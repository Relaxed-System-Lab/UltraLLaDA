I won’t pretend to have\ntaken his vast measure on that first occasion, but I think I had achieved\na glimpse of what the privilege of his acquaintance might mean for many\npersons in the way of charges accepted.  He had been a great experience,\nand it was this perhaps that had put me into the frame of foreseeing how\nwe should all, sooner or later, have the honour of dealing with him as a\nwhole.  Whatever impression I then received of the amount of this total,\nI had a full enough vision of the patience of the Mulvilles.  He was to\nstay all the winter: Adelaide dropped it in a tone that drew the sting\nfrom the inevitable emphasis.  These excellent people might indeed have\nbeen content to give the circle of hospitality a diameter of six months;\nbut if they didn’t say he was to stay all summer as well it was only\nbecause this was more than they ventured to hope.  I remember that at\ndinner that evening he wore slippers, new and predominantly purple, of\nsome queer carpet-stuff; but the Mulvilles were still in the stage of\nsupposing that he might be snatched from them by higher bidders.  At a\nlater time they grew, poor dears, to fear no snatching; but theirs was a\nfidelity which needed no help from competition to make them proud.\nWonderful indeed as, when all was said, you inevitably pronounced Frank\nSaltram, it was not to be overlooked that the Kent Mulvilles were in\ntheir way still more extraordinary: as striking an instance as could\neasily be encountered of the familiar truth that remarkable men find\nremarkable conveniences.\n\nThey had sent for me from Wimbledon to come out and dine, and there had\nbeen an implication in Adelaide’s note—judged by her notes alone she\nmight have been thought silly—that it was a case in which something\nmomentous was to be determined or done.  I had never known them not be in\na “state” about somebody, and I dare say I tried to be droll on this\npoint in accepting their invitation.  On finding myself in the presence\nof their latest discovery I had not at first felt irreverence droop—and,\nthank heaven, I have never been absolutely deprived of that alternative\nin Mr. Saltram’s company.  I saw, however—I hasten to declare it—that\ncompared to this specimen their other phoenixes had been birds of\ninconsiderable feather, and I afterwards took credit to myself for not\nhaving even in primal bewilderments made a mistake about the essence of\nthe man.  He had an incomparable gift; I never was blind to it—it dazzles\nme still.  It dazzles me perhaps even more in remembrance than in fact,\nfor I’m not unaware that for so rare a subject the imagination goes to\nsome expense, inserting a jewel here and there or giving a twist to a\nplume.  How the art of portraiture would rejoice in this figure if the\nart of portraiture had only the canvas!  Nature, in truth, had largely\nrounded it, and if memory, hovering about it, sometimes holds her breath,\nthis is because the voice that comes back was really golden.\n\nThough the great man was an inmate and didn’t dress, he kept dinner on\nthis occasion waiting, and the first words he uttered on coming into the\nroom were an elated announcement to Mulville that he had found out\nsomething.  Not catching the allusion and gaping doubtless a little at\nhis face, I privately asked Adelaide what he had found out.  I shall\nnever forget the look she gave me as she replied: “Everything!”  She\nreally believed it.  At that moment, at any rate, he had found out that\nthe mercy of the Mulvilles was infinite.  He had previously of course\ndiscovered, as I had myself for that matter, that their dinners were\nsoignés.  Let me not indeed, in saying this, neglect to declare that I\nshall falsify my counterfeit if I seem to hint that there was in his\nnature any ounce of calculation.  He took whatever came, but he never\nplotted for it, and no man who was so much of an absorbent can ever have\nbeen so little of a parasite.  He had a system of the universe, but he\nhad no system of sponging—that was quite hand-to-mouth.  He had fine\ngross easy senses, but it was not his good-natured appetite that wrought\nconfusion.  If he had loved us for our dinners we could have paid with\nour dinners, and it would have been a great economy of finer matter.  I\nmake free in these connexions with the plural possessive because if I was\nnever able to do what the Mulvilles did, and people with still bigger\nhouses and simpler charities, I met, first and last, every demand of\nreflexion, of emotion—particularly perhaps those of gratitude and of\nresentment.  No one, I think, paid the tribute of giving him up so often,\nand if it’s rendering honour to borrow wisdom I’ve a right to talk of my\nsacrifices.  He yielded lessons as the sea yields fish—I lived for a\nwhile on this diet.  Sometimes it almost appeared to me that his massive\nmonstrous failure—if failure after all it was—had been designed for my\nprivate recreation.  He fairly pampered my curiosity; but the history of\nthat experience would take me too far.  This is not the large canvas I\njust now spoke of, and I wouldn’t have approached him with my present\nhand had it been a question of all the features.  Frank Saltram’s\nfeatures, for artistic purposes, are verily the anecdotes that are to be\ngathered.  Their name is legion, and this is only one, of which the\ninterest is that it concerns even more closely several other persons.\nSuch episodes, as one looks back, are the little dramas that made up the\ninnumerable facets of the big drama—which is yet to be reported.\n\n\n\n\nII\n\n\nIT is furthermore remarkable that though the two stories are distinct—my\nown, as it were, and this other—they equally began, in a manner, the\nfirst night of my acquaintance with Frank Saltram, the night I came back\nfrom Wimbledon so agitated with a new sense of life that, in London, for\nthe very thrill of it, I could only walk home.  Walking and swinging my\nstick, I overtook, at Buckingham Gate, George Gravener, and George\nGravener’s story may be said to have begun with my making him, as our\npaths lay together, come home with me for a talk.  I duly remember, let\nme parenthesise, that it was still more that of another person, and also\nthat several years were to elapse before it was to extend to a second\nchapter.  I had much to say to him, none the less, about my visit to the\nMulvilles, whom he more indifferently knew, and I was at any rate so\namusing that for long afterwards he never encountered me without asking\nfor news of the old man of the sea.  I hadn’t said Mr. Saltram was old,\nand it was to be seen that he was of an age to outweather George\nGravener.  I had at that time a lodging in Ebury Street, and Gravener was\nstaying at his brother’s empty house in Eaton Square.  At Cambridge, five\nyears before, even in our devastating set, his intellectual power had\nseemed to me almost awful.  Some one had once asked me privately, with\nblanched cheeks, what it was then that after all such a mind as that left\nstanding.  “It leaves itself!” I could recollect devoutly replying.  I\ncould smile at present for this remembrance, since before we got to Ebury\nStreet I was struck with the fact that, save in the sense of being well\nset up on his legs, George Gravener had actually ceased to tower.  The\nuniverse he laid low had somehow bloomed again—the usual eminences were\nvisible.  I wondered whether he had lost his humour, or only, dreadful\nthought, had never had any—not even when I had fancied him most\nAristophanesque.  What was the need of appealing to laughter, however, I\ncould enviously enquire, where you might appeal so confidently to\nmeasurement?  Mr. Saltram’s queer figure, his thick nose and hanging lip,\nwere fresh to me: in the light of my old friend’s fine cold symmetry they\npresented mere success in amusing as the refuge of conscious ugliness.\nAlready, at hungry twenty-six, Gravener looked as blank and parliamentary\nas if he were fifty and popular.  In my scrap of a residence—he had a\nworldling’s eye for its futile conveniences, but never a comrade’s joke—I\nsounded Frank Saltram in his ears; a circumstance I mention in order to\nnote that even then I was surprised at his impatience of my enlivenment.\nAs he had never before heard of the personage it took indeed the form of\nimpatience of the preposterous Mulvilles, his relation to whom, like\nmine, had had its origin in an early, a childish intimacy with the young\nAdelaide, the fruit of multiplied ties in the previous generation.  When\nshe married Kent Mulville, who was older than Gravener and I and much\nmore amiable, I gained a friend, but Gravener practically lost one.  We\nreacted in different ways from the form taken by what he called their\ndeplorable social action—the form (the term was also his) of nasty\nsecond-rate gush.  I may have held in my ‘for intérieur’ that the good\npeople at Wimbledon were beautiful fools, but when he sniffed at them I\ncouldn’t help taking the opposite line, for I already felt that even\nshould we happen to agree it would always be for reasons that differed.\nIt came home to me that he was admirably British as, without so much as a\nsociable sneer at my bookbinder, he turned away from the serried rows of\nmy little French library.\n\n“Of course I’ve never seen the fellow, but it’s clear enough he’s a\nhumbug.”\n\n“Clear ‘enough’ is just what it isn’t,” I replied; “if it only were!”\nThat ejaculation on my part must have been the beginning of what was to\nbe later a long ache for final frivolous rest.  Gravener was profound\nenough to remark after a moment that in the first place he couldn’t be\nanything but a Dissenter, and when I answered that the very note of his\nfascination was his extraordinary speculative breadth my friend retorted\nthat there was no cad like your cultivated cad, and that I might depend\nupon discovering—since I had had the levity not already to have\nenquired—that my shining light proceeded, a generation back, from a\nMethodist cheesemonger.  I confess I was struck with his insistence, and\nI said, after reflexion: “It may be—I admit it may be; but why on earth\nare you so sure?”—asking the question mainly to lay him the trap of\nsaying that it was because the poor man didn’t dress for dinner.  He took\nan instant to circumvent my trap and come blandly out the other side.\n\n“Because the Kent Mulvilles have invented him.  They’ve an infallible\nhand for frauds.  All their geese are swans.  They were born to be duped,\nthey like it, they cry for it, they don’t know anything from anything,\nand they disgust one—luckily perhaps!—with Christian charity.”  His\nvehemence was doubtless an accident, but it might have been a strange\nforeknowledge.  I forget what protest I dropped; it was at any rate\nsomething that led him to go on after a moment: “I only ask one\nthing—it’s perfectly simple.  Is a man, in a given case, a real\ngentleman?”\n\n“A real gentleman, my dear fellow—that’s so soon said!”\n\n“Not so soon when he isn’t!  If they’ve got hold of one this time he must\nbe a great rascal!”\n\n“I might feel injured,” I answered, “if I didn’t reflect that they don’t\nrave about me.”\n\n“Don’t be too sure!  I’ll grant that he’s a gentleman,” Gravener\npresently added, “if you’ll admit that he’s a scamp.”\n\n“I don’t know which to admire most, your logic or your benevolence.”\n\nMy friend coloured at this, but he didn’t change the subject.  “Where did\nthey pick him up?”\n\n“I think they were struck with something he had published.”\n\n“I can fancy the dreary thing!”\n\n“I believe they found out he had all sorts of worries and difficulties.”\n\n“That of course wasn’t to be endured, so they jumped at the privilege of\npaying his debts!”  I professed that I knew nothing about his debts, and\nI reminded my visitor that though the dear Mulvilles were angels they\nwere neither idiots nor millionaires.  What they mainly aimed at was\nreuniting Mr. Saltram to his wife.  “I was expecting to hear he has\nbasely abandoned her,” Gravener went on, at this, “and I’m too glad you\ndon’t disappoint me.”\n\nI tried to recall exactly what Mrs. Mulville had told me.  “He didn’t\nleave her—no.  It’s she who has left him.”\n\n“Left him to us?” Gravener asked.  “The monster—many thanks!  I decline\nto take him.”\n\n“You’ll hear more about him in spite of yourself.  I can’t, no, I really\ncan’t resist the impression that he’s a big man.”  I was already\nmastering—to my shame perhaps be it said—just the tone my old friend\nleast liked.\n\n“It’s doubtless only a trifle,” he returned, “but you haven’t happened to\nmention what his reputation’s to rest on.”\n\n“Why on what I began by boring you with—his extraordinary mind.”\n\n“As exhibited in his writings?”\n\n“Possibly in his writings, but certainly in his talk, which is far and\naway the richest I ever listened to.”\n\n“And what’s it all about?”\n\n“My dear fellow, don’t ask me!  About everything!” I pursued, reminding\nmyself of poor Adelaide.  “About his ideas of things,” I then more\ncharitably added.  “You must have heard him to know what I mean—it’s\nunlike anything that ever was heard.”  I coloured, I admit, I overcharged\na little, for such a picture was an anticipation of Saltram’s later\ndevelopment and still more of my fuller acquaintance with him.  However,\nI really expressed, a little lyrically perhaps, my actual imagination of\nhim when I proceeded to declare that, in a cloud of tradition, of legend,\nhe might very well go down to posterity as the greatest of all great\ntalkers.  Before we parted George Gravener had wondered why such a row\nshould be made about a chatterbox the more and why he should be pampered\nand pensioned.  The greater the wind-bag the greater the calamity.  Out\nof proportion to everything else on earth had come to be this wagging of\nthe tongue.  We were drenched with talk—our wretched age was dying of it.\nI differed from him here sincerely, only going so far as to concede, and\ngladly, that we were drenched with sound.  It was not however the mere\nspeakers who were killing us—it was the mere stammerers.  Fine talk was\nas rare as it was refreshing—the gift of the gods themselves, the one\nstarry spangle on the ragged cloak of humanity.  How many men were there\nwho rose to this privilege, of how many masters of conversation could he\nboast the acquaintance?  Dying of talk?—why we were dying of the lack of\nit!  Bad writing wasn’t talk, as many people seemed to think, and even\ngood wasn’t always to be compared to it.  From the best talk indeed the\nbest writing had something to learn.  I fancifully added that we too\nshould peradventure be gilded by the legend, should be pointed at for\nhaving listened, for having actually heard.  Gravener, who had glanced at\nhis watch and discovered it was midnight, found to all this a retort\nbeautifully characteristic of him.\n\n“There’s one little fact to be borne in mind in the presence equally of\nthe best talk and of the worst.”  He looked, in saying this, as if he\nmeant great things, and I was sure he could only mean once more that\nneither of them mattered if a man wasn’t a real gentleman.  Perhaps it\nwas what he did mean; he deprived me however of the exultation of being\nright by putting the truth in a slightly different way.  “The only thing\nthat really counts for one’s estimate of a person is his conduct.”  He\nhad his watch still in his palm, and I reproached him with unfair play in\nhaving ascertained beforehand that it was now the hour at which I always\ngave in.  My pleasantry so far failed to mollify him that he promptly\nadded that to the rule he had just enunciated there was absolutely no\nexception.\n\n“None whatever?”\n\n“None whatever.”\n\n“Trust me then to try to be good at any price!” I laughed as I went with\nhim to the door.  “I declare I will be, if I have to be horrible!”\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\n\nIF that first night was one of the liveliest, or at any rate was the\nfreshest, of my exaltations, there was another, four years later, that\nwas one of my great discomposures.  Repetition, I well knew by this time,\nwas the secret of Saltram’s power to alienate, and of course one would\nnever have seen him at his finest if one hadn’t seen him in his remorses.\nThey set in mainly at this season and were magnificent, elemental,\norchestral.  I was quite aware that one of these atmospheric disturbances\nwas now due; but none the less, in our arduous attempt to set him on his\nfeet as a lecturer, it was impossible not to feel that two failures were\na large order, as we said, for a short course of five.  This was the\nsecond time, and it was past nine o’clock; the audience, a muster\nunprecedented and really encouraging, had fortunately the attitude of\nblandness that might have been looked for in persons whom the promise of\n(if I’m not mistaken) An Analysis of Primary Ideas had drawn to the\nneighbourhood of Upper Baker Street.  There was in those days in that\nregion a petty lecture-hall to be secured on terms as moderate as the\nfunds left at our disposal by the irrepressible question of the\nmaintenance of five small Saltrams—I include the mother—and one large\none.  By the time the Saltrams, of different sizes, were all maintained\nwe had pretty well poured out the oil that might have lubricated the\nmachinery for enabling the most original of men to appear to maintain\nthem.\n\nIt was I, the other time, who had been forced into the breach, standing\nup there for an odious lamplit moment to explain to half a dozen thin\nbenches, where earnest brows were virtuously void of anything so cynical\nas a suspicion, that we couldn’t so much as put a finger on Mr. Saltram.\nThere was nothing to plead but that our scouts had been out from the\nearly hours and that we were afraid that on one of his walks abroad—he\ntook one, for meditation, whenever he was to address such a company—some\naccident had disabled or delayed him.  The meditative walks were a\nfiction, for he never, that any one could discover, prepared anything but\na magnificent prospectus; hence his circulars and programmes, of which I\npossess an almost complete collection, are the solemn ghosts of\ngenerations never born.  I put the case, as it seemed to me, at the best;\nbut I admit I had been angry, and Kent Mulville was shocked at my want of\npublic optimism.  This time therefore I left the excuses to his more\npractised patience, only relieving myself in response to a direct appeal\nfrom a young lady next whom, in the hall, I found myself sitting.  My\nposition was an accident, but if it had been calculated the reason would\nscarce have eluded an observer of the fact that no one else in the room\nhad an approach to an appearance.  Our philosopher’s “tail” was\ndeplorably limp.  This visitor was the only person who looked at her\nease, who had come a little in the spirit of adventure.  She seemed to\ncarry amusement in her handsome young head, and her presence spoke, a\nlittle mystifyingly, of a sudden extension of Saltram’s sphere of\ninfluence.  He was doing better than we hoped, and he had chosen such an\noccasion, of all occasions, to succumb to heaven knew which of his fond\ninfirmities.  The young lady produced an impression of auburn hair and\nblack velvet, and had on her other hand a companion of obscurer type,\npresumably a waiting-maid.  She herself might perhaps have been a foreign\ncountess, and before she addressed me I had beguiled our sorry interval\nby finding in her a vague recall of the opening of some novel of Madame\nSand.  It didn’t make her more fathomable to pass in a few minutes from\nthis to the certitude that she was American; it simply engendered\ndepressing reflexions as to the possible check to contributions from\nBoston.  She asked me if, as a person apparently more initiated, I would\nrecommend further waiting, and I answered that if she considered I was on\nmy honour I would privately deprecate it.  Perhaps she didn’t; at any\nrate our talk took a turn that prolonged it till she became aware we were\nleft almost alone.  I presently ascertained she knew Mrs. Saltram, and\nthis explained in a manner the miracle.  The brotherhood of the friends\nof the husband was as nothing to the brotherhood, or perhaps I should say\nthe sisterhood, of the friends of the wife.  Like the Kent Mulvilles I\nbelonged to both fraternities, and even better than they I think I had\nsounded the abyss of Mrs. Saltram’s wrongs.  She bored me to extinction,\nand I knew but too well how she had bored her husband; but there were\nthose who stood by her, the most efficient of whom were indeed the\nhandful of poor Saltram’s backers.  They did her liberal justice, whereas\nher mere patrons and partisans had nothing but hatred for our\nphilosopher.  I’m bound to say it was we, however—we of both camps, as it\nwere—who had always done most for her.\n\nI thought my young lady looked rich—I scarcely knew why; and I hoped she\nhad put her hand in her pocket.  I soon made her out, however, not at all\na fine fanatic—she was but a generous, irresponsible enquirer.  She had\ncome to England to see her aunt, and it was at her aunt’s she had met the\ndreary lady we had all so much on our mind.  I saw she’d help to pass the\ntime when she observed that it was a pity this lady wasn’t intrinsically\nmore interesting.  That was refreshing, for it was an article of faith in\nMrs. Saltram’s circle—at least among those who scorned to know her horrid\nhusband—that she was attractive on her merits.  She was in truth a most\nordinary person, as Saltram himself would have been if he hadn’t been a\nprodigy.  The question of vulgarity had no application to him, but it was\na measure his wife kept challenging you to apply.  I hasten to add that\nthe consequences of your doing so were no sufficient reason for his\nhaving left her to starve.  “He doesn’t seem to have much force of\ncharacter,” said my young lady; at which I laughed out so loud that my\ndeparting friends looked back at me over their shoulders as if I were\nmaking a joke of their discomfiture.  My joke probably cost Saltram a\nsubscription or two, but it helped me on with my interlocutress.  “She\nsays he drinks like a fish,” she sociably continued, “and yet she allows\nthat his mind’s wonderfully clear.”  It was amusing to converse with a\npretty girl who could talk of the clearness of Saltram’s mind.  I\nexpected next to hear she had been assured he was awfully clever.  I\ntried to tell her—I had it almost on my conscience—what was the proper\nway to regard him; an effort attended perhaps more than ever on this\noccasion with the usual effect of my feeling that I wasn’t after all very\nsure of it.  She had come to-night out of high curiosity—she had wanted\nto learn this proper way for herself.  She had read some of his papers\nand hadn’t understood them; but it was at home, at her aunt’s, that her\ncuriosity had been kindled—kindled mainly by his wife’s remarkable\nstories of his want of virtue.  “I suppose they ought to have kept me\naway,” my companion dropped, “and I suppose they’d have done so if I\nhadn’t somehow got an idea that he’s fascinating.  In fact Mrs. Saltram\nherself says he is.”\n\n“So you came to see where the fascination resides?  Well, you’ve seen!”\n\nMy young lady raised fine eyebrows.  “Do you mean in his bad faith?”\n\n“In the extraordinary effects of it; his possession, that is, of some\nquality or other that condemns us in advance to forgive him the\nhumiliation, as I may call it, to which he has subjected us.”\n\n“The humiliation?”\n\n“Why mine, for instance, as one of his guarantors, before you as the\npurchaser of a ticket.”\n\nShe let her charming gay eyes rest on me.  “You don’t look humiliated a\nbit, and if you did I should let you off, disappointed as I am; for the\nmysterious quality you speak of is just the quality I came to see.”\n\n“Oh, you can’t ‘see’ it!” I cried.\n\n“How then do you get at it?”\n\n“You don’t!  You mustn’t suppose he’s good-looking,” I added.\n\n“Why his wife says he’s lovely!”\n\nMy hilarity may have struck her as excessive, but I confess it broke out\nafresh.  Had she acted only in obedience to this singular plea, so\ncharacteristic, on Mrs. Saltram’s part, of what was irritating in the\nnarrowness of that lady’s point of view?  “Mrs. Saltram,” I explained,\n“undervalues him where he’s strongest, so that, to make up for it\nperhaps, she overpraises him where he’s weak.  He’s not, assuredly,\nsuperficially attractive; he’s middle-aged, fat, featureless save for his\ngreat eyes.”\n\n“Yes, his great eyes,” said my young lady attentively.  She had evidently\nheard all about his great eyes—the beaux yeux for which alone we had\nreally done it all.\n\n“They’re tragic and splendid—lights on a dangerous coast.  But he moves\nbadly and dresses worse, and altogether he’s anything but smart.”\n\nMy companion, who appeared to reflect on this, after a moment appealed.\n“Do you call him a real gentleman?”\n\nI started slightly at the question, for I had a sense of recognising it:\nGeorge Gravener, years before, that first flushed night, had put me face\nto face with it.  It had embarrassed me then, but it didn’t embarrass me\nnow, for I had lived with it and overcome it and disposed of it.  “A real\ngentleman?  Emphatically not!”\n\nMy promptitude surprised her a little, but I quickly felt how little it\nwas to Gravener I was now talking.  “Do you say that because he’s—what do\nyou call it in England?—of humble extraction?”\n\n“Not a bit.  His father was a country school-master and his mother the\nwidow of a sexton, but that has nothing to do with it.  I say it simply\nbecause I know him well.”\n\n“But isn’t it an awful drawback?”\n\n“Awful—quite awful.”\n\n“I mean isn’t it positively fatal?”\n\n“Fatal to what?  Not to his magnificent vitality.”\n\nAgain she had a meditative moment.  “And is his magnificent vitality the\ncause of his vices?”\n\n“Your questions are formidable, but I’m glad you put them.  I was\nthinking of his noble intellect.  His vices, as you say, have been much\nexaggerated: they consist mainly after all in one comprehensive defect.”\n\n“A want of will?”\n\n“A want of dignity.”\n\n“He doesn’t recognise his obligations?”\n\n“On the contrary, he recognises them with effusion, especially in public:\nhe smiles and bows and beckons across the street to them.  But when they\npass over he turns away, and he speedily loses them in the crowd.  The\nrecognition’s purely spiritual—it isn’t in the least social.  So he\nleaves all his belongings to other people to take care of.  He accepts\nfavours, loans, sacrifices—all with nothing more deterrent than an agony\nof shame.  Fortunately we’re a little faithful band, and we do what we\ncan.”  I held my tongue about the natural children, engendered, to the\nnumber of three, in the wantonness of his youth.  I only remarked that he\ndid make efforts—often tremendous ones.  “But the efforts,” I said,\n“never come to much: the only things that come to much are the\nabandonments, the surrenders.”\n\n“And how much do they come to?”\n\n“You’re right to put it as if we had a big bill to pay, but, as I’ve told\nyou before, your questions are rather terrible.  They come, these mere\nexercises of genius, to a great sum total of poetry, of philosophy, a\nmighty mass of speculation, notation, quotation.  The genius is there,\nyou see, to meet the surrender; but there’s no genius to support the\ndefence.”\n\n“But what is there, after all, at his age, to show?”\n\n“In the way of achievement recognised and reputation established?” I\nasked.  “To ‘show’ if you will, there isn’t much, since his writing,\nmostly, isn’t as fine, isn’t certainly as showy, as his talk.  Moreover\ntwo-thirds of his work are merely colossal projects and announcements.\n‘Showing’ Frank Saltram is often a poor business,” I went on: “we\nendeavoured, you’ll have observed, to show him to-night!  However, if he\nhad lectured he’d have lectured divinely.  It would just have been his\ntalk.”\n\n“And what would his talk just have been?”\n\nI was conscious of some ineffectiveness, as well perhaps as of a little\nimpatience, as I replied: “The exhibition of a splendid intellect.”  My\nyoung lady looked not quite satisfied at this, but as I wasn’t prepared\nfor another question I hastily pursued: “The sight of a great suspended\nswinging crystal—huge lucid lustrous, a block of light—flashing back\nevery impression of life and every possibility of thought!”\n\nThis gave her something to turn over till we had passed out to the dusky\nporch of the hall, in front of which the lamps of a quiet brougham were\nalmost the only thing Saltram’s treachery hadn’t extinguished.  I went\nwith her to the door of her carriage, out of which she leaned a moment\nafter she had thanked me and taken her seat.  Her smile even in the\ndarkness was pretty.  “I do want to see that crystal!”\n\n“You’ve only to come to the next lecture.”\n\n“I go abroad in a day or two with my aunt.”\n\n“Wait over till next week,” I suggested.  “It’s quite worth it.”\n\nShe became grave.  “Not unless he really comes!”  At which the brougham\nstarted off, carrying her away too fast, fortunately for my manners, to\nallow me to exclaim “Ingratitude!”\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\n\nMRS. SALTRAM made a great affair of her right to be informed where her\nhusband had been the second evening he failed to meet his audience.  She\ncame to me to ascertain, but I couldn’t satisfy her, for in spite of my\ningenuity I remained in ignorance.  It wasn’t till much later that I\nfound this had not been the case with Kent Mulville, whose hope for the\nbest never twirled the thumbs of him more placidly than when he happened\nto know the worst.  He had known it on the occasion I speak of—that is\nimmediately after.  He was impenetrable then, but ultimately confessed.\nWhat he confessed was more than I shall now venture to make public.  It\nwas of course familiar to me that Saltram was incapable of keeping the\nengagements which, after their separation, he had entered into with\nregard to his wife, a deeply wronged, justly resentful, quite\nirreproachable and insufferable person.  She often appeared at my\nchambers to talk over his lapses; for if, as she declared, she had washed\nher hands of him, she had carefully preserved the water of this ablution,\nwhich she handed about for analysis.  She had arts of her own of exciting\none’s impatience, the most infallible of which was perhaps her assumption\nthat we were kind to her because we liked her.  In reality her personal\nfall had been a sort of social rise—since I had seen the moment when, in\nour little conscientious circle, her desolation almost made her the\nfashion.  Her voice was grating and her children ugly; moreover she hated\nthe good Mulvilles, whom I more and more loved.  They were the people who\nby doing most for her husband had in the long run done most for herself;\nand the warm confidence with which he had laid his length upon them was a\npressure gentle compared with her stiffer persuadability.  I’m bound to\nsay he didn’t criticise his benefactors, though practically he got tired\nof them; she, however, had the highest standards about eleemosynary\nforms.  She offered the odd spectacle of a spirit puffed up by\ndependence, and indeed it had introduced her to some excellent society.\nShe pitied me for not knowing certain people who aided her and whom she\ndoubtless patronised in turn for their luck in not knowing me.  I dare\nsay I should have got on with her better if she had had a ray of\nimagination—if it had occasionally seemed to occur to her to regard\nSaltram’s expressions of his nature in any other manner than as separate\nsubjects of woe.  They were all flowers of his character, pearls strung\non an endless thread; but she had a stubborn little way of challenging\nthem one after the other, as if she never suspected that he had a\ncharacter, such as it was, or that deficiencies might be organic; the\nirritating effect of a mind incapable of a generalisation.  One might\ndoubtless have overdone the idea that there was a general licence for\nsuch a man; but if this had happened it would have been through one’s\nfeeling that there could be none for such a woman.\n\nI recognised her superiority when I asked her about the aunt of the\ndisappointed young lady: it sounded like a sentence from an\nEnglish-French or other phrase-book.  She triumphed in what she told me\nand she may have triumphed still more in what she withheld.  My friend of\nthe other evening, Miss Anvoy, had but lately come to England; Lady\nCoxon, the aunt, had been established here for years in consequence of\nher marriage with the late Sir Gregory of that name.  She had a house in\nthe Regent’s Park, a Bath-chair and a fernery; and above all she had\nsympathy.  Mrs. Saltram had made her acquaintance through mutual friends.\nThis vagueness caused me to feel how much I was out of it and how large\nan independent circle Mrs. Saltram had at her command.  I should have\nbeen glad to know more about the disappointed young lady, but I felt I\nshould know most by not depriving her of her advantage, as she might have\nmysterious means of depriving me of my knowledge.  For the present,\nmoreover, this experience was stayed, Lady Coxon having in fact gone\nabroad accompanied by her niece.  The niece, besides being immensely\nclever, was an heiress, Mrs. Saltram said; the only daughter and the\nlight of the eyes of some great American merchant, a man, over there, of\nendless indulgences and dollars.  She had pretty clothes and pretty\nmanners, and she had, what was prettier still, the great thing of all.\nThe great thing of all for Mrs. Saltram was always sympathy, and she\nspoke as if during the absence of these ladies she mightn’t know where to\nturn for it.  A few months later indeed, when they had come back, her\ntone perceptibly changed: she alluded to them, on my leading her up to\nit, rather as to persons in her debt for favours received.  What had\nhappened I didn’t know, but I saw it would take only a little more or a\nlittle less to make her speak of them as thankless subjects of social\ncountenance—people for whom she had vainly tried to do something.  I\nconfess I saw how it wouldn’t be in a mere week or two that I should rid\nmyself of the image of Ruth Anvoy, in whose very name, when I learnt it,\nI found something secretly to like.  I should probably neither see her\nnor hear of her again: the knight’s widow (he had been mayor of\nClockborough) would pass away and the heiress would return to her\ninheritance.  I gathered with surprise that she had not communicated to\nhis wife the story of her attempt to hear Mr..Saltram, and I founded this\nreticence on the easy supposition that Mrs. Saltram had fatigued by\noverpressure the spring of the sympathy of which she boasted.  The girl\nat any rate would forget the small adventure, be distracted, take a\nhusband; besides which she would lack occasion to repeat her experiment.\n\nWe clung to the idea of the brilliant course, delivered without an\naccident, that, as a lecturer, would still make the paying public aware\nof our great man, but the fact remained that in the case of an\ninspiration so unequal there was treachery, there was fallacy at least,\nin the very conception of a series.  In our scrutiny of ways and means we\nwere inevitably subject to the old convention of the synopsis, the\nsyllabus, partly of course not to lose the advantage of his grand free\nhand in drawing up such things; but for myself I laughed at our playbills\neven while I stickled for them.  It was indeed amusing work to be\nscrupulous for Frank Saltram, who also at moments laughed about it, so\nfar as the comfort of a sigh so unstudied as to be cheerful might pass\nfor such a sound.  He admitted with a candour all his own that he was in\ntruth only to be depended on in the Mulvilles’ drawing-room.  “Yes,” he\nsuggestively allowed, “it’s there, I think, that I’m at my best; quite\nlate, when it gets toward eleven—and if I’ve not been too much worried.”\nWe all knew what too much worry meant; it meant too enslaved for the hour\nto the superstition of sobriety.  On the Saturdays I used to bring my\nportmanteau, so as not to have to think of eleven o’clock trains.  I had\na bold theory that as regards this temple of talk and its altars of\ncushioned chintz, its pictures and its flowers, its large fireside and\nclear lamplight, we might really arrive at something if the Mulvilles\nwould but charge for admission.  Here it was, however, that they\nshamelessly broke down; as there’s a flaw in every perfection this was\nthe inexpugnable refuge of their egotism.  They declined to make their\nsaloon a market, so that Saltram’s golden words continued the sole coin\nthat rang there.  It can have happened to no man, however, to be paid a\ngreater price than such an enchanted hush as surrounded him on his\ngreatest nights.  The most profane, on these occasions, felt a presence;\nall minor eloquence grew dumb.  Adelaide Mulville, for the pride of her\nhospitality, anxiously watched the door or stealthily poked the fire.  I\nused to call it the music-room, for we had anticipated Bayreuth.  The\nvery gates of the kingdom of light seemed to open and the horizon of\nthought to flash with the beauty of a sunrise at sea.\n\nIn the consideration of ways and means, the sittings of our little board,\nwe were always conscious of the creak of Mrs. Saltram’s shoes.  She\nhovered, she interrupted, she almost presided, the state of affairs being\nmostly such as to supply her with every incentive for enquiring what was\nto be done next.  It was the pressing pursuit of this knowledge that, in\nconcatenations of omnibuses and usually in very wet weather, led her so\noften to my door.  She thought us spiritless creatures with editors and\npublishers; but she carried matters to no great effect when she\npersonally pushed into back-shops.  She wanted all moneys to be paid to\nherself: they were otherwise liable to such strange adventures.  They\ntrickled away into the desert—they were mainly at best, alas, a slender\nstream.  The editors and the publishers were the last people to take this\nremarkable thinker at the valuation that has now pretty well come to be\nestablished.  The former were half-distraught between the desire to “cut”\nhim and the difficulty of finding a crevice for their shears; and when a\nvolume on this or that portentous subject was proposed to the latter they\nsuggested alternative titles which, as reported to our friend, brought\ninto his face the noble blank melancholy that sometimes made it handsome.\nThe title of an unwritten book didn’t after all much matter, but some\nmasterpiece of Saltram’s may have died in his bosom of the shudder with\nwhich it was then convulsed.  The ideal solution, failing the fee at Kent\nMulville’s door, would have been some system of subscription to projected\ntreatises with their non-appearance provided for—provided for, I mean, by\nthe indulgence of subscribers.  The author’s real misfortune was that\nsubscribers were so wretchedly literal.  When they tastelessly enquired\nwhy publication hadn’t ensued I was tempted to ask who in the world had\never been so published.  Nature herself had brought him out in voluminous\nform, and the money was simply a deposit on borrowing the work.\n\n\n\n\nV\n\n\nI WAS doubtless often a nuisance to my friends in those years; but there\nwere sacrifices I declined to make, and I never passed the hat to George\nGravener.  I never forgot our little discussion in Ebury Street, and I\nthink it stuck in my throat to have to treat him to the avowal I had\nfound so easy to Mss Anvoy.  It had cost me nothing to confide to this\ncharming girl, but it would have cost me much to confide to the friend of\nmy youth, that the character of the “real gentleman” wasn’t an attribute\nof the man I took such pains for.  Was this because I had already\ngeneralised to the point of perceiving that women are really the\nunfastidious sex?  I knew at any rate that Gravener, already quite in\nview but still hungry and frugal, had naturally enough more ambition than\ncharity.  He had sharp aims for stray sovereigns, being in view most from\nthe tall steeple of Clockborough.  His immediate ambition was to occupy à\nlui seul the field of vision of that smokily-seeing city, and all his\nmovements and postures were calculated for the favouring angle.  The\nmovement of the hand as to the pocket had thus to alternate gracefully\nwith the posture of the hand on the heart.  He talked to Clockborough in\nshort only less beguilingly than Frank Saltram talked to his electors;\nwith the difference to our credit, however, that we had already voted and\nthat our candidate had no antagonist but himself.  He had more than once\nbeen at Wimbledon—it was Mrs. Mulville’s work not mine—and by the time\nthe claret was served had seen the god descend.  He took more pains to\nswing his censer than I had expected, but on our way back to town he\nforestalled any little triumph I might have been so artless as to express\nby the observation that such a man was—a hundred times!—a man to use and\nnever a man to be used by.  I remember that this neat remark humiliated\nme almost as much as if virtually, in the fever of broken slumbers, I\nhadn’t often made it myself.  The difference was that on Gravener’s part\na force attached to it that could never attach to it on mine.  He was\nable to use people—he had the machinery; and the irony of Saltram’s being\nmade showy at Clockborough came out to me when he said, as if he had no\nmemory of our original talk and the idea were quite fresh to him: “I hate\nhis type, you know, but I’ll be hanged if I don’t put some of those\nthings in.  I can find a place for them: we might even find a place for\nthe fellow himself.”  I myself should have had some fear—not, I need\nscarcely say, for the “things” themselves, but for some other things very\nnear them; in fine for the rest of my eloquence.\n\nLater on I could see that the oracle of Wimbledon was not in this case so\nappropriate as he would have been had the polities of the gods only\ncoincided more exactly with those of the party.  There was a distinct\nmoment when, without saying anything more definite to me, Gravener\nentertained the idea of annexing Mr. Saltram.  Such a project was\ndelusive, for the discovery of analogies between his body of doctrine and\nthat pressed from headquarters upon Clockborough—the bottling, in a word,\nof the air of those lungs for convenient public uncorking in\ncorn-exchanges—was an experiment for which no one had the leisure.  The\nonly thing would have been to carry him massively about, paid, caged,\nclipped; to turn him on for a particular occasion in a particular\nchannel.  Frank Saltram’s channel, however, was essentially not\ncalculable, and there was no knowing what disastrous floods might have\nensued.  For what there would have been to do The Empire, the great\nnewspaper, was there to look to; but it was no new misfortune that there\nwere delicate situations in which The Empire broke down.  In fine there\nwas an instinctive apprehension that a clever young journalist\ncommissioned to report on Mr. Saltram might never come back from the\nerrand.  No one knew better than George Gravener that that was a time\nwhen prompt returns counted double.  If he therefore found our friend an\nexasperating waste of orthodoxy it was because of his being, as he said,\npoor Gravener, up in the clouds, not because he was down in the dust.\nThe man would have been, just as he was, a real enough gentleman if he\ncould have helped to put in a real gentleman.  Gravener’s great objection\nto the actual member was that he was not one.\n\nLady Coxon had a fine old house, a house with “grounds,” at Clockborough,\nwhich she had let; but after she returned from abroad I learned from Mrs.\nSaltram that the lease had fallen in and that she had gone down to resume\npossession.  I could see the faded red livery, the big square shoulders,\nthe high-walled garden of this decent abode.  As the rumble of\ndissolution grew louder the suitor would have pressed his suit, and I\nfound myself hoping the politics of the late Mayor’s widow wouldn’t be\nsuch as to admonish her to ask him to dinner; perhaps indeed I went so\nfar as to pray, they would naturally form a bar to any contact.  I tried\nto focus the many-buttoned page, in the daily airing, as he perhaps even\npushed the Bath-chair over somebody’s toes.  I was destined to hear, none\nthe less, through Mrs. Saltram—who, I afterwards learned, was in\ncorrespondence with Lady Coxon’s housekeeper—that Gravener was known to\nhave spoken of the habitation I had in my eye as the pleasantest thing at\nClockborough.  On his part, I was sure, this was the voice not of envy\nbut of experience.  The vivid scene was now peopled, and I could see him\nin the old-time garden with Miss Anvoy, who would be certain, and very\njustly, to think him good-looking.  It would be too much to describe\nmyself as troubled by this play of surmise; but I occur to remember the\nrelief, singular enough, of feeling it suddenly brushed away by an\nannoyance really much greater; an annoyance the result of its happening\nto come over me about that time with a rush that I was simply ashamed of\nFrank Saltram.  There were limits after all, and my mark at last had been\nreached.\n\nI had had my disgusts, if I may allow myself to-day such an expression;\nbut this was a supreme revolt.  Certain things cleared up in my mind,\ncertain values stood out.  It was all very well to have an unfortunate\ntemperament; there was nothing so unfortunate as to have, for practical\npurposes, nothing else.  I avoided George Gravener at this moment and\nreflected that at such a time I should do so most effectually by leaving\nEngland.  I wanted to forget Frank Saltram—that was all.  I didn’t want\nto do anything in the world to him but that.  Indignation had withered on\nthe stalk, and I felt that one could pity him as much as one ought only\nby never thinking of him again.  It wasn’t for anything he had done to\nme; it was for what he had done to the Mulvilles.  Adelaide cried about\nit for a week, and her husband, profiting by the example so signally\ngiven him of the fatal effect of a want of character, left the letter,\nthe drop too much, unanswered.  The letter, an incredible one, addressed\nby Saltram to Wimbledon during a stay with the Pudneys at Ramsgate, was\nthe central feature of the incident, which, however, had many features,\neach more painful than whichever other we compared it with.  The Pudneys\nhad behaved shockingly, but that was no excuse.  Base ingratitude, gross\nindecency—one had one’s choice only of such formulas as that the more\nthey fitted the less they gave one rest.  These are dead aches now, and I\nam under no obligation, thank heaven, to be definite about the business.\nThere are things which if I had had to tell them—well, would have stopped\nme off here altogether.\n\nI went abroad for the general election, and if I don’t know how much, on\nthe Continent, I forgot, I at least know how much I missed, him.  At a\ndistance, in a foreign land, ignoring, abjuring, unlearning him, I\ndiscovered what he had done for me.  I owed him, oh unmistakeably,\ncertain noble conceptions; I had lighted my little taper at his smoky\nlamp, and lo it continued to twinkle.  But the light it gave me just\nshowed me how much more I wanted.  I was pursued of course by letters\nfrom Mrs. Saltram which I didn’t scruple not to read, though quite aware\nher embarrassments couldn’t but be now of the gravest.  I sacrificed to\npropriety by simply putting them away, and this is how, one day as my\nabsence drew to an end, my eye, while I rummaged in my desk for another\npaper, was caught by a name on a leaf that had detached itself from the\npacket.  The allusion was to Miss Anvoy, who, it appeared, was engaged to\nbe married to Mr. George Gravener; and the news was two months old.  A\ndirect question of Mrs. Saltram’s had thus remained unanswered—she had\nenquired of me in a postscript what sort of man this aspirant to such a\nhand might be.  The great other fact about him just then was that he had\nbeen triumphantly returned for Clockborough in the interest of the party\nthat had swept the country—so that I might easily have referred Mrs.\nSaltram to the journals of the day.  Yet when I at last wrote her that I\nwas coming home and would discharge my accumulated burden by seeing her,\nI but remarked in regard to her question that she must really put it to\nMiss Anvoy.\n\n\n\n\nVI\n\n\nI HAD almost avoided the general election, but some of its consequences,\non my return, had smartly to be faced.  The season, in London, began to\nbreathe again and to flap its folded wings.  Confidence, under the new\nMinistry, was understood to be reviving, and one of the symptoms, in a\nsocial body, was a recovery of appetite.  People once more fed together,\nand it happened that, one Saturday night, at somebody’s house, I fed with\nGeorge Gravener.  When the ladies left the room I moved up to where he\nsat and begged to congratulate him.  “On my election?” he asked after a\nmoment; so that I could feign, jocosely, not to have heard of that\ntriumph and to be alluding to the rumour of a victory still more\npersonal.  I dare say I coloured however, for his political success had\nmomentarily passed out of my mind.  What was present to it was that he\nwas to marry that beautiful girl; and yet his question made me conscious\nof some discomposure—I hadn’t intended to put this before everything.  He\nhimself indeed ought gracefully to have done so, and I remember thinking\nthe whole man was in this assumption that in expressing my sense of what\nhe had won I had fixed my thoughts on his “seat.”  We straightened the\nmatter out, and he was so much lighter in hand than I had lately seen him\nthat his spirits might well have been fed from a twofold source.  He was\nso good as to say that he hoped I should soon make the acquaintance of\nMiss Anvoy, who, with her aunt, was presently coming up to town.  Lady\nCoxon, in the country, had been seriously unwell, and this had delayed\ntheir arrival.  I told him I had heard the marriage would be a splendid\none; on which, brightened and humanised by his luck, he laughed and said\n“Do you mean for her?”  When I had again explained what I meant he went\non: “Oh she’s an American, but you’d scarcely know it; unless, perhaps,”\nhe added, “by her being used to more money than most girls in England,\neven the daughters of rich men.  That wouldn’t in the least do for a\nfellow like me, you know, if it wasn’t for the great liberality of her\nfather.  He really has been most kind, and everything’s quite\nsatisfactory.”  He added that his eldest brother had taken a tremendous\nfancy to her and that during a recent visit at Coldfield she had nearly\nwon over Lady Maddock.  I gathered from something he dropped later on\nthat the free-handed gentleman beyond the seas had not made a settlement,\nbut had given a handsome present and was apparently to be looked to,\nacross the water, for other favours.  People are simplified alike by\ngreat contentments and great yearnings, and, whether or no it was\nGravener’s directness that begot my own, I seem to recall that in some\nturn taken by our talk he almost imposed it on me as an act of decorum to\nask if Miss Anvoy had also by chance expectations from her aunt.  My\nenquiry drew out that Lady Coxon, who was the oddest of women, would have\nin any contingency to act under her late husband’s will, which was odder\nstill, saddling her with a mass of queer obligations complicated with\nqueer loopholes.  There were several dreary people, Coxon cousins, old\nmaids, to whom she would have more or less to minister.  Gravener\nlaughed, without saying no, when I suggested that the young lady might\ncome in through a loophole; then suddenly, as if he suspected my turning\na lantern on him, he declared quite dryly: “That’s all rot—one’s moved by\nother springs!”\n\nA fortnight later, at Lady Coxon’s own house, I understood well enough\nthe springs one was moved by.  Gravener had spoken of me there as an old\nfriend, and I received a gracious invitation to dine.  The Knight’s widow\nwas again indisposed—she had succumbed at the eleventh hour; so that I\nfound Miss Anvoy bravely playing hostess without even Gravener’s help,\nsince, to make matters worse, he had just sent up word that the House,\nthe insatiable House, with which he supposed he had contracted for easier\nterms, positively declined to release him.  I was struck with the\ncourage, the grace and gaiety of the young lady left thus to handle the\nfauna and flora of the Regent’s Park.  I did what I could to help her to\nclassify them, after I had recovered from the confusion of seeing her\nslightly disconcerted at perceiving in the guest introduced by her\nintended the gentleman with whom she had had that talk about Frank\nSaltram.  I had at this moment my first glimpse of the fact that she was\na person who could carry a responsibility; but I leave the reader to\njudge of my sense of the aggravation, for either of us, of such a burden,\nwhen I heard the servant announce Mrs. Saltram.  From what immediately\npassed between the two ladies I gathered that the latter had been sent\nfor post-haste to fill the gap created by the absence of the mistress of\nthe house.  “Good!” I remember crying, “she’ll be put by me;” and my\napprehension was promptly justified.  Mrs. Saltram taken in to dinner,\nand taken in as a consequence of an appeal to her amiability, was Mrs.\nSaltram with a vengeance.  I asked myself what Miss Anvoy meant by doing\nsuch things, but the only answer I arrived at was that Gravener was\nverily fortunate.  She hadn’t happened to tell him of her visit to Upper\nBaker Street, but she’d certainly tell him to-morrow; not indeed that\nthis would make him like any better her having had the innocence to\ninvite such a person as Mrs. Saltram on such an occasion.  It could only\nstrike me that I had never seen a young woman put such ignorance into her\ncleverness, such freedom into her modesty; this, I think, was when, after\ndinner, she said to me frankly, with almost jubilant mirth: “Oh you don’t\nadmire Mrs. Saltram?”  Why should I?  This was truly a young person\nwithout guile.  I had briefly to consider before I could reply that my\nobjection to the lady named was the objection often uttered about people\nmet at the social board—I knew all her stories.  Then as Miss Anvoy\nremained momentarily vague I added: “Those about her husband.”\n\n“Oh yes, but there are some new ones.”\n\n“None for me.  Ah novelty would be pleasant!”\n\n“Doesn’t it appear that of late he has been particularly horrid?”\n\n“His fluctuations don’t matter”, I returned, “for at night all cats are\ngrey.  You saw the shade of this one the night we waited for him\ntogether.  What will you have?  He has no dignity.”\n\nMiss Anvoy, who had been introducing with her American distinctness,\nlooked encouragingly round at some of the combinations she had risked.\n“It’s too bad I can’t see him.”\n\n“You mean Gravener won’t let you?”\n\n“I haven’t asked him.  He lets me do everything.”\n\n“But you know he knows him and wonders what some of us see in him.”\n\n“We haven’t happened to talk of him,” the girl said.\n\n“Get him to take you some day out to see the Mulvilles.”\n\n“I thought Mr. Saltram had thrown the Mulvilles over.”\n\n“Utterly.  But that won’t prevent his being planted there again, to bloom\nlike a rose, within a month or two.”\n\nMiss Anvoy thought a moment.  Then, “I should like to see them,” she said\nwith her fostering smile.\n\n“They’re tremendously worth it.  You mustn’t miss them.”\n\n“I’ll make George take me,” she went on as Mrs. Saltram came up to\ninterrupt us.  She sniffed at this unfortunate as kindly as she had\nsmiled at me and, addressing the question to her, continued: “But the\nchance of a lecture—one of the wonderful lectures?  Isn’t there another\ncourse announced?”\n\n“Another?  There are about thirty!” I exclaimed, turning away and feeling\nMrs. Saltram’s little eyes in my back.  A few days after this I heard\nthat Gravener’s marriage was near at hand—was settled for Whitsuntide;\nbut as no invitation had reached me I had my doubts, and there presently\ncame to me in fact the report of a postponement.  Something was the\nmatter; what was the matter was supposed to be that Lady Coxon was now\ncritically ill.  I had called on her after my dinner in the Regent’s\nPark, but I had neither seen her nor seen Miss Anvoy.  I forget to-day\nthe exact order in which, at this period, sundry incidents occurred and\nthe particular stage at which it suddenly struck me, making me catch my\nbreath a little, that the progression, the acceleration, was for all the\nworld that of fine drama.  This was probably rather late in the day, and\nthe exact order doesn’t signify.  What had already occurred was some\naccident determining a more patient wait.  George Gravener, whom I met\nagain, in fact told me as much, but without signs of perturbation.  Lady\nCoxon had to be constantly attended to, and there were other good reasons\nas well.  Lady Coxon had to be so constantly attended to that on the\noccasion of a second attempt in the Regent’s Park I equally failed to\nobtain a sight of her niece.  I judged it discreet in all the conditions\nnot to make a third; but this didn’t matter, for it was through Adelaide\nMulville that the side-wind of the comedy, though I was at first\nunwitting, began to reach me.  I went to Wimbledon at times because\nSaltram was there, and I went at others because he wasn’t.  The Pudneys,\nwho had taken him to Birmingham, had already got rid of him, and we had a\nhorrible consciousness of his wandering roofless, in dishonour, about the\nsmoky Midlands, almost as the injured Lear wandered on the storm-lashed\nheath.  His room, upstairs, had been lately done up (I could hear the\ncrackle of the new chintz) and the difference only made his smirches and\nbruises, his splendid tainted genius, the more tragic.  If he wasn’t\nbarefoot in the mire he was sure to be unconventionally shod.  These were\nthe things Adelaide and I, who were old enough friends to stare at each\nother in silence, talked about when we didn’t speak.  When we spoke it\nwas only about the brilliant girl George Gravener was to marry and whom\nhe had brought out the other Sunday.  I could see that this presentation\nhad been happy, for Mrs. Mulville commemorated it after her sole fashion\nof showing confidence in a new relation.  “She likes me—she likes me”:\nher native humility exulted in that measure of success.  We all knew for\nourselves how she liked those who liked her, and as regards Ruth Anvoy\nshe was more easily won over than Lady Maddock.\n\n\n\n\nVII\n\n\nONE of the consequences, for the Mulvilles, of the sacrifices they made\nfor Frank Saltram was that they had to give up their carriage.  Adelaide\ndrove gently into London in a one-horse greenish thing, an early\nVictorian landau, hired, near at hand, imaginatively, from a broken-down\njobmaster whose wife was in consumption—a vehicle that made people turn\nround all the more when her pensioner sat beside her in a soft white hat\nand a shawl, one of the dear woman’s own.  This was his position and I\ndare say his costume when on an afternoon in July she went to return Miss\nAnvoy’s visit.  The wheel of fate had now revolved, and amid silences\ndeep and exhaustive, compunctions and condonations alike unutterable,\nSaltram was reinstated.  Was it in pride or in penance that Mrs. Mulville\nhad begun immediately to drive him about?  If he was ashamed of his\ningratitude she might have been ashamed of her forgiveness; but she was\nincorrigibly capable of liking him to be conspicuous in the landau while\nshe was in shops or with her acquaintance.  However, if he was in the\npillory for twenty minutes in the Regent’s Park—I mean at Lady Coxon’s\ndoor while his companion paid her call—it wasn’t to the further\nhumiliation of any one concerned that she presently came out for him in\nperson, not even to show either of them what a fool she was that she drew\nhim in to be introduced to the bright young American.  Her account of the\nintroduction I had in its order, but before that, very late in the\nseason, under Gravener’s auspices, I met Miss Anvoy at tea at the House\nof Commons.  The member for Clockborough had gathered a group of pretty\nladies, and the Mulvilles were not of the party.  On the great terrace,\nas I strolled off with her a little, the guest of honour immediately\nexclaimed to me: “I’ve seen him, you know—I’ve seen him!”  She told me\nabout Saltram’s call.\n\n“And how did you find him?”\n\n“Oh so strange!”\n\n“You didn’t like him?”\n\n“I can’t tell till I see him again.”\n\n“You want to do that?”\n\nShe had a pause.  “Immensely.”\n\nWe went no further; I fancied she had become aware Gravener was looking\nat us.  She turned back toward the knot of the others, and I said:\n“Dislike him as much as you will—I see you’re bitten.”\n\n“Bitten?”  I thought she coloured a little.\n\n“Oh it doesn’t matter!” I laughed; “one doesn’t die of it.”\n\n“I hope I shan’t die of anything before I’ve seen more of Mrs. Mulville.”\nI rejoiced with her over plain Adelaide, whom she pronounced the\nloveliest woman she had met in England; but before we separated I\nremarked to her that it was an act of mere humanity to warn her that if\nshe should see more of Frank Saltram—which would be likely to follow on\nany increase of acquaintance with Mrs. Mulville—she might find herself\nflattening her nose against the clear hard pane of an eternal\nquestion—that of the relative, that of the opposed, importances of virtue\nand brains.  She replied that this was surely a subject on which one took\neverything for granted; whereupon I admitted that I had perhaps expressed\nmyself ill.  What I referred to was what I had referred to the night we\nmet in Upper Baker Street—the relative importance (relative to virtue) of\nother gifts.  She asked me if I called virtue a gift—a thing handed to us\nin a parcel on our first birthday; and I declared that this very enquiry\nproved to me the problem had already caught her by the skirt.  She would\nhave help however, the same help I myself had once had, in resisting its\ntendency to make one cross.\n\n“What help do you mean?”\n\n“That of the member for Clockborough.”\n\nShe stared, smiled, then returned: “Why my idea has been to help him!”\n\nShe had helped him—I had his own word for it that at Clockborough her\nbedevilment of the voters had really put him in.  She would do so\ndoubtless again and again, though I heard the very next month that this\nfine faculty had undergone a temporary eclipse.  News of the catastrophe\nfirst came to me from Mrs. Saltram, and it was afterwards confirmed at\nWimbledon: poor Miss Anvoy was in trouble—great disasters in America had\nsuddenly summoned her home.  Her father, in New York, had suffered\nreverses, lost so much money that it was really vexatious as showing how\nmuch he had had.  It was Adelaide who told me she had gone off alone at\nless than a week’s notice.\n\n“Alone?  Gravener has permitted that?”\n\n“What will you have?  The House of Commons!”\n\nI’m afraid I cursed the House of Commons: I was so much interested.  Of\ncourse he’d follow her as soon as he was free to make her his wife; only\nshe mightn’t now be able to bring him anything like the marriage-portion\nof which he had begun by having the virtual promise.  Mrs. Mulville let\nme know what was already said: she was charming, this American girl, but\nreally these American fathers—!  What was a man to do?  Mr. Saltram,\naccording to Mrs. Mulville, was of opinion that a man was never to suffer\nhis relation to money to become a spiritual relation—he was to keep it\nexclusively material.  “Moi pas comprendre!” I commented on this; in\nrejoinder to which Adelaide, with her beautiful sympathy, explained that\nshe supposed he simply meant that the thing was to use it, don’t you\nknow? but not to think too much about it.  “To take it, but not to thank\nyou for it?” I still more profanely enquired.  For a quarter of an hour\nafterwards she wouldn’t look at me, but this didn’t prevent my asking her\nwhat had been the result, that afternoon—in the Regent’s Park, of her\ntaking our friend to see Miss Anvoy.\n\n“Oh so charming!” she answered, brightening.  “He said he recognised in\nher a nature he could absolutely trust.”\n\n“Yes, but I’m speaking of the effect on herself.”\n\nMrs. Mulville had to remount the stream.  “It was everything one could\nwish.”\n\nSomething in her tone made me laugh.  “Do you mean she gave him—a dole?”\n\n“Well, since you ask me!”\n\n“Right there on the spot?”\n\nAgain poor Adelaide faltered.  “It was to me of course she gave it.”\n\nI stared; somehow I couldn’t see the scene.  “Do you mean a sum of\nmoney?”\n\n“It was very handsome.”  Now at last she met my eyes, though I could see\nit was with an effort.  “Thirty pounds.”\n\n“Straight out of her pocket?”\n\n“Out of the drawer of a table at which she had been writing.  She just\nslipped the folded notes into my hand.  He wasn’t looking; it was while\nhe was going back to the carriage.”  “Oh,” said Adelaide reassuringly, “I\ntake care of it for him!”  The dear practical soul thought my agitation,\nfor I confess I was agitated, referred to the employment of the money.\nHer disclosure made me for a moment muse violently, and I dare say that\nduring that moment I wondered if anything else in the world makes people\nso gross as unselfishness.  I uttered, I suppose, some vague synthetic\ncry, for she went on as if she had had a glimpse of my inward amaze at\nsuch passages.  “I assure you, my dear friend, he was in one of his happy\nhours.”\n\nBut I wasn’t thinking of that.  “Truly indeed these Americans!” I said.\n“With her father in the very act, as it were, of swindling her\nbetrothed!”\n\nMrs. Mulville stared.  “Oh I suppose Mr. Anvoy has scarcely gone\nbankrupt—or whatever he has done—on purpose.  Very likely they won’t be\nable to keep it up, but there it was, and it was a very beautiful\nimpulse.”\n\n“You say Saltram was very fine?”\n\n“Beyond everything.  He surprised even me.”\n\n“And I know what you’ve enjoyed.”  After a moment I added: “Had he\nperadventure caught a glimpse of the money in the table-drawer?”\n\nAt this my companion honestly flushed.  “How can you be so cruel when you\nknow how little he calculates?”\n\n“Forgive me, I do know it.  But you tell me things that act on my nerves.\nI’m sure he hadn’t caught a glimpse of anything but some splendid idea.”\n\nMrs. Mulville brightly concurred.  “And perhaps even of her beautiful\nlistening face.”\n\n“Perhaps even!  And what was it all about?”\n\n“His talk?  It was apropos of her engagement, which I had told him about:\nthe idea of marriage, the philosophy, the poetry, the sublimity of it.”\nIt was impossible wholly to restrain one’s mirth at this, and some rude\nripple that I emitted again caused my companion to admonish me.  “It\nsounds a little stale, but you know his freshness.”\n\n“Of illustration?  Indeed I do!”\n\n“And how he has always been right on that great question.”\n\n“On what great question, dear lady, hasn’t he been right?”\n\n“Of what other great men can you equally say it?—and that he has never,\nbut never, had a deflexion?” Mrs. Mulville exultantly demanded.\n\nI tried to think of some other great man, but I had to give it up.\n“Didn’t Miss Anvoy express her satisfaction in any less diffident way\nthan by her charming present?” I was reduced to asking instead.\n\n“Oh yes, she overflowed to me on the steps while he was getting into the\ncarriage.”  These words somehow brushed up a picture of Saltram’s big\nshawled back as he hoisted himself into the green landau.  “She said she\nwasn’t disappointed,” Adelaide pursued.\n\nI turned it over.  “Did he wear his shawl?”\n\n“His shawl?”  She hadn’t even noticed.\n\n“I mean yours.”\n\n“He looked very nice, and you know he’s really clean.  Miss Anvoy used\nsuch a remarkable expression—she said his mind’s like a crystal!”\n\nI pricked up my ears.  “A crystal?”\n\n“Suspended in the moral world—swinging and shining and flashing there.\nShe’s monstrously clever, you know.”\n\nI thought again.  “Monstrously!”\n\n\n\n\nVIII\n\n\nGEORGE GRAVENER didn’t follow her, for late in September, after the House\nhad risen, I met him in a railway-carriage.  He was coming up from\nScotland and I had just quitted some relations who lived near Durham.\nThe current of travel back to London wasn’t yet strong; at any rate on\nentering the compartment I found he had had it for some time to himself.\nWe fared in company, and though he had a blue-book in his lap and the\nopen jaws of his bag threatened me with the white teeth of confused\npapers, we inevitably, we even at last sociably conversed.  I saw things\nweren’t well with him, but I asked no question till something dropped by\nhimself made, as it had made on another occasion, an absence of curiosity\ninvidious.  He mentioned that he was worried about his good old friend\nLady Coxon, who, with her niece likely to be detained some time in\nAmerica, lay seriously ill at Clockborough, much on his mind and on his\nhands.\n\n“Ah Miss Anvoy’s in America?”\n\n“Her father has got into horrid straits—has lost no end of money.”\n\nI waited, after expressing due concern, but I eventually said: “I hope\nthat raises no objection to your marriage.”\n\n“None whatever; moreover it’s my trade to meet objections.  But it may\ncreate tiresome delays, of which there have been too many, from various\ncauses, already.  Lady Coxon got very bad, then she got much better.\nThen Mr. Anvoy suddenly began to totter, and now he seems quite on his\nback.  I’m afraid he’s really in for some big reverse.  Lady Coxon’s\nworse again, awfully upset by the news from America, and she sends me\nword that she _must_ have Ruth.  How can I supply her with Ruth?  I\nhaven’t got Ruth myself!”\n\n“Surely you haven’t lost her?” I returned.\n\n“She’s everything to her wretched father.  She writes me every\npost—telling me to smooth her aunt’s pillow.  I’ve other things to\nsmooth; but the old lady, save for her servants, is really alone.  She\nwon’t receive her Coxon relations—she’s angry at so much of her money\ngoing to them.  Besides, she’s hopelessly mad,” said Gravener very\nfrankly.\n\nI don’t remember whether it was this, or what it was, that made me ask if\nshe hadn’t such an appreciation of Mrs. Saltram as might render that\nactive person of some use.\n\nHe gave me a cold glance, wanting to know what had put Mrs. Saltram into\nmy head, and I replied that she was unfortunately never out of it.  I\nhappened to remember the wonderful accounts she had given me of the\nkindness Lady Coxon had shown her.  Gravener declared this to be false;\nLady Coxon, who didn’t care for her, hadn’t seen her three times.  The\nonly foundation for it was that Miss Anvoy, who used, poor girl, to chuck\nmoney about in a manner she must now regret, had for an hour seen in the\nmiserable woman—you could never know what she’d see in people—an\ninteresting pretext for the liberality with which her nature overflowed.\nBut even Miss Anvoy was now quite tired of her.  Gravener told me more\nabout the crash in New York and the annoyance it had been to him, and we\nalso glanced here and there in other directions; but by the time we got\nto Doncaster the principal thing he had let me see was that he was\nkeeping something back.  We stopped at that station, and, at the\ncarriage-door, some one made a movement to get in.  Gravener uttered a\nsound of impatience, and I felt sure that but for this I should have had\nthe secret.  Then the intruder, for some reason, spared us his company;\nwe started afresh, and my hope of a disclosure returned.  My companion\nheld his tongue, however, and I pretended to go to sleep; in fact I\nreally dozed for discouragement.  When I reopened my eyes he was looking\nat me with an injured air.  He tossed away with some vivacity the remnant\nof a cigarette and then said: “If you’re not too sleepy I want to put you\na case.”  I answered that I’d make every effort to attend, and welcomed\nthe note of interest when he went on: “As I told you a while ago, Lady\nCoxon, poor dear, is demented.”  His tone had much behind it—was full of\npromise.  I asked if her ladyship’s misfortune were a trait of her malady\nor only of her character, and he pronounced it a product of both.  The\ncase he wanted to put to me was a matter on which it concerned him to\nhave the impression—the judgement, he might also say—of another person.\n“I mean of the average intelligent man, but you see I take what I can\nget.” There would be the technical, the strictly legal view; then there\nwould be the way the question would strike a man of the world.  He had\nlighted another cigarette while he talked, and I saw he was glad to have\nit to handle when he brought out at last, with a laugh slightly\nartificial: “In fact it’s a subject on which Miss Anvoy and I are pulling\ndifferent ways.”\n\n“And you want me to decide between you?  I decide in advance for Miss\nAnvoy.”\n\n“In advance—that’s quite right.  That’s how I decided when I proposed to\nher.  But my story will interest you only so far as your mind isn’t made\nup.”  Gravener puffed his cigarette a minute and then continued: “Are you\nfamiliar with the idea of the Endowment of Research?”\n\n“Of Research?” I was at sea a moment.\n\n“I give you Lady Coxon’s phrase.  She has it on the brain.”\n\n“She wishes to endow—?”\n\n“Some earnest and ‘loyal’ seeker,” Gravener said.  “It was a sketchy\ndesign of her late husband’s, and he handed it on to her; setting apart\nin his will a sum of money of which she was to enjoy the interest for\nlife, but of which, should she eventually see her opportunity—the matter\nwas left largely to her discretion—she would best honour his memory by\ndetermining the exemplary public use.  This sum of money, no less than\nthirteen thousand pounds, was to be called The Coxon Fund; and poor Sir\nGregory evidently proposed to himself that The Coxon Fund should cover\nhis name with glory—be universally desired and admired.  He left his wife\na full declaration of his views, so far at least as that term may be\napplied to views vitiated by a vagueness really infantine.  A little\nlearning’s a dangerous thing, and a good citizen who happens to have been\nan ass is worse for a community than bad sewerage.  He’s worst of all\nwhen he’s dead, because then he can’t be stopped.  However, such as they\nwere, the poor man’s aspirations are now in his wife’s bosom, or\nfermenting rather in her foolish brain: it lies with her to carry them\nout.  But of course she must first catch her hare.”\n\n“Her earnest loyal seeker?”\n\n“The flower that blushes unseen for want of such a pecuniary independence\nas may aid the light that’s in it to shine upon the human race.  The\nindividual, in a word, who, having the rest of the machinery, the\nspiritual, the intellectual, is most hampered in his search.”\n\n“His search for what?”\n\n“For Moral Truth.  That’s what Sir Gregory calls it.”\n\nI burst out laughing.  “Delightful munificent Sir Gregory!  It’s a\ncharming idea.”\n\n“So Miss Anvoy thinks.”\n\n“Has she a candidate for the Fund?”\n\n“Not that I know of—and she’s perfectly reasonable about it.  But Lady\nCoxon has put the matter before her, and we’ve naturally had a lot of\ntalk.”\n\n“Talk that, as you’ve so interestingly intimated, has landed you in a\ndisagreement.”\n\n“She considers there’s something in it,” Gravener said.\n\n“And you consider there’s nothing?”\n\n“It seems to me a piece of solemn twaddle—which can’t fail to be attended\nwith consequences certainly grotesque and possibly immoral.  To begin\nwith, fancy constituting an endowment without establishing a tribunal—a\nbench of competent people, of judges.”\n\n“The sole tribunal is Lady Coxon?”\n\n“And any one she chooses to invite.”\n\n“But she has invited you,” I noted.\n\n“I’m not competent—I hate the thing.  Besides, she hasn’t,” my friend\nwent on.  “The real history of the matter, I take it, is that the\ninspiration was originally Lady Coxon’s own, that she infected him with\nit, and that the flattering option left her is simply his tribute to her\nbeautiful, her aboriginal enthusiasm.  She came to England forty years\nago, a thin transcendental Bostonian, and even her odd happy frumpy\nClockborough marriage never really materialised her.  She feels indeed\nthat she has become very British—as if that, as a process, as a ‘Werden,’\nas anything but an original sign of grace, were conceivable; but it’s\nprecisely what makes her cling to the notion of the ‘Fund’—cling to it as\nto a link with the ideal.”\n\n“How can she cling if she’s dying?”\n\n“Do you mean how can she act in the matter?” Gravener asked.  “That’s\nprecisely the question.  She can’t!  As she has never yet caught her\nhare, never spied out her lucky impostor—how should she, with the life\nshe has led?—her husband’s intention has come very near lapsing.  His\nidea, to do him justice, was that it _should_ lapse if exactly the right\nperson, the perfect mixture of genius and chill penury, should fail to\nturn up.  Ah the poor dear woman’s very particular—she says there must be\nno mistake.”\n\nI found all this quite thrilling—I took it in with avidity.  “And if she\ndies without doing anything, what becomes of the money?” I demanded.\n\n“It goes back to his family, if she hasn’t made some other disposition of\nit.”\n\n“She may do that then—she may divert it?”\n\n“Her hands are not tied.  She has a grand discretion.  The proof is that\nthree months ago she offered to make the proceeds over to her niece.”\n\n“For Miss Anvoy’s own use?”\n\n“For Miss Anvoy’s own use—on the occasion of her prospective marriage.\nShe was discouraged—the earnest seeker required so earnest a search.  She\nwas afraid of making a mistake; every one she could think of seemed\neither not earnest enough or not poor enough.  On the receipt of the\nfirst bad news about Mr. Anvoy’s affairs she proposed to Ruth to make the\nsacrifice for her.  As the situation in New York got worse she repeated\nher proposal.”\n\n“Which Miss Anvoy declined?”\n\n“Except as a formal trust.”\n\n“You mean except as committing herself legally to place the money?”\n\n“On the head of the deserving object, the great man frustrated,” said\nGravener.  “She only consents to act in the spirit of Sir Gregory’s\nscheme.”\n\n“And you blame her for that?” I asked with some intensity.\n\nMy tone couldn’t have been harsh, but he coloured a little and there was\na queer light in his eye.  “My dear fellow, if I ‘blamed’ the young lady\nI’m engaged to I shouldn’t immediately say it even to so old a friend as\nyou.”  I saw that some deep discomfort, some restless desire to be sided\nwith, reassuringly, approvingly mirrored, had been at the bottom of his\ndrifting so far, and I was genuinely touched by his confidence.  It was\ninconsistent with his habits; but being troubled about a woman was not,\nfor him, a habit: that itself was an inconsistency.  George Gravener\ncould stand straight enough before any other combination of forces.  It\namused me to think that the combination he had succumbed to had an\nAmerican accent, a transcendental aunt and an insolvent father; but all\nmy old loyalty to him mustered to meet this unexpected hint that I could\nhelp him.  I saw that I could from the insincere tone in which he\npursued: “I’ve criticised her of course, I’ve contended with her, and it\nhas been great fun.”  Yet it clearly couldn’t have been such great fun as\nto make it improper for me presently to ask if Miss Anvoy had nothing at\nall settled on herself.  To this he replied that she had only a trifle\nfrom her mother—a mere four hundred a year, which was exactly why it\nwould be convenient to him that she shouldn’t decline, in the face of\nthis total change in her prospects, an accession of income which would\ndistinctly help them to marry.  When I enquired if there were no other\nway in which so rich and so affectionate an aunt could cause the weight\nof her benevolence to be felt, he answered that Lady Coxon was\naffectionate indeed, but was scarcely to be called rich.  She could let\nher project of the Fund lapse for her niece’s benefit, but she couldn’t\ndo anything else.  She had been accustomed to regard her as tremendously\nprovided for, and she was up to her eyes in promises to anxious Coxons.\nShe was a woman of an inordinate conscience, and her conscience was now a\ndistress to her, hovering round her bed in irreconcilable forms of\nresentful husbands, portionless nieces and undiscoverable philosophers.\n\nWe were by this time getting into the whirr of fleeting platforms, the\nmultiplication of lights.  “I think you’ll find,” I said with a laugh,\n“that your predicament will disappear in the very fact that the\nphilosopher _is_ undiscoverable.”\n\nHe began to gather up his papers.  “Who can set a limit to the ingenuity\nof an extravagant woman?”\n\n“Yes, after all, who indeed?” I echoed as I recalled the extravagance\ncommemorated in Adelaide’s anecdote of Miss Anvoy and the thirty pounds.\n\n\n\n\nIX\n\n\nTHE thing I had been most sensible of in that talk with George Gravener\nwas the way Saltram’s name kept out of it.  It seemed to me at the time\nthat we were quite pointedly silent about him; but afterwards it appeared\nmore probable there had been on my companion’s part no conscious\navoidance.  Later on I was sure of this, and for the best of reasons—the\nsimple reason of my perceiving more completely that, for evil as well as\nfor good, he said nothing to Gravener’s imagination.  That honest man\ndidn’t fear him—he was too much disgusted with him.  No more did I,\ndoubtless, and for very much the same reason.  I treated my friend’s\nstory as an absolute confidence; but when before Christmas, by Mrs.\nSaltram, I was informed of Lady Coxon’s death without having had news of\nMiss Anvoy’s return, I found myself taking for granted we should hear no\nmore of these nuptials, in which, as obscurely unnatural, I now saw I had\nnever _too_ disconcertedly believed.  I began to ask myself how people\nwho suited each other so little could please each other so much.  The\ncharm was some material charm, some afffinity, exquisite doubtless, yet\nsuperficial some surrender to youth and beauty and passion, to force and\ngrace and fortune, happy accidents and easy contacts.  They might dote on\neach other’s persons, but how could they know each other’s souls?  How\ncould they have the same prejudices, how could they have the same\nhorizon?  Such questions, I confess, seemed quenched but not answered\nwhen, one day in February, going out to Wimbledon, I found our young lady\nin the house.  A passion that had brought her back across the wintry\nocean was as much of a passion as was needed.  No impulse equally strong\nindeed had drawn George Gravener to America; a circumstance on which,\nhowever, I reflected only long enough to remind myself that it was none\nof my business.  Ruth Anvoy was distinctly different, and I felt that the\ndifference was not simply that of her marks of mourning.  Mrs. Mulville\ntold me soon enough what it was: it was the difference between a handsome\ngirl with large expectations and a handsome girl with only four hundred a\nyear.  This explanation indeed didn’t wholly content me, not even when I\nlearned that her mourning had a double cause—learned that poor Mr. Anvoy,\ngiving way altogether, buried under the ruins of his fortune and leaving\nnext to nothing, had died a few weeks before.\n\n“So she has come out to marry George Gravener?” I commented.  “Wouldn’t\nit have been prettier of him to have saved her the trouble?”\n\n“Hasn’t the House just met?” Adelaide replied.  “And for Mr. Gravener the\nHouse—!”  Then she added: “I gather that her having come is exactly a\nsign that the marriage is a little shaky.  If it were quite all right a\nself-respecting girl like Ruth would have waited for him over there.”\n\nI noted that they were already Ruth and Adelaide, but what I said was:\n“Do you mean she’ll have had to return to _make_ it so?”\n\n“No, I mean that she must have come out for some reason independent of\nit.”  Adelaide could only surmise, however, as yet, and there was more,\nas we found, to be revealed.  Mrs. Mulville, on hearing of her arrival,\nhad brought the young lady out in the green landau for the Sunday.  The\nCoxons were in possession of the house in Regent’s Park, and Miss Anvoy\nwas in dreary lodgings.  George Gravener had been with her when Adelaide\ncalled, but had assented graciously enough to the little visit at\nWimbledon.  The carriage, with Mr. Saltram in it but not mentioned, had\nbeen sent off on some errand from which it was to return and pick the\nladies up.  Gravener had left them together, and at the end of an hour,\non the Saturday afternoon, the party of three had driven out to\nWimbledon.  This was the girl’s second glimpse of our great man, and I\nwas interested in asking Mrs. Mulville if the impression made by the\nfirst appeared to have been confirmed.  On her replying after\nconsideration, that of course with time and opportunity it couldn’t fail\nto be, but that she was disappointed, I was sufficiently struck with her\nuse of this last word to question her further.\n\n“Do you mean you’re disappointed because you judge Miss Anvoy to be?”\n\n“Yes; I hoped for a greater effect last evening.  We had two or three\npeople, but he scarcely opened his mouth.”\n\n“He’ll be all the better to-night,” I opined after a moment.  Then I\npursued: “What particular importance do you attach to the idea of her\nbeing impressed?”\n\nAdelaide turned her mild pale eyes on me as for rebuke of my levity.\n“Why the importance of her being as happy as _we_ are!”\n\nI’m afraid that at this my levity grew.  “Oh that’s a happiness almost\ntoo great to wish a person!”  I saw she hadn’t yet in her mind what I had\nin mine, and at any rate the visitor’s actual bliss was limited to a walk\nin the garden with Kent Mulville.  Later in the afternoon I also took\none, and I saw nothing of Miss Anvoy till dinner, at which we failed of\nthe company of Saltram, who had caused it to be reported that he was\nindisposed and lying down.  This made us, most of us—for there were other\nfriends present—convey to each other in silence some of the unutterable\nthings that in those years our eyes had inevitably acquired the art of\nexpressing.  If a fine little American enquirer hadn’t been there we\nwould have expressed them otherwise, and Adelaide would have pretended\nnot to hear.  I had seen her, before the very fact, abstract herself\nnobly; and I knew that more than once, to keep it from the servants,\nmanaging, dissimulating cleverly, she had helped her husband to carry him\nbodily to his room.  Just recently he had been so wise and so deep and so\nhigh that I had begun to get nervous—to wonder if by chance there were\nsomething behind it, if he were kept straight for instance by the\nknowledge that the hated Pudneys would have more to tell us if they\nchose.  He was lying low, but unfortunately it was common wisdom with us\nin this connexion that the biggest splashes took place in the quietest\npools.  We should have had a merry life indeed if all the splashes had\nsprinkled us as refreshingly as the waters we were even then to feel\nabout our ears.  Kent Mulville had been up to his room, but had come back\nwith a face that told as few tales as I had seen it succeed in telling on\nthe evening I waited in the lecture-room with Miss Anvoy.  I said to\nmyself that our friend had gone out, but it was a comfort that the\npresence of a comparative stranger deprived us of the dreary duty of\nsuggesting to each other, in respect of his errand, edifying\npossibilities in which we didn’t ourselves believe.  At ten o’clock he\ncame into the drawing-room with his waistcoat much awry but his eyes\nsending out great signals.  It was precisely with his entrance that I\nceased to be vividly conscious of him.  I saw that the crystal, as I had\ncalled it, had begun to swing, and I had need of my immediate attention\nfor Miss Anvoy.\n\nEven when I was told afterwards that he had, as we might have said\nto-day, broken the record, the manner in which that attention had been\nrewarded relieved me of a sense of loss.  I had of course a perfect\ngeneral consciousness that something great was going on: it was a little\nlike having been etherised to hear Herr Joachim play.  The old music was\nin the air; I felt the strong pulse of thought, the sink and swell, the\nflight, the poise, the plunge; but I knew something about one of the\nlisteners that nobody else knew, and Saltram’s monologue could reach me\nonly through that medium.  To this hour I’m of no use when, as a witness,\nI’m appealed to—for they still absurdly contend about it—as to whether or\nno on that historic night he was drunk; and my position is slightly\nridiculous, for I’ve never cared to tell them what it really was I was\ntaken up with.  What I got out of it is the only morsel of the total\nexperience that is quite my own.  The others were shared, but this is\nincommunicable.  I feel that now, I’m bound to say, even in thus roughly\nevoking the occasion, and it takes something from my pride of clearness.\nHowever, I shall perhaps be as clear as is absolutely needful if I remark\nthat our young lady was too much given up to her own intensity of\nobservation to be sensible of mine.  It was plainly not the question of\nher marriage that had brought her back.  I greatly enjoyed this discovery\nand was sure that had that question alone been involved she would have\nstirred no step.  In this case doubtless Gravener would, in spite of the\nHouse of Commons, have found means to rejoin her.  It afterwards made me\nuncomfortable for her that, alone in the lodging Mrs. Mulville had put\nbefore me as dreary, she should have in any degree the air of waiting for\nher fate; so that I was presently relieved at hearing of her having gone\nto stay at Coldfield.  If she was in England at all while the engagement\nstood the only proper place for her was under Lady Maddock’s wing.  Now\nthat she was unfortunate and relatively poor, perhaps her prospective\nsister-in-law would be wholly won over.\n\nThere would be much to say, if I had space, about the way her behaviour,\nas I caught gleams of it, ministered to the image that had taken birth in\nmy mind, to my private amusement, while that other night I listened to\nGeorge Gravener in the railway-carriage.  I watched her in the light of\nthis queer possibility—a formidable thing certainly to meet—and I was\naware that it coloured, extravagantly perhaps, my interpretation of her\nvery looks and tones.  At Wimbledon for instance it had appeared to me\nshe was literally afraid of Saltram, in dread of a coercion that she had\nbegun already to feel.  I had come up to town with her the next day and\nhad been convinced that, though deeply interested, she was immensely on\nher guard.  She would show as little as possible before she should be\nready to show everything.  What this final exhibition might be on the\npart of a girl perceptibly so able to think things out I found it great\nsport to forecast.  It would have been exciting to be approached by her,\nappealed to by her for advice; but I prayed to heaven I mightn’t find\nmyself in such a predicament.  If there was really a present rigour in\nthe situation of which Gravener had sketched for me the elements, she\nwould have to get out of her difficulty by herself.  It wasn’t I who had\nlaunched her and it wasn’t I who could help her.  I didn’t fail to ask\nmyself why, since I couldn’t help her, I should think so much about her.\nIt was in part my suspense that was responsible for this; I waited\nimpatiently to see whether she wouldn’t have told Mrs. Mulville a portion\nat least of what I had learned from Gravener.  But I saw Mrs. Mulville\nwas still reduced to wonder what she had come out again for if she hadn’t\ncome as a conciliatory bride.  That she had come in some other character\nwas the only thing that fitted all the appearances.  Having for family\nreasons to spend some time that spring in the west of England, I was in a\nmanner out of earshot of the great oceanic rumble—I mean of the\ncontinuous hum of Saltram’s thought—and my uneasiness tended to keep me\nquiet.  There was something I wanted so little to have to say that my\nprudence surmounted my curiosity.  I only wondered if Ruth Anvoy talked\nover the idea of The Coxon Fund with Lady Maddock, and also somewhat why\nI didn’t hear from Wimbledon.  I had a reproachful note about something\nor other from Mrs. Saltram, but it contained no mention of Lady Coxon’s\nniece, on whom her eyes had been much less fixed since the recent\nuntoward events.\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nPOOR Adelaide’s silence was fully explained later—practically explained\nwhen in June, returning to London, I was honoured by this admirable woman\nwith an early visit.  As soon as she arrived I guessed everything, and as\nsoon as she told me that darling Ruth had been in her house nearly a\nmonth I had my question ready.  “What in the name of maidenly modesty is\nshe staying in England for?”\n\n“Because she loves me so!” cried Adelaide gaily.  But she hadn’t come to\nsee me only to tell me Miss Anvoy loved her: that was quite sufficiently\nestablished, and what was much more to the point was that Mr. Gravener\nhad now raised an objection to it.  He had protested at least against her\nbeing at Wimbledon, where in the innocence of his heart he had originally\nbrought her himself; he called on her to put an end to their engagement\nin the only proper, the only happy manner.\n\n“And why in the world doesn’t she do do?” I asked.\n\nAdelaide had a pause.  “She says you know.”\n\nThen on my also hesitating she added: “A condition he makes.”\n\n“The Coxon Fund?” I panted.\n\n“He has mentioned to her his having told you about it.”\n\n“Ah but so little!  Do you mean she has accepted the trust?”\n\n“In the most splendid spirit—as a duty about which there can be no two\nopinions.”  To which my friend added: “Of course she’s thinking of Mr.\nSaltram.”\n\nI gave a quick cry at this, which, in its violence, made my visitor turn\npale.  “How very awful!”\n\n“Awful?”\n\n“Why, to have anything to do with such an idea one’s self.”\n\n“I’m sure _you_ needn’t!” and Mrs. Mulville tossed her head.\n\n“He isn’t good enough!” I went on; to which she opposed a sound almost as\ncontentious as my own had been.  This made me, with genuine immediate\nhorror, exclaim: “You haven’t influenced her, I hope!” and my emphasis\nbrought back the blood with a rush to poor Adelaide’s face.  She declared\nwhile she blushed—for I had frightened her again—that she had never\ninfluenced anybody and that the girl had only seen and heard and judged\nfor herself.  _He_ had influenced her, if I would, as he did every one\nwho had a soul: that word, as we knew, even expressed feebly the power of\nthe things he said to haunt the mind.  How could she, Adelaide, help it\nif Miss Anvoy’s mind was haunted?  I demanded with a groan what right a\npretty girl engaged to a rising M.P. had to _have_ a mind; but the only\nexplanation my bewildered friend could give me was that she was so\nclever.  She regarded Mr. Saltram naturally as a tremendous force for\ngood.  She was intelligent enough to understand him and generous enough\nto admire.\n\n“She’s many things enough, but is she, among them, rich enough?” I\ndemanded.  “Rich enough, I mean, to sacrifice such a lot of good money?”\n\n“That’s for herself to judge.  Besides, it’s not her own money; she\ndoesn’t in the least consider it so.”\n\n“And Gravener does, if not _his_ own; and that’s the whole difficulty?”\n\n“The difficulty that brought her back, yes: she had absolutely to see her\npoor aunt’s solicitor.  It’s clear that by Lady Coxon’s will she may have\nthe money, but it’s still clearer to her conscience that the original\ncondition, definite, intensely implied on her uncle’s part, is attached\nto the use of it.  She can only take one view of it.  It’s for the\nEndowment or it’s for nothing.”\n\n“The Endowment,” I permitted myself to observe, “is a conception\nsuperficially sublime, but fundamentally ridiculous.”\n\n“Are you repeating Mr. Gravener’s words?” Adelaide asked.\n\n“Possibly, though I’ve not seen him for months.  It’s simply the way it\nstrikes me too.  It’s an old wife’s tale.  Gravener made some reference\nto the legal aspect, but such an absurdly loose arrangement has _no_\nlegal aspect.”\n\n“Ruth doesn’t insist on that,” said Mrs. Mulville; “and it’s, for her,\nexactly this technical weakness that constitutes the force of the moral\nobligation.”\n\n“Are you repeating _her_ words?” I enquired.  I forget what else Adelaide\nsaid, but she said she was magnificent.  I thought of George Gravener\nconfronted with such magnificence as that, and I asked what could have\nmade two such persons ever suppose they understood each other.  Mrs.\nMulville assured me the girl loved him as such a woman could love and\nthat she suffered as such a woman could suffer.  Nevertheless she wanted\nto see _me_.  At this I sprang up with a groan.  “Oh I’m so sorry!—when?”\nSmall though her sense of humour, I think Adelaide laughed at my\nsequence.  We discussed the day, the nearest it would be convenient I\nshould come out; but before she went I asked my visitor how long she had\nbeen acquainted with these prodigies.\n\n“For several weeks, but I was pledged to secrecy.”\n\n“And that’s why you didn’t write?”\n\n“I couldn’t very well tell you she was with me without telling you that\nno time had even yet been fixed for her marriage.  And I couldn’t very\nwell tell you as much as that without telling you what I knew of the\nreason of it.  It was not till a day or two ago,” Mrs. Mulville went on,\n“that she asked me to ask you if you wouldn’t come and see her.  Then at\nlast she spoke of your knowing about the idea of the Endowment.”\n\nI turned this over.  “Why on earth does she want to see me?”\n\n“To talk with you, naturally, about Mr. Saltram.”\n\n“As a subject for the prize?”  This was hugely obvious, and I presently\nreturned: “I think I’ll sail to-morrow for Australia.”\n\n“Well then—sail!” said Mrs. Mulville, getting up.\n\nBut I frivolously, continued.  “On Thursday at five, we said?”  The\nappointment was made definite and I enquired how, all this time, the\nunconscious candidate had carried himself.\n\n“In perfection, really, by the happiest of chances: he has positively\nbeen a dear.  And then, as to what we revere him for, in the most\nwonderful form.  His very highest—pure celestial light.  You _won’t_ do\nhim an ill turn?” Adelaide pleaded at the door.\n\n“What danger can equal for him the danger to which he’s exposed from\nhimself?” I asked.  “Look out sharp, if he has lately been too prim.\nHe’ll presently take a day off, treat us to some exhibition that will\nmake an Endowment a scandal.”\n\n“A scandal?” Mrs. Mulville dolorously echoed.\n\n“Is Miss Anvoy prepared for that?”\n\nMy visitor, for a moment, screwed her parasol into my carpet.  “He grows\nbigger every day.”\n\n“So do you!” I laughed as she went off.\n\nThat girl at Wimbledon, on the Thursday afternoon, more than justified my\napprehensions.  I recognised fully now the cause of the agitation she had\nproduced in me from the first—the faint foreknowledge that there was\nsomething very stiff I should have to do for her.  I felt more than ever\ncommitted to my fate as, standing before her in the big drawing-room\nwhere they had tactfully left us to ourselves, I tried with a smile to\nstring together the pearls of lucidity which, from her chair, she\nsuccessively tossed me.  Pale and bright, in her monotonous mourning, she\nwas an image of intelligent purpose, of the passion of duty; but I asked\nmyself whether any girl had ever had so charming an instinct as that\nwhich permitted her to laugh out, as for the joy of her difficulty, into\nthe priggish old room.  This remarkable young woman could be earnest\nwithout being solemn, and at moments when I ought doubtless to have\ncursed her obstinacy I found myself watching the unstudied play of her\neyebrows or the recurrence of a singularly intense whiteness produced by\nthe parting of her lips.  These aberrations, I hasten to add, didn’t\nprevent my learning soon enough why she had wished to see me.  Her reason\nfor this was as distinct as her beauty: it was to make me explain what I\nhad meant, on the occasion of our first meeting, by Mr. Saltram’s want of\ndignity.  It wasn’t that she couldn’t imagine, but she desired it there\nfrom my lips.  What she really desired of course was to know whether\nthere was worse about him than what she had found out for herself.  She\nhadn’t been a month so much in the house with him without discovering\nthat he wasn’t a man of monumental bronze.  He was like a jelly minus its\nmould, he had to be embanked; and that was precisely the source of her\ninterest in him and the ground of her project.  She put her project\nboldly before me: there it stood in its preposterous beauty.  She was as\nwilling to take the humorous view of it as I could be: the only\ndifference was that for her the humorous view of a thing wasn’t\nnecessarily prohibitive, wasn’t paralysing.\n\nMoreover she professed that she couldn’t discuss with me the primary\nquestion—the moral obligation: that was in her own breast.  There were\nthings she couldn’t go into—injunctions, impressions she had received.\nThey were a part of the closest intimacy of her intercourse with her\naunt, they were absolutely clear to her; and on questions of delicacy,\nthe interpretation of a fidelity, of a promise, one had always in the\nlast resort to make up one’s mind for one’s self.  It was the idea of the\napplication to the particular case, such a splendid one at last, that\ntroubled her, and she admitted that it stirred very deep things.  She\ndidn’t pretend that such a responsibility was a simple matter; if it\n_had_ been she wouldn’t have attempted to saddle me with any portion of\nit.  The Mulvilles were sympathy itself, but were they absolutely candid?\nCould they indeed be, in their position—would it even have been to be\ndesired?  Yes, she had sent for me to ask no less than that of me—whether\nthere was anything dreadful kept back.  She made no allusion whatever to\nGeorge Gravener—I thought her silence the only good taste and her gaiety\nperhaps a part of the very anxiety of that discretion, the effect of a\ndetermination that people shouldn’t know from herself that her relations\nwith the man she was to marry were strained.  All the weight, however,\nthat she left me to throw was a sufficient implication of the weight _he_\nhad thrown in vain.  Oh she knew the question of character was immense,\nand that one couldn’t entertain any plan for making merit comfortable\nwithout running the gauntlet of that terrible procession of\ninterrogation-points which, like a young ladies’ school out for a walk,\nhooked their uniform noses at the tail of governess Conduct.  But were we\nabsolutely to hold that there was never, never, never an exception,\nnever, never, never an occasion for liberal acceptance, for clever\ncharity, for suspended pedantry—for letting one side, in short,\noutbalance another?  When Miss Anvoy threw off this appeal I could have\nembraced her for so delightfully emphasising her unlikeness to Mrs.\nSaltram.  “Why not have the courage of one’s forgiveness,” she asked, “as\nwell as the enthusiasm of one’s adhesion?”\n\n“Seeing how wonderfully you’ve threshed the whole thing out,” I evasively\nreplied, “gives me an extraordinary notion of the point your enthusiasm\nhas reached.”\n\nShe considered this remark an instant with her eyes on mine, and I\ndivined that it struck her I might possibly intend it as a reference to\nsome personal subjection to our fat philosopher, to some aberration of\nsensibility, some perversion of taste.  At least I couldn’t interpret\notherwise the sudden flash that came into her face.  Such a\nmanifestation, as the result of any word of mine, embarrassed me; but\nwhile I was thinking how to reassure her the flush passed away in a smile\nof exquisite good nature.  “Oh you see one forgets so wonderfully how one\ndislikes him!” she said; and if her tone simply extinguished his strange\nfigure with the brush of its compassion, it also rings in my ear to-day\nas the purest of all our praises.  But with what quick response of fine\npity such a relegation of the man himself made me privately sigh “Ah poor\nSaltram!”  She instantly, with this, took the measure of all I didn’t\nbelieve, and it enabled her to go on: “What can one do when a person has\ngiven such a lift to one’s interest in life?”\n\n“Yes, what can one do?”  If I struck her as a little vague it was because\nI was thinking of another person.  I indulged in another inarticulate\nmurmur—“Poor George Gravener!”  What had become of the lift _he_ had\ngiven that interest?  Later on I made up my mind that she was sore and\nstricken at the appearance he presented of wanting the miserable money.\nThis was the hidden reason of her alienation.  The probable sincerity, in\nspite of the illiberality, of his scruples about the particular use of it\nunder discussion didn’t efface the ugliness of his demand that they\nshould buy a good house with it.  Then, as for _his_ alienation, he\ndidn’t, pardonably enough, grasp the lift Frank Saltram had given her\ninterest in life.  If a mere spectator could ask that last question, with\nwhat rage in his heart the man himself might!  He wasn’t, like her, I was\nto see, too proud to show me why he was disappointed.\n\n\n\n\nXI\n\n\nI WAS unable this time to stay to dinner: such at any rate was the plea\non which I took leave.  I desired in truth to get away from my young\nlady, for that obviously helped me not to pretend to satisfy her.  How\n_could_ I satisfy her?  I asked myself—how could I tell her how much had\nbeen kept back?  I didn’t even know and I certainly didn’t desire to\nknow.  My own policy had ever been to learn the least about poor\nSaltram’s weaknesses—not to learn the most.  A great deal that I had in\nfact learned had been forced upon me by his wife.  There was something\neven irritating in Miss Anvoy’s crude conscientiousness, and I wondered\nwhy, after all, she couldn’t have let him alone and been content to\nentrust George Gravener with the purchase of the good house.  I was sure\nhe would have driven a bargain, got something excellent and cheap.  I\nlaughed louder even than she, I temporised, I failed her; I told her I\nmust think over her case.  I professed a horror of responsibilities and\ntwitted her with her own extravagant passion for them.  It wasn’t really\nthat I was afraid of the scandal, the moral discredit for the Fund; what\ntroubled me most was a feeling of a different order.  Of course, as the\nbeneficiary of the Fund was to enjoy a simple life-interest, as it was\nhoped that new beneficiaries would arise and come up to new standards, it\nwouldn’t be a trifle that the first of these worthies shouldn’t have been\na striking example of the domestic virtues.  The Fund would start badly,\nas it were, and the laurel would, in some respects at least, scarcely be\ngreener from the brows of the original wearer.  That idea, however, was\nat that hour, as I have hinted, not the source of solicitude it ought\nperhaps to have been, for I felt less the irregularity of Saltram’s\ngetting the money than that of this exalted young woman’s giving it up.\nI wanted her to have it for herself, and I told her so before I went\naway.  She looked graver at this than she had looked at all, saying she\nhoped such a preference wouldn’t make me dishonest.\n\nIt made me, to begin with, very restless—made me, instead of going\nstraight to the station, fidget a little about that many-coloured Common\nwhich gives Wimbledon horizons.  There was a worry for me to work off, or\nrather keep at a distance, for I declined even to admit to myself that I\nhad, in Miss Anvoy’s phrase, been saddled with it.  What could have been\nclearer indeed than the attitude of recognising perfectly what a world of\ntrouble The Coxon Fund would in future save us, and of yet liking better\nto face a continuance of that trouble than see, and in fact contribute\nto, a deviation from attainable bliss in the life of two other persons in\nwhom I was deeply interested?  Suddenly, at the end of twenty minutes,\nthere was projected across this clearness the image of a massive\nmiddle-aged man seated on a bench under a tree, with sad far-wandering\neyes and plump white hands folded on the head of a stick—a stick I\nrecognised, a stout gold-headed staff that I had given him in devoted\ndays.  I stopped short as he turned his face to me, and it happened that\nfor some reason or other I took in as I had perhaps never done before the\nbeauty of his rich blank gaze.  It was charged with experience as the sky\nis charged with light, and I felt on the instant as if we had been\noverspanned and conjoined by the great arch of a bridge or the great dome\nof a temple.  Doubtless I was rendered peculiarly sensitive to it by\nsomething in the way I had been giving him up and sinking him.  While I\nmet it I stood there smitten, and I felt myself responding to it with a\nsort of guilty grimace.  This brought back his attention in a smile which\nexpressed for me a cheerful weary patience, a bruised noble gentleness.\nI had told Miss Anvoy that he had no dignity, but what did he seem to me,\nall unbuttoned and fatigued as he waited for me to come up, if he didn’t\nseem unconcerned with small things, didn’t seem in short majestic?  There\nwas majesty in his mere unconsciousness of our little conferences and\npuzzlements over his maintenance and his reward.\n\nAfter I had sat by him a few minutes I passed my arm over his big soft\nshoulder—wherever you touched him you found equally little firmness—and\nsaid in a tone of which the suppliance fell oddly on my own ear: “Come\nback to town with me, old friend—come back and spend the evening.”  I\nwanted to hold him, I wanted to keep him, and at Waterloo, an hour later,\nI telegraphed possessively to the Mulvilles.  When he objected, as\nregards staying all night, that he had no things, I asked him if he\nhadn’t everything of mine.  I had abstained from ordering dinner, and it\nwas too late for preliminaries at a club; so we were reduced to tea and\nfried fish at my rooms—reduced also to the transcendent.  Something had\ncome up which made me want him to feel at peace with me—and which,\nprecisely, was all the dear man himself wanted on any occasion.  I had\ntoo often had to press upon him considerations irrelevant, but it gives\nme pleasure now to think that on that particular evening I didn’t even\nmention Mrs. Saltram and the children.  Late into the night we smoked and\ntalked; old shames and old rigours fell away from us; I only let him see\nthat I was conscious of what I owed him.  He was as mild as contrition\nand as copious as faith; he was never so fine as on a shy return, and\neven better at forgiving than at being forgiven.  I dare say it was a\nsmaller matter than that famous night at Wimbledon, the night of the\nproblematical sobriety and of Miss Anvoy’s initiation; but I was as much\nin it on this occasion as I had been out of it then.  At about 1.30 he\nwas sublime.\n\nHe never, in whatever situation, rose till all other risings were over,\nand his breakfasts, at Wimbledon, had always been the principal reason\nmentioned by departing cooks.  The coast was therefore clear for me to\nreceive her when, early the next morning, to my surprise, it was\nannounced to me his wife had called.  I hesitated, after she had come up,\nabout telling her Saltram was in the house, but she herself settled the\nquestion, kept me reticent by drawing forth a sealed letter which,\nlooking at me very hard in the eyes, she placed, with a pregnant absence\nof comment, in my hand.  For a single moment there glimmered before me\nthe fond hope that Mrs. Saltram had tendered me, as it were, her\nresignation and desired to embody the act in an unsparing form.  To bring\nthis about I would have feigned any humiliation; but after my eyes had\ncaught the superscription I heard myself say with a flatness that\nbetrayed a sense of something very different from relief: “Oh the\nPudneys!”  I knew their envelopes though they didn’t know mine.  They\nalways used the kind sold at post-offices with the stamp affixed, and as\nthis letter hadn’t been posted they had wasted a penny on me.  I had seen\ntheir horrid missives to the Mulvilles, but hadn’t been in direct\ncorrespondence with them.\n\n“They enclosed it to me, to be delivered.  They doubtless explain to you\nthat they hadn’t your address.”\n\nI turned the thing over without opening it.  “Why in the world should\nthey write to me?”\n\n“Because they’ve something to tell you.  The worst,” Mrs. Saltram dryly\nadded.\n\nIt was another chapter, I felt, of the history of their lamentable\nquarrel with her husband, the episode in which, vindictively,\ndisingenuously as they themselves had behaved, one had to admit that he\nhad put himself more grossly in the wrong than at any moment of his life.\nHe had begun by insulting the matchless Mulvilles for these more specious\nprotectors, and then, according to his wont at the end of a few months,\nhad dug a still deeper ditch for his aberration than the chasm left\nyawning behind.  The chasm at Wimbledon was now blessedly closed; but the\nPudneys, across their persistent gulf, kept up the nastiest fire.  I\nnever doubted they had a strong case, and I had been from the first for\nnot defending him—reasoning that if they weren’t contradicted they’d\nperhaps subside.  This was above all what I wanted, and I so far\nprevailed that I did arrest the correspondence in time to save our little\ncircle an infliction heavier than it perhaps would have borne.  I knew,\nthat is I divined, that their allegations had gone as yet only as far as\ntheir courage, conscious as they were in their own virtue of an exposed\nplace in which Saltram could have planted a blow.  It was a question with\nthem whether a man who had himself so much to cover up would dare his\nblow; so that these vessels of rancour were in a manner afraid of each\nother.  I judged that on the day the Pudneys should cease for some reason\nor other to be afraid they would treat us to some revelation more\ndisconcerting than any of its predecessors.  As I held Mrs. Saltram’s\nletter in my hand it was distinctly communicated to me that the day had\ncome—they had ceased to be afraid.  “I don’t want to know the worst,” I\npresently declared.\n\n“You’ll have to open the letter.  It also contains an enclosure.”\n\nI felt it—it was fat and uncanny.  “Wheels within wheels!” I exclaimed.\n“There’s something for me too to deliver.”\n\n“So they tell me—to Miss Anvoy.”\n\nI stared; I felt a certain thrill.  “Why don’t they send it to her\ndirectly?”\n\nMrs. Saltram hung fire.  “Because she’s staying with Mr. and Mrs.\nMulville.”\n\n“And why should that prevent?”\n\nAgain my visitor faltered, and I began to reflect on the grotesque, the\nunconscious perversity of her action.  I was the only person save George\nGravener and the Mulvilles who was aware of Sir Gregory Coxon’s and of\nMiss Anvoy’s strange bounty.  Where could there have been a more signal\nillustration of the clumsiness of human affairs than her having\ncomplacently selected this moment to fly in the face of it?  “There’s the\nchance of their seeing her letters.  They know Mr. Pudney’s hand.”\n\nStill I didn’t understand; then it flashed upon me.  “You mean they might\nintercept it?  How can you imply anything so base?” I indignantly\ndemanded.\n\n“It’s not I—it’s Mr. Pudney!” cried Mrs. Saltram with a flush.  “It’s his\nown idea.”\n\n“Then why couldn’t he send the letter to you to be delivered?”\n\nMrs. Saltram’s embarrassment increased; she gave me another hard look.\n“You must make that out for yourself.”\n\nI made it out quickly enough.  “It’s a denunciation?”\n\n“A real lady doesn’t betray her husband!” this virtuous woman exclaimed.\n\nI burst out laughing, and I fear my laugh may have had an effect of\nimpertinence.  “Especially to Miss Anvoy, who’s so easily shocked? Why do\nsuch things concern _her_?” I asked, much at a loss.\n\n“Because she’s there, exposed to all his craft.  Mr. and Mrs. Pudney have\nbeen watching this: they feel she may be taken in.”\n\n“Thank you for all the rest of us!  What difference can it make when she\nhas lost her power to contribute?”\n\nAgain Mrs. Saltram considered; then very nobly: “There are other things\nin the world than money.”  This hadn’t occurred to her so long as the\nyoung lady had any; but she now added, with a glance at my letter, that\nMr. and Mrs. Pudney doubtless explained their motives.  “It’s all in\nkindness,” she continued as she got up.\n\n“Kindness to Miss Anvoy?  You took, on the whole, another view of\nkindness before her reverses.”\n\nMy companion smiled with some acidity “Perhaps you’re no safer than the\nMulvilles!”\n\nI didn’t want her to think that, nor that she should report to the\nPudneys that they had not been happy in their agent; and I well remember\nthat this was the moment at which I began, with considerable emotion, to\npromise myself to enjoin upon Miss Anvoy never to open any letter that\nshould come to her in one of those penny envelopes.  My emotion, and I\nfear I must add my confusion, quickly deepened; I presently should have\nbeen as glad to frighten Mrs. Saltram as to think I might by some\ndiplomacy restore the Pudneys to a quieter vigilance.\n\n“It’s best you should take _my_ view of my safety,” I at any rate soon\nresponded.  When I saw she didn’t know what I meant by this I added: “You\nmay turn out to have done, in bringing me this letter, a thing you’ll\nprofoundly regret.”  My tone had a significance which, I could see, did\nmake her uneasy, and there was a moment, after I had made two or three\nmore remarks of studiously bewildering effect, at which her eyes followed\nso hungrily the little flourish of the letter with which I emphasised\nthem that I instinctively slipped Mr. Pudney’s communication into my\npocket.  She looked, in her embarrassed annoyance, capable of grabbing it\nto send it back to him.  I felt, after she had gone, as if I had almost\ngiven her my word I wouldn’t deliver the enclosure.  The passionate\nmovement, at any rate, with which, in solitude, I transferred the whole\nthing, unopened, from my pocket to a drawer which I double-locked would\nhave amounted, for an initiated observer, to some such pledge.\n\n\n\n\nXII\n\n\nMRS. SALTRAM left me drawing my breath more quickly and indeed almost in\npain—as if I had just perilously grazed the loss of something precious.\nI didn’t quite know what it was—it had a shocking resemblance to my\nhonour.  The emotion was the livelier surely in that my pulses even yet\nvibrated to the pleasure with which, the night before, I had rallied to\nthe rare analyst, the great intellectual adventurer and pathfinder.  What\nhad dropped from me like a cumbersome garment as Saltram appeared before\nme in the afternoon on the heath was the disposition to haggle over his\nvalue.  Hang it, one had to choose, one had to put that value somewhere;\nso I would put it really high and have done with it.  Mrs. Mulville drove\nin for him at a discreet hour—the earliest she could suppose him to have\ngot up; and I learned that Miss Anvoy would also have come had she not\nbeen expecting a visit from Mr. Gravener.  I was perfectly mindful that I\nwas under bonds to see this young lady, and also that I had a letter to\nhand to her; but I took my time, I waited from day to day.  I left Mrs.\nSaltram to deal as her apprehensions should prompt with the Pudneys.  I\nknew at last what I meant—I had ceased to wince at my responsibility.  I\ngave this supreme impression of Saltram time to fade if it would; but it\ndidn’t fade, and, individually, it hasn’t faded even now.  During the\nmonth that I thus invited myself to stiffen again, Adelaide Mulville,\nperplexed by my absence, wrote to me to ask why I _was_ so stiff.  At\nthat season of the year I was usually oftener “with” them.  She also\nwrote that she feared a real estrangement had set in between Mr. Gravener\nand her sweet young friend—a state of things but half satisfactory to her\nso long as the advantage resulting to Mr. Saltram failed to disengage\nitself from the merely nebulous state.  She intimated that her sweet\nyoung friend was, if anything, a trifle too reserved; she also intimated\nthat there might now be an opening for another clever young man.  There\nnever was the slightest opening, I may here parenthesise, and of course\nthe question can’t come up to-day.  These are old frustrations now.  Ruth\nAnvoy hasn’t married, I hear, and neither have I.  During the month,\ntoward the end, I wrote to George Gravener to ask if, on a special\nerrand, I might come to see him, and his answer was to knock the very\nnext day at my door.  I saw he had immediately connected my enquiry with\nthe talk we had had in the railway-carriage, and his promptitude showed\nthat the ashes of his eagerness weren’t yet cold.  I told him there was\nsomething I felt I ought in candour to let him know—I recognised the\nobligation his friendly confidence had laid on me.\n\n“You mean Miss Anvoy has talked to you?  She has told me so herself,” he\nsaid.\n\n“It wasn’t to tell you so that I wanted to see you,” I replied; “for it\nseemed to me that such a communication would rest wholly with herself.\nIf however she did speak to you of our conversation she probably told you\nI was discouraging.”\n\n“Discouraging?”\n\n“On the subject of a present application of The Coxon Fund.”\n\n“To the case of Mr. Saltram?  My dear fellow, I don’t know what you call\ndiscouraging!” Gravener cried.\n\n“Well I thought I was, and I thought she thought I was.”\n\n“I believe she did, but such a thing’s measured by the effect.  She’s not\n‘discouraged,’” he said.\n\n“That’s her own affair.  The reason I asked you to see me was that it\nappeared to me I ought to tell you frankly that—decidedly!—I can’t\nundertake to produce that effect.  In fact I don’t want to!”\n\n“It’s very good of you, damn you!” my visitor laughed, red and really\ngrave.  Then he said: “You’d like to see that scoundrel publicly\nglorified—perched on the pedestal of a great complimentary pension?”\n\nI braced myself.  “Taking one form of public recognition with another it\nseems to me on the whole I should be able to bear it.  When I see the\ncompliments that _are_ paid right and left I ask myself why this one\nshouldn’t take its course.  This therefore is what you’re entitled to\nhave looked to me to mention to you.  I’ve some evidence that perhaps\nwould be really dissuasive, but I propose to invite Mss Anvoy to remain\nin ignorance of it.”\n\n“And to invite me to do the same?”\n\n“Oh you don’t require it—you’ve evidence enough.  I speak of a sealed\nletter that I’ve been requested to deliver to her.”\n\n“And you don’t mean to?”\n\n“There’s only one consideration that would make me,” I said.\n\nGravener’s clear handsome eyes plunged into mine a minute, but evidently\nwithout fishing up a clue to this motive—a failure by which I was almost\nwounded.  “What does the letter contain?”\n\n“It’s sealed, as I tell you, and I don’t know what it contains.”\n\n“Why is it sent through you?”\n\n“Rather than you?” I wondered how to put the thing.  “The only\nexplanation I can think of is that the person sending it may have\nimagined your relations with Miss Anvoy to be at an end—may have been\ntold this is the case by Mrs. Saltram.”\n\n“My relations with Miss Anvoy are not at an end,” poor Gravener\nstammered.\n\nAgain for an instant I thought.  “The offer I propose to make you gives\nme the right to address you a question remarkably direct.  Are you still\nengaged to Miss Anvoy?”\n\n“No, I’m not,” he slowly brought out.  “But we’re perfectly good\nfriends.”\n\n“Such good friends that you’ll again become prospective husband and wife\nif the obstacle in your path be removed?”\n\n“Removed?” he anxiously repeated.\n\n“If I send Miss Anvoy the letter I speak of she may give up her idea.”\n\n“Then for God’s sake send it!”\n\n“I’ll do so if you’re ready to assure me that her sacrifice would now\npresumably bring about your marriage.”\n\n“I’d marry her the next day!” my visitor cried.\n\n“Yes, but would she marry _you_?  What I ask of you of course is nothing\nless than your word of honour as to your conviction of this.  If you give\nit me,” I said, “I’ll engage to hand her the letter before night.”\n\nGravener took up his hat; turning it mechanically round he stood looking\na moment hard at its unruffled perfection.  Then very angrily honestly\nand gallantly, “Hand it to the devil!” he broke out; with which he\nclapped the hat on his head and left me.\n\n“Will you read it or not?” I said to Ruth Anvoy, at Wimbledon, when I had\ntold her the story of Mrs. Saltram’s visit.\n\nShe debated for a time probably of the briefest, but long enough to make\nme nervous.  “Have you brought it with you?”\n\n“No indeed.  It’s at home, locked up.”\n\nThere was another great silence, and then she said “Go back and destroy\nit.”\n\nI went back, but I didn’t destroy it till after Saltram’s death, when I\nburnt it unread.  The Pudneys approached her again pressingly, but,\nprompt as they were, The Coxon Fund had already become an operative\nbenefit and a general amaze: Mr. Saltram, while we gathered about, as it\nwere, to watch the manna descend, had begun to draw the magnificent\nincome.  He drew it as he had always drawn everything, with a grand\nabstracted gesture.  Its magnificence, alas, as all the world now knows,\nquite quenched him; it was the beginning of his decline.  It was also\nnaturally a new grievance for his wife, who began to believe in him as\nsoon as he was blighted, and who at this hour accuses us of having bribed\nhim, on the whim of a meddlesome American, to renounce his glorious\noffice, to become, as she says, like everybody else.  The very day he\nfound himself able to publish he wholly ceased to produce.  This deprived\nus, as may easily be imagined, of much of our occupation, and especially\ndeprived the Mulvilles, whose want of self-support I never measured till\nthey lost their great inmate.  They’ve no one to live on now.  Adelaide’s\nmost frequent reference to their destitution is embodied in the remark\nthat dear far-away Ruth’s intentions were doubtless good.  She and Kent\nare even yet looking for another prop, but no one presents a true sphere\nof usefulness.  They complain that people are self-sufficing.  With\nSaltram the fine type of the child of adoption was scattered, the\ngrander, the elder style.  They’ve got their carriage back, but what’s an\nempty carriage?  In short I think we were all happier as well as poorer\nbefore; even including George Gravener, who by the deaths of his brother\nand his nephew has lately become Lord Maddock.  His wife, whose fortune\nclears the property, is criminally dull; he hates being in the Upper\nHouse, and hasn’t yet had high office.  But what are these accidents,\nwhich I should perhaps apologise for mentioning, in the light of the\ngreat eventual boon promised the patient by the rate at which The Coxon\nFund must be rolling up?", "answers": ["He is a guest in the home of the Mulvilles."], "length": 22692, "dataset": "narrativeqa", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "341d214a2c377691bf20e5a30b8f7979696bd19141ad9c9f"}

Johnson, St. Paul's Church-Yard.\n\nMDCCLXXXVIII\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nADVERTISEMENT.\n\n\nIn delineating the Heroine of this Fiction, the Author attempts to\ndevelop a character different from those generally portrayed. This woman\nis neither a Clarissa, a Lady G----, nor a[A] Sophie.--It would be vain\nto mention the various modifications of these models, as it would to\nremark, how widely artists wander from nature, when they copy the\noriginals of great masters. They catch the gross parts; but the subtile\nspirit evaporates; and not having the just ties, affectation disgusts,\nwhen grace was expected to charm.\n\nThose compositions only have power to delight, and carry us willing\ncaptives, where the soul of the author is exhibited, and animates the\nhidden springs. Lost in a pleasing enthusiasm, they live in the scenes\nthey represent; and do not measure their steps in a beaten track,\nsolicitous to gather expected flowers, and bind them in a wreath,\naccording to the prescribed rules of art.\n\nThese chosen few, wish to speak for themselves, and not to be an\necho--even of the sweetest sounds--or the reflector of the most sublime\nbeams. The[B] paradise they ramble in, must be of their own creating--or\nthe prospect soon grows insipid, and not varied by a vivifying\nprinciple, fades and dies.\n\nIn an artless tale, without episodes, the mind of a woman, who has\nthinking powers is displayed. The female organs have been thought too\nweak for this arduous employment; and experience seems to justify the\nassertion. Without arguing physically about _possibilities_--in a\nfiction, such a being may be allowed to exist; whose grandeur is derived\nfrom the operations of its own faculties, not subjugated to opinion; but\ndrawn by the individual from the original source.\n\nFOOTNOTES:\n\n[Footnote A: Rousseau.]\n\n[Footnote B: I here give the Reviewers an opportunity of being very\nwitty about the Paradise of Fools, &c.]\n\n\n\n\nMARY\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. I.\n\n\nMary, the heroine of this fiction, was the daughter of Edward, who\nmarried Eliza, a gentle, fashionable girl, with a kind of indolence in\nher temper, which might be termed negative good-nature: her virtues,\nindeed, were all of that stamp. She carefully attended to the _shews_ of\nthings, and her opinions, I should have said prejudices, were such as\nthe generality approved of. She was educated with the expectation of a\nlarge fortune, of course became a mere machine: the homage of her\nattendants made a great part of her puerile amusements, and she never\nimagined there were any relative duties for her to fulfil: notions of\nher own consequence, by these means, were interwoven in her mind, and\nthe years of youth spent in acquiring a few superficial accomplishments,\nwithout having any taste for them. When she was first introduced into\nthe polite circle, she danced with an officer, whom she faintly wished\nto be united to; but her father soon after recommending another in a\nmore distinguished rank of life, she readily submitted to his will, and\npromised to love, honour, and obey, (a vicious fool,) as in duty bound.\n\nWhile they resided in London, they lived in the usual fashionable style,\nand seldom saw each other; nor were they much more sociable when they\nwooed rural felicity for more than half the year, in a delightful\ncountry, where Nature, with lavish hand, had scattered beauties around;\nfor the master, with brute, unconscious gaze, passed them by unobserved,\nand sought amusement in country sports. He hunted in the morning, and\nafter eating an immoderate dinner, generally fell asleep: this\nseasonable rest enabled him to digest the cumbrous load; he would then\nvisit some of his pretty tenants; and when he compared their ruddy glow\nof health with his wife's countenance, which even rouge could not\nenliven, it is not necessary to say which a _gourmand_ would give the\npreference to. Their vulgar dance of spirits were infinitely more\nagreeable to his fancy than her sickly, die-away languor. Her voice was\nbut the shadow of a sound, and she had, to complete her delicacy, so\nrelaxed her nerves, that she became a mere nothing.\n\nMany such noughts are there in the female world! yet she had a good\nopinion of her own merit,--truly, she said long prayers,--and sometimes\nread her Week's Preparation: she dreaded that horrid place vulgarly\ncalled _hell_, the regions below; but whether her's was a mounting\nspirit, I cannot pretend to determine; or what sort of a planet would\nhave been proper for her, when she left her _material_ part in this\nworld, let metaphysicians settle; I have nothing to say to her unclothed\nspirit.\n\nAs she was sometimes obliged to be alone, or only with her French\nwaiting-maid, she sent to the metropolis for all the new publications,\nand while she was dressing her hair, and she could turn her eyes from\nthe glass, she ran over those most delightful substitutes for bodily\ndissipation, novels. I say bodily, or the animal soul, for a rational\none can find no employment in polite circles. The glare of lights, the\nstudied inelegancies of dress, and the compliments offered up at the\nshrine of false beauty, are all equally addressed to the senses.\n\nWhen she could not any longer indulge the caprices of fancy one way, she\ntried another. The Platonic Marriage, Eliza Warwick, and some other\ninteresting tales were perused with eagerness. Nothing could be more\nnatural than the developement of the passions, nor more striking than\nthe views of the human heart. What delicate struggles! and uncommonly\npretty turns of thought! The picture that was found on a bramble-bush,\nthe new sensitive-plant, or tree, which caught the swain by the\nupper-garment, and presented to his ravished eyes a portrait.--Fatal\nimage!--It planted a thorn in a till then insensible heart, and sent a\nnew kind of a knight-errant into the world. But even this was nothing to\nthe catastrophe, and the circumstance on which it hung, the hornet\nsettling on the sleeping lover's face. What a _heart-rending_ accident!\nShe planted, in imitation of those susceptible souls, a rose bush; but\nthere was not a lover to weep in concert with her, when she watered it\nwith her tears.--Alas! Alas!\n\nIf my readers would excuse the sportiveness of fancy, and give me credit\nfor genius, I would go on and tell them such tales as would force the\nsweet tears of sensibility to flow in copious showers down beautiful\ncheeks, to the discomposure of rouge, &c. &c. Nay, I would make it so\ninteresting, that the fair peruser should beg the hair-dresser to\nsettle the curls himself, and not interrupt her.\n\nShe had besides another resource, two most beautiful dogs, who shared\nher bed, and reclined on cushions near her all the day. These she\nwatched with the most assiduous care, and bestowed on them the warmest\ncaresses. This fondness for animals was not that kind of\n_attendrissement_ which makes a person take pleasure in providing for\nthe subsistence and comfort of a living creature; but it proceeded from\nvanity, it gave her an opportunity of lisping out the prettiest French\nexpressions of ecstatic fondness, in accents that had never been attuned\nby tenderness.\n\nShe was chaste, according to the vulgar acceptation of the word, that\nis, she did not make any actual _faux pas_; she feared the world, and\nwas indolent; but then, to make amends for this seeming self-denial, she\nread all the sentimental novels, dwelt on the love-scenes, and, had she\nthought while she read, her mind would have been contaminated; as she\naccompanied the lovers to the lonely arbors, and would walk with them by\nthe clear light of the moon. She wondered her husband did not stay at\nhome. She was jealous--why did he not love her, sit by her side, squeeze\nher hand, and look unutterable things? Gentle reader, I will tell thee;\nthey neither of them felt what they could not utter. I will not pretend\nto say that they always annexed an idea to a word; but they had none of\nthose feelings which are not easily analyzed.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. II.\n\n\nIn due time she brought forth a son, a feeble babe; and the following\nyear a daughter. After the mother's throes she felt very few sentiments\nof maternal tenderness: the children were given to nurses, and she\nplayed with her dogs. Want of exercise prevented the least chance of her\nrecovering strength; and two or three milk-fevers brought on a\nconsumption, to which her constitution tended. Her children all died in\ntheir infancy, except the two first, and she began to grow fond of the\nson, as he was remarkably handsome. For years she divided her time\nbetween the sofa, and the card-table. She thought not of death, though\non the borders of the grave; nor did any of the duties of her station\noccur to her as necessary. Her children were left in the nursery; and\nwhen Mary, the little blushing girl, appeared, she would send the\nawkward thing away. To own the truth, she was awkward enough, in a house\nwithout any play-mates; for her brother had been sent to school, and she\nscarcely knew how to employ herself; she would ramble about the garden,\nadmire the flowers, and play with the dogs. An old house-keeper told her\nstories, read to her, and, at last, taught her to read. Her mother\ntalked of enquiring for a governess when her health would permit; and,\nin the interim desired her own maid to teach her French. As she had\nlearned to read, she perused with avidity every book that came in her\nway. Neglected in every respect, and left to the operations of her own\nmind, she considered every thing that came under her inspection, and\nlearned to think. She had heard of a separate state, and that angels\nsometimes visited this earth. She would sit in a thick wood in the park,\nand talk to them; make little songs addressed to them, and sing them to\ntunes of her own composing; and her native wood notes wild were sweet\nand touching.\n\nHer father always exclaimed against female acquirements, and was glad\nthat his wife's indolence and ill health made her not trouble herself\nabout them. She had besides another reason, she did not wish to have a\nfine tall girl brought forward into notice as her daughter; she still\nexpected to recover, and figure away in the gay world. Her husband was\nvery tyrannical and passionate; indeed so very easily irritated when\ninebriated, that Mary was continually in dread lest he should frighten\nher mother to death; her sickness called forth all Mary's tenderness,\nand exercised her compassion so continually, that it became more than a\nmatch for self-love, and was the governing propensity of her heart\nthrough life. She was violent in her temper; but she saw her father's\nfaults, and would weep when obliged to compare his temper with her\nown.--She did more; artless prayers rose to Heaven for pardon, when she\nwas conscious of having erred; and her contrition was so exceedingly\npainful, that she watched diligently the first movements of anger and\nimpatience, to save herself this cruel remorse.\n\nSublime ideas filled her young mind--always connected with devotional\nsentiments; extemporary effusions of gratitude, and rhapsodies of\npraise would burst often from her, when she listened to the birds, or\npursued the deer. She would gaze on the moon, and ramble through the\ngloomy path, observing the various shapes the clouds assumed, and listen\nto the sea that was not far distant. The wandering spirits, which she\nimagined inhabited every part of nature, were her constant friends and\nconfidants. She began to consider the Great First Cause, formed just\nnotions of his attributes, and, in particular, dwelt on his wisdom and\ngoodness. Could she have loved her father or mother, had they returned\nher affection, she would not so soon, perhaps, have sought out a new\nworld.\n\nHer sensibility prompted her to search for an object to love; on earth\nit was not to be found: her mother had often disappointed her, and the\napparent partiality she shewed to her brother gave her exquisite\npain--produced a kind of habitual melancholy, led her into a fondness\nfor reading tales of woe, and made her almost realize the fictitious\ndistress.\n\nShe had not any notion of death till a little chicken expired at her\nfeet; and her father had a dog hung in a passion. She then concluded\nanimals had souls, or they would not have been subjected to the caprice\nof man; but what was the soul of man or beast? In this style year after\nyear rolled on, her mother still vegetating.\n\nA little girl who attended in the nursery fell sick. Mary paid her great\nattention; contrary to her wish, she was sent out of the house to her\nmother, a poor woman, whom necessity obliged to leave her sick child\nwhile she earned her daily bread. The poor wretch, in a fit of delirium\nstabbed herself, and Mary saw her dead body, and heard the dismal\naccount; and so strongly did it impress her imagination, that every\nnight of her life the bleeding corpse presented itself to her when the\nfirst began to slumber. Tortured by it, she at last made a vow, that if\nshe was ever mistress of a family she would herself watch over every\npart of it. The impression that this accident made was indelible.\n\nAs her mother grew imperceptibly worse and worse, her father, who did\nnot understand such a lingering complaint, imagined his wife was only\ngrown still more whimsical, and that if she could be prevailed on to\nexert herself, her health would soon be re-established. In general he\ntreated her with indifference; but when her illness at all interfered\nwith his pleasures, he expostulated in the most cruel manner, and\nvisibly harassed the invalid. Mary would then assiduously try to turn\nhis attention to something else; and when sent out of the room, would\nwatch at the door, until the storm was over, for unless it was, she\ncould not rest. Other causes also contributed to disturb her repose: her\nmother's luke-warm manner of performing her religious duties, filled her\nwith anguish; and when she observed her father's vices, the unbidden\ntears would flow. She was miserable when beggars were driven from the\ngate without being relieved; if she could do it unperceived, she would\ngive them her own breakfast, and feel gratified, when, in consequence of\nit, she was pinched by hunger.\n\nShe had once, or twice, told her little secrets to her mother; they were\nlaughed at, and she determined never to do it again. In this manner was\nshe left to reflect on her own feelings; and so strengthened were they\nby being meditated on, that her character early became singular and\npermanent. Her understanding was strong and clear, when not clouded by\nher feelings; but she was too much the creature of impulse, and the\nslave of compassion.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. III.\n\n\nNear her father's house lived a poor widow, who had been brought up in\naffluence, but reduced to great distress by the extravagance of her\nhusband; he had destroyed his constitution while he spent his fortune;\nand dying, left his wife, and five small children, to live on a very\nscanty pittance. The eldest daughter was for some years educated by a\ndistant relation, a Clergyman. While she was with him a young gentleman,\nson to a man of property in the neighbourhood, took particular notice of\nher. It is true, he never talked of love; but then they played and sung\nin concert; drew landscapes together, and while she worked he read to\nher, cultivated her taste, and stole imperceptibly her heart. Just at\nthis juncture, when smiling, unanalyzed hope made every prospect bright,\nand gay expectation danced in her eyes, her benefactor died. She\nreturned to her mother--the companion of her youth forgot her, they took\nno more sweet counsel together. This disappointment spread a sadness\nover her countenance, and made it interesting. She grew fond of\nsolitude, and her character appeared similar to Mary's, though her\nnatural disposition was very different.\n\nShe was several years older than Mary, yet her refinement, her taste,\ncaught her eye, and she eagerly sought her friendship: before her return\nshe had assisted the family, which was almost reduced to the last ebb;\nand now she had another motive to actuate her.\n\nAs she had often occasion to send messages to Ann, her new friend,\nmistakes were frequently made; Ann proposed that in future they should\nbe written ones, to obviate this difficulty, and render their\nintercourse more agreeable. Young people are mostly fond of scribbling;\nMary had had very little instruction; but by copying her friend's\nletters, whose hand she admired, she soon became a proficient; a little\npractice made her write with tolerable correctness, and her genius gave\nforce to it. In conversation, and in writing, when she felt, she was\npathetic, tender and persuasive; and she expressed contempt with such\nenergy, that few could stand the flash of her eyes.\n\nAs she grew more intimate with Ann, her manners were softened, and she\nacquired a degree of equality in her behaviour: yet still her spirits\nwere fluctuating, and her movements rapid. She felt less pain on\naccount of her mother's partiality to her brother, as she hoped now to\nexperience the pleasure of being beloved; but this hope led her into new\nsorrows, and, as usual, paved the way for disappointment. Ann only felt\ngratitude; her heart was entirely engrossed by one object, and\nfriendship could not serve as a substitute; memory officiously retraced\npast scenes, and unavailing wishes made time loiter.\n\nMary was often hurt by the involuntary indifference which these\nconsequences produced. When her friend was all the world to her, she\nfound she was not as necessary to her happiness; and her delicate mind\ncould not bear to obtrude her affection, or receive love as an alms, the\noffspring of pity. Very frequently has she ran to her with delight, and\nnot perceiving any thing of the same kind in Ann's countenance, she has\nshrunk back; and, falling from one extreme into the other, instead of a\nwarm greeting that was just slipping from her tongue, her expressions\nseemed to be dictated by the most chilling insensibility.\n\nShe would then imagine that she looked sickly or unhappy, and then all\nher tenderness would return like a torrent, and bear away all\nreflection. In this manner was her sensibility called forth, and\nexercised, by her mother's illness, her friend's misfortunes, and her\nown unsettled mind.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. IV.\n\n\nNear to her father's house was a range of mountains; some of them were,\nliterally speaking, cloud-capt, for on them clouds continually rested,\nand gave grandeur to the prospect; and down many of their sides the\nlittle bubbling cascades ran till they swelled a beautiful river.\nThrough the straggling trees and bushes the wind whistled, and on them\nthe birds sung, particularly the robins; they also found shelter in the\nivy of an old castle, a haunted one, as the story went; it was situated\non the brow of one of the mountains, and commanded a view of the sea.\nThis castle had been inhabited by some of her ancestors; and many tales\nhad the old house-keeper told her of the worthies who had resided there.\n\nWhen her mother frowned, and her friend looked cool, she would steal to\nthis retirement, where human foot seldom trod--gaze on the sea, observe\nthe grey clouds, or listen to the wind which struggled to free itself\nfrom the only thing that impeded its course. When more cheerful, she\nadmired the various dispositions of light and shade, the beautiful tints\nthe gleams of sunshine gave to the distant hills; then she rejoiced in\nexistence, and darted into futurity.\n\nOne way home was through the cavity of a rock covered with a thin layer\nof earth, just sufficient to afford nourishment to a few stunted shrubs\nand wild plants, which grew on its sides, and nodded over the summit. A\nclear stream broke out of it, and ran amongst the pieces of rocks\nfallen into it. Here twilight always reigned--it seemed the Temple of\nSolitude; yet, paradoxical as the assertion may appear, when the foot\nsounded on the rock, it terrified the intruder, and inspired a strange\nfeeling, as if the rightful sovereign was dislodged. In this retreat she\nread Thomson's Seasons, Young's Night-Thoughts, and Paradise Lost.\n\nAt a little distance from it were the huts of a few poor fishermen, who\nsupported their numerous children by their precarious labour. In these\nlittle huts she frequently rested, and denied herself every childish\ngratification, in order to relieve the necessities of the inhabitants.\nHer heart yearned for them, and would dance with joy when she had\nrelieved their wants, or afforded them pleasure.\n\nIn these pursuits she learned the luxury of doing good; and the sweet\ntears of benevolence frequently moistened her eyes, and gave them a\nsparkle which, exclusive of that, they had not; on the contrary, they\nwere rather fixed, and would never have been observed if her soul had\nnot animated them. They were not at all like those brilliant ones which\nlook like polished diamonds, and dart from every superfice, giving more\nlight to the beholders than they receive themselves.\n\nHer benevolence, indeed, knew no bounds; the distress of others carried\nher out of herself; and she rested not till she had relieved or\ncomforted them. The warmth of her compassion often made her so diligent,\nthat many things occurred to her, which might have escaped a less\ninterested observer.\n\nIn like manner, she entered with such spirit into whatever she read,\nand the emotions thereby raised were so strong, that it soon became a\npart of her mind.\n\nEnthusiastic sentiments of devotion at this period actuated her; her\nCreator was almost apparent to her senses in his works; but they were\nmostly the grand or solemn features of Nature which she delighted to\ncontemplate. She would stand and behold the waves rolling, and think of\nthe voice that could still the tumultuous deep.\n\nThese propensities gave the colour to her mind, before the passions\nbegan to exercise their tyrannic sway, and particularly pointed out\nthose which the soil would have a tendency to nurse.\n\nYears after, when wandering through the same scenes, her imagination has\nstrayed back, to trace the first placid sentiments they inspired, and\nshe would earnestly desire to regain the same peaceful tranquillity.\n\nMany nights she sat up, if I may be allowed the expression, _conversing_\nwith the Author of Nature, making verses, and singing hymns of her own\ncomposing. She considered also, and tried to discern what end her\nvarious faculties were destined to pursue; and had a glimpse of a truth,\nwhich afterwards more fully unfolded itself.\n\nShe thought that only an infinite being could fill the human soul, and\nthat when other objects were followed as a means of happiness, the\ndelusion led to misery, the consequence of disappointment. Under the\ninfluence of ardent affections, how often has she forgot this\nconviction, and as often returned to it again, when it struck her with\nredoubled force. Often did she taste unmixed delight; her joys, her\necstacies arose from genius.\n\nShe was now fifteen, and she wished to receive the holy sacrament; and\nperusing the scriptures, and discussing some points of doctrine which\npuzzled her, she would sit up half the night, her favourite time for\nemploying her mind; she too plainly perceived that she saw through a\nglass darkly; and that the bounds set to stop our intellectual\nresearches, is one of the trials of a probationary state.\n\nBut her affections were roused by the display of divine mercy; and she\neagerly desired to commemorate the dying love of her great benefactor.\nThe night before the important day, when she was to take on herself her\nbaptismal vow, she could not go to bed; the sun broke in on her\nmeditations, and found her not exhausted by her watching.\n\nThe orient pearls were strewed around--she hailed the morn, and sung\nwith wild delight, Glory to God on high, good will towards men. She was\nindeed so much affected when she joined in the prayer for her eternal\npreservation, that she could hardly conceal her violent emotions; and\nthe recollection never failed to wake her dormant piety when earthly\npassions made it grow languid.\n\nThese various movements of her mind were not commented on, nor were the\nluxuriant shoots restrained by culture. The servants and the poor adored\nher.\n\nIn order to be enabled to gratify herself in the highest degree, she\npracticed the most rigid oeconomy, and had such power over her\nappetites and whims, that without any great effort she conquered them\nso entirely, that when her understanding or affections had an object,\nshe almost forgot she had a body which required nourishment.\n\nThis habit of thinking, this kind of absorption, gave strength to the\npassions.\n\nWe will now enter on the more active field of life.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. V.\n\n\nA few months after Mary was turned of seventeen, her brother was\nattacked by a violent fever, and died before his father could reach the\nschool.\n\nShe was now an heiress, and her mother began to think her of\nconsequence, and did not call her _the child_. Proper masters were sent\nfor; she was taught to dance, and an extraordinary master procured to\nperfect her in that most necessary of all accomplishments.\n\nA part of the estate she was to inherit had been litigated, and the heir\nof the person who still carried on a Chancery suit, was only two years\nyounger than our heroine. The fathers, spite of the dispute, frequently\nmet, and, in order to settle it amicably, they one day, over a bottle,\ndetermined to quash it by a marriage, and, by uniting the two estates,\nto preclude all farther enquiries into the merits of their different\nclaims.\n\nWhile this important matter was settling, Mary was otherwise employed.\nAnn's mother's resources were failing; and the ghastly phantom, poverty,\nmade hasty strides to catch them in his clutches. Ann had not fortitude\nenough to brave such accumulated misery; besides, the canker-worm was\nlodged in her heart, and preyed on her health. She denied herself every\nlittle comfort; things that would be no sacrifice when a person is well,\nare absolutely necessary to alleviate bodily pain, and support the\nanimal functions.\n\nThere were many elegant amusements, that she had acquired a relish for,\nwhich might have taken her mind off from its most destructive bent; but\nthese her indigence would not allow her to enjoy: forced then, by way of\nrelaxation, to play the tunes her lover admired, and handle the pencil\nhe taught her to hold, no wonder his image floated on her imagination,\nand that taste invigorated love.\n\nPoverty, and all its inelegant attendants, were in her mother's abode;\nand she, though a good sort of a woman, was not calculated to banish, by\nher trivial, uninteresting chat, the delirium in which her daughter was\nlost.\n\nThis ill-fated love had given a bewitching softness to her manners, a\ndelicacy so truly feminine, that a man of any feeling could not behold\nher without wishing to chase her sorrows away. She was timid and\nirresolute, and rather fond of dissipation; grief only had power to make\nher reflect.\n\nIn every thing it was not the great, but the beautiful, or the pretty,\nthat caught her attention. And in composition, the polish of style, and\nharmony of numbers, interested her much more than the flights of genius,\nor abstracted speculations.\n\nShe often wondered at the books Mary chose, who, though she had a lively\nimagination, would frequently study authors whose works were addressed\nto the understanding. This liking taught her to arrange her thoughts,\nand argue with herself, even when under the influence of the most\nviolent passions.\n\nAnn's misfortunes and ill health were strong ties to bind Mary to her;\nshe wished so continually to have a home to receive her in, that it\ndrove every other desire out of her mind; and, dwelling on the tender\nschemes which compassion and friendship dictated, she longed most\nardently to put them in practice.\n\nFondly as she loved her friend, she did not forget her mother, whose\ndecline was so imperceptible, that they were not aware of her\napproaching dissolution. The physician, however, observing the most\nalarming symptoms; her husband was apprised of her immediate danger; and\nthen first mentioned to her his designs with respect to his daughter.\n\nShe approved of them; Mary was sent for; she was not at home; she had\nrambled to visit Ann, and found her in an hysteric fit. The landlord of\nher little farm had sent his agent for the rent, which had long been due\nto him; and he threatened to seize the stock that still remained, and\nturn them out, if they did not very shortly discharge the arrears.\n\nAs this man made a private fortune by harassing the tenants of the\nperson to whom he was deputy, little was to be expected from his\nforbearance.\n\nAll this was told to Mary--and the mother added, she had many other\ncreditors who would, in all probability, take the alarm, and snatch from\nthem all that had been saved out of the wreck. \"I could bear all,\" she\ncried; \"but what will become of my children? Of this child,\" pointing to\nthe fainting Ann, \"whose constitution is already undermined by care and\ngrief--where will she go?\"--Mary's heart ceased to beat while she asked\nthe question--She attempted to speak; but the inarticulate sounds died\naway. Before she had recovered herself, her father called himself to\nenquire for her; and desired her instantly to accompany him home.\n\nEngrossed by the scene of misery she had been witness to, she walked\nsilently by his side, when he roused her out of her reverie by telling\nher that in all likelihood her mother had not many hours to live; and\nbefore she could return him any answer, informed her that they had both\ndetermined to marry her to Charles, his friend's son; he added, the\nceremony was to be performed directly, that her mother might be witness\nof it; for such a desire she had expressed with childish eagerness.\n\nOverwhelmed by this intelligence, Mary rolled her eyes about, then, with\na vacant stare, fixed them on her father's face; but they were no longer\na sense; they conveyed no ideas to the brain. As she drew near the\nhouse, her wonted presence of mind returned: after this suspension of\nthought, a thousand darted into her mind,--her dying mother,--her\nfriend's miserable situation,--and an extreme horror at taking--at being\nforced to take, such a hasty step; but she did not feel the disgust, the\nreluctance, which arises from a prior attachment.\n\nShe loved Ann better than any one in the world--to snatch her from the\nvery jaws of destruction--she would have encountered a lion. To have\nthis friend constantly with her; to make her mind easy with respect to\nher family, would it not be superlative bliss?\n\nFull of these thoughts she entered her mother's chamber, but they then\nfled at the sight of a dying parent. She went to her, took her hand; it\nfeebly pressed her's. \"My child,\" said the languid mother: the words\nreached her heart; she had seldom heard them pronounced with accents\ndenoting affection; \"My child, I have not always treated you with\nkindness--God forgive me! do you?\"--Mary's tears strayed in a\ndisregarded stream; on her bosom the big drops fell, but did not relieve\nthe fluttering tenant. \"I forgive you!\" said she, in a tone of\nastonishment.\n\nThe clergyman came in to read the service for the sick, and afterwards\nthe marriage ceremony was performed. Mary stood like a statue of\nDespair, and pronounced the awful vow without thinking of it; and then\nran to support her mother, who expired the same night in her arms.\n\nHer husband set off for the continent the same day, with a tutor, to\nfinish his studies at one of the foreign universities.\n\nAnn was sent for to console her, not on account of the departure of her\nnew relation, a boy she seldom took any notice of, but to reconcile her\nto her fate; besides, it was necessary she should have a female\ncompanion, and there was not any maiden aunt in the family, or cousin of\nthe same class.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. VI.\n\n\nMary was allowed to pay the rent which gave her so much uneasiness, and\nshe exerted every nerve to prevail on her father effectually to succour\nthe family; but the utmost she could obtain was a small sum very\ninadequate to the purpose, to enable the poor woman to carry into\nexecution a little scheme of industry near the metropolis.\n\nHer intention of leaving that part of the country, had much more weight\nwith him, than Mary's arguments, drawn from motives of philanthropy and\nfriendship; this was a language he did not understand; expressive of\noccult qualities he never thought of, as they could not be seen or\nfelt.\n\nAfter the departure of her mother, Ann still continued to languish,\nthough she had a nurse who was entirely engrossed by the desire of\namusing her. Had her health been re-established, the time would have\npassed in a tranquil, improving manner.\n\nDuring the year of mourning they lived in retirement; music, drawing,\nand reading, filled up the time; and Mary's taste and judgment were both\nimproved by contracting a habit of observation, and permitting the\nsimple beauties of Nature to occupy her thoughts.\n\nShe had a wonderful quickness in discerning distinctions and combining\nideas, that at the first glance did not appear to be similar. But these\nvarious pursuits did not banish all her cares, or carry off all her\nconstitutional black bile. Before she enjoyed Ann's society, she\nimagined it would have made her completely happy: she was disappointed,\nand yet knew not what to complain of.\n\nAs her friend could not accompany her in her walks, and wished to be\nalone, for a very obvious reason, she would return to her old haunts,\nretrace her anticipated pleasures--and wonder how they changed their\ncolour in possession, and proved so futile.\n\nShe had not yet found the companion she looked for. Ann and she were not\ncongenial minds, nor did she contribute to her comfort in the degree she\nexpected. She shielded her from poverty; but this was only a negative\nblessing; when under the pressure it was very grievous, and still more\nso were the apprehensions; but when exempt from them, she was not\ncontented.\n\nSuch is human nature, its laws were not to be inverted to gratify our\nheroine, and stop the progress of her understanding, happiness only\nflourished in paradise--we cannot taste and live.\n\nAnother year passed away with increasing apprehensions. Ann had a hectic\ncough, and many unfavourable prognostics: Mary then forgot every thing\nbut the fear of losing her, and even imagined that her recovery would\nhave made her happy.\n\nHer anxiety led her to study physic, and for some time she only read\nbooks of that cast; and this knowledge, literally speaking, ended in\nvanity and vexation of spirit, as it enabled her to foresee what she\ncould not prevent.\n\nAs her mind expanded, her marriage appeared a dreadful misfortune; she\nwas sometimes reminded of the heavy yoke, and bitter was the\nrecollection!\n\nIn one thing there seemed to be a sympathy between them, for she wrote\nformal answers to his as formal letters. An extreme dislike took root in\nher mind; the found of his name made her turn sick; but she forgot all,\nlistening to Ann's cough, and supporting her languid frame. She would\nthen catch her to her bosom with convulsive eagerness, as if to save her\nfrom sinking into an opening grave.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. VII.\n\n\nIt was the will of Providence that Mary should experience almost every\nspecies of sorrow. Her father was thrown from his horse, when his blood\nwas in a very inflammatory state, and the bruises were very dangerous;\nhis recovery was not expected by the physical tribe.\n\nTerrified at seeing him so near death, and yet so ill prepared for it,\nhis daughter sat by his bed, oppressed by the keenest anguish, which her\npiety increased.\n\nHer grief had nothing selfish in it; he was not a friend or protector;\nbut he was her father, an unhappy wretch, going into eternity, depraved\nand thoughtless. Could a life of sensuality be a preparation for a\npeaceful death? Thus meditating, she passed the still midnight hour by\nhis bedside.\n\nThe nurse fell asleep, nor did a violent thunder storm interrupt her\nrepose, though it made the night appear still more terrific to Mary. Her\nfather's unequal breathing alarmed her, when she heard a long drawn\nbreath, she feared it was his last, and watching for another, a dreadful\npeal of thunder struck her ears. Considering the separation of the soul\nand body, this night seemed sadly solemn, and the hours long.\n\nDeath is indeed a king of terrors when he attacks the vicious man! The\ncompassionate heart finds not any comfort; but dreads an eternal\nseparation. No transporting greetings are anticipated, when the\nsurvivors also shall have finished their course; but all is black!--the\ngrave may truly be said to receive the departed--this is the sting of\ndeath!\n\nNight after night Mary watched, and this excessive fatigue impaired her\nown health, but had a worse effect on Ann; though she constantly went to\nbed, she could not rest; a number of uneasy thoughts obtruded\nthemselves; and apprehensions about Mary, whom she loved as well as her\nexhausted heart could love, harassed her mind. After a sleepless,\nfeverish night she had a violent fit of coughing, and burst a\nblood-vessel. The physician, who was in the house, was sent for, and\nwhen he left the patient, Mary, with an authoritative voice, insisted on\nknowing his real opinion. Reluctantly he gave it, that her friend was in\na critical state; and if she passed the approaching winter in England,\nhe imagined she would die in the spring; a season fatal to consumptive\ndisorders. The spring!--Her husband was then expected.--Gracious Heaven,\ncould she bear all this.\n\nIn a few days her father breathed his last. The horrid sensations his\ndeath occasioned were too poignant to be durable: and Ann's danger, and\nher own situation, made Mary deliberate what mode of conduct she should\npursue. She feared this event might hasten the return of her husband,\nand prevent her putting into execution a plan she had determined on. It\nwas to accompany Ann to a more salubrious climate.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. VIII.\n\n\nI mentioned before, that Mary had never had any particular attachment,\nto give rise to the disgust that daily gained ground. Her friendship for\nAnn occupied her heart, and resembled a passion. She had had, indeed,\nseveral transient likings; but they did not amount to love. The society\nof men of genius delighted her, and improved her faculties. With beings\nof this class she did not often meet; it is a rare genus; her first\nfavourites were men past the meridian of life, and of a philosophic\nturn.\n\nDetermined on going to the South of France, or Lisbon; she wrote to the\nman she had promised to obey. The physicians had said change of air was\nnecessary for her as well as her friend. She mentioned this, and added,\n\"Her comfort, almost her existence, depended on the recovery of the\ninvalid she wished to attend; and that should she neglect to follow the\nmedical advice she had received, she should never forgive herself, or\nthose who endeavoured to prevent her.\" Full of her design, she wrote\nwith more than usual freedom; and this letter was like most of her\nothers, a transcript of her heart.\n\n\"This dear friend,\" she exclaimed, \"I love for her agreeable qualities,\nand substantial virtues. Continual attention to her health, and the\ntender office of a nurse, have created an affection very like a maternal\none--I am her only support, she leans on me--could I forsake the\nforsaken, and break the bruised reed--No--I would die first! I must--I\nwill go.\"\n\nShe would have added, \"you would very much oblige me by consenting;\" but\nher heart revolted--and irresolutely she wrote something about wishing\nhim happy.--\"Do I not wish all the world well?\" she cried, as she\nsubscribed her name--It was blotted, the letter sealed in a hurry, and\nsent out of her sight; and she began to prepare for her journey.\n\nBy the return of the post she received an answer; it contained some\ncommon-place remarks on her romantic friendship, as he termed it; \"But\nas the physicians advised change of air, he had no objection.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. IX.\n\n\nThere was nothing now to retard their journey; and Mary chose Lisbon\nrather than France, on account of its being further removed from the\nonly person she wished not to see.\n\nThey set off accordingly for Falmouth, in their way to that city. The\njourney was of use to Ann, and Mary's spirits were raised by her\nrecovered looks--She had been in despair--now she gave way to hope, and\nwas intoxicated with it. On ship-board Ann always remained in the cabin;\nthe sight of the water terrified her: on the contrary, Mary, after she\nwas gone to bed, or when she fell asleep in the day, went on deck,\nconversed with the sailors, and surveyed the boundless expanse before\nher with delight. One instant she would regard the ocean, the next the\nbeings who braved its fury. Their insensibility and want of fear, she\ncould not name courage; their thoughtless mirth was quite of an animal\nkind, and their feelings as impetuous and uncertain as the element they\nplowed.\n\nThey had only been a week at sea when they hailed the rock of Lisbon,\nand the next morning anchored at the castle. After the customary visits,\nthey were permitted to go on shore, about three miles from the city; and\nwhile one of the crew, who understood the language, went to procure them\none of the ugly carriages peculiar to the country, they waited in the\nIrish convent, which is situated close to the Tagus.\n\nSome of the people offered to conduct them into the church, where there\nwas a fine organ playing; Mary followed them, but Ann preferred staying\nwith a nun she had entered into conversation with.\n\nOne of the nuns, who had a sweet voice, was singing; Mary was struck\nwith awe; her heart joined in the devotion; and tears of gratitude and\ntenderness flowed from her eyes. My Father, I thank thee! burst from\nher--words were inadequate to express her feelings. Silently, she\nsurveyed the lofty dome; heard unaccustomed sounds; and saw faces,\nstrange ones, that she could not yet greet with fraternal love.\n\nIn an unknown land, she considered that the Being she adored inhabited\neternity, was ever present in unnumbered worlds. When she had not any\none she loved near her, she was particularly sensible of the presence\nof her Almighty Friend.\n\nThe arrival of the carriage put a stop to her speculations; it was to\nconduct them to an hotel, fitted up for the reception of invalids.\nUnfortunately, before they could reach it there was a violent shower of\nrain; and as the wind was very high, it beat against the leather\ncurtains, which they drew along the front of the vehicle, to shelter\nthemselves from it; but it availed not, some of the rain forced its way,\nand Ann felt the effects of it, for she caught cold, spite of Mary's\nprecautions.\n\nAs is the custom, the rest of the invalids, or lodgers, sent to enquire\nafter their health; and as soon as Ann left her chamber, in which her\ncomplaints seldom confined her the whole day, they came in person to pay\ntheir compliments. Three fashionable females, and two gentlemen; the\none a brother of the eldest of the young ladies, and the other an\ninvalid, who came, like themselves, for the benefit of the air. They\nentered into conversation immediately.\n\nPeople who meet in a strange country, and are all together in a house,\nsoon get acquainted, without the formalities which attend visiting in\nseparate houses, where they are surrounded by domestic friends. Ann was\nparticularly delighted at meeting with agreeable society; a little\nhectic fever generally made her low-spirited in the morning, and lively\nin the evening, when she wished for company. Mary, who only thought of\nher, determined to cultivate their acquaintance, as she knew, that if\nher mind could be diverted, her body might gain strength.\n\nThey were all musical, and proposed having little concerts. One of the\ngentlemen played on the violin, and the other on the german-flute. The\ninstruments were brought in, with all the eagerness that attends putting\na new scheme in execution.\n\nMary had not said much, for she was diffident; she seldom joined in\ngeneral conversations; though her quickness of penetration enabled her\nsoon to enter into the characters of those she conversed with; and her\nsensibility made her desirous of pleasing every human creature. Besides,\nif her mind was not occupied by any particular sorrow, or study, she\ncaught reflected pleasure, and was glad to see others happy, though\ntheir mirth did not interest her.\n\nThis day she was continually thinking of Ann's recovery, and encouraging\nthe cheerful hopes, which though they dissipated the spirits that had\nbeen condensed by melancholy, yet made her wish to be silent. The music,\nmore than the conversation, disturbed her reflections; but not at first.\nThe gentleman who played on the german-flute, was a handsome, well-bred,\nsensible man; and his observations, if not original, were pertinent.\n\nThe other, who had not said much, began to touch the violin, and played\na little Scotch ballad; he brought such a thrilling sound out of the\ninstrument, that Mary started, and looking at him with more attention\nthan she had done before, and saw, in a face rather ugly, strong lines\nof genius. His manners were awkward, that kind of awkwardness which is\noften found in literary men: he seemed a thinker, and delivered his\nopinions in elegant expressions, and musical tones of voice.\n\nWhen the concert was over, they all retired to their apartments. Mary\nalways slept with Ann, as she was subject to terrifying dreams; and\nfrequently in the night was obliged to be supported, to avoid\nsuffocation. They chatted about their new acquaintance in their own\napartment, and, with respect to the gentlemen, differed in opinion.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. X.\n\n\nEvery day almost they saw their new acquaintance; and civility produced\nintimacy. Mary sometimes left her friend with them; while she indulged\nherself in viewing new modes of life, and searching out the causes which\nproduced them. She had a metaphysical turn, which inclined her to\nreflect on every object that passed by her; and her mind was not like a\nmirror, which receives every floating image, but does not retain them:\nshe had not any prejudices, for every opinion was examined before it was\nadopted.\n\nThe Roman Catholic ceremonies attracted her attention, and gave rise to\nconversations when they all met; and one of the gentlemen continually\nintroduced deistical notions, when he ridiculed the pageantry they all\nwere surprised at observing. Mary thought of both the subjects, the\nRomish tenets, and the deistical doubts; and though not a sceptic,\nthought it right to examine the evidence on which her faith was built.\nShe read Butler's Analogy, and some other authors: and these researches\nmade her a christian from conviction, and she learned charity,\nparticularly with respect to sectaries; saw that apparently good and\nsolid arguments might take their rise from different points of view; and\nshe rejoiced to find that those she should not concur with had some\nreason on their side.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XI.\n\n\nWhen I mentioned the three ladies, I said they were fashionable women;\nand it was all the praise, as a faithful historian, I could bestow on\nthem; the only thing in which they were consistent. I forgot to mention\nthat they were all of one family, a mother, her daughter, and niece. The\ndaughter was sent by her physician, to avoid a northerly winter; the\nmother, her niece, and nephew, accompanied her.\n\nThey were people of rank; but unfortunately, though of an ancient\nfamily, the title had descended to a very remote branch--a branch they\ntook care to be intimate with; and servilely copied the Countess's\nairs. Their minds were shackled with a set of notions concerning\npropriety, the fitness of things for the world's eye, trammels which\nalways hamper weak people. What will the world say? was the first thing\nthat was thought of, when they intended doing any thing they had not\ndone before. Or what would the Countess do on such an occasion? And when\nthis question was answered, the right or wrong was discovered without\nthe trouble of their having any idea of the matter in their own heads.\nThis same Countess was a fine planet, and the satellites observed a most\nharmonic dance around her.\n\nAfter this account it is scarcely necessary to add, that their minds had\nreceived very little cultivation. They were taught French, Italian, and\nSpanish; English was their vulgar tongue. And what did they learn?\nHamlet will tell you--words--words. But let me not forget that they\nsqualled Italian songs in the true _gusto_. Without having any seeds\nsown in their understanding, or the affections of the heart set to work,\nthey were brought out of their nursery, or the place they were secluded\nin, to prevent their faces being common; like blazing stars, to\ncaptivate Lords.\n\nThey were pretty, and hurrying from one party of pleasure to another,\noccasioned the disorder which required change of air. The mother, if we\nexcept her being near twenty years older, was just the same creature;\nand these additional years only served to make her more tenaciously\nadhere to her habits of folly, and decide with stupid gravity, some\ntrivial points of ceremony, as a matter of the last importance; of\nwhich she was a competent judge, from having lived in the fashionable\nworld so long: that world to which the ignorant look up as we do to the\nsun.\n\nIt appears to me that every creature has some notion--or rather relish,\nof the sublime. Riches, and the consequent state, are the sublime of\nweak minds:--These images fill, nay, are too big for their narrow souls.\n\nOne afternoon, which they had engaged to spend together, Ann was so ill,\nthat Mary was obliged to send an apology for not attending the\ntea-table. The apology brought them on the carpet; and the mother, with\na look of solemn importance, turned to the sick man, whose name was\nHenry, and said;\n\n\"Though people of the first fashion are frequently at places of this\nkind, intimate with they know not who; yet I do not choose that my\ndaughter, whose family is so respectable, should be intimate with any\none she would blush to know elsewhere. It is only on that account, for I\nnever suffer her to be with any one but in my company,\" added she,\nsitting more erect; and a smile of self-complacency dressed her\ncountenance.\n\n\"I have enquired concerning these strangers, and find that the one who\nhas the most dignity in her manners, is really a woman of fortune.\"\n\"Lord, mamma, how ill she dresses:\" mamma went on; \"She is a romantic\ncreature, you must not copy her, miss; yet she is an heiress of the\nlarge fortune in ----shire, of which you may remember to have heard the\nCountess speak the night you had on the dancing-dress that was so much\nadmired; but she is married.\"\n\nShe then told them the whole story as she heard it from her maid, who\npicked it out of Mary's servant. \"She is a foolish creature, and this\nfriend that she pays as much attention to as if she was a lady of\nquality, is a beggar.\" \"Well, how strange!\" cried the girls.\n\n\"She is, however, a charming creature,\" said her nephew. Henry sighed,\nand strode across the room once or twice; then took up his violin, and\nplayed the air which first struck Mary; he had often heard her praise\nit.\n\nThe music was uncommonly melodious, \"And came stealing on the senses\nlike the sweet south.\" The well-known sounds reached Mary as she sat by\nher friend--she listened without knowing that she did--and shed tears\nalmost without being conscious of it. Ann soon fell asleep, as she had\ntaken an opiate. Mary, then brooding over her fears, began to imagine\nshe had deceived herself--Ann was still very ill; hope had beguiled many\nheavy hours; yet she was displeased with herself for admitting this\nwelcome guest.--And she worked up her mind to such a degree of anxiety,\nthat she determined, once more, to seek medical aid.\n\nNo sooner did she determine, than she ran down with a discomposed look,\nto enquire of the ladies who she should send for. When she entered the\nroom she could not articulate her fears--it appeared like pronouncing\nAnn's sentence of death; her faultering tongue dropped some broken\nwords, and she remained silent. The ladies wondered that a person of her\nsense should be so little mistress of herself; and began to administer\nsome common-place comfort, as, that it was our duty to submit to the\nwill of Heaven, and the like trite consolations, which Mary did not\nanswer; but waving her hand, with an air of impatience, she exclaimed,\n\"I cannot live without her!--I have no other friend; if I lose her, what\na desart will the world be to me.\" \"No other friend,\" re-echoed they,\n\"have you not a husband?\"\n\nMary shrunk back, and was alternately pale and red. A delicate sense of\npropriety prevented her replying; and recalled her bewildered\nreason.--Assuming, in consequence of her recollection, a more composed\nmanner, she made the intended enquiry, and left the room. Henry's eyes\nfollowed her while the females very freely animadverted on her strange\nbehaviour.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XII.\n\n\nThe physician was sent for; his prescription afforded Ann a little\ntemporary relief; and they again joined the circle. Unfortunately, the\nweather happened to be constantly wet for more than a week, and confined\nthem to the house. Ann then found the ladies not so agreeable; when they\nsat whole hours together, the thread-bare topics were exhausted; and,\nbut for cards or music, the long evenings would have been yawned away in\nlistless indolence.\n\nThe bad weather had had as ill an effect on Henry as on Ann. He was\nfrequently very thoughtful, or rather melancholy; this melancholy would\nof itself have attracted Mary's notice, if she had not found his\nconversation so infinitely superior to the rest of the group. When she\nconversed with him, all the faculties of her soul unfolded themselves;\ngenius animated her expressive countenance and the most graceful,\nunaffected gestures gave energy to her discourse.\n\nThey frequently discussed very important subjects, while the rest were\nsinging or playing cards, nor were they observed for doing so, as Henry,\nwhom they all were pleased with, in the way of gallantry shewed them all\nmore attention than her. Besides, as there was nothing alluring in her\ndress or manner, they never dreamt of her being preferred to them.\n\nHenry was a man of learning; he had also studied mankind, and knew many\nof the intricacies of the human heart, from having felt the infirmities\nof his own. His taste was just, as it had a standard--Nature, which he\nobserved with a critical eye. Mary could not help thinking that in his\ncompany her mind expanded, as he always went below the surface. She\nincreased her stock of ideas, and her taste was improved.\n\nHe was also a pious man; his rational religious sentiments received\nwarmth from his sensibility; and, except on very particular occasions,\nkept it in proper bounds; these sentiments had likewise formed his\ntemper; he was gentle, and easily to be intreated. The ridiculous\nceremonies they were every day witness to, led them into what are termed\ngrave subjects, and made him explain his opinions, which, at other\ntimes, he was neither ashamed of, nor unnecessarily brought forward to\nnotice.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XIII.\n\n\nWhen the weather began to clear up, Mary sometimes rode out alone,\npurposely to view the ruins that still remained of the earthquake: or\nshe would ride to the banks of the Tagus, to feast her eyes with the\nsight of that magnificent river. At other times she would visit the\nchurches, as she was particularly fond of seeing historical paintings.\n\nOne of these visits gave rise to the subject, and the whole party\ndescanted on it; but as the ladies could not handle it well, they soon\nadverted to portraits; and talked of the attitudes and characters in\nwhich they should wish to be drawn. Mary did not fix on one--when\nHenry, with more apparent warmth than usual, said, \"I would give the\nworld for your picture, with the expression I have seen in your face,\nwhen you have been supporting your friend.\"\n\nThis delicate compliment did not gratify her vanity, but it reached her\nheart. She then recollected that she had once sat for her picture--for\nwhom was it designed? For a boy! Her cheeks flushed with indignation, so\nstrongly did she feel an emotion of contempt at having been thrown\naway--given in with an estate.\n\nAs Mary again gave way to hope, her mind was more disengaged; and her\nthoughts were employed about the objects around her.\n\nShe visited several convents, and found that solitude only eradicates\nsome passions, to give strength to others; the most baneful ones. She\nsaw that religion does not consist in ceremonies; and that many prayers\nmay fall from the lips without purifying the heart.\n\nThey who imagine they can be religious without governing their tempers,\nor exercising benevolence in its most extensive sense, must certainly\nallow, that their religious duties are only practiced from selfish\nprinciples; how then can they be called good? The pattern of all\ngoodness went about _doing_ good. Wrapped up in themselves, the nuns\nonly thought of inferior gratifications. And a number of intrigues were\ncarried on to accelerate certain points on which their hearts were\nfixed:\n\nSuch as obtaining offices of trust or authority; or avoiding those that\nwere servile or laborious. In short, when they could be neither wives\nnor mothers, they aimed at being superiors, and became the most selfish\ncreatures in the world: the passions that were curbed gave strength to\nthe appetites, or to those mean passions which only tend to provide for\nthe gratification of them. Was this seclusion from the world? or did\nthey conquer its vanities or avoid its vexations?\n\nIn these abodes the unhappy individual, who, in the first paroxysm of\ngrief flies to them for refuge, finds too late she took a wrong step.\nThe same warmth which determined her will make her repent; and sorrow,\nthe rust of the mind, will never have a chance of being rubbed off by\nsensible conversation, or new-born affections of the heart.\n\nShe will find that those affections that have once been called forth and\nstrengthened by exercise, are only smothered, not killed, by\ndisappointment; and that in one form or other discontent will corrode\nthe heart, and produce those maladies of the imagination, for which\nthere is no specific.\n\nThe community at large Mary disliked; but pitied many of them whose\nprivate distresses she was informed of; and to pity and relieve were the\nsame things with her.\n\nThe exercise of her various virtues gave vigor to her genius, and\ndignity to her mind; she was sometimes inconsiderate, and violent; but\nnever mean or cunning.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XIV.\n\n\nThe Portuguese are certainly the most uncivilized nation in Europe. Dr.\nJohnson would have said, \"They have the least mind.\". And can such serve\ntheir Creator in spirit and in truth? No, the gross ritual of Romish\nceremonies is all they can comprehend: they can do penance, but not\nconquer their revenge, or lust. Religion, or love, has never humanized\ntheir hearts; they want the vital part; the mere body worships. Taste is\nunknown; Gothic finery, and unnatural decorations, which they term\nornaments, are conspicuous in their churches and dress. Reverence for\nmental excellence is only to be found in a polished nation.\n\nCould the contemplation of such a people gratify Mary's heart? No: she\nturned disgusted from the prospects--turned to a man of refinement.\nHenry had been some time ill and low-spirited; Mary would have been\nattentive to any one in that situation; but to him she was particularly\nso; she thought herself bound in gratitude, on account of his constant\nendeavours to amuse Ann, and prevent her dwelling on the dreary prospect\nbefore her, which sometimes she could not help anticipating with a kind\nof quiet despair.\n\nShe found some excuse for going more frequently into the room they all\nmet in; nay, she avowed her desire to amuse him: offered to read to him,\nand tried to draw him into amusing conversations; and when she was full\nof these little schemes, she looked at him with a degree of tenderness\nthat she was not conscious of. This divided attention was of use to her,\nand prevented her continually thinking of Ann, whose fluctuating\ndisorder often gave rise to false hopes.\n\nA trifling thing occurred now which occasioned Mary some uneasiness. Her\nmaid, a well-looking girl, had captivated the clerk of a neighbouring\ncompting-house. As the match was an advantageous one, Mary could not\nraise any objection to it, though at this juncture it was very\ndisagreeable to her to have a stranger about her person. However, the\ngirl consented to delay the marriage, as she had some affection for her\nmistress; and, besides, looked forward to Ann's death as a time of\nharvest.\n\nHenry's illness was not alarming, it was rather pleasing, as it gave\nMary an excuse to herself for shewing him how much she was interested\nabout him; and giving little artless proofs of affection, which the\npurity of her heart made her never wish to restrain.\n\nThe only visible return he made was not obvious to common observers. He\nwould sometimes fix his eyes on her, and take them off with a sigh that\nwas coughed away; or when he was leisurely walking into the room, and\ndid not expect to see her, he would quicken his steps, and come up to\nher with eagerness to ask some trivial question. In the same style, he\nwould try to detain her when he had nothing to say--or said nothing.\n\nAnn did not take notice of either his or Mary's behaviour, nor did she\nsuspect that he was a favourite, on any other account than his\nappearing neither well nor happy. She had often seen that when a person\nwas unfortunate, Mary's pity might easily be mistaken for love, and,\nindeed, it was a temporary sensation of that kind. Such it was--why it\nwas so, let others define, I cannot argue against instincts. As reason\nis cultivated in man, they are supposed to grow weaker, and this may\nhave given rise to the assertion, \"That as judgment improves, genius\nevaporates.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XV.\n\n\nOne morning they set out to visit the aqueduct; though the day was very\nfine when they left home, a very heavy shower fell before they reached\nit; they lengthened their ride, the clouds dispersed, and the sun came\nfrom behind them uncommonly bright.\n\nMary would fain have persuaded Ann not to have left the carriage; but\nshe was in spirits, and obviated all her objections, and insisted on\nwalking, tho' the ground was damp. But her strength was not equal to her\nspirits; she was soon obliged to return to the carriage so much\nfatigued, that she fainted, and remained insensible a long time.\n\nHenry would have supported her; but Mary would not permit him; her\nrecollection was instantaneous, and she feared sitting on the damp\nground might do him a material injury: she was on that account positive,\nthough the company did not guess the cause of her being so. As to\nherself, she did not fear bodily pain; and, when her mind was agitated,\nshe could endure the greatest fatigue without appearing sensible of it.\n\nWhen Ann recovered, they returned slowly home; she was carried to bed,\nand the next morning Mary thought she observed a visible change for the\nworse. The physician was sent for, who pronounced her to be in the most\nimminent danger.\n\nAll Mary's former fears now returned like a torrent, and carried every\nother care away; she even added to her present anguish by upbraiding\nherself for her late tranquillity--it haunted her in the form of a\ncrime.\n\nThe disorder made the most rapid advances--there was no hope!--Bereft of\nit, Mary again was tranquil; but it was a very different kind of\ntranquillity. She stood to brave the approaching storm, conscious she\nonly could be overwhelmed by it.\n\nShe did not think of Henry, or if her thoughts glanced towards him, it\nwas only to find fault with herself for suffering a thought to have\nstrayed from Ann.--Ann!--this dear friend was soon torn from her--she\ndied suddenly as Mary was assisting her to walk across the room.--The\nfirst string was severed from her heart--and this \"slow, sudden-death\"\ndisturbed her reasoning faculties; she seemed stunned by it; unable to\nreflect, or even to feel her misery.\n\nThe body was stolen out of the house the second night, and Mary refused\nto see her former companions. She desired her maid to conclude her\nmarriage, and request her intended husband to inform her when the first\nmerchantman was to leave the port, as the packet had just sailed, and\nshe determined not to stay in that hated place any longer than was\nabsolutely necessary.\n\nShe then sent to request the ladies to visit her; she wished to avoid a\nparade of grief--her sorrows were her own, and appeared to her not to\nadmit of increase or softening. She was right; the sight of them did not\naffect her, or turn the stream of her sullen sorrow; the black wave\nrolled along in the same course, it was equal to her where she cast her\neyes; all was impenetrable gloom.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XVI.\n\n\nSoon after the ladies left her, she received a message from Henry,\nrequesting, as she saw company, to be permitted to visit her: she\nconsented, and he entered immediately, with an unassured pace. She ran\neagerly up to him--saw the tear trembling in his eye, and his\ncountenance softened by the tenderest compassion; the hand which pressed\nhers seemed that of a fellow-creature. She burst into tears; and, unable\nto restrain them, she hid her face with both her hands; these tears\nrelieved her, (she had before had a difficulty in breathing,) and she\nsat down by him more composed than she had appeared since Ann's death;\nbut her conversation was incoherent.\n\nShe called herself \"a poor disconsolate creature!\"--\"Mine is a selfish\ngrief,\" she exclaimed--\"Yet; Heaven is my witness, I do not wish her\nback now she has reached those peaceful mansions, where the weary rest.\nHer pure spirit is happy; but what a wretch am I!\"\n\nHenry forgot his cautious reserve. \"Would you allow me to call you\nfriend?\" said he in a hesitating voice. \"I feel, dear girl, the tendered\ninterest in whatever concerns thee.\" His eyes spoke the rest. They were\nboth silent a few moments; then Henry resumed the conversation. \"I have\nalso been acquainted with grief! I mourn the loss of a woman who was not\nworthy of my regard. Let me give thee some account of the man who now\nsolicits thy friendship; and who, from motives of the purest\nbenevolence, wishes to give comfort to thy wounded heart.\"\n\n\"I have myself,\" said he, mournfully, \"shaken hands with happiness, and\nam dead to the world; I wait patiently for my dissolution; but, for\nthee, Mary, there may be many bright days in store.\"\n\n\"Impossible,\" replied she, in a peevish tone, as if he had insulted her\nby the supposition; her feelings were so much in unison with his, that\nshe was in love with misery.\n\nHe smiled at her impatience, and went on. \"My father died before I knew\nhim, and my mother was so attached to my eldest brother, that she took\nvery little pains to fit me for the profession to which I was destined:\nand, may I tell thee, I left my family, and, in many different stations,\nrambled about the world; saw mankind in every rank of life; and, in\norder to be independent, exerted those talents Nature has given me:\nthese exertions improved my understanding; and the miseries I was\nwitness to, gave a keener edge to my sensibility. My constitution is\nnaturally weak; and, perhaps, two or three lingering disorders in my\nyouth, first gave me a habit of reflecting, and enabled me to obtain\nsome dominion over my passions. At least,\" added he, stifling a sigh,\n\"over the violent ones, though I fear, refinement and reflection only\nrenders the tender ones more tyrannic.\n\n\"I have told you already I have been in love, and disappointed--the\nobject is now no more; let her faults sleep with her! Yet this passion\nhas pervaded my whole soul, and mixed itself with all my affections and\npursuits.--I am not peacefully indifferent; yet it is only to my violin\nI tell the sorrows I now confide with thee. The object I loved forfeited\nmy esteem; yet, true to the sentiment, my fancy has too frequently\ndelighted to form a creature that I could love, that could convey to my\nsoul sensations which the gross part of mankind have not any conception\nof.\"\n\nHe stopped, as Mary seemed lost in thought; but as she was still in a\nlistening attitude, continued his little narrative. \"I kept up an\nirregular correspondence with my mother; my brother's extravagance and\ningratitude had almost broken her heart, and made her feel something\nlike a pang of remorse, on account of her behaviour to me. I hastened to\ncomfort her--and was a comfort to her.\n\n\"My declining health prevented my taking orders, as I had intended; but\nI with warmth entered into literary pursuits; perhaps my heart, not\nhaving an object, made me embrace the substitute with more eagerness.\nBut, do not imagine I have always been a die-away swain. No: I have\nfrequented the cheerful haunts of men, and wit!--enchanting wit! has\nmade many moments fly free from care. I am too fond of the elegant arts;\nand woman--lovely woman! thou hast charmed me, though, perhaps, it would\nnot be easy to find one to whom my reason would allow me to be constant.\n\n\"I have now only to tell you, that my mother insisted on my spending\nthis winter in a warmer climate; and I fixed on Lisbon, as I had before\nvisited the Continent.\" He then looked Mary full in the face; and, with\nthe most insinuating accents, asked \"if he might hope for her\nfriendship? If she would rely on him as if he was her father; and that\nthe tenderest father could not more anxiously interest himself in the\nfate of a darling child, than he did in her's.\"\n\nSuch a crowd of thoughts all at once rushed into Mary's mind, that she\nin vain attempted to express the sentiments which were most predominant.\nHer heart longed to receive a new guest; there was a void in it:\naccustomed to have some one to love, she was alone, and comfortless, if\nnot engrossed by a particular affection.\n\nHenry saw her distress, and not to increase it, left the room. He had\nexerted himself to turn her thoughts into a new channel, and had\nsucceeded; she thought of him till she began to chide herself for\ndefrauding the dead, and, determining to grieve for Ann, she dwelt on\nHenry's misfortunes and ill health; and the interest he took in her fate\nwas a balm to her sick mind. She did not reason on the subject; but she\nfelt he was attached to her: lost in this delirium, she never asked\nherself what kind of an affection she had for him, or what it tended to;\nnor did she know that love and friendship are very distinct; she thought\nwith rapture, that there was one person in the world who had an\naffection for her, and that person she admired--had a friendship for.\n\nHe had called her his dear girl; the words might have fallen from him by\naccident; but they did not fall to the ground. My child! His child,\nwhat an association of ideas! If I had had a father, such a father!--She\ncould not dwell on the thoughts, the wishes which obtruded themselves.\nHer mind was unhinged, and passion unperceived filled her whole soul.\nLost, in waking dreams, she considered and reconsidered Henry's account\nof himself; till she actually thought she would tell Ann--a bitter\nrecollection then roused her out of her reverie; and aloud she begged\nforgiveness of her.\n\nBy these kind of conflicts the day was lengthened; and when she went to\nbed, the night passed away in feverish slumbers; though they did not\nrefresh her, she was spared the labour of thinking, of restraining her\nimagination; it sported uncontrouled; but took its colour from her\nwaking train of thoughts. One instant she was supporting her dying\nmother; then Ann was breathing her last, and Henry was comforting her.\n\nThe unwelcome light visited her languid eyes; yet, I must tell the\ntruth, she thought she should see Henry, and this hope set her spirits\nin motion: but they were quickly depressed by her maid, who came to tell\nher that she had heard of a vessel on board of which she could be\naccommodated, and that there was to be another female passenger on\nboard, a vulgar one; but perhaps she would be more useful on that\naccount--Mary did not want a companion.\n\nAs she had given orders for her passage to be engaged in the first\nvessel that sailed, she could not now retract; and must prepare for the\nlonely voyage, as the Captain intended taking advantage of the first\nfair wind. She had too much strength of mind to waver in her\ndetermination but to determine wrung her very heart, opened all her old\nwounds, and made them bleed afresh. What was she to do? where go? Could\nshe set a seal to a hasty vow, and tell a deliberate lie; promise to\nlove one man, when the image of another was ever present to her--her\nsoul revolted. \"I might gain the applause of the world by such mock\nheroism; but should I not forfeit my own? forfeit thine, my father!\"\n\nThere is a solemnity in the shortest ejaculation, which, for a while,\nstills the tumult of passion. Mary's mind had been thrown off its poise;\nher devotion had been, perhaps, more fervent for some time past; but\nless regular. She forgot that happiness was not to be found on earth,\nand built a terrestrial paradise liable to be destroyed by the first\nserious thought: when, she reasoned she became inexpressibly sad, to\nrender life bearable she gave way to fancy--this was madness.\n\nIn a few days she must again go to sea; the weather was very\ntempestuous--what of that, the tempest in her soul rendered every other\ntrifling--it was not the contending elements, but _herself_ she feared!\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XVII.\n\n\nIn order to gain strength to support the expected interview, she went\nout in a carriage. The day was fine; but all nature was to her a\nuniversal blank; she could neither enjoy it, nor weep that she could\nnot. She passed by the ruins of an old monastery on a very high hill she\ngot out to walk amongst the ruins; the wind blew violently, she did not\navoid its fury, on the contrary, wildly bid it blow on, and seemed glad\nto contend with it, or rather walk against it. Exhausted she returned to\nthe carriage was soon at home, and in the old room.\n\nHenry started at the sight of her altered appearance; the day before her\ncomplexion had been of the most pallid hue; but now her cheeks were\nflushed, and her eyes enlivened with a false vivacity, an unusual fire.\nHe was not well, his illness was apparent in his countenance, and he\nowned he had not closed his eyes all night; this roused her dormant\ntenderness, she forgot they were so soon to part-engrossed by the\npresent happiness of seeing, of hearing him.\n\nOnce or twice she essayed to tell him that she was, in a few days, to\ndepart; but she could not; she was irresolute; it will do to-morrow;\nshould the wind change they could not sail in such a hurry; thus she\nthought, and insensibly grew more calm. The Ladies prevailed on her to\nspend the evening with them; but she retired very early to rest, and sat\non the side of her bed several hours, then threw herself on it, and\nwaited for the dreaded to-morrow.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XVIII.\n\n\nThe ladies heard that her servant was to be married that day, and that\nshe was to sail in the vessel which was then clearing out at the\nCustom-house. Henry heard, but did not make any remarks; and Mary called\nup all her fortitude to support her, and enable her to hide from the\nfemales her internal struggles. She durst not encounter Henry's glances\nwhen she found he had been informed of her intention; and, trying to\ndraw a veil over her wretched state of mind, she talked incessantly, she\nknew not what; flashes of wit burst from her, and when she began to\nlaugh she could not stop herself.\n\nHenry smiled at some of her sallies, and looked at her with such\nbenignity and compassion, that he recalled her scattered thoughts; and,\nthe ladies going to dress for dinner, they were left alone; and remained\nsilent a few moments: after the noisy conversation it appeared solemn.\nHenry began. \"You are going, Mary, and going by yourself; your mind is\nnot in a state to be left to its own operations--yet I cannot, dissuade\nyou; if I attempted to do it, I should ill deserve the title I wish to\nmerit. I only think of your happiness; could I obey the strongest\nimpulse of my heart, I should accompany thee to England; but such a step\nmight endanger your future peace.\"\n\nMary, then, with all the frankness which marked her character, explained\nher situation to him and mentioned her fatal tie with such disgust that\nhe trembled for her. \"I cannot see him; he is not the man formed for me\nto love!\" Her delicacy did not restrain her, for her dislike to her\nhusband had taken root in her mind long before she knew Henry. Did she\nnot fix on Lisbon rather than France on purpose to avoid him? and if Ann\nhad been in tolerable health she would have flown with her to some\nremote corner to have escaped from him.\n\n\"I intend,\" said Henry, \"to follow you in the next packet; where shall I\nhear of your health?\" \"Oh! let me hear of thine,\" replied Mary. \"I am\nwell, very well; but thou art very ill--thy health is in the most\nprecarious state.\" She then mentioned her intention of going to Ann's\nrelations. \"I am her representative, I have duties to fulfil for her:\nduring my voyage I have time enough for reflection; though I think I\nhave already determined.\"\n\n\"Be not too hasty, my child,\" interrupted Henry; \"far be it from me to\npersuade thee to do violence to thy feelings--but consider that all thy\nfuture life may probably take its colour from thy present mode of\nconduct. Our affections as well as our sentiments are fluctuating; you\nwill not perhaps always either think or feel as you do at present: the\nobject you now shun may appear in a different light.\" He paused. \"In\nadvising thee in this style, I have only thy good at heart, Mary.\"\n\nShe only answered to expostulate. \"My affections are involuntary--yet\nthey can only be fixed by reflection, and when they are they make quite\na part of my soul, are interwoven in it, animate my actions, and form\nmy taste: certain qualities are calculated to call forth my sympathies,\nand make me all I am capable of being. The governing affection gives its\nstamp to the rest--because I am capable of loving one, I have that kind\nof charity to all my fellow-creatures which is not easily provoked.\nMilton has asserted, That earthly love is the scale by which to heavenly\nwe may ascend.\"\n\nShe went on with eagerness. \"My opinions on some subjects are not\nwavering; my pursuit through life has ever been the same: in solitude\nwere my sentiments formed; they are indelible, and nothing can efface\nthem but death--No, death itself cannot efface them, or my soul must be\ncreated afresh, and not improved. Yet a little while am I parted from\nmy Ann--I could not exist without the hope of seeing her again--I could\nnot bear to think that time could wear away an affection that was\nfounded on what is not liable to perish; you might as well attempt to\npersuade me that my soul is matter, and that its feelings arose from\ncertain modifications of it.\"\n\n\"Dear enthusiastic creature,\" whispered Henry, \"how you steal into my\nsoul.\" She still continued. \"The same turn of mind which leads me to\nadore the Author of all Perfection--which leads me to conclude that he\nonly can fill my soul; forces me to admire the faint image-the shadows\nof his attributes here below; and my imagination gives still bolder\nstrokes to them. I knew I am in some degree under the influence of a\ndelusion--but does not this strong delusion prove that I myself 'am _of\nsubtiler essence than the trodden clod_' these flights of the\nimagination point to futurity; I cannot banish them. Every cause in\nnature produces an effect; and am I an exception to the general rule?\nhave I desires implanted in me only to make me miserable? will they\nnever be gratified? shall I never be happy? My feelings do not accord\nwith the notion of solitary happiness. In a state of bliss, it will be\nthe society of beings we can love, without the alloy that earthly\ninfirmities mix with our best affections, that will constitute great\npart of our happiness.\n\n\"With these notions can I conform to the maxims of worldly wisdom? can\nI listen to the cold dictates of worldly prudence and bid my tumultuous\npassions cease to vex me, be still, find content in grovelling pursuits,\nand the admiration of the misjudging crowd, when it is only one I wish\nto please--one who could be all the world to me. Argue not with me, I am\nbound by human ties; but did my spirit ever promise to love, or could I\nconsider when forced to bind myself--to take a vow, that at the awful\nday of judgment I must give an account of. My conscience does not smite\nme, and that Being who is greater than the internal monitor, may approve\nof what the world condemns; sensible that in Him I live, could I brave\nHis presence, or hope in solitude to find peace, if I acted contrary to\nconviction, that the world might approve of my conduct--what could the\nworld give to compensate for my own esteem? it is ever hostile and armed\nagainst the feeling heart!\n\n\"Riches and honours await me, and the cold moralist might desire me to\nsit down and enjoy them--I cannot conquer my feelings, and till I do,\nwhat are these baubles to me? you may tell me I follow a fleeting good,\nan _ignis fatuus_; but this chase, these struggles prepare me for\neternity--when I no longer see through a glass darkly I shall not reason\nabout, but _feel_ in what happiness consists.\"\n\nHenry had not attempted to interrupt her; he saw she was determined, and\nthat these sentiments were not the effusion of the moment, but well\ndigested ones, the result of strong affections, a high sense of honour,\nand respect for the source of all virtue and truth. He was startled, if\nnot entirely convinced by her arguments; indeed her voice, her gestures\nwere all persuasive.\n\nSome one now entered the room; he looked an answer to her long harangue;\nit was fortunate for him, or he might have been led to say what in a\ncooler moment he had determined to conceal; but were words necessary to\nreveal it? He wished not to influence her conduct--vain precaution; she\nknew she was beloved; and could she forget that such a man loved her, or\nrest satisfied with any inferior gratification. When passion first\nenters the heart, it is only a return of affection that is sought after,\nand every other remembrance and wish is blotted out.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XIX.\n\n\nTwo days passed away without any particular conversation; Henry, trying\nto be indifferent, or to appear so, was more assiduous than ever. The\nconflict was too violent for his present state of health; the spirit was\nwilling, but the body suffered; he lost his appetite, and looked\nwretchedly; his spirits were calmly low--the world seemed to fade\naway--what was that world to him that Mary did not inhabit; she lived\nnot for him.\n\nHe was mistaken; his affection was her only support; without this dear\nprop she had sunk into the grave of her lost--long-loved friend;--his\nattention snatched her from despair. Inscrutable are the ways of\nHeaven!\n\nThe third day Mary was desired to prepare herself; for if the wind\ncontinued in the same point, they should set sail the next evening. She\ntried to prepare her mind, and her efforts were not useless she appeared\nless agitated than could have been expected, and talked of her voyage\nwith composure. On great occasions she was generally calm and collected,\nher resolution would brace her unstrung nerves; but after the victory\nshe had no triumph; she would sink into a state of moping melancholy,\nand feel ten-fold misery when the heroic enthusiasm was over.\n\nThe morning of the day fixed on for her departure she was alone with\nHenry only a few moments, and an awkward kind of formality made them\nslip away without their having said much to each other. Henry was\nafraid to discover his passion, or give any other name to his regard but\nfriendship; yet his anxious solicitude for her welfare was ever breaking\nout-while she as artlessly expressed again and again, her fears with\nrespect to his declining health.\n\n\"We shall soon meet,\" said he, with a faint smile; Mary smiled too; she\ncaught the sickly beam; it was still fainter by being reflected, and not\nknowing what she wished to do, started up and left the room. When she\nwas alone she regretted she had left him so precipitately. \"The few\nprecious moments I have thus thrown away may never return,\" she\nthought-the reflection led to misery.\n\nShe waited for, nay, almost wished for the summons to depart. She could\nnot avoid spending the intermediate time with the ladies and Henry; and\nthe trivial conversations she was obliged to bear a part in harassed her\nmore than can be well conceived.\n\nThe summons came, and the whole party attended her to the vessel. For a\nwhile the remembrance of Ann banished her regret at parting with Henry,\nthough his pale figure pressed on her sight; it may seem a paradox, but\nhe was more present to her when she sailed; her tears then were all his\nown.\n\n\"My poor Ann!\" thought Mary, \"along this road we came, and near this\nspot you called me your guardian angel--and now I leave thee here! ah!\nno, I do not--thy spirit is not confined to its mouldering tenement!\nTell me, thou soul of her I love, tell me, ah! whither art thou fled?\"\nAnn occupied her until they reached the ship.\n\nThe anchor was weighed. Nothing can be more irksome than waiting to say\nfarewel. As the day was serene, they accompanied her a little way, and\nthen got into the boat; Henry was the last; he pressed her hand, it had\nnot any life in it; she leaned over the side of the ship without looking\nat the boat, till it was so far distant, that she could not see the\ncountenances of those that were in it: a mist spread itself over her\nsight--she longed to exchange one look--tried to recollect the\nlast;--the universe contained no being but Henry!--The grief of parting\nwith him had swept all others clean away. Her eyes followed the keel of\nthe boat, and when she could no longer perceive its traces: she looked\nround on the wide waste of waters, thought of the precious moments\nwhich had been stolen from the waste of murdered time.\n\nShe then descended into the cabin, regardless of the surrounding\nbeauties of nature, and throwing herself on her bed in the little hole\nwhich was called the state-room--she wished to forget her existence. On\nthis bed she remained two days, listening to the dashing waves, unable\nto close her eyes. A small taper made the darkness visible; and the\nthird night, by its glimmering light, she wrote the following fragment.\n\n\"Poor solitary wretch that I am; here alone do I listen to the whistling\nwinds and dashing waves;--on no human support can I rest--when not lost\nto hope I found pleasure in the society of those rough beings; but now\nthey appear not like my fellow creatures; no social ties draw me to\nthem. How long, how dreary has this day been; yet I scarcely wish it\nover--for what will to-morrow bring--to-morrow, and to-morrow will only\nbe marked with unvaried characters of wretchedness.--Yet surely, I am\nnot alone!\"\n\nHer moistened eyes were lifted up to heaven; a crowd of thoughts darted\ninto her mind, and pressing her hand against her forehead, as if to bear\nthe intellectual weight, she tried, but tried in vain, to arrange them.\n\"Father of Mercies, compose this troubled spirit: do I indeed wish it to\nbe composed--to forget my Henry?\" the _my_, the pen was directly drawn\nacross in an agony.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XX.\n\n\nThe mate of the ship, who heard her stir, came to offer her some\nrefreshment; and she, who formerly received every offer of kindness or\ncivility with pleasure, now shrunk away disgusted: peevishly she desired\nhim not to disturb her; but the words were hardly articulated when her\nheart smote her, she called him back, and requested something to drink.\nAfter drinking it, fatigued by her mental exertions, she fell into a\ndeath-like slumber, which lasted some hours; but did not refresh her, on\nthe contrary, she awoke languid and stupid.\n\nThe wind still continued contrary; a week, a dismal week, had she\nstruggled with her sorrows; and the struggle brought on a slow fever,\nwhich sometimes gave her false spirits.\n\nThe winds then became very tempestuous, the Great Deep was troubled, and\nall the passengers appalled. Mary then left her bed, and went on deck,\nto survey the contending elements: the scene accorded with the present\nstate of her soul; she thought in a few hours I may go home; the\nprisoner may be released. The vessel rose on a wave and descended into a\nyawning gulph--Not slower did her mounting soul return to earth,\nfor--Ah! her treasure and her heart was there. The squalls rattled\namongst the sails, which were quickly taken down; the wind would then\ndie away, and the wild undirected waves rushed on every side with a\ntremendous roar. In a little vessel in the midst of such a storm she\nwas not dismayed; she felt herself independent.\n\nJust then one of the crew perceived a signal of distress; by the help of\na glass he could plainly discover a small vessel dismasted, drifted\nabout, for the rudder had been broken by the violence of the storm.\nMary's thoughts were now all engrossed by the crew on the brink of\ndestruction. They bore down to the wreck; they reached it, and hailed\nthe trembling wretches; at the sound of the friendly greeting, loud\ncries of tumultuous joy were mixed with the roaring of the waves, and\nwith ecstatic transport they leaped on the shattered deck, launched\ntheir boat in a moment, and committed themselves to the mercy of the\nsea. Stowed between two casks, and leaning on a sail, she watched the\nboat, and when a wave intercepted it from her view--she ceased to\nbreathe, or rather held her breath until it rose again.\n\nAt last the boat arrived safe along-side the ship, and Mary caught the\npoor trembling wretches as they stumbled into it, and joined them in\nthanking that gracious Being, who though He had not thought fit to still\nthe raging of the sea, had afforded them unexpected succour.\n\nAmongst the wretched crew was one poor woman, who fainted when she was\nhauled on board: Mary undressed her, and when she had recovered, and\nsoothed her, left her to enjoy the rest she required to recruit her\nstrength, which fear had quite exhausted. She returned again to view the\nangry deep; and when she gazed on its perturbed state, she thought of\nthe Being who rode on the wings of the wind, and stilled the noise of\nthe sea; and the madness of the people--He only could speak peace to\nher troubled spirit! she grew more calm; the late transaction had\ngratified her benevolence, and stole her out of herself.\n\nOne of the sailors, happening to say to another, \"that he believed the\nworld was going to be at an end;\" this observation led her into a new\ntrain of thoughts: some of Handel's sublime compositions occurred to\nher, and she sung them to the grand accompaniment. The Lord God\nOmnipotent reigned, and would reign for ever, and ever!--Why then did\nshe fear the sorrows that were passing away, when she knew that He would\nbind up the broken-hearted, and receive those who came out of great\ntribulation. She retired to her cabin; and wrote in the little book that\nwas now her only confident. It was after midnight.\n\n\"At this solemn hour, the great day of judgment fills my thoughts; the\nday of retribution, when the secrets of all hearts will be revealed;\nwhen all worldly distinctions will fade away, and be no more seen. I\nhave not words to express the sublime images which the bare\ncontemplation of this awful day raises in my mind. Then, indeed, the\nLord Omnipotent will reign, and He will wipe the tearful eye, and\nsupport the trembling heart--yet a little while He hideth his face, and\nthe dun shades of sorrow, and the thick clouds of folly separate us from\nour God; but when the glad dawn of an eternal day breaks, we shall know\neven as we are known. Here we walk by faith, and not by sight; and we\nhave this alternative, either to enjoy the pleasures of life which are\nbut for a season, or look forward to the prize of our high calling, and\nwith fortitude, and that wisdom which is from above, endeavour to bear\nthe warfare of life. We know that many run the race; but he that\nstriveth obtaineth the crown of victory. Our race is an arduous one! How\nmany are betrayed by traitors lodged in their own breasts, who wear the\ngarb of Virtue, and are so near akin; we sigh to think they should ever\nlead into folly, and slide imperceptibly into vice. Surely any thing\nlike happiness is madness! Shall probationers of an hour presume to\npluck the fruit of immortality, before they have conquered death? it is\nguarded, when the great day, to which I allude, arrives, the way will\nagain be opened. Ye dear delusions, gay deceits, farewel! and yet I\ncannot banish ye for ever; still does my panting soul push forward, and\nlive in futurity, in the deep shades o'er which darkness hangs.--I try\nto pierce the gloom, and find a resting-place, where my thirst of\nknowledge will be gratified, and my ardent affections find an object to\nfix them. Every thing material must change; happiness and this\nfluctating principle is not compatible. Eternity, immateriality, and\nhappiness,--what are ye? How shall I grasp the mighty and fleeting\nconceptions ye create?\"\n\nAfter writing, serenely she delivered her soul into the hands of the\nFather of Spirits; and slept in peace.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXI.\n\n\nMary rose early, refreshed by the seasonable rest, and went to visit the\npoor woman, whom she found quite recovered: and, on enquiry, heard that\nshe had lately buried her husband, a common sailor; and that her only\nsurviving child had been washed over-board the day before. Full of her\nown danger, she scarcely thought of her child till that was over; and\nthen she gave way to boisterous emotions.\n\nMary endeavoured to calm her at first, by sympathizing with her; and she\ntried to point out the only solid source of comfort but in doing this\nshe encountered many difficulties; she found her grossly ignorant, yet\nshe did not despair: and as the poor creature could not receive comfort\nfrom the operations of her own mind, she laboured to beguile the hours,\nwhich grief made heavy, by adapting her conversation to her capacity.\n\nThere are many minds that only receive impressions through the medium of\nthe senses: to them did Mary address herself; she made her some\npresents, and promised to assist her when they should arrive in England.\nThis employment roused her out of her late stupor, and again set the\nfaculties of her soul in motion; made the understanding contend with the\nimagination, and the heart throbbed not so irregularly during the\ncontention. How short-lived was the calm! when the English coast was\ndescried, her sorrows returned with redoubled vigor.--She was to visit\nand comfort the mother of her lost friend--And where then should she\ntake up her residence? These thoughts suspended the exertions of her\nunderstanding; abstracted reflections gave way to alarming\napprehensions; and tenderness undermined fortitude.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXII.\n\n\nIn England then landed the forlorn wanderer. She looked round for some\nfew moments--her affections were not attracted to any particular part of\nthe Island. She knew none of the inhabitants of the vast city to which\nshe was going: the mass of buildings appeared to her a huge body without\nan informing soul. As she passed through the streets in an\nhackney-coach, disgust and horror alternately filled her mind. She met\nsome women drunk; and the manners of those who attacked the sailors,\nmade her shrink into herself, and exclaim, are these my fellow\ncreatures!\n\nDetained by a number of carts near the water-side, for she came up the\nriver in the vessel, not having reason to hasten on shore, she saw\nvulgarity, dirt, and vice--her soul sickened; this was the first time\nsuch complicated misery obtruded itself on her sight.--Forgetting her\nown griefs, she gave the world a much indebted tear; mourned for a world\nin ruins. She then perceived, that great part of her comfort must arise\nfrom viewing the smiling face of nature, and be reflected from the view\nof innocent enjoyments: she was fond of seeing animals play, and could\nnot bear to see her own species sink below them.\n\nIn a little dwelling in one of the villages near London, lived the\nmother of Ann; two of her children still remained with her; but they did\nnot resemble Ann. To her house Mary directed the coach, and told the\nunfortunate mother of her loss. The poor woman, oppressed by it, and her\nmany other cares, after an inundation of tears, began to enumerate all\nher past misfortunes, and present cares. The heavy tale lasted until\nmidnight, and the impression it made on Mary's mind was so strong, that\nit banished sleep till towards morning; when tired nature sought\nforgetfulness, and the soul ceased to ruminate about many things.\n\nShe sent for the poor woman they took up at sea, provided her a lodging,\nand relieved her present necessities. A few days were spent in a kind of\nlistless way; then the mother of Ann began to enquire when she thought\nof returning home. She had hitherto treated her with the greatest\nrespect, and concealed her wonder at Mary's choosing a remote room in\nthe house near the garden, and ordering some alterations to be made, as\nif she intended living in it.\n\nMary did not choose to explain herself; had Ann lived, it is probable\nshe would never have loved Henry so fondly; but if she had, she could\nnot have talked of her passion to any human creature. She deliberated,\nand at last informed the family, that she had a reason for not living\nwith her husband, which must some time remain a secret--they stared--Not\nlive with him! how will you live then? This was a question she could not\nanswer; she had only about eighty pounds remaining, of the money she\ntook with her to Lisbon; when it was exhausted where could she get more?\nI will work, she cried, do any thing rather than be a slave.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXIII.\n\n\nUnhappy, she wandered about the village, and relieved the poor; it was\nthe only employment that eased her aching heart; she became more\nintimate with misery--the misery that rises from poverty and the want of\neducation. She was in the vicinity of a great city; the vicious poor in\nand about it must ever grieve a benevolent contemplative mind.\n\nOne evening a man who stood weeping in a little lane, near the house she\nresided in, caught her eye. She accosted him; in a confused manner, he\ninformed her, that his wife was dying, and his children crying for the\nbread he could not earn. Mary desired to be conducted to his\nhabitation; it was not very distant, and was the upper room in an old\nmansion-house, which had been once the abode of luxury. Some tattered\nshreds of rich hangings still remained, covered with cobwebs and filth;\nround the ceiling, through which the rain drop'd, was a beautiful\ncornice mouldering; and a spacious gallery was rendered dark by the\nbroken windows being blocked up; through the apertures the wind forced\nits way in hollow sounds, and reverberated along the former scene of\nfestivity.\n\nIt was crowded with inhabitants: som were scolding, others swearing, or\nsinging indecent songs. What a sight for Mary! Her blood ran cold; yet\nshe had sufficient resolution to mount to the top of the house. On the\nfloor, in one corner of a very small room, lay an emaciated figure of a\nwoman; a window over her head scarcely admitted any light, for the\nbroken panes were stuffed with dirty rags. Near her were five children,\nall young, and covered with dirt; their sallow cheeks, and languid eyes,\nexhibited none of the charms of childhood. Some were fighting, and\nothers crying for food; their yells were mixed with their mother's\ngroans, and the wind which rushed through the passage. Mary was\npetrified; but soon assuming more courage, approached the bed, and,\nregardless of the surrounding nastiness, knelt down by the poor wretch,\nand breathed the most poisonous air; for the unfortunate creature was\ndying of a putrid fever, the consequence of dirt and want.\n\nTheir state did not require much explanation. Mary sent the husband for\na poor neighbour, whom she hired to nurse the woman, and take care of\nthe children; and then went herself to buy them some necessaries at a\nshop not far distant. Her knowledge of physic had enabled her to\nprescribe for the woman; and she left the house, with a mixture of\nhorror and satisfaction.\n\nShe visited them every day, and procured them every comfort; contrary to\nher expectation, the woman began to recover; cleanliness and wholesome\nfood had a wonderful effect; and Mary saw her rising as it were from the\ngrave. Not aware of the danger she ran into, she did not think of it\ntill she perceived she had caught the fever. It made such an alarming\nprogress, that she was prevailed on to send for a physician; but the\ndisorder was so violent, that for some days it baffled his skill; and\nMary felt not her danger, as she was delirious. After the crisis, the\nsymptoms were more favourable, and she slowly recovered, without\nregaining much strength or spirits; indeed they were intolerably low:\nshe wanted a tender nurse.\n\nFor some time she had observed, that she was not treated with the same\nrespect as formerly; her favors were forgotten when no more were\nexpected. This ingratitude hurt her, as did a similar instance in the\nwoman who came out of the ship. Mary had hitherto supported her; as her\nfinances were growing low, she hinted to her, that she ought to try to\nearn her own subsistence: the woman in return loaded her with abuse.\n\nTwo months were elapsed; she had not seen, or heard from Henry. He was\nsick--nay, perhaps had forgotten her; all the world was dreary, and all\nthe people ungrateful.\n\nShe sunk into apathy, and endeavouring to rouse herself out of it, she\nwrote in her book another fragment:\n\n\"Surely life is a dream, a frightful one! and after those rude,\ndisjointed images are fled, will light ever break in? Shall I ever feel\njoy? Do all suffer like me; or am I framed so as to be particularly\nsusceptible of misery? It is true, I have experienced the most rapturous\nemotions--short-lived delight!--ethereal beam, which only serves to shew\nmy present misery--yet lie still, my throbbing heart, or burst; and my\nbrain--why dost thou whirl about at such a terrifying rate? why do\nthoughts so rapidly rush into my mind, and yet when they disappear\nleave such deep traces? I could almost wish for the madman's happiness,\nand in a strong imagination lose a sense of woe.\n\n\"Oh! reason, thou boasted guide, why desert me, like the world, when I\nmost need thy assistance! Canst thou not calm this internal tumult, and\ndrive away the death-like sadness which presses so sorely on me,--a\nsadness surely very nearly allied to despair. I am now the prey of\napathy--I could wish for the former storms! a ray of hope sometimes\nillumined my path; I had a pursuit; but now _it visits not my haunts\nforlorn_. Too well have I loved my fellow creatures! I have been wounded\nby ingratitude; from every one it has something of the serpent's tooth.\n\n\"When overwhelmed by sorrow, I have met unkindness; I looked for some\none to have pity on me; but found none!--The healing balm of sympathy is\ndenied; I weep, a solitary wretch, and the hot tears scald my cheeks. I\nhave not the medicine of life, the dear chimera I have so often chased,\na friend. Shade of my loved Ann! dost thou ever visit thy poor Mary?\nRefined spirit, thou wouldst weep, could angels weep, to see her\nstruggling with passions she cannot subdue; and feelings which corrode\nher small portion of comfort!\"\n\nShe could not write any more; she wished herself far distant from all\nhuman society; a thick gloom spread itself over her mind: but did not\nmake her forget the very beings she wished to fly from. She sent for the\npoor woman she found in the garret; gave her money to clothe herself\nand children, and buy some furniture for a little hut, in a large\ngarden, the master of which agreed to employ her husband, who had been\nbred a gardener. Mary promised to visit the family, and see their new\nabode when she was able to go out.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXIV.\n\n\nMary still continued weak and low, though it was spring, and all nature\nbegan to look gay; with more than usual brightness the sun shone, and a\nlittle robin which she had cherished during the winter sung one of his\nbest songs. The family were particularly civil this fine morning, and\ntried to prevail on her to walk out. Any thing like kindness melted her;\nshe consented.\n\nSofter emotions banished her melancholy, and she directed her steps to\nthe habitation she had rendered comfortable.\n\nEmerging out of a dreary chamber, all nature looked cheerful; when she\nhad last walked out, snow covered the ground, and bleak winds pierced\nher through and through: now the hedges were green, the blossoms adorned\nthe trees, and the birds sung. She reached the dwelling, without being\nmuch exhausted and while she rested there, observed the children\nsporting on the grass, with improved complexions. The mother with tears\nthanked her deliverer, and pointed out her comforts. Mary's tears flowed\nnot only from sympathy, but a complication of feelings and recollections\nthe affections which bound her to her fellow creatures began again to\nplay, and reanimated nature. She observed the change in herself, tried\nto account for it, and wrote with her pencil a rhapsody on sensibility.\n\n\"Sensibility is the most exquisite feeling of which the human soul is\nsusceptible: when it pervades us, we feel happy; and could it last\nunmixed, we might form some conjecture of the bliss of those\nparadisiacal days, when the obedient passions were under the dominion of\nreason, and the impulses of the heart did not need correction.\n\n\"It is this quickness, this delicacy of feeling, which enables us to\nrelish the sublime touches of the poet, and the painter; it is this,\nwhich expands the soul, gives an enthusiastic greatness, mixed with\ntenderness, when we view the magnificent objects of nature; or hear of a\ngood action. The same effect we experience in the spring, when we hail\nthe returning sun, and the consequent renovation of nature; when the\nflowers unfold themselves, and exhale their sweets, and the voice of\nmusic is heard in the land. Softened by tenderness; the soul is\ndisposed to be virtuous. Is any sensual gratification to be compared to\nthat of feelings the eves moistened after having comforted the\nunfortunate?\n\n\"Sensibility is indeed the foundation of all our happiness; but these\nraptures are unknown to the depraved sensualist, who is only moved by\nwhat strikes his gross senses; the delicate embellishments of nature\nescape his notice; as do the gentle and interesting affections.--But it\nis only to be felt; it escapes discussion.\"\n\nShe then returned home, and partook of the family meal, which was\nrendered more cheerful by the presence of a man, past the meridian of\nlife, of polished manners, and dazzling wit. He endeavoured to draw Mary\nout, and succeeded; she entered into conversation, and some of her\nartless flights of genius struck him with surprise; he found she had a\ncapacious mind, and that her reason was as profound as her imagination\nwas lively. She glanced from earth to heaven, and caught the light of\ntruth. Her expressive countenance shewed what passed in her mind, and\nher tongue was ever the faithful interpreter of her heart; duplicity\nnever threw a shade over her words or actions. Mary found him a man of\nlearning; and the exercise of her understanding would frequently make\nher forget her griefs, when nothing else could, except benevolence.\n\nThis man had known the mistress of the house in her youth; good nature\ninduced him to visit her; but when he saw Mary he had another\ninducement. Her appearance, and above all, her genius, and cultivation\nof mind, roused his curiosity; but her dignified manners had such an\neffect on him, he was obliged to suppress it. He knew men, as well as\nbooks; his conversation was entertaining and improving. In Mary's\ncompany he doubted whether heaven was peopled with spirits masculine;\nand almost forgot that he had called the sex \"the pretty play things\nthat render life tolerable.\"\n\nHe had been the slave of beauty, the captive of sense; love he ne'er had\nfelt; the mind never rivetted the chain, nor had the purity of it made\nthe body appear lovely in his eyes. He was humane, despised meanness;\nbut was vain of his abilities, and by no means a useful member of\nsociety. He talked often of the beauty of virtue; but not having any\nsolid foundation to build the practice on, he was only a shining, or\nrather a sparkling character: and though his fortune enabled him to\nhunt down pleasure, he was discontented.\n\nMary observed his character, and wrote down a train of reflections,\nwhich these observations led her to make; these reflections received a\ntinge from her mind; the present state of it, was that kind of painful\nquietness which arises from reason clouded by disgust; she had not yet\nlearned to be resigned; vague hopes agitated her.\n\n\"There are some subjects that are so enveloped in clouds, as you\ndissipate one, another overspreads it. Of this kind are our reasonings\nconcerning happiness; till we are obliged to cry out with the Apostle,\n_That it hath not entered into the heart of man to conceive in what it\ncould consist_, or how satiety could be prevented. Man seems formed for\naction, though the passions are seldom properly managed; they are\neither so languid as not to serve as a spur, or else so violent, as to\noverleap all bounds.\n\n\"Every individual has its own peculiar trials; and anguish, in one shape\nor other, visits every heart. Sensibility produces flights of virtue;\nand not curbed by reason, is on the brink of vice talking, and even\nthinking of virtue.\n\n\"Christianity can only afford just principles to govern the wayward\nfeelings and impulses of the heart: every good disposition runs wild, if\nnot transplanted into this soil; but how hard is it to keep the heart\ndiligently, though convinced that the issues of life depend on it.\n\n\"It is very difficult to discipline the mind of a thinker, or reconcile\nhim to the weakness, the inconsistency of his understanding; and a\nstill more laborious task for him to conquer his passions, and learn to\nseek content, instead of happiness. Good dispositions, and virtuous\npropensities, without the light of the Gospel, produce eccentric\ncharacters: comet-like, they are always in extremes; while revelation\nresembles the laws of attraction, and produces uniformity; but too often\nis the attraction feeble; and the light so obscured by passion, as to\nforce the bewildered soul to fly into void space, and wander in\nconfusion.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXV.\n\n\nA few mornings after, as Mary was sitting ruminating, harassed by\nperplexing thoughts, and fears, a letter was delivered to her: the\nservant waited for an answer. Her heart palpitated; it was from Henry;\nshe held it some time in her hand, then tore it open; it was not a long\none; and only contained an account of a relapse, which prevented his\nsailing in the first packet, as he had intended. Some tender enquiries\nwere added, concerning her health, and state of mind; but they were\nexpressed in rather a formal style: it vexed her, and the more so, as it\nstopped the current of affection, which the account of his arrival and\nillness had made flow to her heart--it ceased to beat for a moment--she\nread the passage over again; but could not tell what she was hurt\nby--only that it did not answer the expectations of her affection. She\nwrote a laconic, incoherent note in return, allowing him to call on her\nthe next day--he had requested permission at the conclusion of his\nletter.\n\nHer mind was then painfully active; she could not read or walk; she\ntried to fly from herself, to forget the long hours that were yet to run\nbefore to-morrow could arrive: she knew not what time he would come;\ncertainly in the morning, she concluded; the morning then was anxiously\nwished for; and every wish produced a sigh, that arose from expectation\non the stretch, damped by fear and vain regret.\n\nTo beguile the tedious time, Henry's favorite tunes were sung; the books\nthey read together turned over; and the short epistle read at least a\nhundred times.--Any one who had seen her, would have supposed that she\nwas trying to decypher Chinese characters.\n\nAfter a sleepless night, she hailed the tardy day, watched the rising\nsun, and then listened for every footstep, and started if she heard the\nstreet door opened. At last he came, and she who had been counting the\nhours, and doubting whether the earth moved, would gladly have escaped\nthe approaching interview.\n\nWith an unequal, irresolute pace, she went to meet him; but when she\nbeheld his emaciated countenance, all the tenderness, which the\nformality of his letter had damped, returned, and a mournful\npresentiment stilled the internal conflict. She caught his hand, and\nlooking wistfully at him, exclaimed, \"Indeed, you are not well!\"\n\n\"I am very far from well; but it matters not,\" added he with a smile of\nresignation; \"my native air may work wonders, and besides, my mother is\na tender nurse, and I shall sometimes see thee.\"\n\nMary felt for the first time in her life, envy; she wished\ninvoluntarily, that all the comfort he received should be from her. She\nenquired about the symptoms of his disorder; and heard that he had been\nvery ill; she hastily drove away the fears, that former dear bought\nexperience suggested: and again and again did she repeat, that she was\nsure he would soon recover. She would then look in his face, to see if\nhe assented, and ask more questions to the same purport. She tried to\navoid speaking of herself, and Henry left her, with, a promise of\nvisiting her the next day.\n\nHer mind was now engrossed by one fear--yet she would not allow herself\nto think that she feared an event she could not name. She still saw his\npale face; the sound of his voice still vibrated on her ears; she tried\nto retain it; she listened, looked round, wept, and prayed.\n\nHenry had enlightened the desolate scene: was this charm of life to fade\naway, and, like the baseless fabric of a vision, leave not a wreck\nbehind? These thoughts disturbed her reason, she shook her head, as if\nto drive them out of it; a weight, a heavy one, was on her heart; all\nwas not well there.\n\nOut of this reverie she was soon woke to keener anguish, by the arrival\nof a letter from her husband; it came to Lisbon after her departure:\nHenry had forwarded it to her, but did not choose to deliver it\nhimself, for a very obvious reason; it might have produced a\nconversation he wished for some time to avoid; and his precaution took\nits rise almost equally from benevolence and love.\n\nShe could not muster up sufficient resolution to break the seal: her\nfears were not prophetic, for the contents gave her comfort. He informed\nher that he intended prolonging his tour, as he was now his own master,\nand wished to remain some time on the continent, and in particular to\nvisit Italy without any restraint: but his reasons for it appeared\nchildish; it was not to cultivate his taste, or tread on classic ground,\nwhere poets and philosophers caught their lore; but to join in the\nmasquerades, and such burlesque amusements.\n\nThese instances of folly relieved Mary, in some degree reconciled her\nto herself added fuel to the devouring flame--and silenced something\nlike a pang, which reason and conscience made her feel, when she\nreflected, that it is the office of Religion to reconcile us to the\nseemingly hard dispensations of providence; and that no inclination,\nhowever strong, should oblige us to desert the post assigned us, or\nforce us to forget that virtue should be an active principle; and that\nthe most desirable station, is the one that exercises our faculties,\nrefines our affections, and enables us to be useful.\n\nOne reflection continually wounded her repose; she feared not poverty;\nher wants were few; but in giving up a fortune, she gave up the power of\ncomforting the miserable, and making the sad heart sing for joy.\n\nHeaven had endowed her with uncommon humanity, to render her one of His\nbenevolent agents, a messenger of peace; and should she attend to her\nown inclinations?\n\nThese suggestions, though they could not subdue a violent passion,\nincreased her misery. One moment she was a heroine, half determined to\nbear whatever fate should inflict; the next, her mind would recoil--and\ntenderness possessed her whole soul. Some instances of Henry's\naffection, his worth and genius, were remembered: and the earth was only\na vale of tears, because he was not to sojourn with her.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXVI.\n\n\nHenry came the next day, and once or twice in the course of the\nfollowing week; but still Mary kept up some little formality, a certain\nconsciousness restrained her; and Henry did not enter on the subject\nwhich he found she wished to avoid. In the course of conversation,\nhowever, she mentioned to him, that she earnestly desired to obtain a\nplace in one of the public offices for Ann's brother, as the family were\nagain in a declining way.\n\nHenry attended, made a few enquiries, and dropped the subject; but the\nfollowing week, she heard him enter with unusual haste; it was to inform\nher, that he had made interest with a person of some consequence, whom\nhe had once obliged in a very disagreeable exigency, in a foreign\ncountry; and that he had procured a place for her friend, which would\ninfallibly lead to something better, if he behaved with propriety. Mary\ncould not speak to thank him; emotions of gratitude and love suffused\nher face; her blood eloquently spoke. She delighted to receive benefits\nthrough the medium of her fellow creatures; but to receive them from\nHenry was exquisite pleasure.\n\nAs the summer advanced, Henry grew worse; the closeness of the air, in\nthe metropolis, affected his breath; and his mother insisted on his\nfixing on some place in the country, where she would accompany him. He\ncould not think of going far off, but chose a little village on the\nbanks of the Thames, near Mary's dwelling: he then introduced her to his\nmother.\n\nThey frequently went down the river in a boat; Henry would take his\nviolin, and Mary would sometimes sing, or read, to them. She pleased his\nmother; she inchanted him. It was an advantage to Mary that friendship\nfirst possessed her heart; it opened it to all the softer sentiments of\nhumanity:--and when this first affection was torn away, a similar one\nsprung up, with a still tenderer sentiment added to it.\n\nThe last evening they were on the water, the clouds grew suddenly black,\nand broke in violent showers, which interrupted the solemn stillness\nthat had prevailed previous to it. The thunder roared; and the oars\nplying quickly, in order to reach the shore, occasioned a not\nunpleasing sound. Mary drew still nearer Henry; she wished to have\nsought with him a watry grave; to have escaped the horror of surviving\nhim.--She spoke not, but Henry saw the workings of her mind--he felt\nthem; threw his arm round her waist--and they enjoyed the luxury of\nwretchedness.--As they touched the shore, Mary perceived that Henry was\nwet; with eager anxiety she cried, What shall I do!--this day will kill\nthee, and I shall not die with thee!\n\nThis accident put a stop to their pleasurable excursions; it had injured\nhim, and brought on the spitting of blood he was subject to--perhaps it\nwas not the cold that he caught, that occasioned it. In vain did Mary\ntry to shut her eyes; her fate pursued her! Henry every day grew worse\nand worse.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXVII.\n\n\nOppressed by her foreboding fears, her sore mind was hurt by new\ninstances of ingratitude: disgusted with the family, whose misfortunes\nhad often disturbed her repose, and lost in anticipated sorrow, she\nrambled she knew not where; when turning down a shady walk, she\ndiscovered her feet had taken the path they delighted to tread. She saw\nHenry sitting in his garden alone; he quickly opened the garden-gate,\nand she sat down by him.\n\n\"I did not,\" said he, \"expect to see thee this evening, my dearest Mary;\nbut I was thinking of thee. Heaven has endowed thee with an uncommon\nportion of fortitude, to support one of the most affectionate hearts in\nthe world. This is not a time for disguise; I know I am dear to\nthee--and my affection for thee is twisted with every fibre of my\nheart.--I loved thee ever since I have been acquainted with thine: thou\nart the being my fancy has delighted to form; but which I imagined\nexisted only there! In a little while the shades of death will encompass\nme--ill-fated love perhaps added strength to my disease, and smoothed\nthe rugged path. Try, my love, to fulfil thy destined course--try to add\nto thy other virtues patience. I could have wished, for thy sake, that\nwe could have died together--or that I could live to shield thee from\nthe assaults of an unfeeling world! Could I but offer thee an asylum in\nthese arms--a faithful bosom, in which thou couldst repose all thy\ngriefs--\" He pressed her to it, and she returned the pressure--he felt her\nthrobbing heart. A mournful silence ensued! when he resumed the\nconversation. \"I wished to prepare thee for the blow--too surely do I\nfeel that it will not be long delayed! The passion I have nursed is so\npure, that death cannot extinguish it--or tear away the impression thy\nvirtues have made on my soul. I would fain comfort thee--\"\n\n\"Talk not of comfort,\" interrupted Mary, \"it will be in heaven with thee\nand Ann--while I shall remain on earth the veriest wretch!\"--She grasped\nhis hand.\n\n\"There we shall meet, my love, my Mary, in our Father's--\" His voice\nfaultered; he could not finish the sentence; he was almost\nsuffocated--they both wept, their tears relieved them; they walked\nslowly to the garden-gate (Mary would not go into the house); they could\nnot say farewel when they reached it--and Mary hurried down the lane; to\nspare Henry the pain of witnessing her emotions.\n\nWhen she lost sight of the house she sat down on the ground, till it\ngrew late, thinking of all that had passed. Full of these thoughts, she\ncrept along, regardless of the descending rain; when lifting up her eyes\nto heaven, and then turning them wildly on the prospects around, without\nmarking them; she only felt that the scene accorded with her present\nstate of mind. It was the last glimmering of twilight, with a full moon,\nover which clouds continually flitted. Where am I wandering, God of\nMercy! she thought; she alluded to the wanderings of her mind. In what a\nlabyrinth am I lost! What miseries have I already encountered--and what\na number lie still before me.\n\nHer thoughts flew rapidly to something. I could be happy listening to\nhim, soothing his cares.--Would he not smile upon me--call me his own\nMary? I am not his--said she with fierceness--I am a wretch! and she\nheaved a sigh that almost broke her heart, while the big tears rolled\ndown her burning cheeks; but still her exercised mind, accustomed to\nthink, began to observe its operation, though the barrier of reason was\nalmost carried away, and all the faculties not restrained by her, were\nrunning into confusion. Wherefore am I made thus? Vain are my\nefforts--I cannot live without loving--and love leads to madness.--Yet\nI will not weep; and her eyes were now fixed by despair, dry and\nmotionless; and then quickly whirled about with a look of distraction.\n\nShe looked for hope; but found none--all was troubled waters.--No where\ncould she find rest. I have already paced to and fro in the earth; it is\nnot my abiding place--may I not too go home! Ah! no. Is this complying\nwith my Henry's request, could a spirit thus disengaged expect to\nassociate with his? Tears of tenderness strayed down her relaxed\ncountenance, and her softened heart heaved more regularly. She felt the\nrain, and turned to her solitary home.\n\nFatigued by the tumultuous emotions she had endured, when she entered\nthe house she ran to her own room, sunk on the bed; and exhausted\nnature soon closed her eyes; but active fancy was still awake, and a\nthousand fearful dreams interrupted her slumbers.\n\nFeverish and languid, she opened her eyes, and saw the unwelcome sun\ndart his rays through a window, the curtains of which she had forgotten\nto draw. The dew hung on the adjacent trees, and added to the lustre;\nthe little robin began his song, and distant birds joined. She looked;\nher countenance was still vacant--her sensibility was absorbed by one\nobject.\n\nDid I ever admire the rising sun, she slightly thought, turning from the\nWindow, and shutting her eyes: she recalled to view the last night's\nscene. His faltering voice, lingering step, and the look of tender woe,\nwere all graven on her heart; as were the words \"Could these arms\nshield thee from sorrow--afford thee an asylum from an unfeeling world.\"\nThe pressure to his bosom was not forgot. For a moment she was happy;\nbut in a long-drawn sigh every delightful sensation evaporated.\nSoon--yes, very soon, will the grave again receive all I love! and the\nremnant of my days--she could not proceed--Were there then days to come\nafter that?\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXVIII.\n\n\nJust as she was going to quit her room, to visit Henry, his mother\ncalled on her.\n\n\"My son is worse to-day,\" said she, \"I come to request you to spend not\nonly this day, but a week or two with me.--Why should I conceal any\nthing from you? Last night my child made his mother his confident, and,\nin the anguish of his heart, requested me to be thy friend--when I shall\nbe childless. I will not attempt to describe what I felt when he talked\nthus to me. If I am to lose the support of my age, and be again a\nwidow--may I call her Child whom my Henry wishes me to adopt?\"\n\nThis new instance of Henry's disinterested affection, Mary felt most\nforcibly; and striving to restrain the complicated emotions, and sooth\nthe wretched mother, she almost fainted: when the unhappy parent forced\ntears from her, by saying, \"I deserve this blow; my partial fondness\nmade me neglect him, when most he wanted a mother's care; this neglect,\nperhaps, first injured his constitution: righteous Heaven has made my\ncrime its own punishment; and now I am indeed a mother, I shall loss my\nchild--my only child!\"\n\nWhen they were a little more composed they hastened to the invalide; but\nduring the short ride, the mother related several instances of Henry's\ngoodness of heart. Mary's tears were not those of unmixed anguish; the\ndisplay of his virtues gave her extreme delight--yet human nature\nprevailed; she trembled to think they would soon unfold themselves in a\nmore genial clime.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXIX.\n\n\nShe found Henry very ill. The physician had some weeks before declared\nhe never knew a person with a similar pulse recover. Henry was certain\nhe could not live long; all the rest he could obtain, was procured by\nopiates. Mary now enjoyed the melancholy pleasure of nursing him, and\nsoftened by her tenderness the pains she could not remove. Every sigh\ndid she stifle, every tear restrain, when he could see or hear them. She\nwould boast of her resignation--yet catch eagerly at the least ray of\nhope. While he slept she would support his pillow, and rest her head\nwhere she could feel his breath. She loved him better than herself--she\ncould not pray for his recovery; she could only say, The will of Heaven\nbe done.\n\nWhile she was in this state, she labored to acquire fortitude; but one\ntender look destroyed it all--she rather labored, indeed, to make him\nbelieve he was resigned, than really to be so.\n\nShe wished to receive the sacrament with him, as a bond of union which\nwas to extend beyond the grave. She did so, and received comfort from\nit; she rose above her misery.\n\nHis end was now approaching. Mary sat on the side of the bed. His eyes\nappeared fixed--no longer agitated by passion, he only felt that it was\na fearful thing to die. The soul retired to the citadel; but it was not\nnow solely filled by the image of her who in silent despair watched for\nhis last breath. Collected, a frightful calmness stilled every turbulent\nemotion.\n\nThe mother's grief was more audible. Henry had for some time only\nattended to Mary--Mary pitied the parent, whose stings of conscience\nincreased her sorrow; she whispered him, \"Thy mother weeps, disregarded\nby thee; oh! comfort her!--My mother, thy son blesses thee.--\" The\noppressed parent left the room. And Mary _waited_ to see him die.\n\nShe pressed with trembling eagerness his parched lips--he opened his\neyes again; the spreading film retired, and love returned them--he gave\na look--it was never forgotten. My Mary, will you be comforted?\n\nYes, yes, she exclaimed in a firm voice; you go to be happy--I am not a\ncomplete wretch! The words almost choked her.\n\nHe was a long time silent; the opiate produced a kind of stupor. At\nlast, in an agony, he cried, It is dark; I cannot see thee; raise me up.\nWhere is Mary? did she not say she delighted to support me? let me die\nin her arms.\n\nHer arms were opened to receive him; they trembled not. Again he was\nobliged to lie down, resting on her: as the agonies increased he leaned\ntowards her: the soul seemed flying to her, as it escaped out of its\nprison. The breathing was interrupted; she heard distinctly the last\nsigh--and lifting up to Heaven her eyes, Father, receive his spirit, she\ncalmly cried.\n\nThe attendants gathered round; she moved not, nor heard the clamor; the\nhand seemed yet to press hers; it still was warm. A ray of light from\nan opened window discovered the pale face.\n\nShe left the room, and retired to one very near it; and sitting down on\nthe floor, fixed her eyes on the door of the apartment which contained\nthe body. Every event of her life rushed across her mind with wonderful\nrapidity--yet all was still--fate had given the finishing stroke. She\nsat till midnight.--Then rose in a phrensy, went into the apartment, and\ndesired those who watched the body to retire.\n\nShe knelt by the bed side;--an enthusiastic devotion overcame the\ndictates of despair.--She prayed most ardently to be supported, and\ndedicated herself to the service of that Being into whose hands, she had\ncommitted the spirit she almost adored--again--and again,--she prayed\nwildly--and fervently--but attempting to touch the lifeless hand--her\nhead swum--she sunk--\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXX.\n\n\nThree months after, her only friend, the mother of her lost Henry began\nto be alarmed, at observing her altered appearance; and made her own\nhealth a pretext for travelling. These complaints roused Mary out of her\ntorpid state; she imagined a new duty now forced her to exert herself--a\nduty love made sacred!--\n\nThey went to Bath, from that to Bristol; but the latter place they\nquickly left; the sight of the sick that resort there, they neither of\nthem could bear. From Bristol they flew to Southampton. The road was\npleasant--yet Mary shut her eyes;--or if they were open, green fields\nand commons, passed in quick succession, and left no more traces behind\nthan if they had been waves of the sea.\n\nSome time after they were settled at Southampton, they met the man who\ntook so much notice of Mary, soon after her return to England. He\nrenewed his acquaintance; he was really interested in her fate, as he\nhad heard her uncommon story; besides, he knew her husband; knew him to\nbe a good-natured, weak man. He saw him soon after his arrival in his\nnative country, and prevented his hastening to enquire into the reasons\nof Mary's strange conduct. He desired him not to be too precipitate, if\nhe ever wished to possess an invaluable treasure. He was guided by him,\nand allowed him to follow Mary to Southampton, and speak first to her\nfriend.\n\nThis friend determined to trust to her native strength of mind, and\ninformed her of the circumstance; but she overrated it: Mary was not\nable, for a few days after the intelligence, to fix on the mode of\nconduct she ought now to pursue. But at last she conquered her disgust,\nand wrote her _husband_ an account of what had passed since she had\ndropped his correspondence.\n\nHe came in person to answer the letter. Mary fainted when he approached\nher unexpectedly. Her disgust returned with additional force, in spite\nof previous reasonings, whenever he appeared; yet she was prevailed on\nto promise to live with him, if he would permit her to pass one year,\ntravelling from place to place; he was not to accompany her.\n\nThe time too quickly elapsed, and she gave him her hand--the struggle\nwas almost more than she could endure. She tried to appear calm; time\nmellowed her grief, and mitigated her torments; but when her husband\nwould take her hand, or mention any thing like love, she would instantly\nfeel a sickness, a faintness at her heart, and wish, involuntarily, that\nthe earth would open and swallow her.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXXI.\n\n\nMary visited the continent, and sought health in different climates; but\nher nerves were not to be restored to their former state. She then\nretired to her house in the country, established manufactories, threw\nthe estate into small farms; and continually employed herself this way\nto dissipate care, and banish unavailing regret. She visited the sick,\nsupported the old, and educated the young.\n\nThese occupations engrossed her mind; but there were hours when all her\nformer woes would return and haunt her.--Whenever she did, or said, any\nthing she thought Henry would have approved of--she could not avoid\nthinking with anguish, of the rapture his approbation ever conveyed to\nher heart--a heart in which there was a void, that even benevolence and\nreligion could not fill. The latter taught her to struggle for\nresignation; and the former rendered life supportable.\n\nHer delicate state of health did not promise long life. In moments of\nsolitary sadness, a gleam of joy would dart across her mind--She thought\nshe was hastening to that world _where there is neither marrying_, nor\ngiving in marriage.", "answers": ["Because she is in unrequited love with someone else"], "length": 23316, "dataset": "narrativeqa", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "26c6325283dece0b557e34cde9a5c57999ec5c68782e8194"}

                  _110\n Till in this cave they found the lady lone,\n Sitting upon a seat of emerald stone.\n\n 9.\n And universal Pan, 'tis said, was there,\n And though none saw him,--through the adamant\n Of the deep mountains, through the trackless air,             _115\n And through those living spirits, like a want,\n He passed out of his everlasting lair\n Where the quick heart of the great world doth pant,\n And felt that wondrous lady all alone,--\n And she felt him, upon her emerald throne.                    _120\n\n 10.\n And every nymph of stream and spreading tree,\n And every shepherdess of Ocean's flocks,\n Who drives her white waves over the green sea,\n And Ocean with the brine on his gray locks,\n And quaint Priapus with his company,                          _125\n All came, much wondering how the enwombed rocks\n Could have brought forth so beautiful a birth;--\n Her love subdued their wonder and their mirth.\n\n 11.\n The herdsmen and the mountain maidens came,\n And the rude kings of pastoral Garamant--                     _130\n Their spirits shook within them, as a flame\n Stirred by the air under a cavern gaunt:\n Pigmies, and Polyphemes, by many a name,\n Centaurs, and Satyrs, and such shapes as haunt\n Wet clefts,--and lumps neither alive nor dead,                _135\n Dog-headed, bosom-eyed, and bird-footed.\n\n 12.\n For she was beautiful--her beauty made\n The bright world dim, and everything beside\n Seemed like the fleeting image of a shade:\n No thought of living spirit could abide,                      _140\n Which to her looks had ever been betrayed,\n On any object in the world so wide,\n On any hope within the circling skies,\n But on her form, and in her inmost eyes.\n\n 13.\n Which when the lady knew, she took her spindle                _145\n And twined three threads of fleecy mist, and three\n Long lines of light, such as the dawn may kindle\n The clouds and waves and mountains with; and she\n As many star-beams, ere their lamps could dwindle\n In the belated moon, wound skilfully;                         _150\n And with these threads a subtle veil she wove--\n A shadow for the splendour of her love.\n\n 14.\n The deep recesses of her odorous dwelling\n Were stored with magic treasures--sounds of air,\n Which had the power all spirits of compelling,                _155\n Folded in cells of crystal silence there;\n Such as we hear in youth, and think the feeling\n Will never die--yet ere we are aware,\n The feeling and the sound are fled and gone,\n And the regret they leave remains alone.                      _160\n\n 15.\n And there lay Visions swift, and sweet, and quaint,\n Each in its thin sheath, like a chrysalis,\n Some eager to burst forth, some weak and faint\n With the soft burthen of intensest bliss.\n It was its work to bear to many a saint                       _165\n Whose heart adores the shrine which holiest is,\n Even Love's:--and others white, green, gray, and black,\n And of all shapes--and each was at her beck.\n\n 16.\n And odours in a kind of aviary\n Of ever-blooming Eden-trees she kept,                         _170\n Clipped in a floating net, a love-sick Fairy\n Had woven from dew-beams while the moon yet slept;\n As bats at the wired window of a dairy,\n They beat their vans; and each was an adept,\n When loosed and missioned, making wings of winds,             _175\n To stir sweet thoughts or sad, in destined minds.\n\n 17.\n And liquors clear and sweet, whose healthful might\n Could medicine the sick soul to happy sleep,\n And change eternal death into a night\n Of glorious dreams--or if eyes needs must weep,               _180\n Could make their tears all wonder and delight,\n She in her crystal vials did closely keep:\n If men could drink of those clear vials, 'tis said\n The living were not envied of the dead.\n\n 18.\n Her cave was stored with scrolls of strange device,           _185\n The works of some Saturnian Archimage,\n Which taught the expiations at whose price\n Men from the Gods might win that happy age\n Too lightly lost, redeeming native vice;\n And which might quench the Earth-consuming rage               _190\n Of gold and blood--till men should live and move\n Harmonious as the sacred stars above;\n\n 19.\n And how all things that seem untameable,\n Not to be checked and not to be confined,\n Obey the spells of Wisdom's wizard skill;                     _195\n Time, earth, and fire--the ocean and the wind,\n And all their shapes--and man's imperial will;\n And other scrolls whose writings did unbind\n The inmost lore of Love--let the profane\n Tremble to ask what secrets they contain.                     _200\n\n 20.\n And wondrous works of substances unknown,\n To which the enchantment of her father's power\n Had changed those ragged blocks of savage stone,\n Were heaped in the recesses of her bower;\n Carved lamps and chalices, and vials which shone              _205\n In their own golden beams--each like a flower,\n Out of whose depth a fire-fly shakes his light\n Under a cypress in a starless night.\n\n 21.\n At first she lived alone in this wild home,\n And her own thoughts were each a minister,                    _210\n Clothing themselves, or with the ocean foam,\n Or with the wind, or with the speed of fire,\n To work whatever purposes might come\n Into her mind; such power her mighty Sire\n Had girt them with, whether to fly or run,                    _215\n Through all the regions which he shines upon.\n\n 22.\n The Ocean-nymphs and Hamadryades,\n Oreads and Naiads, with long weedy locks,\n Offered to do her bidding through the seas,\n Under the earth, and in the hollow rocks,                     _220\n And far beneath the matted roots of trees,\n And in the gnarled heart of stubborn oaks,\n So they might live for ever in the light\n Of her sweet presence--each a satellite.\n\n 23.\n 'This may not be,' the wizard maid replied;                   _225\n 'The fountains where the Naiades bedew\n Their shining hair, at length are drained and dried;\n The solid oaks forget their strength, and strew\n Their latest leaf upon the mountains wide;\n The boundless ocean like a drop of dew                        _230\n Will be consumed--the stubborn centre must\n Be scattered, like a cloud of summer dust.\n\n 24.\n 'And ye with them will perish, one by one;--\n If I must sigh to think that this shall be,\n If I must weep when the surviving Sun                         _235\n Shall smile on your decay--oh, ask not me\n To love you till your little race is run;\n I cannot die as ye must--over me\n Your leaves shall glance--the streams in which ye dwell\n Shall be my paths henceforth, and so--farewell!'--            _240\n\n 25.\n She spoke and wept:--the dark and azure well\n Sparkled beneath the shower of her bright tears,\n And every little circlet where they fell\n Flung to the cavern-roof inconstant spheres\n And intertangled lines of light:--a knell                     _245\n Of sobbing voices came upon her ears\n From those departing Forms, o'er the serene\n Of the white streams and of the forest green.\n\n 26.\n All day the wizard lady sate aloof,\n Spelling out scrolls of dread antiquity,                      _250\n Under the cavern's fountain-lighted roof;\n Or broidering the pictured poesy\n Of some high tale upon her growing woof,\n Which the sweet splendour of her smiles could dye\n In hues outshining heaven--and ever she                       _255\n Added some grace to the wrought poesy.\n\n 27.\n While on her hearth lay blazing many a piece\n Of sandal wood, rare gums, and cinnamon;\n Men scarcely know how beautiful fire is--\n Each flame of it is as a precious stone                       _260\n Dissolved in ever-moving light, and this\n Belongs to each and all who gaze upon.\n The Witch beheld it not, for in her hand\n She held a woof that dimmed the burning brand.\n\n 28.\n This lady never slept, but lay in trance                      _265\n All night within the fountain--as in sleep.\n Its emerald crags glowed in her beauty's glance;\n Through the green splendour of the water deep\n She saw the constellations reel and dance\n Like fire-flies--and withal did ever keep                     _270\n The tenour of her contemplations calm,\n With open eyes, closed feet, and folded palm.\n\n 29.\n And when the whirlwinds and the clouds descended\n From the white pinnacles of that cold hill,\n She passed at dewfall to a space extended,                    _275\n Where in a lawn of flowering asphodel\n Amid a wood of pines and cedars blended,\n There yawned an inextinguishable well\n Of crimson fire--full even to the brim,\n And overflowing all the margin trim.                          _280\n\n 30.\n Within the which she lay when the fierce war\n Of wintry winds shook that innocuous liquor\n In many a mimic moon and bearded star\n O'er woods and lawns;--the serpent heard it flicker\n In sleep, and dreaming still, he crept afar--                 _285\n And when the windless snow descended thicker\n Than autumn leaves, she watched it as it came\n Melt on the surface of the level flame.\n\n 31.\n She had a boat, which some say Vulcan wrought\n For Venus, as the chariot of her star;                        _290\n But it was found too feeble to be fraught\n With all the ardours in that sphere which are,\n And so she sold it, and Apollo bought\n And gave it to this daughter: from a car\n Changed to the fairest and the lightest boat                  _295\n Which ever upon mortal stream did float.\n\n 32.\n And others say, that, when but three hours old,\n The first-born Love out of his cradle lept,\n And clove dun Chaos with his wings of gold,\n And like a horticultural adept,                               _300\n Stole a strange seed, and wrapped it up in mould,\n And sowed it in his mother's star, and kept\n Watering it all the summer with sweet dew,\n And with his wings fanning it as it grew.\n\n 33.\n The plant grew strong and green, the snowy flower             _305\n Fell, and the long and gourd-like fruit began\n To turn the light and dew by inward power\n To its own substance; woven tracery ran\n Of light firm texture, ribbed and branching, o'er\n The solid rind, like a leaf's veined fan--                    _310\n Of which Love scooped this boat--and with soft motion\n Piloted it round the circumfluous ocean.\n\n 34.\n This boat she moored upon her fount, and lit\n A living spirit within all its frame,\n Breathing the soul of swiftness into it.                      _315\n Couched on the fountain like a panther tame,\n One of the twain at Evan's feet that sit--\n Or as on Vesta's sceptre a swift flame--\n Or on blind Homer's heart a winged thought,--\n In joyous expectation lay the boat.                           _320\n\n 35.\n Then by strange art she kneaded fire and snow\n Together, tempering the repugnant mass\n With liquid love--all things together grow\n Through which the harmony of love can pass;\n And a fair Shape out of her hands did flow--                  _325\n A living Image, which did far surpass\n In beauty that bright shape of vital stone\n Which drew the heart out of Pygmalion.\n\n 36.\n A sexless thing it was, and in its growth\n It seemed to have developed no defect                         _330\n Of either sex, yet all the grace of both,--\n In gentleness and strength its limbs were decked;\n The bosom swelled lightly with its full youth,\n The countenance was such as might select\n Some artist that his skill should never die,                  _335\n Imaging forth such perfect purity.\n\n 37.\n From its smooth shoulders hung two rapid wings,\n Fit to have borne it to the seventh sphere,\n Tipped with the speed of liquid lightenings,\n Dyed in the ardours of the atmosphere:                        _340\n She led her creature to the boiling springs\n Where the light boat was moored, and said: 'Sit here!'\n And pointed to the prow, and took her seat\n Beside the rudder, with opposing feet.\n\n 38.\n And down the streams which clove those mountains vast,        _345\n Around their inland islets, and amid\n The panther-peopled forests whose shade cast\n Darkness and odours, and a pleasure hid\n In melancholy gloom, the pinnace passed;\n By many a star-surrounded pyramid                             _350\n Of icy crag cleaving the purple sky,\n And caverns yawning round unfathomably.\n\n 39.\n The silver noon into that winding dell,\n With slanted gleam athwart the forest tops,\n Tempered like golden evening, feebly fell;                    _355\n A green and glowing light, like that which drops\n From folded lilies in which glow-worms dwell,\n When Earth over her face Night's mantle wraps;\n Between the severed mountains lay on high,\n Over the stream, a narrow rift of sky.                        _360\n\n 40.\n And ever as she went, the Image lay\n With folded wings and unawakened eyes;\n And o'er its gentle countenance did play\n The busy dreams, as thick as summer flies,\n Chasing the rapid smiles that would not stay,                 _365\n And drinking the warm tears, and the sweet sighs\n Inhaling, which, with busy murmur vain,\n They had aroused from that full heart and brain.\n\n 41.\n And ever down the prone vale, like a cloud\n Upon a stream of wind, the pinnace went:                      _370\n Now lingering on the pools, in which abode\n The calm and darkness of the deep content\n In which they paused; now o'er the shallow road\n Of white and dancing waters, all besprent\n With sand and polished pebbles:--mortal boat                  _375\n In such a shallow rapid could not float.\n\n 42.\n And down the earthquaking cataracts which shiver\n Their snow-like waters into golden air,\n Or under chasms unfathomable ever\n Sepulchre them, till in their rage they tear                  _380\n A subterranean portal for the river,\n It fled--the circling sunbows did upbear\n Its fall down the hoar precipice of spray,\n Lighting it far upon its lampless way.\n\n 43.\n And when the wizard lady would ascend                         _385\n The labyrinths of some many-winding vale,\n Which to the inmost mountain upward tend--\n She called 'Hermaphroditus!'--and the pale\n And heavy hue which slumber could extend\n Over its lips and eyes, as on the gale                        _390\n A rapid shadow from a slope of grass,\n Into the darkness of the stream did pass.\n\n 44.\n And it unfurled its heaven-coloured pinions,\n With stars of fire spotting the stream below;\n And from above into the Sun's dominions                       _395\n Flinging a glory, like the golden glow\n In which Spring clothes her emerald-winged minions,\n All interwoven with fine feathery snow\n And moonlight splendour of intensest rime,\n With which frost paints the pines in winter time.             _400\n\n 45.\n And then it winnowed the Elysian air\n Which ever hung about that lady bright,\n With its aethereal vans--and speeding there,\n Like a star up the torrent of the night,\n Or a swift eagle in the morning glare                         _405\n Breasting the whirlwind with impetuous flight,\n The pinnace, oared by those enchanted wings,\n Clove the fierce streams towards their upper springs.\n\n 46.\n The water flashed, like sunlight by the prow\n Of a noon-wandering meteor flung to Heaven;                   _410\n The still air seemed as if its waves did flow\n In tempest down the mountains; loosely driven\n The lady's radiant hair streamed to and fro:\n Beneath, the billows having vainly striven\n Indignant and impetuous, roared to feel                       _415\n The swift and steady motion of the keel.\n\n 47.\n Or, when the weary moon was in the wane,\n Or in the noon of interlunar night,\n The lady-witch in visions could not chain\n Her spirit; but sailed forth under the light                  _420\n Of shooting stars, and bade extend amain\n Its storm-outspeeding wings, the Hermaphrodite;\n She to the Austral waters took her way,\n Beyond the fabulous Thamondocana,--\n\n 48.\n Where, like a meadow which no scythe has shaven,              _425\n Which rain could never bend, or whirl-blast shake,\n With the Antarctic constellations paven,\n Canopus and his crew, lay the Austral lake--\n There she would build herself a windless haven\n Out of the clouds whose moving turrets make                   _430\n The bastions of the storm, when through the sky\n The spirits of the tempest thundered by:\n\n 49.\n A haven beneath whose translucent floor\n The tremulous stars sparkled unfathomably,\n And around which the solid vapours hoar,                      _435\n Based on the level waters, to the sky\n Lifted their dreadful crags, and like a shore\n Of wintry mountains, inaccessibly\n Hemmed in with rifts and precipices gray,\n And hanging crags, many a cove and bay.                       _440\n\n 50.\n And whilst the outer lake beneath the lash\n Of the wind's scourge, foamed like a wounded thing,\n And the incessant hail with stony clash\n Ploughed up the waters, and the flagging wing\n Of the roused cormorant in the lightning flash                _445\n Looked like the wreck of some wind-wandering\n Fragment of inky thunder-smoke--this haven\n Was as a gem to copy Heaven engraven,--\n\n 51.\n On which that lady played her many pranks,\n Circling the image of a shooting star,                        _450\n Even as a tiger on Hydaspes' banks\n Outspeeds the antelopes which speediest are,\n In her light boat; and many quips and cranks\n She played upon the water, till the car\n Of the late moon, like a sick matron wan,                     _455\n To journey from the misty east began.\n\n 52.\n And then she called out of the hollow turrets\n Of those high clouds, white, golden and vermilion,\n The armies of her ministering spirits--\n In mighty legions, million after million,                     _460\n They came, each troop emblazoning its merits\n On meteor flags; and many a proud pavilion\n Of the intertexture of the atmosphere\n They pitched upon the plain of the calm mere.\n\n 53.\n They framed the imperial tent of their great Queen            _465\n Of woven exhalations, underlaid\n With lambent lightning-fire, as may be seen\n A dome of thin and open ivory inlaid\n With crimson silk--cressets from the serene\n Hung there, and on the water for her tread                    _470\n A tapestry of fleece-like mist was strewn,\n Dyed in the beams of the ascending moon.\n\n 54.\n And on a throne o'erlaid with starlight, caught\n Upon those wandering isles of aery dew,\n Which highest shoals of mountain shipwreck not,               _475\n She sate, and heard all that had happened new\n Between the earth and moon, since they had brought\n The last intelligence--and now she grew\n Pale as that moon, lost in the watery night--\n And now she wept, and now she laughed outright.               _480\n\n 55.\n These were tame pleasures; she would often climb\n The steepest ladder of the crudded rack\n Up to some beaked cape of cloud sublime,\n And like Arion on the dolphin's back\n Ride singing through the shoreless air;--oft-time             _485\n Following the serpent lightning's winding track,\n She ran upon the platforms of the wind,\n And laughed to hear the fire-balls roar behind.\n\n 56.\n And sometimes to those streams of upper air\n Which whirl the earth in its diurnal round,                   _490\n She would ascend, and win the spirits there\n To let her join their chorus. Mortals found\n That on those days the sky was calm and fair,\n And mystic snatches of harmonious sound\n Wandered upon the earth where'er she passed,                  _495\n And happy thoughts of hope, too sweet to last.\n\n 57.\n But her choice sport was, in the hours of sleep,\n To glide adown old Nilus, where he threads\n Egypt and Aethiopia, from the steep\n Of utmost Axume, until he spreads,                            _500\n Like a calm flock of silver-fleeced sheep,\n His waters on the plain: and crested heads\n Of cities and proud temples gleam amid,\n And many a vapour-belted pyramid.\n\n 58.\n By Moeris and the Mareotid lakes,                             _505\n Strewn with faint blooms like bridal chamber floors,\n Where naked boys bridling tame water-snakes,\n Or charioteering ghastly alligators,\n Had left on the sweet waters mighty wakes\n Of those huge forms--within the brazen doors                  _510\n Of the great Labyrinth slept both boy and beast,\n Tired with the pomp of their Osirian feast.\n\n 59.\n And where within the surface of the river\n The shadows of the massy temples lie,\n And never are erased--but tremble ever                        _515\n Like things which every cloud can doom to die,\n Through lotus-paven canals, and wheresoever\n The works of man pierced that serenest sky\n With tombs, and towers, and fanes, 'twas her delight\n To wander in the shadow of the night.                         _520\n\n 60.\n With motion like the spirit of that wind\n Whose soft step deepens slumber, her light feet\n Passed through the peopled haunts of humankind.\n Scattering sweet visions from her presence sweet,\n Through fane, and palace-court, and labyrinth mined           _525\n With many a dark and subterranean street\n Under the Nile, through chambers high and deep\n She passed, observing mortals in their sleep.\n\n 61.\n A pleasure sweet doubtless it was to see\n Mortals subdued in all the shapes of sleep.                   _530\n Here lay two sister twins in infancy;\n There, a lone youth who in his dreams did weep;\n Within, two lovers linked innocently\n In their loose locks which over both did creep\n Like ivy from one stem;--and there lay calm                   _535\n Old age with snow-bright hair and folded palm.\n\n 62.\n But other troubled forms of sleep she saw,\n Not to be mirrored in a holy song--\n Distortions foul of supernatural awe,\n And pale imaginings of visioned wrong;                        _540\n And all the code of Custom's lawless law\n Written upon the brows of old and young:\n 'This,' said the wizard maiden, 'is the strife\n Which stirs the liquid surface of man's life.'\n\n 63.\n And little did the sight disturb her soul.--                  _545\n We, the weak mariners of that wide lake\n Where'er its shores extend or billows roll,\n Our course unpiloted and starless make\n O'er its wild surface to an unknown goal:--\n But she in the calm depths her way could take,                _550\n Where in bright bowers immortal forms abide\n Beneath the weltering of the restless tide.\n\n 64.\n And she saw princes couched under the glow\n Of sunlike gems; and round each temple-court\n In dormitories ranged, row after row,                         _555\n She saw the priests asleep--all of one sort--\n For all were educated to be so.--\n The peasants in their huts, and in the port\n The sailors she saw cradled on the waves,\n And the dead lulled within their dreamless graves.            _560\n\n 65.\n And all the forms in which those spirits lay\n Were to her sight like the diaphanous\n Veils, in which those sweet ladies oft array\n Their delicate limbs, who would conceal from us\n Only their scorn of all concealment: they                     _565\n Move in the light of their own beauty thus.\n But these and all now lay with sleep upon them,\n And little thought a Witch was looking on them.\n\n 66.\n She, all those human figures breathing there,\n Beheld as living spirits--to her eyes                         _570\n The naked beauty of the soul lay bare,\n And often through a rude and worn disguise\n She saw the inner form most bright and fair--\n And then she had a charm of strange device,\n Which, murmured on mute lips with tender tone,                _575\n Could make that spirit mingle with her own.\n\n 67.\n Alas! Aurora, what wouldst thou have given\n For such a charm when Tithon became gray?\n Or how much, Venus, of thy silver heaven\n Wouldst thou have yielded, ere Proserpina                     _580\n Had half (oh! why not all?) the debt forgiven\n Which dear Adonis had been doomed to pay,\n To any witch who would have taught you it?\n The Heliad doth not know its value yet.\n\n 68.\n 'Tis said in after times her spirit free                      _585\n Knew what love was, and felt itself alone--\n But holy Dian could not chaster be\n Before she stooped to kiss Endymion,\n Than now this lady--like a sexless bee\n Tasting all blossoms, and confined to none,                   _590\n Among those mortal forms, the wizard-maiden\n Passed with an eye serene and heart unladen.\n\n 69.\n To those she saw most beautiful, she gave\n Strange panacea in a crystal bowl:--\n They drank in their deep sleep of that sweet wave,            _595\n And lived thenceforward as if some control,\n Mightier than life, were in them; and the grave\n Of such, when death oppressed the weary soul,\n Was as a green and overarching bower\n Lit by the gems of many a starry flower.                      _600\n\n 70.\n For on the night when they were buried, she\n Restored the embalmers' ruining, and shook\n The light out of the funeral lamps, to be\n A mimic day within that deathy nook;\n And she unwound the woven imagery                             _605\n Of second childhood's swaddling bands, and took\n The coffin, its last cradle, from its niche,\n And threw it with contempt into a ditch.\n\n 71.\n And there the body lay, age after age.\n Mute, breathing, beating, warm, and undecaying,               _610\n Like one asleep in a green hermitage,\n With gentle smiles about its eyelids playing,\n And living in its dreams beyond the rage\n Of death or life; while they were still arraying\n In liveries ever new, the rapid, blind                        _615\n And fleeting generations of mankind.\n\n 72.\n And she would write strange dreams upon the brain\n Of those who were less beautiful, and make\n All harsh and crooked purposes more vain\n Than in the desert is the serpent's wake                      _620\n Which the sand covers--all his evil gain\n The miser in such dreams would rise and shake\n Into a beggar's lap;--the lying scribe\n Would his own lies betray without a bribe.\n\n 73.\n The priests would write an explanation full,                  _625\n Translating hieroglyphics into Greek,\n How the God Apis really was a bull,\n And nothing more; and bid the herald stick\n The same against the temple doors, and pull\n The old cant down; they licensed all to speak                 _630\n Whate'er they thought of hawks, and cats, and geese,\n By pastoral letters to each diocese.\n\n 74.\n The king would dress an ape up in his crown\n And robes, and seat him on his glorious seat,\n And on the right hand of the sunlike throne                   _635\n Would place a gaudy mock-bird to repeat\n The chatterings of the monkey.--Every one\n Of the prone courtiers crawled to kiss the feet\n Of their great Emperor, when the morning came,\n And kissed--alas, how many kiss the same!

Time is precious, and Crito\nhas come early in order to gain his consent to a plan of escape.  This can\nbe easily accomplished by his friends, who will incur no danger in making\nthe attempt to save him, but will be disgraced for ever if they allow him\nto perish.  He should think of his duty to his children, and not play into\nthe hands of his enemies.  Money is already provided by Crito as well as by\nSimmias and others, and he will have no difficulty in finding friends in\nThessaly and other places.\n\nSocrates is afraid that Crito is but pressing upon him the opinions of the\nmany:  whereas, all his life long he has followed the dictates of reason\nonly and the opinion of the one wise or skilled man.  There was a time when\nCrito himself had allowed the propriety of this.  And although some one\nwill say 'the many can kill us,' that makes no difference; but a good life,\nin other words, a just and honourable life, is alone to be valued.  All\nconsiderations of loss of reputation or injury to his children should be\ndismissed:  the only question is whether he would be right in attempting to\nescape.  Crito, who is a disinterested person not having the fear of death\nbefore his eyes, shall answer this for him.  Before he was condemned they\nhad often held discussions, in which they agreed that no man should either\ndo evil, or return evil for evil, or betray the right.  Are these\nprinciples to be altered because the circumstances of Socrates are altered?\nCrito admits that they remain the same.  Then is his escape consistent with\nthe maintenance of them?  To this Crito is unable or unwilling to reply.\n\nSocrates proceeds:--Suppose the Laws of Athens to come and remonstrate with\nhim:  they will ask 'Why does he seek to overturn them?' and if he replies,\n'they have injured him,' will not the Laws answer, 'Yes, but was that the\nagreement?  Has he any objection to make to them which would justify him in\noverturning them?  Was he not brought into the world and educated by their\nhelp, and are they not his parents?  He might have left Athens and gone\nwhere he pleased, but he has lived there for seventy years more constantly\nthan any other citizen.'  Thus he has clearly shown that he acknowledged\nthe agreement, which he cannot now break without dishonour to himself and\ndanger to his friends.  Even in the course of the trial he might have\nproposed exile as the penalty, but then he declared that he preferred death\nto exile.  And whither will he direct his footsteps?  In any well-ordered\nstate the Laws will consider him as an enemy.  Possibly in a land of\nmisrule like Thessaly he may be welcomed at first, and the unseemly\nnarrative of his escape will be regarded by the inhabitants as an amusing\ntale.  But if he offends them he will have to learn another sort of lesson.\nWill he continue to give lectures in virtue?  That would hardly be decent.\nAnd how will his children be the gainers if he takes them into Thessaly,\nand deprives them of Athenian citizenship?  Or if he leaves them behind,\ndoes he expect that they will be better taken care of by his friends\nbecause he is in Thessaly?  Will not true friends care for them equally\nwhether he is alive or dead?\n\nFinally, they exhort him to think of justice first, and of life and\nchildren afterwards.  He may now depart in peace and innocence, a sufferer\nand not a doer of evil.  But if he breaks agreements, and returns evil for\nevil, they will be angry with him while he lives; and their brethren the\nLaws of the world below will receive him as an enemy.  Such is the mystic\nvoice which is always murmuring in his ears.\n\nThat Socrates was not a good citizen was a charge made against him during\nhis lifetime, which has been often repeated in later ages.  The crimes of\nAlcibiades, Critias, and Charmides, who had been his pupils, were still\nrecent in the memory of the now restored democracy.  The fact that he had\nbeen neutral in the death-struggle of Athens was not likely to conciliate\npopular good-will.  Plato, writing probably in the next generation,\nundertakes the defence of his friend and master in this particular, not to\nthe Athenians of his day, but to posterity and the world at large.\n\nWhether such an incident ever really occurred as the visit of Crito and the\nproposal of escape is uncertain:  Plato could easily have invented far more\nthan that (Phaedr.); and in the selection of Crito, the aged friend, as the\nfittest person to make the proposal to Socrates, we seem to recognize the\nhand of the artist.  Whether any one who has been subjected by the laws of\nhis country to an unjust judgment is right in attempting to escape, is a\nthesis about which casuists might disagree.  Shelley (Prose Works) is of\nopinion that Socrates 'did well to die,' but not for the 'sophistical'\nreasons which Plato has put into his mouth.  And there would be no\ndifficulty in arguing that Socrates should have lived and preferred to a\nglorious death the good which he might still be able to perform.  'A\nrhetorician would have had much to say upon that point.'  It may be\nobserved however that Plato never intended to answer the question of\ncasuistry, but only to exhibit the ideal of patient virtue which refuses to\ndo the least evil in order to avoid the greatest, and to show his master\nmaintaining in death the opinions which he had professed in his life.  Not\n'the world,' but the 'one wise man,' is still the paradox of Socrates in\nhis last hours.  He must be guided by reason, although her conclusions may\nbe fatal to him.  The remarkable sentiment that the wicked can do neither\ngood nor evil is true, if taken in the sense, which he means, of moral\nevil; in his own words, 'they cannot make a man wise or foolish.'\n\nThis little dialogue is a perfect piece of dialectic, in which granting the\n'common principle,' there is no escaping from the conclusion.  It is\nanticipated at the beginning by the dream of Socrates and the parody of\nHomer.  The personification of the Laws, and of their brethren the Laws in\nthe world below, is one of the noblest and boldest figures of speech which\noccur in Plato.\n\n\nCRITO\n\nby\n\nPlato\n\nTranslated by Benjamin Jowett\n\n\nPERSONS OF THE DIALOGUE:  Socrates, Crito.\n\nSCENE:  The Prison of Socrates.\n\n\nSOCRATES:  Why have you come at this hour, Crito? it must be quite early.\n\nCRITO:  Yes, certainly.\n\nSOCRATES:  What is the exact time?\n\nCRITO:  The dawn is breaking.\n\nSOCRATES:  I wonder that the keeper of the prison would let you in.\n\nCRITO:  He knows me because I often come, Socrates; moreover.  I have done\nhim a kindness.\n\nSOCRATES:  And are you only just arrived?\n\nCRITO:  No, I came some time ago.\n\nSOCRATES:  Then why did you sit and say nothing, instead of at once\nawakening me?\n\nCRITO:  I should not have liked myself, Socrates, to be in such great\ntrouble and unrest as you are--indeed I should not:  I have been watching\nwith amazement your peaceful slumbers; and for that reason I did not awake\nyou, because I wished to minimize the pain.  I have always thought you to\nbe of a happy disposition; but never did I see anything like the easy,\ntranquil manner in which you bear this calamity.\n\nSOCRATES:  Why, Crito, when a man has reached my age he ought not to be\nrepining at the approach of death.\n\nCRITO:  And yet other old men find themselves in similar misfortunes, and\nage does not prevent them from repining.\n\nSOCRATES:  That is true.  But you have not told me why you come at this\nearly hour.\n\nCRITO:  I come to bring you a message which is sad and painful; not, as I\nbelieve, to yourself, but to all of us who are your friends, and saddest of\nall to me.\n\nSOCRATES:  What?  Has the ship come from Delos, on the arrival of which I\nam to die?\n\nCRITO:  No, the ship has not actually arrived, but she will probably be\nhere to-day, as persons who have come from Sunium tell me that they have\nleft her there; and therefore to-morrow, Socrates, will be the last day of\nyour life.\n\nSOCRATES:  Very well, Crito; if such is the will of God, I am willing; but\nmy belief is that there will be a delay of a day.\n\nCRITO:  Why do you think so?\n\nSOCRATES:  I will tell you.  I am to die on the day after the arrival of\nthe ship?\n\nCRITO:  Yes; that is what the authorities say.\n\nSOCRATES:  But I do not think that the ship will be here until to-morrow;\nthis I infer from a vision which I had last night, or rather only just now,\nwhen you fortunately allowed me to sleep.\n\nCRITO:  And what was the nature of the vision?\n\nSOCRATES:  There appeared to me the likeness of a woman, fair and comely,\nclothed in bright raiment, who called to me and said:  O Socrates,\n\n'The third day hence to fertile Phthia shalt thou go.'  (Homer, Il.)\n\nCRITO:  What a singular dream, Socrates!\n\nSOCRATES:  There can be no doubt about the meaning, Crito, I think.\n\nCRITO:  Yes; the meaning is only too clear.  But, oh! my beloved Socrates,\nlet me entreat you once more to take my advice and escape.  For if you die\nI shall not only lose a friend who can never be replaced, but there is\nanother evil:  people who do not know you and me will believe that I might\nhave saved you if I had been willing to give money, but that I did not\ncare.  Now, can there be a worse disgrace than this--that I should be\nthought to value money more than the life of a friend?  For the many will\nnot be persuaded that I wanted you to escape, and that you refused.\n\nSOCRATES:  But why, my dear Crito, should we care about the opinion of the\nmany?  Good men, and they are the only persons who are worth considering,\nwill think of these things truly as they occurred.\n\nCRITO:  But you see, Socrates, that the opinion of the many must be\nregarded, for what is now happening shows that they can do the greatest\nevil to any one who has lost their good opinion.\n\nSOCRATES:  I only wish it were so, Crito; and that the many could do the\ngreatest evil; for then they would also be able to do the greatest good--\nand what a fine thing this would be!  But in reality they can do neither;\nfor they cannot make a man either wise or foolish; and whatever they do is\nthe result of chance.\n\nCRITO:  Well, I will not dispute with you; but please to tell me, Socrates,\nwhether you are not acting out of regard to me and your other friends:  are\nyou not afraid that if you escape from prison we may get into trouble with\nthe informers for having stolen you away, and lose either the whole or a\ngreat part of our property; or that even a worse evil may happen to us?\nNow, if you fear on our account, be at ease; for in order to save you, we\nought surely to run this, or even a greater risk; be persuaded, then, and\ndo as I say.\n\nSOCRATES:  Yes, Crito, that is one fear which you mention, but by no means\nthe only one.\n\nCRITO:  Fear not--there are persons who are willing to get you out of\nprison at no great cost; and as for the informers they are far from being\nexorbitant in their demands--a little money will satisfy them.  My means,\nwhich are certainly ample, are at your service, and if you have a scruple\nabout spending all mine, here are strangers who will give you the use of\ntheirs; and one of them, Simmias the Theban, has brought a large sum of\nmoney for this very purpose; and Cebes and many others are prepared to\nspend their money in helping you to escape.  I say, therefore, do not\nhesitate on our account, and do not say, as you did in the court (compare\nApol.), that you will have a difficulty in knowing what to do with yourself\nanywhere else.  For men will love you in other places to which you may go,\nand not in Athens only; there are friends of mine in Thessaly, if you like\nto go to them, who will value and protect you, and no Thessalian will give\nyou any trouble.  Nor can I think that you are at all justified, Socrates,\nin betraying your own life when you might be saved; in acting thus you are\nplaying into the hands of your enemies, who are hurrying on your\ndestruction.  And further I should say that you are deserting your own\nchildren; for you might bring them up and educate them; instead of which\nyou go away and leave them, and they will have to take their chance; and if\nthey do not meet with the usual fate of orphans, there will be small thanks\nto you.  No man should bring children into the world who is unwilling to\npersevere to the end in their nurture and education.  But you appear to be\nchoosing the easier part, not the better and manlier, which would have been\nmore becoming in one who professes to care for virtue in all his actions,\nlike yourself.  And indeed, I am ashamed not only of you, but of us who are\nyour friends, when I reflect that the whole business will be attributed\nentirely to our want of courage.  The trial need never have come on, or\nmight have been managed differently; and this last act, or crowning folly,\nwill seem to have occurred through our negligence and cowardice, who might\nhave saved you, if we had been good for anything; and you might have saved\nyourself, for there was no difficulty at all.  See now, Socrates, how sad\nand discreditable are the consequences, both to us and you.  Make up your\nmind then, or rather have your mind already made up, for the time of\ndeliberation is over, and there is only one thing to be done, which must be\ndone this very night, and if we delay at all will be no longer practicable\nor possible; I beseech you therefore, Socrates, be persuaded by me, and do\nas I say.\n\nSOCRATES:  Dear Crito, your zeal is invaluable, if a right one; but if\nwrong, the greater the zeal the greater the danger; and therefore we ought\nto consider whether I shall or shall not do as you say.  For I am and\nalways have been one of those natures who must be guided by reason,\nwhatever the reason may be which upon reflection appears to me to be the\nbest; and now that this chance has befallen me, I cannot repudiate my own\nwords:  the principles which I have hitherto honoured and revered I still\nhonour, and unless we can at once find other and better principles, I am\ncertain not to agree with you; no, not even if the power of the multitude\ncould inflict many more imprisonments, confiscations, deaths, frightening\nus like children with hobgoblin terrors (compare Apol.).  What will be the\nfairest way of considering the question?  Shall I return to your old\nargument about the opinions of men?--we were saying that some of them are\nto be regarded, and others not.  Now were we right in maintaining this\nbefore I was condemned?  And has the argument which was once good now\nproved to be talk for the sake of talking--mere childish nonsense?  That is\nwhat I want to consider with your help, Crito:--whether, under my present\ncircumstances, the argument appears to be in any way different or not; and\nis to be allowed by me or disallowed.  That argument, which, as I believe,\nis maintained by many persons of authority, was to the effect, as I was\nsaying, that the opinions of some men are to be regarded, and of other men\nnot to be regarded.  Now you, Crito, are not going to die to-morrow--at\nleast, there is no human probability of this, and therefore you are\ndisinterested and not liable to be deceived by the circumstances in which\nyou are placed.  Tell me then, whether I am right in saying that some\nopinions, and the opinions of some men only, are to be valued, and that\nother opinions, and the opinions of other men, are not to be valued.  I ask\nyou whether I was right in maintaining this?\n\nCRITO:  Certainly.\n\nSOCRATES:  The good are to be regarded, and not the bad?\n\nCRITO:  Yes.\n\nSOCRATES:  And the opinions of the wise are good, and the opinions of the\nunwise are evil?\n\nCRITO:  Certainly.\n\nSOCRATES:  And what was said about another matter?  Is the pupil who\ndevotes himself to the practice of gymnastics supposed to attend to the\npraise and blame and opinion of every man, or of one man only--his\nphysician or trainer, whoever he may be?\n\nCRITO:  Of one man only.\n\nSOCRATES:  And he ought to fear the censure and welcome the praise of that\none only, and not of the many?\n\nCRITO:  Clearly so.\n\nSOCRATES:  And he ought to act and train, and eat and drink in the way\nwhich seems good to his single master who has understanding, rather than\naccording to the opinion of all other men put together?\n\nCRITO:  True.\n\nSOCRATES:  And if he disobeys and disregards the opinion and approval of\nthe one, and regards the opinion of the many who have no understanding,\nwill he not suffer evil?\n\nCRITO:  Certainly he will.\n\nSOCRATES:  And what will the evil be, whither tending and what affecting,\nin the disobedient person?\n\nCRITO:  Clearly, affecting the body; that is what is destroyed by the evil.\n\nSOCRATES:  Very good; and is not this true, Crito, of other things which we\nneed not separately enumerate?  In questions of just and unjust, fair and\nfoul, good and evil, which are the subjects of our present consultation,\nought we to follow the opinion of the many and to fear them; or the opinion\nof the one man who has understanding? ought we not to fear and reverence\nhim more than all the rest of the world:  and if we desert him shall we not\ndestroy and injure that principle in us which may be assumed to be improved\nby justice and deteriorated by injustice;--there is such a principle?\n\nCRITO:  Certainly there is, Socrates.\n\nSOCRATES:  Take a parallel instance:--if, acting under the advice of those\nwho have no understanding, we destroy that which is improved by health and\nis deteriorated by disease, would life be worth having?  And that which has\nbeen destroyed is--the body?\n\nCRITO:  Yes.\n\nSOCRATES:  Could we live, having an evil and corrupted body?\n\nCRITO:  Certainly not.\n\nSOCRATES:  And will life be worth having, if that higher part of man be\ndestroyed, which is improved by justice and depraved by injustice?  Do we\nsuppose that principle, whatever it may be in man, which has to do with\njustice and injustice, to be inferior to the body?\n\nCRITO:  Certainly not.\n\nSOCRATES:  More honourable than the body?\n\nCRITO:  Far more.\n\nSOCRATES:  Then, my friend, we must not regard what the many say of us:\nbut what he, the one man who has understanding of just and unjust, will\nsay, and what the truth will say.  And therefore you begin in error when\nyou advise that we should regard the opinion of the many about just and\nunjust, good and evil, honorable and dishonorable.--'Well,' some one will\nsay, 'but the many can kill us.'\n\nCRITO:  Yes, Socrates; that will clearly be the answer.\n\nSOCRATES:  And it is true; but still I find with surprise that the old\nargument is unshaken as ever.  And I should like to know whether I may say\nthe same of another proposition--that not life, but a good life, is to be\nchiefly valued?\n\nCRITO:  Yes, that also remains unshaken.\n\nSOCRATES:  And a good life is equivalent to a just and honorable one--that\nholds also?\n\nCRITO:  Yes, it does.\n\nSOCRATES:  From these premisses I proceed to argue the question whether I\nought or ought not to try and escape without the consent of the Athenians:\nand if I am clearly right in escaping, then I will make the attempt; but if\nnot, I will abstain.  The other considerations which you mention, of money\nand loss of character and the duty of educating one's children, are, I\nfear, only the doctrines of the multitude, who would be as ready to restore\npeople to life, if they were able, as they are to put them to death--and\nwith as little reason.  But now, since the argument has thus far prevailed,\nthe only question which remains to be considered is, whether we shall do\nrightly either in escaping or in suffering others to aid in our escape and\npaying them in money and thanks, or whether in reality we shall not do\nrightly; and if the latter, then death or any other calamity which may\nensue on my remaining here must not be allowed to enter into the\ncalculation.\n\nCRITO:  I think that you are right, Socrates; how then shall we proceed?\n\nSOCRATES:  Let us consider the matter together, and do you either refute me\nif you can, and I will be convinced; or else cease, my dear friend, from\nrepeating to me that I ought to escape against the wishes of the Athenians:\nfor I highly value your attempts to persuade me to do so, but I may not be\npersuaded against my own better judgment.  And now please to consider my\nfirst position, and try how you can best answer me.\n\nCRITO:  I will.\n\nSOCRATES:  Are we to say that we are never intentionally to do wrong, or\nthat in one way we ought and in another way we ought not to do wrong, or is\ndoing wrong always evil and dishonorable, as I was just now saying, and as\nhas been already acknowledged by us?  Are all our former admissions which\nwere made within a few days to be thrown away?  And have we, at our age,\nbeen earnestly discoursing with one another all our life long only to\ndiscover that we are no better than children?  Or, in spite of the opinion\nof the many, and in spite of consequences whether better or worse, shall we\ninsist on the truth of what was then said, that injustice is always an evil\nand dishonour to him who acts unjustly?  Shall we say so or not?\n\nCRITO:  Yes.\n\nSOCRATES:  Then we must do no wrong?\n\nCRITO:  Certainly not.\n\nSOCRATES:  Nor when injured injure in return, as the many imagine; for we\nmust injure no one at all?  (E.g. compare Rep.)\n\nCRITO:  Clearly not.\n\nSOCRATES:  Again, Crito, may we do evil?\n\nCRITO:  Surely not, Socrates.\n\nSOCRATES:  And what of doing evil in return for evil, which is the morality\nof the many--is that just or not?\n\nCRITO:  Not just.\n\nSOCRATES:  For doing evil to another is the same as injuring him?\n\nCRITO:  Very true.\n\nSOCRATES:  Then we ought not to retaliate or render evil for evil to any\none, whatever evil we may have suffered from him.  But I would have you\nconsider, Crito, whether you really mean what you are saying.  For this\nopinion has never been held, and never will be held, by any considerable\nnumber of persons; and those who are agreed and those who are not agreed\nupon this point have no common ground, and can only despise one another\nwhen they see how widely they differ.  Tell me, then, whether you agree\nwith and assent to my first principle, that neither injury nor retaliation\nnor warding off evil by evil is ever right.  And shall that be the premiss\nof our argument?  Or do you decline and dissent from this?  For so I have\never thought, and continue to think; but, if you are of another opinion,\nlet me hear what you have to say.  If, however, you remain of the same mind\nas formerly, I will proceed to the next step.\n\nCRITO:  You may proceed, for I have not changed my mind.\n\nSOCRATES:  Then I will go on to the next point, which may be put in the\nform of a question:--Ought a man to do what he admits to be right, or ought\nhe to betray the right?\n\nCRITO:  He ought to do what he thinks right.\n\nSOCRATES:  But if this is true, what is the application?  In leaving the\nprison against the will of the Athenians, do I wrong any? or rather do I\nnot wrong those whom I ought least to wrong?  Do I not desert the\nprinciples which were acknowledged by us to be just--what do you say?\n\nCRITO:  I cannot tell, Socrates, for I do not know.\n\nSOCRATES:  Then consider the matter in this way:--Imagine that I am about\nto play truant (you may call the proceeding by any name which you like),\nand the laws and the government come and interrogate me:  'Tell us,\nSocrates,' they say; 'what are you about? are you not going by an act of\nyours to overturn us--the laws, and the whole state, as far as in you lies?\nDo you imagine that a state can subsist and not be overthrown, in which the\ndecisions of law have no power, but are set aside and trampled upon by\nindividuals?'  What will be our answer, Crito, to these and the like words?\nAny one, and especially a rhetorician, will have a good deal to say on\nbehalf of the law which requires a sentence to be carried out.  He will\nargue that this law should not be set aside; and shall we reply, 'Yes; but\nthe state has injured us and given an unjust sentence.'  Suppose I say\nthat?\n\nCRITO:  Very good, Socrates.\n\nSOCRATES:  'And was that our agreement with you?' the law would answer; 'or\nwere you to abide by the sentence of the state?'  And if I were to express\nmy astonishment at their words, the law would probably add:  'Answer,\nSocrates, instead of opening your eyes--you are in the habit of asking and\nanswering questions.  Tell us,--What complaint have you to make against us\nwhich justifies you in attempting to destroy us and the state?  In the\nfirst place did we not bring you into existence?  Your father married your\nmother by our aid and begat you.  Say whether you have any objection to\nurge against those of us who regulate marriage?'  None, I should reply.\n'Or against those of us who after birth regulate the nurture and education\nof children, in which you also were trained?  Were not the laws, which have\nthe charge of education, right in commanding your father to train you in\nmusic and gymnastic?'  Right, I should reply.  'Well then, since you were\nbrought into the world and nurtured and educated by us, can you deny in the\nfirst place that you are our child and slave, as your fathers were before\nyou?  And if this is true you are not on equal terms with us; nor can you\nthink that you have a right to do to us what we are doing to you.  Would\nyou have any right to strike or revile or do any other evil to your father\nor your master, if you had one, because you have been struck or reviled by\nhim, or received some other evil at his hands?--you would not say this?\nAnd because we think right to destroy you, do you think that you have any\nright to destroy us in return, and your country as far as in you lies?\nWill you, O professor of true virtue, pretend that you are justified in\nthis?  Has a philosopher like you failed to discover that our country is\nmore to be valued and higher and holier far than mother or father or any\nancestor, and more to be regarded in the eyes of the gods and of men of\nunderstanding? also to be soothed, and gently and reverently entreated when\nangry, even more than a father, and either to be persuaded, or if not\npersuaded, to be obeyed?  And when we are punished by her, whether with\nimprisonment or stripes, the punishment is to be endured in silence; and if\nshe lead us to wounds or death in battle, thither we follow as is right;\nneither may any one yield or retreat or leave his rank, but whether in\nbattle or in a court of law, or in any other place, he must do what his\ncity and his country order him; or he must change their view of what is\njust:  and if he may do no violence to his father or mother, much less may\nhe do violence to his country.'  What answer shall we make to this, Crito?\nDo the laws speak truly, or do they not?\n\nCRITO:  I think that they do.\n\nSOCRATES:  Then the laws will say:  'Consider, Socrates, if we are speaking\ntruly that in your present attempt you are going to do us an injury.  For,\nhaving brought you into the world, and nurtured and educated you, and given\nyou and every other citizen a share in every good which we had to give, we\nfurther proclaim to any Athenian by the liberty which we allow him, that if\nhe does not like us when he has become of age and has seen the ways of the\ncity, and made our acquaintance, he may go where he pleases and take his\ngoods with him.  None of us laws will forbid him or interfere with him.\nAny one who does not like us and the city, and who wants to emigrate to a\ncolony or to any other city, may go where he likes, retaining his property.\nBut he who has experience of the manner in which we order justice and\nadminister the state, and still remains, has entered into an implied\ncontract that he will do as we command him.  And he who disobeys us is, as\nwe maintain, thrice wrong:  first, because in disobeying us he is\ndisobeying his parents; secondly, because we are the authors of his\neducation; thirdly, because he has made an agreement with us that he will\nduly obey our commands; and he neither obeys them nor convinces us that our\ncommands are unjust; and we do not rudely impose them, but give him the\nalternative of obeying or convincing us;--that is what we offer, and he\ndoes neither.\n\n'These are the sort of accusations to which, as we were saying, you,\nSocrates, will be exposed if you accomplish your intentions; you, above all\nother Athenians.'  Suppose now I ask, why I rather than anybody else? they\nwill justly retort upon me that I above all other men have acknowledged the\nagreement.  'There is clear proof,' they will say, 'Socrates, that we and\nthe city were not displeasing to you.  Of all Athenians you have been the\nmost constant resident in the city, which, as you never leave, you may be\nsupposed to love (compare Phaedr.).  For you never went out of the city\neither to see the games, except once when you went to the Isthmus, or to\nany other place unless when you were on military service; nor did you\ntravel as other men do.  Nor had you any curiosity to know other states or\ntheir laws:  your affections did not go beyond us and our state; we were\nyour especial favourites, and you acquiesced in our government of you; and\nhere in this city you begat your children, which is a proof of your\nsatisfaction.  Moreover, you might in the course of the trial, if you had\nliked, have fixed the penalty at banishment; the state which refuses to let\nyou go now would have let you go then.  But you pretended that you\npreferred death to exile (compare Apol.), and that you were not unwilling\nto die.  And now you have forgotten these fine sentiments, and pay no\nrespect to us the laws, of whom you are the destroyer; and are doing what\nonly a miserable slave would do, running away and turning your back upon\nthe compacts and agreements which you made as a citizen.  And first of all\nanswer this very question:  Are we right in saying that you agreed to be\ngoverned according to us in deed, and not in word only?  Is that true or\nnot?'  How shall we answer, Crito?  Must we not assent?\n\nCRITO:  We cannot help it, Socrates.\n\nSOCRATES:  Then will they not say:  'You, Socrates, are breaking the\ncovenants and agreements which you made with us at your leisure, not in any\nhaste or under any compulsion or deception, but after you have had seventy\nyears to think of them, during which time you were at liberty to leave the\ncity, if we were not to your mind, or if our covenants appeared to you to\nbe unfair.  You had your choice, and might have gone either to Lacedaemon\nor Crete, both which states are often praised by you for their good\ngovernment, or to some other Hellenic or foreign state.  Whereas you, above\nall other Athenians, seemed to be so fond of the state, or, in other words,\nof us her laws (and who would care about a state which has no laws?), that\nyou never stirred out of her; the halt, the blind, the maimed, were not\nmore stationary in her than you were.  And now you run away and forsake\nyour agreements.  Not so, Socrates, if you will take our advice; do not\nmake yourself ridiculous by escaping out of the city.\n\n'For just consider, if you transgress and err in this sort of way, what\ngood will you do either to yourself or to your friends?  That your friends\nwill be driven into exile and deprived of citizenship, or will lose their\nproperty, is tolerably certain; and you yourself, if you fly to one of the\nneighbouring cities, as, for example, Thebes or Megara, both of which are\nwell governed, will come to them as an enemy, Socrates, and their\ngovernment will be against you, and all patriotic citizens will cast an\nevil eye upon you as a subverter of the laws, and you will confirm in the\nminds of the judges the justice of their own condemnation of you.  For he\nwho is a corrupter of the laws is more than likely to be a corrupter of the\nyoung and foolish portion of mankind.  Will you then flee from well-ordered\ncities and virtuous men? and is existence worth having on these terms?  Or\nwill you go to them without shame, and talk to them, Socrates?  And what\nwill you say to them?  What you say here about virtue and justice and\ninstitutions and laws being the best things among men?  Would that be\ndecent of you?  Surely not.  But if you go away from well-governed states\nto Crito's friends in Thessaly, where there is great disorder and licence,\nthey will be charmed to hear the tale of your escape from prison, set off\nwith ludicrous particulars of the manner in which you were wrapped in a\ngoatskin or some other disguise, and metamorphosed as the manner is of\nrunaways; but will there be no one to remind you that in your old age you\nwere not ashamed to violate the most sacred laws from a miserable desire of\na little more life?  Perhaps not, if you keep them in a good temper; but if\nthey are out of temper you will hear many degrading things; you will live,\nbut how?--as the flatterer of all men, and the servant of all men; and\ndoing what?--eating and drinking in Thessaly, having gone abroad in order\nthat you may get a dinner.  And where will be your fine sentiments about\njustice and virtue?  Say that you wish to live for the sake of your\nchildren--you want to bring them up and educate them--will you take them\ninto Thessaly and deprive them of Athenian citizenship?  Is this the\nbenefit which you will confer upon them?  Or are you under the impression\nthat they will be better cared for and educated here if you are still\nalive, although absent from them; for your friends will take care of them?\nDo you fancy that if you are an inhabitant of Thessaly they will take care\nof them, and if you are an inhabitant of the other world that they will not\ntake care of them?  Nay; but if they who call themselves friends are good\nfor anything, they will--to be sure they will.\n\n'Listen, then, Socrates, to us who have brought you up.  Think not of life\nand children first, and of justice afterwards, but of justice first, that\nyou may be justified before the princes of the world below.  For neither\nwill you nor any that belong to you be happier or holier or juster in this\nlife, or happier in another, if you do as Crito bids.  Now you depart in\ninnocence, a sufferer and not a doer of evil; a victim, not of the laws,\nbut of men.  But if you go forth, returning evil for evil, and injury for\ninjury, breaking the covenants and agreements which you have made with us,\nand wronging those whom you ought least of all to wrong, that is to say,\nyourself, your friends, your country, and us, we shall be angry with you\nwhile you live, and our brethren, the laws in the world below, will receive\nyou as an enemy; for they will know that you have done your best to destroy\nus.  Listen, then, to us and not to Crito.'\n\nThis, dear Crito, is the voice which I seem to hear murmuring in my ears,\nlike the sound of the flute in the ears of the mystic; that voice, I say,\nis humming in my ears, and prevents me from hearing any other.  And I know\nthat anything more which you may say will be vain.  Yet speak, if you have\nanything to say.\n\nCRITO:  I have nothing to say, Socrates.\n\nSOCRATES:  Leave me then, Crito, to fulfil the will of God, and to follow\nwhither he leads.", "answers": ["To smuggle Socrates out of prison and into a life of exile."], "length": 6592, "dataset": "narrativeqa", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "68fc4dee839213b5259d41718909195c2f5274665bc18036"}

How Otto Saw the Great Emperor,\n\n\n\n\nFOREWORD.\n\nBetween the far away past history of the world, and that which lies near\nto us; in the time when the wisdom of the ancient times was dead and\nhad passed away, and our own days of light had not yet come, there lay a\ngreat black gulf in human history, a gulf of ignorance, of superstition,\nof cruelty, and of wickedness.\n\nThat time we call the dark or middle ages.\n\nFew records remain to us of that dreadful period in our world's history,\nand we only know of it through broken and disjointed fragments that have\nbeen handed down to us through the generations.\n\nYet, though the world's life then was so wicked and black, there yet\nremained a few good men and women here and there (mostly in peaceful\nand quiet monasteries, far from the thunder and the glare of the worlds\nbloody battle), who knew the right and the truth and lived according to\nwhat they knew; who preserved and tenderly cared for the truths that the\ndear Christ taught, and lived and died for in Palestine so long ago.\n\nThis tale that I am about to tell is of a little boy who lived and\nsuffered in those dark middle ages; of how he saw both the good and the\nbad of men, and of how, by gentleness and love and not by strife and\nhatred, he came at last to stand above other men and to be looked up to\nby all. And should you follow the story to the end, I hope you may find\nit a pleasure, as I have done, to ramble through those dark ancient\ncastles, to lie with little Otto and Brother John in the high\nbelfry-tower, or to sit with them in the peaceful quiet of the sunny\nold monastery garden, for, of all the story, I love best those early\npeaceful years that little Otto spent in the dear old White Cross on the\nHill.\n\nPoor little Otto's life was a stony and a thorny pathway, and it is well\nfor all of us nowadays that we walk it in fancy and not in truth.\n\n\n\n\nI. The Dragon's House.\n\nUp from the gray rocks, rising sheer and bold and bare, stood the walls\nand towers of Castle Drachenhausen. A great gate-way, with a heavy\niron-pointed portcullis hanging suspended in the dim arch above, yawned\nblackly upon the bascule or falling drawbridge that spanned a chasm\nbetween the blank stone walls and the roadway that winding down the\nsteep rocky slope to the little valley just beneath. There in the lap of\nthe hills around stood the wretched straw-thatched huts of the peasants\nbelonging to the castle--miserable serfs who, half timid, half fierce,\ntilled their poor patches of ground, wrenching from the hard soil barely\nenough to keep body and soul together. Among those vile hovels played\nthe little children like foxes about their dens, their wild, fierce eyes\npeering out from under a mat of tangled yellow hair.\n\nBeyond these squalid huts lay the rushing, foaming river, spanned by a\nhigh, rude, stone bridge where the road from the castle crossed it, and\nbeyond the river stretched the great, black forest, within whose gloomy\ndepths the savage wild beasts made their lair, and where in winter time\nthe howling wolves coursed their flying prey across the moonlit snow and\nunder the net-work of the black shadows from the naked boughs above.\n\nThe watchman in the cold, windy bartizan or watch-tower that clung to\nthe gray walls above the castle gateway, looked from his narrow window,\nwhere the wind piped and hummed, across the tree-tops that rolled in\nendless billows of green, over hill and over valley to the blue and\ndistant slope of the Keiserberg, where, on the mountain side, glimmered\nfar away the walls of Castle Trutz-Drachen.\n\nWithin the massive stone walls through which the gaping gateway led,\nthree great cheerless brick buildings, so forbidding that even the\nyellow sunlight could not light them into brightness, looked down, with\nrow upon row of windows, upon three sides of the bleak, stone courtyard.\nBack of and above them clustered a jumble of other buildings, tower and\nturret, one high-peaked roof overtopping another.\n\nThe great house in the centre was the Baron's Hall, the part to the left\nwas called the Roderhausen; between the two stood a huge square pile,\nrising dizzily up into the clear air high above the rest--the great\nMelchior Tower.\n\nAt the top clustered a jumble of buildings hanging high aloft in the\nwindy space a crooked wooden belfry, a tall, narrow watch-tower, and a\nrude wooden house that clung partly to the roof of the great tower and\npartly to the walls.\n\nFrom the chimney of this crazy hut a thin thread of smoke would now and\nthen rise into the air, for there were folk living far up in that empty,\nairy desert, and oftentimes wild, uncouth little children were seen\nplaying on the edge of the dizzy height, or sitting with their bare\nlegs hanging down over the sheer depths, as they gazed below at what was\ngoing on in the court-yard. There they sat, just as little children in\nthe town might sit upon their father's door-step; and as the sparrows\nmight fly around the feet of the little town children, so the circling\nflocks of rooks and daws flew around the feet of these air-born\ncreatures.\n\nIt was Schwartz Carl and his wife and little ones who lived far up there\nin the Melchior Tower, for it overlooked the top of the hill behind the\ncastle and so down into the valley upon the further side. There, day\nafter day, Schwartz Carl kept watch upon the gray road that ran like a\nribbon through the valley, from the rich town of Gruenstaldt to the rich\ntown of Staffenburgen, where passed merchant caravans from the one to\nthe other--for the lord of Drachenhausen was a robber baron.\n\nDong! Dong! The great alarm bell would suddenly ring out from the belfry\nhigh up upon the Melchior Tower. Dong! Dong! Till the rooks and daws\nwhirled clamoring and screaming. Dong! Dong! Till the fierce wolf-hounds\nin the rocky kennels behind the castle stables howled dismally in\nanswer. Dong! Dong!--Dong! Dong!\n\nThen would follow a great noise and uproar and hurry in the castle\ncourt-yard below; men shouting and calling to one another, the ringing\nof armor, and the clatter of horses' hoofs upon the hard stone. With the\ncreaking and groaning of the windlass the iron-pointed portcullis would\nbe slowly raised, and with a clank and rattle and clash of iron chains\nthe drawbridge would fall crashing. Then over it would thunder horse and\nman, clattering away down the winding, stony pathway, until the great\nforest would swallow them, and they would be gone.\n\nThen for a while peace would fall upon the castle courtyard, the cock\nwould crow, the cook would scold a lazy maid, and Gretchen, leaning out\nof a window, would sing a snatch of a song, just as though it were a\npeaceful farm-house, instead of a den of robbers.\n\nMaybe it would be evening before the men would return once more. Perhaps\none would have a bloody cloth bound about his head, perhaps one would\ncarry his arm in a sling; perhaps one--maybe more than one--would be\nleft behind, never to return again, and soon forgotten by all excepting\nsome poor woman who would weep silently in the loneliness of her daily\nwork.\n\nNearly always the adventurers would bring back with them pack-horses\nladen with bales of goods. Sometimes, besides these, they would return\nwith a poor soul, his hands tied behind his back and his feet beneath\nthe horse's body, his fur cloak and his flat cap wofully awry. A while\nhe would disappear in some gloomy cell of the dungeon-keep, until an\nenvoy would come from the town with a fat purse, when his ransom would\nbe paid, the dungeon would disgorge him, and he would be allowed to go\nupon his way again.\n\nOne man always rode beside Baron Conrad in his expeditions and\nadventures a short, deep-chested, broad-shouldered man, with sinewy arms\nso long that when he stood his hands hung nearly to his knees.\n\nHis coarse, close-clipped hair came so low upon his brow that only a\nstrip of forehead showed between it and his bushy, black eyebrows. One\neye was blind; the other twinkled and gleamed like a spark under the\npenthouse of his brows. Many folk said that the one-eyed Hans had drunk\nbeer with the Hill-man, who had given him the strength of ten, for he\ncould bend an iron spit like a hazel twig, and could lift a barrel of\nwine from the floor to his head as easily as though it were a basket of\neggs.\n\nAs for the one-eyed Hans he never said that he had not drunk beer with\nthe Hill-man, for he liked the credit that such reports gave him with\nthe other folk. And so, like a half savage mastiff, faithful to death\nto his master, but to him alone, he went his sullen way and lived his\nsullen life within the castle walls, half respected, half feared by the\nother inmates, for it was dangerous trifling with the one-eyed Hans.\n\n\n\n\nII. How the Baron went Forth to Shear.\n\nBaron Conrad and Baroness Matilda sat together at their morning meal\nbelow their raised seats stretched the long, heavy wooden table, loaded\nwith coarse food--black bread, boiled cabbage, bacon, eggs, a great\nchine from a wild boar, sausages, such as we eat nowadays, and flagons\nand jars of beer and wine, Along the board sat ranged in the order of\nthe household the followers and retainers. Four or five slatternly women\nand girls served the others as they fed noisily at the table, moving\nhere and there behind the men with wooden or pewter dishes of food, now\nand then laughing at the jests that passed or joining in the talk. A\nhuge fire blazed and crackled and roared in the great open fireplace,\nbefore which were stretched two fierce, shaggy, wolfish-looking hounds.\nOutside, the rain beat upon the roof or ran trickling from the eaves,\nand every now and then a chill draught of wind would breathe through the\nopen windows of the great black dining-hall and set the fire roaring.\n\nAlong the dull-gray wall of stone hung pieces of armor, and swords and\nlances, and great branching antlers of the stag. Overhead arched the\nrude, heavy, oaken beams, blackened with age and smoke, and underfoot\nwas a chill pavement of stone.\n\nUpon Baron Conrad's shoulder leaned the pale, slender, yellow-haired\nBaroness, the only one in all the world with whom the fierce lord of\nDrachenhausen softened to gentleness, the only one upon whom his savage\nbrows looked kindly, and to whom his harsh voice softened with love.\n\nThe Baroness was talking to her husband in a low voice, as he looked\ndown into her pale face, with its gentle blue eyes.\n\n\"And wilt thou not, then,\" said she, \"do that one thing for me?\"\n\n\"Nay,\" he growled, in his deep voice, \"I cannot promise thee never more\nto attack the towns-people in the valley over yonder. How else could I\nlive an' I did not take from the fat town hogs to fill our own larder?\"\n\n\"Nay,\" said the Baroness, \"thou couldst live as some others do, for all\ndo not rob the burgher folk as thou dost. Alas! mishap will come upon\nthee some day, and if thou shouldst be slain, what then would come of\nme?\"\n\n\"Prut,\" said the Baron, \"thy foolish fears\" But he laid his rough, hairy\nhand softly upon the Baroness' head and stroked her yellow hair.\n\n\"For my sake, Conrad,\" whispered the Baroness.\n\nA pause followed. The Baron sat looking thoughtfully down into the\nBaroness' face. A moment more, and he might have promised what she\nbesought; a moment more, and he might have been saved all the bitter\ntrouble that was to follow. But it was not to be.\n\nSuddenly a harsh sound broke the quietness of all into a confusion of\nnoises. Dong! Dong!--it was the great alarm-bell from Melchior's Tower.\n\nThe Baron started at the sound. He sat for a moment or two with his hand\nclinched upon the arm of his seat as though about to rise, then he sunk\nback into his chair again.\n\nAll the others had risen tumultuously from the table, and now stood\nlooking at him, awaiting his orders.\n\n\"For my sake, Conrad,\" said the Baroness again.\n\nDong! Dong! rang the alarm-bell. The Baron sat with his eyes bent upon\nthe floor, scowling blackly.\n\nThe Baroness took his hand in both of hers. \"For my sake,\" she pleaded,\nand the tears filled her blue eyes as she looked up at him, \"do not go\nthis time.\"\n\nFrom the courtyard without came the sound of horses' hoofs clashing\nagainst the stone pavement, and those in the hall stood watching and\nwondering at this strange delay of the Lord Baron. Just then the door\nopened and one came pushing past the rest; it was the one-eyed Hans.\nHe came straight to where the Baron sat, and, leaning over, whispered\nsomething into his master's ear.\n\n\"For my sake,\" implored the Baroness again; but the scale was turned.\nThe Baron pushed back his chair heavily and rose to his feet. \"Forward!\"\nhe roared, in a voice of thunder, and a great shout went up in answer as\nhe strode clanking down the hall and out of the open door.\n\nThe Baroness covered her face with her hands and wept.\n\n\"Never mind, little bird,\" said old Ursela, the nurse, soothingly; \"he\nwill come back to thee again as he has come back to thee before.\"\n\nBut the poor young Baroness continued weeping with her face buried in\nher hands, because he had not done that thing she had asked.\n\nA white young face framed in yellow hair looked out into the courtyard\nfrom a window above; but if Baron Conrad of Drachenhausen saw it from\nbeneath the bars of his shining helmet, he made no sign.\n\n\"Forward,\" he cried again.\n\nDown thundered the drawbridge, and away they rode with clashing hoofs\nand ringing armor through the gray shroud of drilling rain.\n\nThe day had passed and the evening had come, and the Baroness and her\nwomen sat beside a roaring fire. All were chattering and talking and\nlaughing but two--the fair young Baroness and old Ursela; the one sat\nlistening, listening, listening, the other sat with her chin resting in\nthe palm of her hand, silently watching her young mistress. The night\nwas falling gray and chill, when suddenly the clear notes of a bugle\nrang from without the castle walls. The young Baroness started, and the\nrosy light flashed up into her pale cheeks.\n\n\"Yes, good,\" said old Ursela; \"the red fox has come back to his den\nagain, and I warrant he brings a fat town goose in his mouth; now we'll\nhave fine clothes to wear, and thou another gold chain to hang about thy\npretty neck.\"\n\nThe young Baroness laughed merrily at the old woman's speech. \"This\ntime,\" said she, \"I will choose a string of pearls like that one my aunt\nused to wear, and which I had about my neck when Conrad first saw me.\"\n\nMinute after minute passed; the Baroness sat nervously playing with a\nbracelet of golden beads about her wrist. \"How long he stays,\" said she.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Ursela; \"but it is not cousin wish that holds him by the\ncoat.\"\n\nAs she spoke, a door banged in the passageway without, and the ring of\niron footsteps sounded upon the stone floor. Clank! Clank! Clank!\n\nThe Baroness rose to her feet, her face all alight. The door opened;\nthen the flush of joy faded away and the face grew white, white, white.\nOne hand clutched the back of the bench whereon she had been sitting,\nthe other hand pressed tightly against her side.\n\nIt was Hans the one-eyed who stood in the doorway, and black trouble sat\non his brow; all were looking at him waiting.\n\n\"Conrad,\" whispered the Baroness, at last. \"Where is Conrad? Where is\nyour master?\" and even her lips were white as she spoke.\n\nThe one-eyed Hans said nothing.\n\nJust then came the noise of men s voices in the corridor and the shuffle\nand scuffle of feet carrying a heavy load. Nearer and nearer they came,\nand one-eyed Hans stood aside. Six men came struggling through the\ndoorway, carrying a litter, and on the litter lay the great Baron\nConrad. The flaming torch thrust into the iron bracket against the wall\nflashed up with the draught of air from the open door, and the light\nfell upon the white face and the closed eyes, and showed upon his body\narmor a great red stain that was not the stain of rust.\n\nSuddenly Ursela cried out in a sharp, shrill voice, \"Catch her, she\nfalls!\"\n\nIt was the Baroness.\n\nThen the old crone turned fiercely upon the one-eyed Hans. \"Thou fool!\"\nshe cried, \"why didst thou bring him here? Thou hast killed thy lady!\"\n\n\"I did not know,\" said the one-eyed Hans, stupidly.\n\n\n\n\nIII. How the Baron came Home Shorn.\n\nBut Baron Conrad was not dead. For days he lay upon his hard bed, now\nmuttering incoherent words beneath his red beard, now raving fiercely\nwith the fever of his wound. But one day he woke again to the things\nabout him.\n\nHe turned his head first to the one side and then to the other; there\nsat Schwartz Carl and the one-eyed Hans. Two or three other retainers\nstood by a great window that looked out into the courtyard beneath,\njesting and laughing together in low tones, and one lay upon the heavy\noaken bench that stood along by the wall snoring in his sleep.\n\n\"Where is your lady?\" said the Baron, presently; \"and why is she not\nwith me at this time?\"\n\nThe man that lay upon the bench started up at the sound of his voice,\nand those at the window came hurrying to his bedside. But Schwartz Carl\nand the one-eyed Hans looked at one another, and neither of them spoke.\nThe Baron saw the look and in it read a certain meaning that brought\nhim to his elbow, though only to sink back upon his pillow again with a\ngroan.\n\n\"Why do you not answer me?\" said he at last, in a hollow voice; then\nto the one-eyed Hans, \"Hast no tongue, fool, that thou standest gaping\nthere like a fish? Answer me, where is thy mistress?\"\n\n\"I--I do not know,\" stammered poor Hans.\n\nFor a while the Baron lay silently looking from one face to the other,\nthen he spoke again. \"How long have I been lying here?\" said he.\n\n\"A sennight, my lord,\" said Master Rudolph, the steward, who had come\ninto the room and who now stood among the others at the bedside.\n\n\"A sennight,\" repeated the Baron, in a low voice, and then to Master\nRudolph, \"And has the Baroness been often beside me in that time?\"\nMaster Rudolph hesitated. \"Answer me,\" said the Baron, harshly.\n\n\"Not--not often,\" said Master Rudolph, hesitatingly.\n\nThe Baron lay silent for a long time. At last he passed his hands over\nhis face and held them there for a minute, then of a sudden, before\nanyone knew what he was about to do, he rose upon his elbow and then sat\nupright upon the bed. The green wound broke out afresh and a dark red\nspot grew and spread upon the linen wrappings; his face was drawn and\nhaggard with the pain of his moving, and his eyes wild and bloodshot.\nGreat drops of sweat gathered and stood upon his forehead as he sat\nthere swaying slightly from side to side.\n\n\"My shoes,\" said he, hoarsely.\n\nMaster Rudolph stepped forward. \"But, my Lord Baron,\" he began and then\nstopped short, for the Baron shot him such a look that his tongue stood\nstill in his head.\n\nHans saw that look out of his one eye. Down he dropped upon his knees\nand, fumbling under the bed, brought forth a pair of soft leathern\nshoes, which he slipped upon the Baron's feet and then laced the thongs\nabove the instep.\n\n\"Your shoulder,\" said the Baron. He rose slowly to his feet, gripping\nHans in the stress of his agony until the fellow winced again. For a\nmoment he stood as though gathering strength, then doggedly started\nforth upon that quest which he had set upon himself.\n\nAt the door he stopped for a moment as though overcome by his weakness,\nand there Master Nicholas, his cousin, met him; for the steward had sent\none of the retainers to tell the old man what the Baron was about to do.\n\n\"Thou must go back again, Conrad,\" said Master Nicholas; \"thou art not\nfit to be abroad.\"\n\nThe Baron answered him never a word, but he glared at him from out of\nhis bloodshot eyes and ground his teeth together. Then he started forth\nagain upon his way.\n\nDown the long hall he went, slowly and laboriously, the others following\nsilently behind him, then up the steep winding stairs, step by step,\nnow and then stopping to lean against the wall. So he reached a long\nand gloomy passageway lit only by the light of a little window at the\nfurther end.\n\nHe stopped at the door of one of the rooms that opened into this\npassage-way, stood for a moment, then he pushed it open.\n\nNo one was within but old Ursela, who sat crooning over a fire with a\nbundle upon her knees. She did not see the Baron or know that he was\nthere.\n\n\"Where is your lady?\" said he, in a hollow voice.\n\nThen the old nurse looked up with a start. \"Jesu bless us,\" cried she,\nand crossed herself.\n\n\"Where is your lady?\" said the Baron again, in the same hoarse voice;\nand then, not waiting for an answer, \"Is she dead?\"\n\nThe old woman looked at him for a minute blinking her watery eyes, and\nthen suddenly broke into a shrill, long-drawn wail. The Baron needed to\nhear no more.\n\nAs though in answer to the old woman's cry, a thin piping complaint came\nfrom the bundle in her lap.\n\nAt the sound the red blood flashed up into the Baron's face. \"What\nis that you have there?\" said he, pointing to the bundle upon the old\nwoman's knees.\n\nShe drew back the coverings and there lay a poor, weak, little baby,\nthat once again raised its faint reedy pipe.\n\n\"It is your son,\" said Ursela, \"that the dear Baroness left behind her\nwhen the holy angels took her to Paradise. She blessed him and called\nhim Otto before she left us.\"\n\n\n\n\nIV. The White Cross on the Hill.\n\nHere the glassy waters of the River Rhine, holding upon its bosom a\nmimic picture of the blue sky and white clouds floating above, runs\nsmoothly around a jutting point of land, St. Michaelsburg, rising from\nthe reedy banks of the stream, sweeps up with a smooth swell until\nit cuts sharp and clear against the sky. Stubby vineyards covered its\nearthy breast, and field and garden and orchard crowned its brow, where\nlay the Monastery of St. Michaelsburg--\"The White Cross on the Hill.\"\nThere within the white walls, where the warm yellow sunlight slept, all\nwas peaceful quietness, broken only now and then by the crowing of\nthe cock or the clamorous cackle of a hen, the lowing of kine or the\nbleating of goats, a solitary voice in prayer, the faint accord of\ndistant singing, or the resonant toll of the monastery bell from the\nhigh-peaked belfry that overlooked the hill and valley and the smooth,\nfar-winding stream. No other sounds broke the stillness, for in this\npeaceful haven was never heard the clash of armor, the ring of iron-shod\nhoofs, or the hoarse call to arms.\n\nAll men were not wicked and cruel and fierce in that dark, far-away age;\nall were not robbers and terror-spreading tyrants, even in that time\nwhen men's hands were against their neighbors, and war and rapine dwelt\nin place of peace and justice.\n\nAbbot Otto, of St. Michaelsburg, was a gentle, patient, pale-faced old\nman; his white hands were soft and smooth, and no one would have thought\nthat they could have known the harsh touch of sword-hilt and lance. And\nyet, in the days of the Emperor Frederick--the grandson of the great\nRed-beard--no one stood higher in the prowess of arms than he. But all\nat once--for why, no man could tell--a change came over him, and in the\nflower of his youth and fame and growing power he gave up everything\nin life and entered the quiet sanctuary of that white monastery on the\nhill-side, so far away from the tumult and the conflict of the world in\nwhich he had lived.\n\nSome said that it was because the lady he had loved had loved his\nbrother, and that when they were married Otto of Wolbergen had left the\nchurch with a broken heart.\n\nBut such stories are old songs that have been sung before.\n\nClatter! clatter! Jingle! jingle! It was a full-armed knight that came\nriding up the steep hill road that wound from left to right and right to\nleft amid the vineyards on the slopes of St. Michaelsburg. Polished helm\nand corselet blazed in the noon sunlight, for no knight in those days\ndared to ride the roads except in full armor. In front of him the\nsolitary knight carried a bundle wrapped in the folds of his coarse gray\ncloak.\n\nIt was a sorely sick man that rode up the heights of St. Michaelsburg.\nHis head hung upon his breast through the faintness of weariness and\npain; for it was the Baron Conrad.\n\nHe had left his bed of sickness that morning, had saddled his horse in\nthe gray dawn with his own hands, and had ridden away into the misty\ntwilight of the forest without the knowledge of anyone excepting the\nporter, who, winking and blinking in the bewilderment of his broken\nslumber, had opened the gates to the sick man, hardly knowing what he\nwas doing, until he beheld his master far away, clattering down the\nsteep bridle-path.\n\nEight leagues had he ridden that day with neither a stop nor a stay; but\nnow at last the end of his journey had come, and he drew rein under the\nshade of the great wooden gateway of St. Michaelsburg.\n\nHe reached up to the knotted rope and gave it a pull, and from within\nsounded the answering ring of the porter's bell. By and by a little\nwicket opened in the great wooden portals, and the gentle, wrinkled face\nof old Brother Benedict, the porter, peeped out at the strange iron-clad\nvisitor and the great black war-horse, streaked and wet with the sweat\nof the journey, flecked and dappled with flakes of foam. A few words\npassed between them, and then the little window was closed again; and\nwithin, the shuffling pat of the sandalled feet sounded fainter and\nfainter, as Brother Benedict bore the message from Baron Conrad to Abbot\nOtto, and the mail-clad figure was left alone, sitting there as silent\nas a statue.\n\nBy and by the footsteps sounded again; there came a noise of clattering\nchains and the rattle of the key in the lock, and the rasping of the\nbolts dragged back. Then the gate swung slowly open, and Baron Conrad\nrode into the shelter of the White Cross, and as the hoofs of his\nwar-horse clashed upon the stones of the courtyard within, the wooden\ngate swung slowly to behind him.\n\nAbbot Otto stood by the table when Baron Conrad entered the high-vaulted\nroom from the farther end. The light from the oriel window behind the\nold man shed broken rays of light upon him, and seemed to frame his thin\ngray hairs with a golden glory. His white, delicate hand rested upon the\ntable beside him, and upon some sheets of parchment covered with rows of\nancient Greek writing which he had been engaged in deciphering.\n\nClank! clank! clank! Baron Conrad strode across the stone floor, and\nthen stopped short in front of the good old man.\n\n\"What dost thou seek here, my son?\" said the Abbot.\n\n\"I seek sanctuary for my son and thy brother's grandson,\" said the Baron\nConrad, and he flung back the folds of his cloak and showed the face of\nthe sleeping babe.\n\nFor a while the Abbot said nothing, but stood gazing dreamily at\nthe baby. After a while he looked up. \"And the child's mother,\" said\nhe--\"what hath she to say at this?\"\n\n\"She hath naught to say,\" said Baron Conrad, hoarsely, and then stopped\nshort in his speech. \"She is dead,\" said he, at last, in a husky voice,\n\"and is with God's angels in paradise.\"\n\nThe Abbot looked intently in the Baron's face. \"So!\" said he, under his\nbreath, and then for the first time noticed how white and drawn was the\nBaron's face. \"Art sick thyself?\" he asked.\n\n\"Ay,\" said the Baron, \"I have come from death's door. But that is no\nmatter. Wilt thou take this little babe into sanctuary? My house is a\nvile, rough place, and not fit for such as he, and his mother with the\nblessed saints in heaven.\" And once more Conrad of Drachenhausen's face\nbegan twitching with the pain of his thoughts.\n\n\"Yes,\" said the old man, gently, \"he shall live here,\" and he stretched\nout his hands and took the babe. \"Would,\" said he, \"that all the little\nchildren in these dark times might be thus brought to the house of God,\nand there learn mercy and peace, instead of rapine and war.\"\n\nFor a while he stood looking down in silence at the baby in his arms,\nbut with his mind far away upon other things. At last he roused himself\nwith a start. \"And thou,\" said he to the Baron Conrad--\"hath not thy\nheart been chastened and softened by this? Surely thou wilt not go back\nto thy old life of rapine and extortion?\"\n\n\"Nay,\" said Baron Conrad, gruffly, \"I will rob the city swine no longer,\nfor that was the last thing that my dear one asked of me.\"\n\nThe old Abbot's face lit up with a smile. \"I am right glad that thy\nheart was softened, and that thou art willing at last to cease from war\nand violence.\"\n\n\"Nay,\" cried the Baron, roughly, \"I said nothing of ceasing from war. By\nheaven, no! I will have revenge!\" And he clashed his iron foot upon the\nfloor and clinched his fists and ground his teeth together. \"Listen,\"\nsaid he, \"and I will tell thee how my troubles happened. A fortnight ago\nI rode out upon an expedition against a caravan of fat burghers in the\nvalley of Gruenhoffen. They outnumbered us many to one, but city swine\nsuch as they are not of the stuff to stand against our kind for a long\ntime. Nevertheless, while the men-at-arms who guarded the caravan were\nstaying us with pike and cross-bow from behind a tree which they had\nfelled in front of a high bridge the others had driven the pack-horses\noff, so that by the time we had forced the bridge they were a league\nor more away. We pushed after them as hard as we were able, but when we\ncame up with them we found that they had been joined by Baron Frederick\nof Trutz-Drachen, to whom for three years and more the burghers of\nGruenstadt have been paying a tribute for his protection against others.\nThen again they made a stand, and this time the Baron Frederick himself\nwas with them. But though the dogs fought well, we were forcing them\nback, and might have got the better of them, had not my horse stumbled\nupon a sloping stone, and so fell and rolled over upon me. While I lay\nthere with my horse upon me, Baron Frederick ran me down with his lance,\nand gave me that foul wound that came so near to slaying me--and did\nslay my dear wife. Nevertheless, my men were able to bring me out from\nthat press and away, and we had bitten the Trutz-Drachen dogs so deep\nthat they were too sore to follow us, and so let us go our way in peace.\nBut when those fools of mine brought me to my castle they bore me lying\nupon a litter to my wife's chamber. There she beheld me, and, thinking\nme dead, swooned a death-swoon, so that she only lived long enough to\nbless her new-born babe and name it Otto, for you, her father's brother.\nBut, by heavens! I will have revenge, root and branch, upon that vile\ntribe, the Roderburgs of Trutz-Drachen. Their great-grandsire built that\ncastle in scorn of Baron Casper in the old days; their grandsire slew my\nfather's grandsire; Baron Nicholas slew two of our kindred; and now this\nBaron Frederick gives me that foul wound and kills my dear wife through\nmy body.\" Here the Baron stopped short; then of a sudden, shaking his\nfist above his head, he cried out in his hoarse voice: \"I swear by all\nthe saints in heaven, either the red cock shall crow over the roof of\nTrutz-Drachen or else it shall crow over my house! The black dog shall\nsit on Baron Frederick's shoulders or else he shall sit on mine!\" Again\nhe stopped, and fixing his blazing eyes upon the old man, \"Hearest thou\nthat, priest?\" said he, and broke into a great boisterous laugh.\n\nAbbot Otto sighed heavily, but he tried no further to persuade the other\ninto different thoughts.\n\n\"Thou art wounded,\" said he, at last, in a gentle voice; \"at least stay\nhere with us until thou art healed.\"\n\n\"Nay,\" said the Baron, roughly, \"I will tarry no longer than to hear\nthee promise to care for my child.\"\n\n\"I promise,\" said the Abbot; \"but lay aside thy armor, and rest.\"\n\n\"Nay,\" said the Baron, \"I go back again to-day.\"\n\nAt this the Abbot cried out in amazement: \"Sure thou, wounded man, would\nnot take that long journey without a due stay for resting! Think! Night\nwill be upon thee before thou canst reach home again, and the forests\nare beset with wolves.\"\n\nThe Baron laughed. \"Those are not the wolves I fear,\" said he. \"Urge me\nno further, I must return to-night; yet if thou hast a mind to do me a\nkindness thou canst give me some food to eat and a flask of your golden\nMichaelsburg; beyond these, I ask no further favor of any man, be he\npriest or layman.\"\n\n\"What comfort I can give thee thou shalt have,\" said the Abbot, in his\npatient voice, and so left the room to give the needful orders, bearing\nthe babe with him.\n\n\n\n\nV. How Otto Dwelt at St. Michaelsburg.\n\nSo the poor, little, motherless waif lived among the old monks at the\nWhite Cross on the hill, thriving and growing apace until he had reached\neleven or twelve years of age; a slender, fair-haired little fellow,\nwith a strange, quiet serious manner.\n\n\"Poor little child!\" Old Brother Benedict would sometimes say to the\nothers, \"poor little child! The troubles in which he was born must have\nbroken his wits like a glass cup. What think ye he said to me to-day?\n'Dear Brother Benedict,' said he, 'dost thou shave the hair off of the\ntop of thy head so that the dear God may see thy thoughts the better?'\nThink of that now!\" and the good old man shook with silent laughter.\n\nWhen such talk came to the good Father Abbot's ears, he smiled quietly\nto himself. \"It may be,\" said he, \"that the wisdom of little children\nflies higher than our heavy wits can follow.\"\n\nAt least Otto was not slow with his studies, and Brother Emmanuel,\nwho taught him his lessons, said more than once that, if his wits were\ncracked in other ways, they were sound enough in Latin.\n\nOtto, in a quaint, simple way which belonged to him, was gentle\nand obedient to all. But there was one among the Brethren of St.\nMichaelsburg whom he loved far above all the rest--Brother John, a poor\nhalf-witted fellow, of some twenty-five or thirty years of age. When\na very little child, he had fallen from his nurse's arms and hurt his\nhead, and as he grew up into boyhood, and showed that his wits had been\naddled by his fall, his family knew not what else to do with him, and\nso sent him off to the Monastery of St. Michaelsburg, where he lived\nhis simple, witless life upon a sort of sufferance, as though he were a\ntame, harmless animal.\n\nWhile Otto was still a little baby, he had been given into Brother\nJohn's care. Thereafter, and until Otto had grown old enough to care for\nhimself, poor Brother John never left his little charge, night or day.\nOftentimes the good Father Abbot, coming into the garden, where he loved\nto walk alone in his meditations, would find the poor, simple Brother\nsitting under the shade of the pear-tree, close to the bee-hives,\nrocking the little baby in his arms, singing strange, crazy songs to\nit, and gazing far away into the blue, empty sky with his curious, pale\neyes.\n\nAlthough, as Otto grew up into boyhood, his lessons and his tasks\nseparated him from Brother John, the bond between them seemed to grow\nstronger rather than weaker. During the hours that Otto had for his own\nthey were scarcely ever apart. Down in the vineyard, where the monks\nwere gathering the grapes for the vintage, in the garden, or in the\nfields, the two were always seen together, either wandering hand in\nhand, or seated in some shady nook or corner.\n\nBut most of all they loved to lie up in the airy wooden belfry; the\ngreat gaping bell hanging darkly above them, the mouldering cross-beams\nglimmering far up under the dim shadows of the roof, where dwelt a great\nbrown owl that, unfrightened at their familiar presence, stared down at\nthem with his round, solemn eyes. Below them stretched the white walls\nof the garden, beyond them the vineyard, and beyond that again the far\nshining river, that seemed to Otto's mind to lead into wonder-land.\nThere the two would lie upon the belfry floor by the hour, talking\ntogether of the strangest things.\n\n\"I saw the dear Angel Gabriel again yester morn,\" said Brother John.\n\n\"So!\" says Otto, seriously; \"and where was that?\"\n\n\"It was out in the garden, in the old apple-tree,\" said Brother John. \"I\nwas walking there, and my wits were running around in the grass like a\nmouse. What heard I but a wonderful sound of singing, and it was like\nthe hum of a great bee, only sweeter than honey. So I looked up into the\ntree, and there I saw two sparks. I thought at first that they were\ntwo stars that had fallen out of heaven; but what think you they were,\nlittle child?\"\n\n\"I do not know,\" said Otto, breathlessly.\n\n\"They were angel's eyes,\" said Brother John; and he smiled in the\nstrangest way, as he gazed up into the blue sky. \"So I looked at the two\nsparks and felt happy, as one does in spring time when the cold weather\nis gone, and the warm sun shines, and the cuckoo sings again. Then,\nby-and-by, I saw the face to which the eyes belonged. First, it shone\nwhite and thin like the moon in the daylight; but it grew brighter and\nbrighter, until it hurt one's eyes to look at it, as though it had been\nthe blessed sun itself. Angel Gabriel's hand was as white as silver, and\nin it he held a green bough with blossoms, like those that grow on the\nthorn bush. As for his robe, it was all of one piece, and finer than the\nFather Abbot's linen, and shone beside like the sunlight on pure snow.\nSo I knew from all these things that it was the blessed Angel Gabriel.\"\n\n\"What do they say about this tree, Brother John?\" said he to me.\n\n\"They say it is dying, my Lord Angel,\" said I, \"and that the gardener\nwill bring a sharp axe and cut it down.\"\n\n\"'And what dost thou say about it, Brother John?' said he.\"\n\n\"'I also say yes, and that it is dying,' said I.\"\n\n\"At that he smiled until his face shone so bright that I had to shut my\neyes.\"\n\n\"'Now I begin to believe, Brother John, that thou art as foolish as men\nsay,' said he. 'Look, till I show thee.' And thereat I opened mine eyes\nagain.\"\n\n\"Then Angel Gabriel touched the dead branches with the flowery twig that\nhe held in his hand, and there was the dead wood all covered with green\nleaves, and fair blossoms and beautiful apples as yellow as gold. Each\nsmelling more sweetly than a garden of flowers, and better to the taste\nthan white bread and honey.\n\n\"'They are souls of the apples,' said the good Angel,' and they can\nnever wither and die.'\n\n\"'Then I'll tell the gardener that he shall not cut the tree down,' said\nI.\"\n\n\"'No, no,' said the dear Gabriel, 'that will never do, for if the tree\nis not cut down here on the earth, it can never be planted in paradise.'\"\n\nHere Brother John stopped short in his story, and began singing one of\nhis crazy songs, as he gazed with his pale eyes far away into nothing at\nall.\n\n\"But tell me, Brother John,\" said little Otto, in a hushed voice, \"what\nelse did the good Angel say to thee?\"\n\nBrother John stopped short in his song and began looking from right to\nleft, and up and down, as though to gather his wits.\n\n\"So!\" said he, \"there was something else that he told me. Tschk! If I\ncould but think now. Yes, good! This is it--'Nothing that has lived,'\nsaid he, 'shall ever die, and nothing that has died shall ever live.'\"\n\nOtto drew a deep breath. \"I would that I might see the beautiful Angel\nGabriel sometime,\" said he; but Brother John was singing again and did\nnot seem to hear what he said.\n\nNext to Brother John, the nearest one to the little child was the good\nAbbot Otto, for though he had never seen wonderful things with the eyes\nof his soul, such as Brother John's had beheld, and so could not tell of\nthem, he was yet able to give little Otto another pleasure that no one\nelse could give.\n\nHe was a great lover of books, the old Abbot, and had under lock and key\nwonderful and beautiful volumes, bound in hog-skin and metal, and with\ncovers inlaid with carved ivory, or studded with precious stones. But\nwithin these covers, beautiful as they were, lay the real wonder of the\nbooks, like the soul in the body; for there, beside the black letters\nand initials, gay with red and blue and gold, were beautiful pictures\npainted upon the creamy parchment. Saints and Angels, the Blessed Virgin\nwith the golden oriole about her head, good St. Joseph, the three Kings;\nthe simple Shepherds kneeling in the fields, while Angels with glories\nabout their brow called to the poor Peasants from the blue sky above.\nBut, most beautiful of all was the picture of the Christ Child lying in\nthe manger, with the mild-eyed Kine gazing at him.\n\nSometimes the old Abbot would unlock the iron-bound chest where these\ntreasures lay hidden, and carefully and lovingly brushing the few grains\nof dust from them, would lay them upon the table beside the oriel window\nin front of his little namesake, allowing the little boy freedom to turn\nthe leaves as he chose.\n\nAlways it was one picture that little Otto sought; the Christ Child in\nthe manger, with the Virgin, St. Joseph, the Shepherds, and the Kine.\nAnd as he would hang breathlessly gazing and gazing upon it, the old\nAbbot would sit watching him with a faint, half-sad smile flickering\naround his thin lips and his pale, narrow face.\n\nIt was a pleasant, peaceful life, but by-and-by the end came. Otto was\nnow nearly twelve years old.\n\nOne bright, clear day, near the hour of noon, little Otto heard the\nporter's bell sounding below in the court-yard--dong! dong! Brother\nEmmanuel had been appointed as the boy's instructor, and just then Otto\nwas conning his lessons in the good monk's cell. Nevertheless, at the\nsound of the bell he pricked up his ears and listened, for a visitor was\na strange matter in that out-of-the-way place, and he wondered who it\ncould be. So, while his wits wandered his lessons lagged.\n\n\"Postera Phoeba lustrabat lampade terras,\" continued Brother Emmanuel,\ninexorably running his horny finger-nail beneath the line, \"humentemque\nAurora polo dimoverat umbram--\" the lesson dragged along.\n\nJust then a sandaled footstep sounded without, in the stone corridor,\nand a light tap fell upon Brother Emmanuel's door. It was Brother\nIgnatius, and the Abbot wished little Otto to come to the refectory.\n\nAs they crossed the court-yard Otto stared to see a group of mail-clad\nmen-at-arms, some sitting upon their horses, some standing by the\nsaddle-bow. \"Yonder is the young baron,\" he heard one of them say in a\ngruff voice, and thereupon all turned and stared at him.\n\nA stranger was in the refectory, standing beside the good old Abbot,\nwhile food and wine were being brought and set upon the table for his\nrefreshment; a great, tall, broad-shouldered man, beside whom the Abbot\nlooked thinner and slighter than ever.\n\nThe stranger was clad all in polished and gleaming armor, of plate and\nchain, over which was drawn a loose robe of gray woollen stuff, reaching\nto the knees and bound about the waist by a broad leathern sword-belt.\nUpon his arm he carried a great helmet which he had just removed from\nhis head. His face was weather-beaten and rugged, and on lip and chin\nwas a wiry, bristling beard; once red, now frosted with white.\n\nBrother Ignatius had bidden Otto to enter, and had then closed the door\nbehind him; and now, as the lad walked slowly up the long room, he gazed\nwith round, wondering blue eyes at the stranger.\n\n\"Dost know who I am, Otto? said the mail-clad knight, in a deep,\ngrowling voice.\n\n\"Methinks you are my father, sir,\" said Otto.\n\n\"Aye, thou art right,\" said Baron Conrad, \"and I am glad to see that\nthese milk-churning monks have not allowed thee to forget me, and who\nthou art thyself.\"\n\n\"An' it please you,\" said Otto, \"no one churneth milk here but\nBrother Fritz; we be makers of wine and not makers of butter, at St.\nMichaelsburg.\"\n\nBaron Conrad broke into a great, loud laugh, but Abbot Otto's sad and\nthoughtful face lit up with no shadow of an answering smile.\n\n\"Conrad,\" said he, turning to the other, \"again let me urge thee; do\nnot take the child hence, his life can never be your life, for he is not\nfitted for it. I had thought,\" said he, after a moment's pause, \"I had\nthought that thou hadst meant to consecrate him--this motherless one--to\nthe care of the Universal Mother Church.\"\n\n\"So!\" said the Baron, \"thou hadst thought that, hadst thou? Thou hadst\nthought that I had intended to deliver over this boy, the last of the\nVuelphs, to the arms of the Church? What then was to become of our name\nand the glory of our race if it was to end with him in a monastery? No,\nDrachenhausen is the home of the Vuelphs, and there the last of the race\nshall live as his sires have lived before him, holding to his rights by\nthe power and the might of his right hand.\"\n\nThe Abbot turned and looked at the boy, who was gaping in simple\nwide-eyed wonderment from one to the other as they spoke.\n\n\"And dost thou think, Conrad,\" said the old man, in his gentle, patient\nvoice, \"that that poor child can maintain his rights by the strength of\nhis right hand?\"\n\nThe Baron's look followed the Abbot's, and he said nothing.\n\nIn the few seconds of silence that followed, little Otto, in his simple\nmind, was wondering what all this talk portended. Why had his father\ncome hither to St. Michaelsburg, lighting up the dim silence of the\nmonastery with the flash and ring of his polished armor? Why had he\ntalked about churning butter but now, when all the world knew that the\nmonks of St. Michaelsburg made wine.\n\nIt was Baron Conrad's deep voice that broke the little pause of silence.\n\n\"If you have made a milkmaid of the boy,\" he burst out at last, \"I thank\nthe dear heaven that there is yet time to undo your work and to make a\nman of him.\"\n\nThe Abbot sighed. \"The child is yours, Conrad,\" said he, \"the will of\nthe blessed saints be done. Mayhap if he goes to dwell at Drachenhausen\nhe may make you the better instead of you making him the worse.\"\n\nThen light came to the darkness of little Otto's wonderment; he saw what\nall this talk meant and why his father had come hither. He was to leave\nthe happy, sunny silence of the dear White Cross, and to go out into\nthat great world that he had so often looked down upon from the high\nwindy belfry on the steep hillside.\n\n\n\n\nVI. How Otto Lived in the Dragon's House.\n\nThe gates of the Monastery stood wide open, the world lay beyond, and\nall was ready for departure. Baron Conrad and his men-at-arms sat foot\nin stirrup, the milk-white horse that had been brought for Otto stood\nwaiting for him beside his father's great charger.\n\n\"Farewell, Otto,\" said the good old Abbot, as he stooped and kissed the\nboy's cheek.\n\n\"Farewell,\" answered Otto, in his simple, quiet way, and it brought\na pang to the old man's heart that the child should seem to grieve so\nlittle at the leave-taking.\n\n\"Farewell, Otto,\" said the brethren that stood about, \"farewell,\nfarewell.\"\n\nThen poor brother John came forward and took the boy's hand, and looked\nup into his face as he sat upon his horse. \"We will meet again,\" said\nhe, with his strange, vacant smile, \"but maybe it will be in Paradise,\nand there perhaps they will let us lie in the father's belfry, and look\ndown upon the angels in the court-yard below.\"\n\n\"Aye,\" answered Otto, with an answering smile.\n\n\"Forward,\" cried the Baron, in a deep voice, and with a clash of hoofs\nand jingle of armor they were gone, and the great wooden gates were shut\nto behind them.\n\nDown the steep winding pathway they rode, and out into the great wide\nworld beyond, upon which Otto and brother John had gazed so often from\nthe wooden belfry of the White Cross on the hill.\n\n\"Hast been taught to ride a horse by the priests up yonder on\nMichaelsburg?\" asked the Baron, when they had reached the level road.\n\n\"Nay,\" said Otto; \"we had no horse to ride, but only to bring in the\nharvest or the grapes from the further vineyards to the vintage.\"\n\n\"Prut,\" said the Baron, \"methought the abbot would have had enough of\nthe blood of old days in his veins to have taught thee what is fitting\nfor a knight to know; art not afeared?\"\n\n\"Nay,\" said Otto, with a smile, \"I am not afeared.\"\n\n\"There at least thou showest thyself a Vuelph,\" said the grim Baron. But\nperhaps Otto's thought of fear and Baron Conrad's thought of fear were\ntwo very different matters.\n\nThe afternoon had passed by the time they had reached the end of their\njourney. Up the steep, stony path they rode to the drawbridge and\nthe great gaping gateway of Drachenhausen, where wall and tower and\nbattlement looked darker and more forbidding than ever in the gray\ntwilight of the coming night. Little Otto looked up with great,\nwondering, awe-struck eyes at this grim new home of his.\n\nThe next moment they clattered over the drawbridge that spanned the\nnarrow black gulph between the roadway and the wall, and the next were\npast the echoing arch of the great gateway and in the gray gloaming of\nthe paved court-yard within.\n\nOtto looked around upon the many faces gathered there to catch the\nfirst sight of the little baron; hard, rugged faces, seamed and\nweather-beaten; very different from those of the gentle brethren among\nwhom he had lived, and it seemed strange to him that there was none\nthere whom he should know.\n\nAs he climbed the steep, stony steps to the door of the Baron's house,\nold Ursela came running down to meet him. She flung her withered arms\naround him and hugged him close to her. \"My little child,\" she cried,\nand then fell to sobbing as though her heart would break.\n\n\"Here is someone knoweth me,\" thought the little boy.\n\nHis new home was all very strange and wonderful to Otto; the armors, the\ntrophies, the flags, the long galleries with their ranges of rooms,\nthe great hall below with its vaulted roof and its great fireplace of\ngrotesquely carved stone, and all the strange people with their lives\nand thoughts so different from what he had been used to know.\n\nAnd it was a wonderful thing to explore all the strange places in the\ndark old castle; places where it seemed to Otto no one could have ever\nbeen before.\n\nOnce he wandered down a long, dark passageway below the hall, pushed\nopen a narrow, iron-bound oaken door, and found himself all at once in\na strange new land; the gray light, coming in through a range of tall,\nnarrow windows, fell upon a row of silent, motionless figures carven in\nstone, knights and ladies in strange armor and dress; each lying upon\nhis or her stony couch with clasped hands, and gazing with fixed,\nmotionless, stony eyeballs up into the gloomy, vaulted arch above them.\nThere lay, in a cold, silent row, all of the Vuelphs who had died since\nthe ancient castle had been built.\n\nIt was the chapel into which Otto had made his way, now long since\nfallen out of use excepting as a burial place of the race.\n\nAt another time he clambered up into the loft under the high peaked\nroof, where lay numberless forgotten things covered with the dim dust\nof years. There a flock of pigeons had made their roost, and flapped\nnoisily out into the sunlight when he pushed open the door from below.\nHere he hunted among the mouldering things of the past until, oh, joy\nof joys! in an ancient oaken chest he found a great lot of worm-eaten\nbooks, that had belonged to some old chaplain of the castle in days gone\nby. They were not precious and beautiful volumes, such as the Father\nAbbot had showed him, but all the same they had their quaint painted\npictures of the blessed saints and angels.\n\nAgain, at another time, going into the court-yard, Otto had found\nthe door of Melchior's tower standing invitingly open, for old Hilda,\nSchwartz Carl's wife, had come down below upon some business or other.\n\nThen upon the shaky wooden steps Otto ran without waiting for a second\nthought, for he had often gazed at those curious buildings hanging so\nfar up in the air, and had wondered what they were like. Round and round\nand up and up Otto climbed, until his head spun. At last he reached\na landing-stage, and gazing over the edge and down, beheld the stone\npavement far, far below, lit by a faint glimmer of light that entered\nthrough the arched doorway. Otto clutched tight hold of the wooden rail,\nhe had no thought that he had climbed so far.\n\nUpon the other side of the landing was a window that pierced the thick\nstone walls of the tower; out of the window he looked, and then drew\nsuddenly back again with a gasp, for it was through the outer wall he\npeered, and down, down below in the dizzy depths he saw the hard\ngray rocks, where the black swine, looking no larger than ants in the\ndistance, fed upon the refuse thrown out over the walls of the castle.\nThere lay the moving tree-tops like a billowy green sea, and the coarse\nthatched roofs of the peasant cottages, round which crawled the little\nchildren like tiny human specks.\n\nThen Otto turned and crept down the stairs, frightened at the height to\nwhich he had climbed.\n\nAt the doorway he met Mother Hilda. \"Bless us,\" she cried, starting back\nand crossing herself, and then, seeing who it was, ducked him a courtesy\nwith as pleasant a smile as her forbidding face, with its little\ndeep-set eyes, was able to put upon itself.\n\nOld Ursela seemed nearer to the boy than anyone else about the castle,\nexcepting it was his father, and it was a newfound delight to Otto to\nsit beside her and listen to her quaint stories, so different from the\nmonkish tales that he had heard and read at the monastery.\n\nBut one day it was a tale of a different sort that she told him, and one\nthat opened his eyes to what he had never dreamed of before.\n\nThe mellow sunlight fell through the window upon old Ursela, as she sat\nin the warmth with her distaff in her hands while Otto lay close to her\nfeet upon a bear skin, silently thinking over the strange story of a\nbrave knight and a fiery dragon that she had just told him. Suddenly\nUrsela broke the silence.\n\n\"Little one,\" said she, \"thou art wondrously like thy own dear mother;\ndidst ever hear how she died?\"\n\n\"Nay,\" said Otto, \"but tell me, Ursela, how it was.\"\n\n\"Tis strange,\" said the old woman, \"that no one should have told thee\nin all this time.\" And then, in her own fashion she related to him the\nstory of how his father had set forth upon that expedition in spite of\nall that Otto's mother had said, beseeching him to abide at home; how he\nhad been foully wounded, and how the poor lady had died from her fright\nand grief.\n\nOtto listened with eyes that grew wider and wider, though not all with\nwonder; he no longer lay upon the bear skin, but sat up with his hands\nclasped. For a moment or two after the old woman had ended her story, he\nsat staring silently at her. Then he cried out, in a sharp voice, \"And\nis this truth that you tell me, Ursela? and did my father seek to rob\nthe towns people of their goods?\"\n\nOld Ursela laughed. \"Aye,\" said she, \"that he did and many times. Ah!\nme, those day's are all gone now.\" And she fetched a deep sigh. \"Then we\nlived in plenty and had both silks and linens and velvets besides in the\nstore closets and were able to buy good wines and live in plenty upon\nthe best. Now we dress in frieze and live upon what we can get and\nsometimes that is little enough, with nothing better than sour beer to\ndrink. But there is one comfort in it all, and that is that our good\nBaron paid back the score he owed the Trutz-Drachen people not only for\nthat, but for all that they had done from the very first.\"\n\nThereupon she went on to tell Otto how Baron Conrad had fulfilled the\npledge of revenge that he had made Abbot Otto, how he had watched day\nafter day until one time he had caught the Trutz-Drachen folk,\nwith Baron Frederick at their head, in a narrow defile back of the\nKaiserburg; of the fierce fight that was there fought; of how the\nRoderburgs at last fled, leaving Baron Frederick behind them wounded; of\nhow he had kneeled before the Baron Conrad, asking for mercy, and of\nhow Baron Conrad had answered, \"Aye, thou shalt have such mercy as thou\ndeservest,\" and had therewith raised his great two-handed sword and laid\nhis kneeling enemy dead at one blow.\n\nPoor little Otto had never dreamed that such cruelty and wickedness\ncould be. He listened to the old woman's story with gaping horror, and\nwhen the last came and she told him, with a smack of her lips, how his\nfather had killed his enemy with his own hand, he gave a gasping cry and\nsprang to his feet. Just then the door at the other end of the chamber\nwas noisily opened, and Baron Conrad himself strode into the room.\nOtto turned his head, and seeing who it was, gave another cry, loud and\nquavering, and ran to his father and caught him by the hand.\n\n\"Oh, father!\" he cried, \"oh, father! Is it true that thou hast killed a\nman with thy own hand?\"\n\n\"Aye,\" said the Baron, grimly, \"it is true enough, and I think me I have\nkilled many more than one. But what of that, Otto? Thou must get out of\nthose foolish notions that the old monks have taught thee. Here in the\nworld it is different from what it is at St. Michaelsburg; here a man\nmust either slay or be slain.\"\n\nBut poor little Otto, with his face hidden in his father's robe, cried\nas though his heart would break. \"Oh, father!\" he said, again and again,\n\"it cannot be--it cannot be that thou who art so kind to me should have\nkilled a man with thine own hands.\" Then: \"I wish that I were back\nin the monastery again; I am afraid out here in the great wide world;\nperhaps somebody may kill me, for I am only a weak little boy and could\nnot save my own life if they chose to take it from me.\"\n\nBaron Conrad looked down upon Otto all this while, drawing his bushy\neyebrows together. Once he reached out his hand as though to stroke the\nboy's hair, but drew it back again.\n\nTurning angrily upon the old woman, \"Ursela,\" said he, \"thou must tell\nthe child no more such stories as these; he knowest not at all of such\nthings as yet. Keep thy tongue busy with the old woman's tales that he\nloves to hear thee tell, and leave it with me to teach him what becometh\na true knight and a Vuelph.\"\n\nThat night the father and son sat together beside the roaring fire in\nthe great ball. \"Tell me, Otto,\" said the Baron, \"dost thou hate me for\nhaving done what Ursela told thee today that I did?\"\n\nOtto looked for a while into his father's face. \"I know not,\" said he at\nlast, in his quaint, quiet voice, \"but methinks that I do not hate thee\nfor it.\"\n\nThe Baron drew his bushy brows together until his eyes twinkled out of\nthe depths beneath them, then of a sudden he broke into a great loud\nlaugh, smiting his horny palm with a smack upon his thigh.\n\n\n\n\nVII. The Red Cock Crows on Drachenhausen.\n\nThere was a new emperor in Germany who had come from a far away Swiss\ncastle; Count Rudolph of Hapsburg, a good, honest man with a good,\nhonest, homely face, but bringing with him a stern sense of justice and\nof right, and a determination to put down the lawlessness of the savage\nGerman barons among whom he had come as Emperor.\n\nOne day two strangers came galloping up the winding path to the gates\nof the Dragon's house. A horn sounded thin and clear, a parley was held\nacross the chasm in the road between the two strangers and the porter\nwho appeared at the little wicket. Then a messenger was sent running to\nthe Baron, who presently came striding across the open court-yard to the\ngateway to parley with the strangers.\n\nThe two bore with them a folded parchment with a great red seal\nhanging from it like a clot of blood; it was a message from the Emperor\ndemanding that the Baron should come to the Imperial Court to answer\ncertain charges that had been brought against him, and to give his bond\nto maintain the peace of the empire.\n\nOne by one those barons who had been carrying on their private wars, or\nhad been despoiling the burgher folk in their traffic from town to\ntown, and against whom complaint had been lodged, were summoned to the\nImperial Court, where they were compelled to promise peace and to swear\nallegiance to the new order of things. All those who came willingly were\nallowed to return home again after giving security for maintaining the\npeace; all those who came not willingly were either brought in chains\nor rooted out of their strongholds with fire and sword, and their roofs\nburned over their heads.\n\nNow it was Baron Conrad's turn to be summoned to the Imperial Court,\nfor complaint had been lodged against him by his old enemy of\nTrutz-Drachen--Baron Henry--the nephew of the old Baron Frederick\nwho had been slain while kneeling in the dust of the road back of the\nKaiserburg.\n\nNo one at Drachenhausen could read but Master Rudolph, the steward,\nwho was sand blind, and little Otto. So the boy read the summons to his\nfather, while the grim Baron sat silent with his chin resting upon his\nclenched fist and his eyebrows drawn together into a thoughtful frown as\nhe gazed into the pale face of his son, who sat by the rude oaken table\nwith the great parchment spread out before him.\n\nShould he answer the summons, or scorn it as he would have done under\nthe old emperors? Baron Conrad knew not which to do; pride said one\nthing and policy another. The Emperor was a man with an iron hand, and\nBaron Conrad knew what had happened to those who had refused to obey the\nimperial commands. So at last he decided that he would go to the court,\ntaking with him a suitable escort to support his dignity.\n\nIt was with nearly a hundred armed men clattering behind him that Baron\nConrad rode away to court to answer the imperial summons. The castle was\nstripped of its fighting men, and only eight remained behind to guard\nthe great stone fortress and the little simple-witted boy.\n\nIt was a sad mistake.\n\nThree days had passed since the Baron had left the castle, and now the\nthird night had come. The moon was hanging midway in the sky, white and\nfull, for it was barely past midnight.\n\nThe high precipitous banks of the rocky road threw a dense black shadow\ninto the gully below, and in that crooked inky line that scarred the\nwhite face of the moonlit rocks a band of some thirty men were creeping\nslowly and stealthily nearer and nearer to Castle Drachenhausen. At the\nhead of them was a tall, slender knight clad in light chain armor, his\nhead covered only by a steel cap or bascinet.\n\nAlong the shadow they crept, with only now and then a faint clink or\njingle of armor to break the stillness, for most of those who followed\nthe armed knight were clad in leathern jerkins; only one or two wearing\neven so much as a steel breast-plate by way of armor.\n\nSo at last they reached the chasm that yawned beneath the roadway, and\nthere they stopped, for they had reached the spot toward which they had\nbeen journeying. It was Baron Henry of Trutz-Drachen who had thus come\nin the silence of the night time to the Dragon's house, and his visit\nboded no good to those within.\n\nThe Baron and two or three of his men talked together in low tones, now\nand then looking up at the sheer wall that towered above them.\n\n\"Yonder is the place, Lord Baron,\" said one of those who stood with him.\n\"I have scanned every foot of the wall at night for a week past. An we\nget not in by that way, we get not in at all. A keen eye, a true aim,\nand a bold man are all that we need, and the business is done.\" Here\nagain all looked upward at the gray wall above them, rising up in the\nsilent night air.\n\nHigh aloft hung the wooden bartizan or watch-tower, clinging to the face\nof the outer wall and looming black against the pale sky above. Three\ngreat beams pierced the wall, and upon them the wooden tower rested. The\nmiddle beam jutted out beyond the rest to the distance of five or six\nfeet, and the end of it was carved into the rude semblance of a dragon's\nhead.\n\n\"So, good,\" said the Baron at last; \"then let us see if thy plan holds,\nand if Hans Schmidt's aim is true enough to earn the three marks that I\nhave promised him. Where is the bag?\"\n\nOne of those who stood near handed the Baron a leathern pouch, the Baron\nopened it and drew out a ball of fine thread, another of twine, a coil\nof stout rope, and a great bundle that looked, until it was unrolled,\nlike a coarse fish-net. It was a rope ladder. While these were being\nmade ready, Hans Schmidt, a thick-set, low-browed, broad-shouldered\narcher, strung his stout bow, and carefully choosing three arrows\nfrom those in his quiver, he stuck them point downward in the earth.\nUnwinding the ball of thread, he laid it loosely in large loops upon the\nground so that it might run easily without hitching, then he tied the\nend of the thread tightly around one of his arrows. He fitted the arrow\nto the bow and drew the feather to his ear. Twang! rang the bowstring,\nand the feathered messenger flew whistling upon its errand to the\nwatch-tower. The very first shaft did the work.\n\n\"Good,\" said Hans Schmidt, the archer, in his heavy voice, \"the three\nmarks are mine, Lord Baron.\"\n\nThe arrow had fallen over and across the jutting beam between the carved\ndragon's head and the bartizan, carrying with it the thread, which now\nhung from above, glimmering white in the moonlight like a cobweb.\n\nThe rest was an easy task enough. First the twine was drawn up to and\nover the beam by the thread, then the rope was drawn up by the twine,\nand last of all the rope ladder by the rope. There it hung like a thin,\nslender black line against the silent gray walls.\n\n\"And now,\" said the Baron, \"who will go first and win fifty marks for\nhis own, and climb the rope ladder to the tower yonder?\" Those around\nhesitated. \"Is there none brave enough to venture?\" said the Baron,\nafter a pause of silence.\n\nA stout, young fellow, of about eighteen years of age, stepped forward\nand flung his flat leathern cap upon the ground. \"I will go, my Lord\nBaron,\" said he.\n\n\"Good,\" said the Baron, \"the fifty marks are thine. And now listen, if\nthou findest no one in the watch-tower, whistle thus; if the watchman\nbe at his post, see that thou makest all safe before thou givest the\nsignal. When all is ready the others will follow thee. And now go and\ngood luck go with thee.\"\n\nThe young fellow spat upon his hands and, seizing the ropes, began\nslowly and carefully to mount the flimsy, shaking ladder. Those below\nheld it as tight as they were able, but nevertheless he swung backward\nand forward and round and round as he climbed steadily upward. Once he\nstopped upon the way, and those below saw him clutch the ladder close\nto him as though dizzied by the height and the motion but he soon began\nagain, up, up, up like some great black spider. Presently he came out\nfrom the black shadow below and into the white moonlight, and then his\nshadow followed him step by step up the gray wall upon his way. At last\nhe reached the jutting beam, and there again he stopped for a moment\nclutching tightly to it. The next he was upon the beam, dragging himself\ntoward the window of the bartizan just above. Slowly raising himself\nupon his narrow foothold he peeped cautiously within. Those watching\nhim from be low saw him slip his hand softly to his side, and then place\nsomething between his teeth. It was his dagger. Reaching up, he clutched\nthe window sill above him and, with a silent spring, seated himself\nupon it. The next moment he disappeared within. A few seconds of silence\nfollowed, then of sudden a sharp gurgling cry broke the stillness. There\nwas another pause of silence, then a faint shrill whistle sounded from\nabove.\n\n\"Who will go next?\" said the Baron. It was Hans Schmidt who stepped\nforward. Another followed the arch up the ladder, and another, and\nanother. Last of all went the Baron Henry himself, and nothing was left\nbut the rope ladder hanging from above, and swaying back and forth in\nthe wind.\n\nThat night Schwartz Carl had been bousing it over a pot of yellow wine\nin the pantry with his old crony, Master Rudolph, the steward; and the\ntwo, chatting and gossiping together, had passed the time away until\nlong after the rest of the castle had been wrapped in sleep. Then,\nperhaps a little unsteady upon his feet, Schwartz Carl betook himself\nhomeward to the Melchior tower.\n\nHe stood for a while in the shadow of the doorway, gazing up into the\npale sky above him at the great, bright, round moon, that hung like a\nbubble above the sharp peaks of the roofs standing black as ink against\nthe sky. But all of a sudden he started up from the post against which\nhe had been leaning, and with head bent to one side, stood listening\nbreathlessly, for he too had heard that smothered cry from the\nwatch-tower. So he stood intently, motionlessly, listening, listening;\nbut all was silent except for the monotonous dripping of water in one of\nthe nooks of the court-yard, and the distant murmur of the river borne\nupon the breath of the night air. \"Mayhap I was mistaken,\" muttered\nSchwartz Carl to himself.\n\nBut the next moment the silence was broken again by a faint, shrill\nwhistle; what did it mean?\n\nBack of the heavy oaken door of the tower was Schwartz Carl's cross-bow,\nthe portable windlass with which the bowstring was drawn back, and a\npouch of bolts. Schwartz Carl reached back into the darkness, fumbling\nin the gloom until his fingers met the weapon. Setting his foot in the\niron stirrup at the end of the stock, he wound the stout bow-string\ninto the notch of the trigger, and carefully fitted the heavy,\nmurderous-looking bolt into the groove.\n\nMinute after minute passed, and Schwartz Carl, holding his arbelast in\nhis hand, stood silently waiting and watching in the sharp-cut, black\nshadow of the doorway, motionless as a stone statue. Minute after minute\npassed. Suddenly there was a movement in the shadow of the arch of the\ngreat gateway across the court-yard, and the next moment a leathern-clad\nfigure crept noiselessly out upon the moonlit pavement, and stood there\nlistening, his head bent to one side. Schwartz Carl knew very well\nthat it was no one belonging to the castle, and, from the nature of his\naction, that he was upon no good errand.\n\nHe did not stop to challenge the suspicious stranger. The taking of\nanother's life was thought too small a matter for much thought or care\nin those days. Schwartz Carl would have shot a man for a much smaller\nreason than the suspicious actions of this fellow. The leather-clad\nfigure stood a fine target in the moonlight for a cross-bow bolt.\nSchwartz Carl slowly raised the weapon to his shoulder and took a long\nand steady aim. Just then the stranger put his fingers to his lips and\ngave a low, shrill whistle. It was the last whistle that he was to give\nupon this earth. There was a sharp, jarring twang of the bow-string, the\nhiss of the flying bolt, and the dull thud as it struck its mark. The\nman gave a shrill, quavering cry, and went staggering back, and then\nfell all of a heap against the wall behind him. As though in answer to\nthe cry, half a dozen men rushed tumultuously out from the shadow of\nthe gateway whence the stranger had just come, and then stood in the\ncourt-yard, looking uncertainly this way and that, not knowing from what\nquarter the stroke had come that had laid their comrade low.\n\nBut Schwartz Carl did not give them time to discover that; there was no\nchance to string his cumbersome weapon again; down he flung it upon the\nground. \"To arms!\" he roared in a voice of thunder, and then clapped to\nthe door of Melchior's tower and shot the great iron bolts with a clang\nand rattle.\n\nThe next instant the Trutz-Drachen men were thundering at the door, but\nSchwartz Carl was already far up the winding steps.\n\nBut now the others came pouring out from the gateway. \"To the house,\"\nroared Baron Henry.\n\nThen suddenly a clashing, clanging uproar crashed out upon the night.\nDong! Dong! It was the great alarm bell from Melchior's tower--Schwartz\nCarl was at his post.\n\nLittle Baron Otto lay sleeping upon the great rough bed in his room,\ndreaming of the White Cross on the hill and of brother John. By and by\nhe heard the convent bell ringing, and knew that there must be visitors\nat the gate, for loud voices sounded through his dream. Presently he\nknew that he was coming awake, but though the sunny monastery garden\ngrew dimmer and dimmer to his sleeping sight, the clanging of the bell\nand the sound of shouts grew louder and louder. Then he opened his eyes.\nFlaming red lights from torches, carried hither and thither by people\nin the court-yard outside, flashed and ran along the wall of his\nroom. Hoarse shouts and cries filled the air, and suddenly the shrill,\npiercing shriek of a woman rang from wall to wall; and through the\nnoises the great bell from far above upon Melchior's tower clashed and\nclanged its harsh, resonant alarm.\n\nOtto sprang from his bed and looked out of the window and down upon\nthe court-yard below. \"Dear God! what dreadful thing hath happened?\" he\ncried and clasped his hands together.\n\nA cloud of smoke was pouring out from the windows of the building across\nthe court-yard, whence a dull ruddy glow flashed and flickered. Strange\nmen were running here and there with flaming torches, and the now\ncontinuous shrieking of women pierced the air.\n\nJust beneath the window lay the figure of a man half naked and face\ndownward upon the stones. Then suddenly Otto cried out in fear and\nhorror, for, as he looked with dazed and bewildered eyes down into the\nlurid court-yard beneath, a savage man, in a shining breast-plate and\nsteel cap, came dragging the dark, silent figure of a woman across the\nstones; but whether she was dead or in a swoon, Otto could not tell.\n\nAnd every moment the pulsing of that dull red glare from the windows of\nthe building across the court-yard shone more brightly, and the glare\nfrom other flaming buildings, which Otto could not see from his window,\nturned the black, starry night into a lurid day.\n\nJust then the door of the room was burst open, and in rushed poor old\nUrsela, crazy with her terror. She flung herself down upon the floor and\ncaught Otto around the knees. \"Save me!\" she cried, \"save me!\" as though\nthe poor, pale child could be of any help to her at such a time. In the\npassageway without shone the light of torches, and the sound of loud\nfootsteps came nearer and nearer.\n\nAnd still through all the din sounded continually the clash and clang\nand clamor of the great alarm bell.\n\nThe red light flashed into the room, and in the doorway stood a tall,\nthin figure clad from head to foot in glittering chain armor. From\nbehind this fierce knight, with his dark, narrow, cruel face, its\ndeep-set eyes glistening in the light of the torches, crowded six or\neight savage, low-browed, brutal men, who stared into the room and\nat the white-faced boy as he stood by the window with the old woman\nclinging to his knees and praying to him for help.\n\n\"We have cracked the nut and here is the kernel,\" said one of them who\nstood behind the rest, and thereupon a roar of brutal laughter went up.\nBut the cruel face of the armed knight never relaxed into a smile;\nhe strode into the room and laid his iron hand heavily upon the boy's\nshoulder. \"Art thou the young Baron Otto?\" said he, in a harsh voice.\n\n\"Aye,\" said the lad; \"but do not kill me.\"\n\nThe knight did not answer him. \"Fetch the cord hither,\" said he, \"and\ndrag the old witch away.\"\n\nIt took two of them to loosen poor old Ursela's crazy clutch from about\nher young master. Then amid roars of laughter they dragged her away,\nscreaming and scratching and striking with her fists.\n\nThey drew back Otto's arms behind his back and wrapped them round and\nround with a bowstring. Then they pushed and hustled and thrust him\nforth from the room and along the passageway, now bright with the flames\nthat roared and crackled without. Down the steep stairway they drove\nhim, where thrice he stumbled and fell amid roars of laughter. At last\nthey were out into the open air of the court-yard. Here was a terrible\nsight, but Otto saw nothing of it; his blue eyes were gazing far away,\nand his lips moved softly with the prayer that the good monks of St.\nMichaelsburg had taught him, for he thought that they meant to slay him.\n\nAll around the court-yard the flames roared and snapped and crackled.\nFour or five figures lay scattered here and there, silent in all the\nglare and uproar. The heat was so intense that they were soon forced\nback into the shelter of the great gateway, where the women captives,\nunder the guard of three or four of the Trutz-Drachen men, were crowded\ntogether in dumb, bewildered terror. Only one man was to be seen among\nthe captives, poor, old, half blind Master Rudolph, the steward,\nwho crouched tremblingly among the women. They had set the blaze to\nMelchior's tower, and now, below, it was a seething furnace. Above, the\nsmoke rolled in black clouds from the windows, but still the alarm bell\nsounded through all the blaze and smoke. Higher and higher the flames\nrose; a trickle of fire ran along the frame buildings hanging aloft in\nthe air. A clear flame burst out at the peak of the roof, but still the\nbell rang forth its clamorous clangor. Presently those who watched below\nsaw the cluster of buildings bend and sink and sway; there was a crash\nand roar, a cloud of sparks flew up as though to the very heavens\nthemselves, and the bell of Melchior's tower was stilled forever. A\ngreat shout arose from the watching, upturned faces.\n\n\"Forward!\" cried Baron Henry, and out from the gateway they swept and\nacross the drawbridge, leaving Drachenhausen behind them a flaming\nfurnace blazing against the gray of the early dawning.\n\n\n\n\nVIII. In the House of the Dragon Scorner.\n\nTall, narrow, gloomy room; no furniture but a rude bench a bare stone\nfloor, cold stone walls and a gloomy ceiling of arched stone over head;\na long, narrow slit of a window high above in the wall, through the iron\nbars of which Otto could see a small patch of blue sky and now and then\na darting swallow, for an instant seen, the next instant gone. Such\nwas the little baron's prison in Trutz-Drachen. Fastened to a bolt\nand hanging against the walls, hung a pair of heavy chains with gaping\nfetters at the ends. They were thick with rust, and the red stain of\nthe rust streaked the wall below where they hung like a smear of blood.\nLittle Otto shuddered as he looked at them; can those be meant for me,\nhe thought.\n\nNothing was to be seen but that one patch of blue sky far up in the\nwall. No sound from without was to be heard in that gloomy cell of\nstone, for the window pierced the outer wall, and the earth and its\nnoises lay far below.\n\nSuddenly a door crashed without, and the footsteps of men were heard\ncoming along the corridor. They stopped in front of Otto's cell; he\nheard the jingle of keys, and then a loud rattle of one thrust into\nthe lock of the heavy oaken door. The rusty bolt was shot back with a\nscreech, the door opened, and there stood Baron Henry, no longer in his\narmor, but clad in a long black robe that reached nearly to his feet,\na broad leather belt was girdled about his waist, and from it dangled a\nshort, heavy hunting sword.\n\nAnother man was with the Baron, a heavy-faced fellow clad in a leathern\njerkin over which was drawn a short coat of linked mail.\n\nThe two stood for a moment looking into the room, and Otto, his pale\nface glimmering in the gloom, sat upon the edge of the heavy wooden\nbench or bed, looking back at them out of his great blue eyes. Then the\ntwo entered and closed the door behind them.\n\n\"Dost thou know why thou art here?\" said the Baron, in his deep, harsh\nvoice.\n\n\"Nay,\" said Otto, \"I know not.\"\n\n\"So?\" said the Baron. \"Then I will tell thee. Three years ago the good\nBaron Frederick, my uncle, kneeled in the dust and besought mercy at thy\nfather's hands; the mercy he received was the coward blow that slew him.\nThou knowest the story?\"\n\n\"Aye,\" said Otto, tremblingly, \"I know it.\"\n\n\"Then dost thou not know why I am here?\" said the Baron.\n\n\"Nay, dear Lord Baron, I know not,\" said poor little Otto, and began to\nweep.\n\nThe Baron stood for a moment or two looking gloomily upon him, as the\nlittle boy sat there with the tears running down his white face.\n\n\"I will tell thee,\" said he, at last; \"I swore an oath that the red cock\nshould crow on Drachenhausen, and I have given it to the dames. I swore\nan oath that no Vuelph that ever left my hands should be able to strike\nsuch a blow as thy father gave to Baron Frederick, and now I will fulfil\nthat too. Catch the boy, Casper, and hold him.\"\n\nAs the man in the mail shirt stepped toward little Otto, the boy leaped\nup from where he sat and caught the Baron about the knees. \"Oh! dear\nLord Baron,\" he cried, \"do not harm me; I am only a little child, I have\nnever done harm to thee; do not harm me.\"\n\n\"Take him away,\" said the Baron, harshly.\n\nThe fellow stooped, and loosening Otto's hold, in spite of his struggles\nand cries, carried him to the bench, against which he held him, whilst\nthe Baron stood above him.\n\nBaron Henry and the other came forth from the cell, carefully closing\nthe wooden door behind them. At the end of the corridor the Baron\nturned, \"Let the leech be sent to the boy,\" said he. And then he turned\nand walked away.\n\nOtto lay upon the hard couch in his cell, covered with a shaggy bear\nskin. His face was paler and thinner than ever, and dark rings encircled\nhis blue eyes. He was looking toward the door, for there was a noise of\nsomeone fumbling with the lock without.\n\nSince that dreadful day when Baron Henry had come to his cell, only two\nsouls had visited Otto. One was the fellow who had come with the Baron\nthat time; his name, Otto found, was Casper. He brought the boy his rude\nmeals of bread and meat and water. The other visitor was the leech or\ndoctor, a thin, weasand little man, with a kindly, wrinkled face and a\ngossiping tongue, who, besides binding wounds, bleeding, and leeching,\nand administering his simple remedies to those who were taken sick in\nthe castle, acted as the Baron's barber.\n\nThe Baron had left the key in the lock of the door, so that these two\nmight enter when they chose, but Otto knew that it was neither the one\nnor the other whom he now heard at the door, working uncertainly with\nthe key, striving to turn it in the rusty, cumbersome lock. At last the\nbolts grated back, there was a pause, and then the door opened a little\nway, and Otto thought that he could see someone peeping in from without.\nBy and by the door opened further, there was another pause, and then\na slender, elfish-looking little girl, with straight black hair and\nshining black eyes, crept noiselessly into the room.\n\nShe stood close by the door with her finger in her mouth, staring at\nthe boy where he lay upon his couch, and Otto upon his part lay, full of\nwonder, gazing back upon the little elfin creature.\n\nShe, seeing that he made no sign or motion, stepped a little nearer, and\nthen, after a moment's pause, a little nearer still, until, at last, she\nstood within a few feet of where he lay.\n\n\"Art thou the Baron Otto?\" said she.\n\n\"Yes,\" answered Otto.\n\n\"Prut!\" said she, \"and is that so! Why, I thought that thou wert a great\ntall fellow at least, and here thou art a little boy no older than Carl\nMax, the gooseherd.\" Then, after a little pause--\"My name is Pauline,\nand my father is the Baron. I heard him tell my mother all about thee,\nand so I wanted to come here and see thee myself: Art thou sick?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Otto, \"I am sick.\"\n\n\"And did my father hurt thee?\"\n\n\"Aye,\" said Otto, and his eyes filled with tears, until one sparkling\ndrop trickled slowly down his white face.\n\nLittle Pauline stood looking seriously at him for a while. \"I am sorry\nfor thee, Otto,\" said she, at last. And then, at her childish pity, he\nbegan crying in earnest.\n\nThis was only the first visit of many from the little maid, for after\nthat she often came to Otto's prison, who began to look for her coming\nfrom day to day as the one bright spot in the darkness and the gloom.\n\nSitting upon the edge of his bed and gazing into his face with wide open\neyes, she would listen to him by the hour, as he told her of his life in\nthat far away monastery home; of poor, simple brother John's wonderful\nvisions, of the good Abbot's books with their beautiful pictures, and of\nall the monkish tales and stories of knights and dragons and heroes and\nemperors of ancient Rome, which brother Emmanuel had taught him to read\nin the crabbed monkish Latin in which they were written.\n\nOne day the little maid sat for a long while silent after he had ended\nspeaking. At last she drew a deep breath. \"And are all these things that\nthou tellest me about the priests in their castle really true?\" said\nshe.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Otto, \"all are true.\"\n\n\"And do they never go out to fight other priests?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Otto, \"they know nothing of fighting.\"\n\n\"So!\" said she. And then fell silent in the thought of the wonder of\nit all, and that there should be men in the world that knew nothing of\nviolence and bloodshed; for in all the eight years of her life she had\nscarcely been outside of the walls of Castle Trutz-Drachen.\n\nAt another time it was of Otto's mother that they were speaking.\n\n\"And didst thou never see her, Otto?\" said the little girl.\n\n\"Aye,\" said Otto, \"I see her sometimes in my dreams, and her face always\nshines so bright that I know she is an angel; for brother John has often\nseen the dear angels, and he tells me that their faces always shine in\nthat way. I saw her the night thy father hurt me so, for I could not\nsleep and my head felt as though it would break asunder. Then she\ncame and leaned over me and kissed my forehead, and after that I fell\nasleep.\"\n\n\"But where did she come from, Otto?\" said the little girl.\n\n\"From paradise, I think,\" said Otto, with that patient seriousness that\nhe had caught from the monks, and that sat so quaintly upon him.\n\n\"So!\" said little Pauline; and then, after a pause, \"That is why thy\nmother kissed thee when thy head ached--because she is an angel. When\nI was sick my mother bade Gretchen carry me to a far part of the house,\nbecause I cried and so troubled her. Did thy mother ever strike thee,\nOtto?\"\n\n\"Nay,\" said Otto.\n\n\"Mine hath often struck me,\" said Pauline.\n\nOne day little Pauline came bustling into Otto's cell, her head full of\nthe news which she carried. \"My father says that thy father is out\nin the woods somewhere yonder, back of the castle, for Fritz, the\nswineherd, told my father that last night he had seen a fire in the\nwoods, and that he had crept up to it without anyone knowing. There he\nhad seen the Baron Conrad and six of his men, and that they were eating\none of the swine that they had killed and roasted. Maybe,\" said she,\nseating herself upon the edge of Otto's couch; \"maybe my father will\nkill thy father, and they will bring him here and let him lie upon a\nblack bed with bright candles burning around him, as they did my uncle\nFrederick when he was killed.\"\n\n\"God forbid!\" said Otto, and then lay for a while with his hands\nclasped. \"Dost thou love me, Pauline?\" said he, after a while.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Pauline, \"for thou art a good child, though my father says\nthat thy wits are cracked.\"\n\n\"Mayhap they are,\" said Otto, simply, \"for I have often been told so\nbefore. But thou wouldst not see me die, Pauline; wouldst thou?\"\n\n\"Nay,\" said Pauline, \"I would not see thee die, for then thou couldst\ntell me no more stories; for they told me that uncle Frederick could not\nspeak because he was dead.\"\n\n\"Then listen, Pauline,\" said Otto; \"if I go not away from here I shall\nsurely die. Every day I grow more sick and the leech cannot cure me.\"\nHere he broke down and, turning his face upon the couch, began crying,\nwhile little Pauline sat looking seriously at him.\n\n\"Why dost thou cry, Otto?\" said she, after a while.\n\n\"Because,\" said he, \"I am so sick, and I want my father to come and take\nme away from here.\"\n\n\"But why dost thou want to go away?\" said Pauline. \"If thy father takes\nthee away, thou canst not tell me any more stories.\"\n\n\"Yes, I can,\" said Otto, \"for when I grow to be a man I will come\nagain and marry thee, and when thou art my wife I can tell thee all the\nstories that I know. Dear Pauline, canst thou not tell my father where I\nam, that he may come here and take me away before I die?\"\n\n\"Mayhap I could do so,\" said Pauline, after a little while, \"for\nsometimes I go with Casper Max to see his mother, who nursed me when I\nwas a baby. She is the wife of Fritz, the swineherd, and she will make\nhim tell thy father; for she will do whatever I ask of her, and Fritz\nwill do whatever she bids him do.\"\n\n\"And for my sake, wilt thou tell him, Pauline?\" said Otto.\n\n\"But see, Otto,\" said the little girl, \"if I tell him, wilt thou promise\nto come indeed and marry me when thou art grown a man?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Otto, very seriously, \"I will promise.\"\n\n\"Then I will tell thy father where thou art,\" said she.\n\n\"But thou wilt do it without the Baron Henry knowing, wilt thou not,\nPauline?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said she, \"for if my father and my mother knew that I did such\na thing, they would strike me, mayhap send me to my bed alone in the\ndark.\"\n\n\n\n\nIX. How One-eyed Hans came to Trutz-Drachen.\n\nFritz, the swineherd, sat eating his late supper of porridge out of a\ngreat, coarse, wooden bowl; wife Katherine sat at the other end of the\ntable, and the half-naked little children played upon the earthen floor.\nA shaggy dog lay curled up in front of the fire, and a grunting pig\nscratched against a leg of the rude table close beside where the woman\nsat.\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" said Katherine, speaking of the matter of which they had\nalready been talking. \"It is all very true that the Drachenhausens are a\nbad lot, and I for one am of no mind to say no to that; all the same it\nis a sad thing that a simple-witted little child like the young Baron\nshould be so treated as the boy has been; and now that our Lord Baron\nhas served him so that he, at least, will never be able to do us 'harm,\nI for one say that he should not be left there to die alone in that\nblack cell.\"\n\nFritz, the swineherd, gave a grunt at this without raising his eyes from\nthe bowl.\n\n\"Yes, good,\" said Katherine, \"I know what thou meanest, Fritz, and that\nit is none of my business to be thrusting my finger into the Baron's\ndish. But to hear the way that dear little child spoke when she was here\nthis morn--it would have moved a heart of stone to hear her tell of all\nhis pretty talk. Thou wilt try to let the red-beard know that that poor\nboy, his son, is sick to death in the black cell; wilt thou not, Fritz?\"\n\nThe swineherd dropped his wooden spoon into the bowl with a clatter.\n\"Potstausand!\" he cried; \"art thou gone out of thy head to let thy wits\nrun upon such things as this of which thou talkest to me? If it should\ncome to our Lord Baron's ears he would cut the tongue from out thy head\nand my head from off my shoulders for it. Dost thou think I am going to\nmeddle in such a matter as this? Listen! these proud Baron folk, with\ntheir masterful ways, drive our sort hither and thither; they beat us,\nthey drive us, they kill us as they choose. Our lives are not as much\nto them as one of my black swine. Why should I trouble my head if they\nchoose to lop and trim one another? The fewer there are of them the\nbetter for us, say I. We poor folk have a hard enough life of it without\nthrusting our heads into the noose to help them out of their troubles.\nWhat thinkest thou would happen to us if Baron Henry should hear of our\nbetraying his affairs to the Red-beard?\"\n\n\"Nay,\" said Katherine, \"thou hast naught to do in the matter but to tell\nthe Red-beard in what part of the castle the little Baron lies.\"\n\n\"And what good would that do?\" said Fritz, the swineherd.\n\n\"I know not,\" said Katherine, \"but I have promised the little one that\nthou wouldst find the Baron Conrad and tell him that much.\"\n\n\"Thou hast promised a mare's egg,\" said her husband, angrily. \"How shall\nI find the Baron Conrad to bear a message to him, when our Baron has\nbeen looking for him in vain for two days past?\"\n\n\"Thou has found him once and thou mayst find him again,\" said Katherine,\n\"for it is not likely that he will keep far away from here whilst his\nboy is in such sore need of help.\"\n\n\"I will have nothing to do with it!\" said Fritz, and he got up from the\nwooden block whereon he was sitting and stumped out of the house. But,\nthen, Katherine had heard him talk in that way before, and knew, in\nspite of his saying \"no,\" that, sooner or later, he would do as she\nwished.\n\nTwo days later a very stout little one-eyed man, clad in a leathern\njerkin and wearing a round leathern cap upon his head, came toiling up\nthe path to the postern door of Trutz-Drachen, his back bowed under the\nburthen of a great peddler's pack. It was our old friend the one-eyed\nHans, though even his brother would hardly have known him in his present\nguise, for, besides having turned peddler, he had grown of a sudden\nsurprisingly fat.\n\nRap-tap-tap! He knocked at the door with a knotted end of the crooked\nthorned staff upon which he leaned. He waited for a while and then\nknocked again--rap-tap-tap!\n\nPresently, with a click, a little square wicket that pierced the door\nwas opened, and a woman's face peered out through the iron bars.\n\nThe one-eyed Hans whipped off his leathern cap.\n\n\"Good day, pretty one,\" said he, \"and hast thou any need of glass beads,\nribbons, combs, or trinkets? Here I am come all the way from Gruenstadt,\nwith a pack full of such gay things as thou never laid eyes on before.\nHere be rings and bracelets and necklaces that might be of pure silver\nand set with diamonds and rubies, for anything that thy dear one could\ntell if he saw thee decked in them. And all are so cheap that thou hast\nonly to say, 'I want them,' and they are thine.\"\n\nThe frightened face at the window looked from right to left and from\nleft to right. \"Hush,\" said the girl, and laid her finger upon her lips.\n\"There! thou hadst best get away from here, poor soul, as fast as thy\nlegs can carry thee, for if the Lord Baron should find thee here talking\nsecretly at the postern door, he would loose the wolf-hounds upon thee.\"\n\n\"Prut,\" said one-eyed Hans, with a grin, \"the Baron is too big a fly to\nsee such a little gnat as I; but wolf-hounds or no wolf-hounds, I\ncan never go hence without showing thee the pretty things that I have\nbrought from the town, even though my stay be at the danger of my own\nhide.\"\n\nHe flung the pack from off his shoulders as he spoke and fell to\nunstrapping it, while the round face of the lass (her eyes big with\ncuriosity) peered down at him through the grated iron bars.\n\nHans held up a necklace of blue and white beads that glistened like\njewels in the sun, and from them hung a gorgeous filigree cross. \"Didst\nthou ever see a sweeter thing than this?\" said he; \"and look, here is a\ncomb that even the silversmith would swear was pure silver all the way\nthrough.\" Then, in a soft, wheedling voice, \"Canst thou not let me in,\nmy little bird? Sure there are other lasses besides thyself who would\nlike to trade with a poor peddler who has travelled all the way from\nGruenstadt just to please the pretty ones of Trutz-Drachen.\"\n\n\"Nay,\" said the lass, in a frightened voice, \"I cannot let thee in; I\nknow not what the Baron would do to me, even now, if he knew that I was\nhere talking to a stranger at the postern;\" and she made as if she would\nclap to the little window in his face; but the one-eyed Hans thrust his\nstaff betwixt the bars and so kept the shutter open.\n\n\"Nay, nay,\" said he, eagerly, \"do not go away from me too soon. Look,\ndear one; seest thou this necklace?\"\n\n\"Aye,\" said she, looking hungrily at it.\n\n\"Then listen; if thou wilt but let me into the castle, so that I may\nstrike a trade, I will give it to thee for thine own without thy paying\na barley corn for it.\"\n\nThe girl looked and hesitated, and then looked again; the temptation was\ntoo great. There was a noise of softly drawn bolts and bars, the door\nwas hesitatingly opened a little way, and, in a twinkling, the one-eyed\nHans had slipped inside the castle, pack and all.\n\n\"The necklace,\" said the girl, in a frightened whisper.\n\nHans thrust it into her hand. \"It's thine,\" said he, \"and now wilt thou\nnot help me to a trade?\"\n\n\"I will tell my sister that thou art here,\" said she, and away she ran\nfrom the little stone hallway, carefully bolting and locking the further\ndoor behind her.\n\nThe door that the girl had locked was the only one that connected the\npostern hail with the castle.\n\nThe one-eyed Hans stood looking after her. \"Thou fool!\" he muttered to\nhimself, \"to lock the door behind thee. What shall I do next, I should\nlike to know? Here am I just as badly off as I was when I stood outside\nthe walls. Thou hussy! If thou hadst but let me into the castle for only\ntwo little minutes, I would have found somewhere to have hidden myself\nwhile thy back was turned. But what shall I do now?\" He rested his pack\nupon the floor and stood looking about him.\n\nBuilt in the stone wall opposite to him, was a high, narrow fireplace\nwithout carving of any sort. As Hans' one eye wandered around the bare\nstone space, his glance fell at last upon it, and there it rested. For\na while he stood looking intently at it, presently he began rubbing his\nhand over his bristling chin in a thoughtful, meditative manner. Finally\nhe drew a deep breath, and giving himself a shake as though to arouse\nhimself from his thoughts, and after listening a moment or two to\nmake sure that no one was nigh, he walked softly to the fireplace, and\nstooping, peered up the chimney. Above him yawned a black cavernous\ndepth, inky with the soot of years. Hans straightened himself, and\ntilting his leathern cap to one side, began scratching his bullet-head;\nat last he drew a long breath. \"Yes, good,\" he muttered to himself; \"he\nwho jumps into the river must e'en swim the best he can. It is a vile,\ndirty place to thrust one's self; but I am in for it now, and must make\nthe best of a lame horse.\"\n\nHe settled the cap more firmly upon his head, spat upon his hands, and\nonce more stooping in the fireplace, gave a leap, and up the chimney he\nwent with a rattle of loose mortar and a black trickle of soot.\n\nBy and by footsteps sounded outside the door. There was a pause; a\nhurried whispering of women's voices; the twitter of a nervous laugh,\nand then the door was pushed softly opens and the girl to whom the\none-eyed Hans had given the necklace of blue and white beads with the\nfiligree cross hanging from it, peeped uncertainly into the room. Behind\nher broad, heavy face were three others, equally homely and stolid; for\na while all four stood there, looking blankly into the room and around\nit. Nothing was there but the peddler's knapsack lying in the middle of\nthe floor-the man was gone. The light of expectancy slowly faded Out of\nthe girl's face, and in its place succeeded first bewilderment and then\ndull alarm. \"But, dear heaven,\" she said, \"where then has the peddler\nman gone?\"\n\nA moment or two of silence followed her speech. \"Perhaps,\" said one of\nthe others, in a voice hushed with awe, \"perhaps it was the evil one\nhimself to whom thou didst open the door.\"\n\nAgain there was a hushed and breathless pause; it was the lass who had\nlet Hans in at the postern, who next spoke.\n\n\"Yes,\" said she, in a voice trembling with fright at what she had done,\n\"yes, it must have been the evil one, for now I remember he had but one\neye.\" The four girls crossed themselves, and their eyes grew big and\nround with the fright.\n\nSuddenly a shower of mortar came rattling down the chimney. \"Ach!\" cried\nthe four, as with one voice. Bang! the door was clapped to and away they\nscurried like a flock of frightened rabbits.\n\nWhen Jacob, the watchman, came that way an hour later, upon his evening\nround of the castle, he found a peddler's knapsack lying in the middle\nof the floor. He turned it over with his pike-staff and saw that it was\nfull of beads and trinkets and ribbons.\n\n\"How came this here?\" said he. And then, without waiting for the answer\nwhich he did not expect, he flung it over his shoulder and marched away\nwith it.\n\n\n\n\nX. How Hans Brought Terror to the Kitchen.\n\nHans found himself in a pretty pickle in the chimney, for the soot got\ninto his one eye and set it to watering, and into his nose and set him\nto sneezing, and into his mouth and his ears and his hair. But still\nhe struggled on, up and up; \"for every chimney has a top,\" said Hans\nto himself \"and I am sure to climb out somewhere or other.\" Suddenly he\ncame to a place where another chimney joined the one he was climbing,\nand here he stopped to consider the matter at his leisure. \"See now,\" he\nmuttered, \"if I still go upward I may come out at the top of some tall\nchimney-stack with no way of getting down outside. Now, below here\nthere must be a fire-place somewhere, for a chimney does not start from\nnothing at all; yes, good! we will go down a while and see what we make\nof that.\"\n\nIt was a crooked, zigzag road that he had to travel, and rough and hard\ninto the bargain. His one eye tingled and smarted, and his knees and\nelbows were rubbed to the quick; nevertheless One-eyed Hans had been in\nworse trouble than this in his life.\n\nDown he went and down he went, further than he had climbed upward\nbefore. \"Sure, I must be near some place or other,\" he thought.\n\nAs though in instant answer to his thoughts, he heard the sudden sound\nof a voice so close beneath him that he stopped short in his downward\nclimbing and stood as still as a mouse, with his heart in his mouth.\nA few inches more and he would have been discovered;--what would have\nhappened then would have been no hard matter to foretell.\n\nHans braced his back against one side of the chimney, his feet against\nthe other and then, leaning forward, looked down between his knees. The\ngray light of the coming evening glimmered in a wide stone fireplace\njust below him. Within the fireplace two people were moving about upon\nthe broad hearth, a great, fat woman and a shock-headed boy. The woman\nheld a spit with two newly trussed fowls upon it, so that One-eyed Hans\nknew that she must be the cook.\n\n\"Thou ugly toad,\" said the woman to the boy, \"did I not bid thee make a\nfire an hour ago? and now, here there is not so much as a spark to roast\nthe fowls withall, and they to be basted for the lord Baron's supper.\nWhere hast thou been for all this time?\"\n\n\"No matter,\" said the boy, sullenly, as he laid the fagots ready for the\nlighting; \"no matter, I was not running after Long Jacob, the bowman, to\ntry to catch him for a sweetheart, as thou hast been doing.\"\n\nThe reply was instant and ready. The cook raised her hand; \"smack!\" she\nstruck and a roar from the scullion followed.\n\n\"Yes, good,\" thought Hans, as he looked down upon them; \"I am glad that\nthe boy's ear was not on my head.\"\n\n\"Now give me no more of thy talk,\" said the woman, \"but do the work\nthat thou hast been bidden.\" Then--\"How came all this black soot here, I\nshould like to know?\"\n\n\"How should I know?\" snuffled the scullion, \"mayhap thou wouldst blame\nthat on me also?\"\n\n\"That is my doing,\" whispered Hans to himself; \"but if they light the\nfire, what then becomes of me?\"\n\n\"See now,\" said the cook; \"I go to make the cakes ready; if I come back\nand find that thou hast not built the fire, I will warm thy other ear\nfor thee.\"\n\n\"So,\" thought Hans; \"then will be my time to come down the chimney, for\nthere will be but one of them.\"\n\nThe next moment he heard the door close and knew that the cook had gone\nto make the cakes ready as she said. And as he looked down he saw that\nthe boy was bending over the bundle of fagots, blowing the spark that\nhe had brought in upon the punk into a flame. The dry fagots began to\ncrackle and blaze. \"Now is my time,\" said Hans to himself. Bracing his\nelbows against each side of the chimney, he straightened his legs so\nthat he might fall clear His motions loosened little shower of soot that\nfell rattling upon the fagots that were now beginning to blaze brightly,\nwhereupon the boy raised his face and looked up. Hans loosened his hold\nupon the chimney; crash! he fell, lighting upon his feet in the midst\nof the burning fagots. The scullion boy tumbled backward upon the floor,\nwhere he lay upon the broad of his back with a face as white as\ndough and eyes and mouth agape, staring speechlessly at the frightful\ninky-black figure standing in the midst of the flames and smoke. Then\nhis scattered wits came back to him. \"It is the evil one,\" he roared.\nAnd thereupon, turning upon his side, he half rolled, half scrambled to\nthe door. Then out he leaped and, banging it to behind him, flew down\nthe passageway, yelling with fright and never daring once to look behind\nhim.\n\nAll the time One-eyed Hans was brushing away the sparks that clung to\nhis clothes. He was as black as ink from head to foot with the soot from\nthe chimney.\n\n\"So far all is good,\" he muttered to himself, \"but if I go wandering\nabout in my sooty shoes I will leave black tracks to follow me, so there\nis nothing to do but e'en to go barefoot.\"\n\nHe stooped and drawing the pointed soft leather shoes from his feet, he\nthrew them upon the now blazing fagots, where they writhed and twisted\nand wrinkled, and at last burst into a flame. Meanwhile Hans lost no\ntime; he must find a hiding-place, and quickly, if he would yet hope\nto escape. A great bread trough stood in the corner of the kitchen--a\nhopper-shaped chest with a flat lid. It was the best hiding place that\nthe room afforded. Without further thought Hans ran to it, snatching up\nfrom the table as he passed a loaf of black bread and a bottle half full\nof stale wine, for he had had nothing to eat since that morning. Into\nthe great bread trough he climbed, and drawing the lid down upon him,\ncurled himself up as snugly as a mouse in its nest.\n\nFor a while the kitchen lay in silence, but at last the sound of voices\nwas heard at the door, whispering together in low tones. Suddenly the\ndoor was flung open and a tall, lean, lantern-jawed fellow, clad in\nrough frieze, strode into the room and stood there glaring with half\nfrightened boldness around about him; three or four women and the\ntrembling scullion crowded together in a frightened group behind him.\n\nThe man was Long Jacob, the bowman; but, after all, his boldness was\nall wasted, for not a thread or a hair was to be seen, but only the\ncrackling fire throwing its cheerful ruddy glow upon the wall of the\nroom, now rapidly darkening in the falling gray of the twilight without.\n\nThe fat cook's fright began rapidly to turn into anger.\n\n\"Thou imp,\" she cried, \"it is one of thy tricks,\" and she made a dive\nfor the scullion, who ducked around the skirts of one of the other women\nand so escaped for the time; but Long Jacob wrinkled up his nose and\nsniffed. \"Nay,\" said he, \"me thinks that there lieth some truth in the\ntale that the boy hath told, for here is a vile smell of burned horn\nthat the black one bath left behind him.\"\n\nIt was the smell from the soft leather shoes that Hans had burned.\n\nThe silence of night had fallen over the Castle of Trutz-Drachen; not\na sound was heard but the squeaking of mice scurring behind the\nwainscoting, the dull dripping of moisture from the eaves, or the\nsighing of the night wind around the gables and through the naked\nwindows of the castle.\n\nThe lid of the great dough trough was softly raised, and a face, black\nwith soot, peeped cautiously out from under it. Then little by little\narose a figure as black as the face; and One-eyed Hans stepped out upon\nthe floor, stretching and rubbing himself.\n\n\"Methinks I must have slept,\" he muttered. \"Hui, I am as stiff as a new\nleather doublet, and now, what next is to become of me? I hope my luck\nmay yet stick to me, in spite of this foul black soot!\"\n\nAlong the middle of the front of the great hall of the castle, ran a\nlong stone gallery, opening at one end upon the court-yard by a high\nflight of stone steps. A man-at-arms in breast-plate and steel cap, and\nbearing a long pike, paced up and down the length of this gallery, now\nand then stopping, leaning over the edge, and gazing up into the starry\nsky above; then, with a long drawn yawn, lazily turning back to the\nmonotonous watch again.\n\nA dark figure crept out from an arched doorway at the lower part of the\nlong straight building, and some little distance below the end gallery,\nbut the sentry saw nothing of it, for his back was turned. As silently\nand as stealthily as a cat the figure crawled along by the dark shadowy\nwall, now and then stopping, and then again creeping slowly forward\ntoward the gallery where the man-at-arms moved monotonously up and down.\nIt was One-eyed Hans in his bare feet.\n\nInch by inch, foot by foot--the black figure crawled along in the angle\nof the wall; inch by inch and foot by foot, but ever nearer and nearer\nto the long straight row of stone steps that led to the covered gallery.\nAt last it crouched at the lowest step of the flight. Just then the\nsentinel upon watch came to the very end of the gallery and stood there\nleaning upon his spear. Had he looked down below he could not have\nfailed to have seen One-eyed Hans lying there motionlessly; but he was\ngazing far away over the steep black roofs beyond, and never saw the\nunsuspected presence. Minute after minute passed, and the one stood\nthere looking out into the night and the other lay crouching by the\nwall; then with a weary sigh the sentry turned and began slowly pacing\nback again toward the farther end of the gallery.\n\nInstantly the motionless figure below arose and glided noiselessly and\nswiftly up the flight of steps.\n\nTwo rude stone pillars flanked either side of the end of the gallery.\nLike a shadow the black figure slipped behind one of these, flattening\nitself up against the wall, where it stood straight and motionless as\nthe shadows around it.\n\nDown the long gallery came the watchman, his sword clinking loudly in\nthe silence as he walked, tramp, tramp, tramp! clink, clank, jingle.\n\nWithin three feet of the motionless figure behind the pillar he turned,\nand began retracing his monotonous steps. Instantly the other left the\nshadow of the post and crept rapidly and stealthily after him. One step,\ntwo steps the sentinel took; for a moment the black figure behind him\nseemed to crouch and draw together, then like a flash it leaped forward\nupon its victim.\n\nA shadowy cloth fell upon the man's face, and in an instant he was flung\nback and down with a muffled crash upon the stones. Then followed a\nfierce and silent struggle in the darkness, but strong and sturdy as the\nman was, he was no match for the almost superhuman strength of One-eyed\nHans. The cloth which he had flung over his head was tied tightly and\nsecurely. Then the man was forced upon his face and, in spite of his\nfierce struggles, his arms were bound around and around with strong fine\ncord; next his feet were bound in the same way, and the task was done.\nThen Hans stood upon his feet, and wiped the sweat from his swarthy\nforehead. \"Listen, brother,\" he whispered, and as he spoke he stooped\nand pressed something cold and hard against the neck of the other.\n\"Dost thou know the feel of this? It is a broad dagger, and if thou\ndost contrive to loose that gag from thy mouth and makest any outcry, it\nshall be sheathed in thy weasand.\"\n\nSo saying, he thrust the knife back again into its sheath, then stooping\nand picking up the other, he flung him across his shoulder like a sack,\nand running down the steps as lightly as though his load was nothing at\nall, he carried his burden to the arched doorway whence he had come a\nlittle while before. There, having first stripped his prisoner of\nall his weapons, Hans sat the man up in the angle of the wall. \"So,\nbrother;\" said he, \"now we can talk with more ease than we could up\nyonder. I will tell thee frankly why I am here; it is to find where the\nyoung Baron Otto of Drachenhausen is kept. If thou canst tell me,\nwell and good; if not, I must e'en cut thy weasand and find me one who\nknoweth more. Now, canst thou tell me what I would learn, brother?\"\n\nThe other nodded dimly in the darkness.\n\n\"That is good,\" said Hans, \"then I will loose thy gag until thou hast\ntold me; only bear in mind what I said concerning my dagger.\"\n\nThereupon, he unbound his prisoner, and the fellow slowly rose to his\nfeet. He shook himself and looked all about him in a heavy, bewildered\nfashion, as though he had just awakened from a dream.\n\nHis right hand slid furtively down to his side, but the dagger-sheath\nwas empty.\n\n\"Come, brother!\" said Hans, impatiently, \"time is passing, and once lost\ncan never be found again. Show me the way to the young Baron Otto or--.\"\nAnd he whetted the shining blade of his dagger on his horny palm.\n\nThe fellow needed no further bidding; turning, he led the way, and\ntogether they were swallowed up in the yawning shadows, and again the\nhush of night-time lay upon the Castle of Trutz-Drachen.\n\n\n\n\nXI. How Otto was Saved.\n\nLittle Otto was lying upon the hard couch in his cell, tossing in\nrestless and feverish sleep; suddenly a heavy hand was laid upon him and\na voice whispered in his ear, \"Baron, Baron Otto, waken, rouse yourself;\nI am come to help you. I am One-eyed Hans.\"\n\nOtto was awake in an instant and raised himself upon his elbow in the\ndarkness. \"One-eyed Hans,\" he breathed, \"One-eyed Hans; who is One-eyed\nHans?\"\n\n\"True,\" said the other, \"thou dost not know me. I am thy father's\ntrusted servant, and am the only one excepting his own blood and kin\nwho has clung to him in this hour of trouble. Yes, all are gone but me\nalone, and so I have come to help thee away from this vile place.\"\n\n\"Oh, dear, good Hans! if only thou canst!\" cried Otto; \"if only thou\ncanst take me away from this wicked place. Alas, dear Hans! I am weary\nand sick to death.\" And poor little Otto began to weep silently in the\ndarkness.\n\n\"Aye, aye,\" said Hans, gruffly, \"it is no place for a little child\nto be. Canst thou climb, my little master? canst thou climb a knotted\nrope?\"\n\n\"Nay,\" said Otto, \"I can never climb again! See, Hans;\" and he flung\nback the covers from off him.\n\n\"I cannot see,\" said Hans, \"it is too dark.\"\n\n\"Then feel, dear Hans,\" said Otto.\n\nHans bent over the poor little white figure glimmering palely in the\ndarkness. Suddenly he drew back with a snarl like an angry wolf. \"Oh!\nthe black, bloody wretches!\" he cried, hoarsely; \"and have they done\nthat to thee, a little child?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Otto, \"the Baron Henry did it.\" And then again he began to\ncry.\n\n\"There, there,\" said Hans, roughly, \"weep no more. Thou shalt get away\nfrom here even if thou canst not climb; I myself will help thee. Thy\nfather is already waiting below the window here, and thou shalt soon be\nwith him. There, there, cry no more.\"\n\nWhile he was speaking Hans had stripped off his peddler's leathern\njacket, and there, around his body, was wrapped coil after coil of stout\nhempen rope tied in knots at short distances. He began unwinding the\nrope, and when he had done he was as thin as ever he had been before.\nNext he drew from the pouch that hung at his side a ball of fine cord\nand a leaden weight pierced by a hole, both of which he had brought with\nhim for the use to which he now put them. He tied the lead to the end of\nthe cord, then whirling the weight above his head, he flung it up toward\nthe window high above. Twice the piece of lead fell back again into the\nroom; the third time it flew out between the iron bars carrying the cord\nwith it. Hans held the ball in his hand and paid out the string as the\nweight carried it downward toward the ground beneath. Suddenly the cord\nstopped running. Hans jerked it and shook it, but it moved no farther.\n\"Pray heaven, little child,\" said he, \"that it hath reached the ground,\nfor if it hath not we are certainly lost.\"\n\n\"I do pray,\" said Otto, and he bowed his head.\n\nThen, as though in answer to his prayer, there came a twitch upon the\ncord.\n\n\"See,\" said Hans, \"they have heard thee up above in heaven; it was thy\nfather who did that.\" Quickly and deftly he tied the cord to the end of\nthe knotted rope; then he gave an answering jerk upon the string. The\nnext moment the rope was drawn up to the window and down the outside by\nthose below. Otto lay watching the rope as it crawled up to the window\nand out into the night like a great snake, while One-eyed Hans held the\nother end lest it should be drawn too far. At last it stopped. \"Good,\"\nmuttered Hans, as though to himself. \"The rope is long enough.\"\n\nHe waited for a few minutes and then, drawing upon the rope and finding\nthat it was held from below, he spat upon his hands and began slowly\nclimbing up to the window above. Winding his arm around the iron bars of\nthe grating that guarded it, he thrust his hand into the pouch that hung\nby his side, and drawing forth a file, fell to work cutting through all\nthat now lay between Otto and liberty.\n\nIt was slow, slow work, and it seemed to Otto as though Hans would never\nfinish his task, as lying upon his hard couch he watched that figure,\nblack against the sky, bending over its work. Now and then the file\nscreeched against the hard iron, and then Hans would cease for a moment,\nbut only to begin again as industriously as ever. Three or four times he\ntried the effects of his work, but still the iron held. At last he\nset his shoulder against it, and as Otto looked he saw the iron bend.\nSuddenly there was a sharp crack, and a piece of the grating went flying\nout into the night.\n\nHans tied the rope securely about the stump of the stout iron bar that\nyet remained, and then slid down again into the room below.\n\n\"My little lord,\" said he, \"dost thou think that if I carry thee, thou\nwilt be able and strong enough to cling to my neck?\"\n\n\"Aye,\" said Otto, \"methinks I will be able to do that.\"\n\n\"Then come,\" said Hans.\n\nHe stooped as he spoke, and gently lifting Otto from his rude and rugged\nbed he drew his broad leathern belt around them both, buckling it firmly\nand securely. \"It does not hurt thee?\" said he.\n\n\"Not much,\" whispered Otto faintly.\n\nThen Hans spat upon his hands, and began slowly climbing the rope.\n\nThey reached the edge of the window and there they rested for a moment,\nand Otto renewed his hold around the neck of the faithful Hans.\n\n\"And now art thou ready?\" said Hans\n\n\"Aye,\" said Otto.\n\n\"Then courage,\" said Hans, and he turned and swung his leg over the\nabyss below.\n\nThe next moment they were hanging in mid-air.\n\nOtto looked down and gave a gasp. \"The mother of heaven bless us,\" he\nwhispered, and then closed his eyes, faint and dizzy at the sight of\nthat sheer depth beneath. Hans said nothing, but shutting his teeth\nand wrapping his legs around the rope, he began slowly descending, hand\nunder hand. Down, down, down he went, until to Otto, with his eyes shut\nand his head leaning upon Hans' shoulder, it seemed as though it could\nnever end. Down, down, down. Suddenly he felt Hans draw a deep breath;\nthere was a slight jar, and Otto opened his eyes; Hans was standing upon\nthe ground.\n\nA figure wrapped in a dark cloak arose from the shadow of the wall, and\ntook Otto in its arms. It was Baron Conrad.\n\n\"My son--my little child!\" he cried, in a choked, trembling voice, and\nthat was all. And Otto pressed his cheek against his father's and began\ncrying.\n\nSuddenly the Baron gave a sharp, fierce cry. \"Dear Heaven!\" he cried;\n\"what have they done to thee?\" But poor little Otto could not answer.\n\n\"Oh!\" gasped the Baron, in a strangled voice, \"my little child! my\nlittle child!\" And therewith he broke down, and his whole body shook\nwith fierce, dry sobs; for men in those days did not seek to hide their\ngrief as they do now, but were fierce and strong in the expression of\nthat as of all else.\n\n\"Never mind, dear father,\" whispered Otto; \"it did not hurt me so very\nmuch,\" and he pressed his lips against his father's cheek.\n\nLittle Otto had but one hand.\n\n\n\n\nXII. A Ride For Life.\n\nBut not yet was Otto safe, and all danger past and gone by. Suddenly, as\nthey stood there, the harsh clangor of a bell broke the silence of\nthe starry night above their heads, and as they raised their faces and\nlooked up, they saw lights flashing from window to window. Presently\ncame the sound of a hoarse voice shouting something that, from the\ndistance, they could not understand.\n\nOne-eyed Hans smote his hand upon his thigh. Look said he, \"here is\nwhat comes of having a soft heart in one's bosom. I overcame and bound a\nwatchman up yonder, and forced him to tell me where our young Baron lay.\nIt was on my mind to run my knife into him after he had told me every\nthing, but then, bethinking how the young Baron hated the thought of\nbloodshed, I said to myself, 'No, Hans, I will spare the villain's\nlife.' See now what comes of being merciful; here, by hook or by crook,\nthe fellow has loosed himself from his bonds, and brings the whole\ncastle about our ears like a nest of wasps.\"\n\n\"We must fly,\" said the Baron; \"for nothing else in the world is\nleft me, now that all have deserted me in this black time of trouble,\nexcepting these six faithful ones.\"\n\nHis voice was bitter, bitter, as he spoke; then stooping, he raised Otto\nin his arms, and bearing him gently, began rapidly descending the rocky\nslope to the level road that ran along the edge of the hill beneath.\nClose behind him followed the rest; Hans still grimed with soot and in\nhis bare feet. A little distance from the road and under the shade of\nthe forest trees, seven horses stood waiting. The Baron mounted upon\nhis great black charger, seating little Otto upon the saddle in front of\nhim. \"Forward!\" he cried, and away they clattered and out upon the road.\nThen--\"To St. Michaelsburg,\" said Baron Conrad, in his deep voice, and\nthe horses' heads were turned to the westward, and away they galloped\nthrough the black shadows of the forest, leaving Trutz-Drachen behind\nthem.\n\nBut still the sound of the alarm bell rang through the beating of the\nhorses' hoofs, and as Hans looked over his shoulder, he saw the light\nof torches flashing hither and thither along the outer walls in front of\nthe great barbican.\n\nIn Castle Trutz-Drachen all was confusion and uproar: flashing torches\nlit up the dull gray walls; horses neighed and stamped, and men shouted\nand called to one another in the bustle of making ready. Presently Baron\nHenry came striding along the corridor clad in light armor, which he had\nhastily donned when roused from his sleep by the news that his prisoner\nhad escaped. Below in the courtyard his horse was standing, and without\nwaiting for assistance, he swung himself into the saddle. Then away they\nall rode and down the steep path, armor ringing, swords clanking, and\niron-shod hoofs striking sparks of fire from the hard stones. At their\nhead rode Baron Henry; his triangular shield hung over his shoulder, and\nin his hand he bore a long, heavy, steel-pointed lance with a pennant\nflickering darkly from the end.\n\nAt the high-road at the base of the slope they paused, for they were at\na loss to know which direction the fugitives had taken; a half a score\nof the retainers leaped from their horses, and began hurrying about\nhither and thither, and up and down, like hounds searching for the lost\nscent, and all the time Baron Henry sat still as a rock in the midst of\nthe confusion.\n\nSuddenly a shout was raised from the forest just beyond the road; they\nhad come upon the place where the horses had been tied. It was an easy\nmatter to trace the way that Baron Conrad and his followers had taken\nthence back to the high-road, but there again they were at a loss. The\nroad ran straight as an arrow eastward and westward--had the fugitives\ntaken their way to the east or to the west?\n\nBaron Henry called his head-man, Nicholas Stein, to him, and the\ntwo spoke together for a while in an undertone. At last the Baron's\nlieutenant reined his horse back, and choosing first one and then\nanother, divided the company into two parties. The baron placed himself\nat the head of one band and Nicholas Stein at the head of the other.\n\"Forward!\" he cried, and away clattered the two companies of horsemen in\nopposite directions.\n\nIt was toward the westward that Baron Henry of Trutz-Drachen rode at the\nhead of his men.\n\nThe early springtide sun shot its rays of misty, yellow light across the\nrolling tops of the forest trees where the little birds were singing in\nthe glory of the May morning. But Baron Henry and his followers thought\nnothing of the beauty of the peaceful day, and heard nothing of the\nmultitudinous sound of the singing birds as, with a confused sound of\ngalloping hoofs, they swept along the highway, leaving behind them a\nslow-curling, low-trailing cloud of dust.\n\nAs the sun rose more full and warm, the misty wreaths began to dissolve,\nuntil at last they parted and rolled asunder like a white curtain and\nthere, before the pursuing horsemen, lay the crest of the mountain\ntoward which they were riding, and up which the road wound steeply.\n\n\"Yonder they are,\" cried a sudden voice behind Baron Henry of\nTrutz-Drachen, and at the cry all looked upward.\n\nFar away upon the mountain-side curled a cloud of dust, from the midst\nof which came the star-like flash of burnished armor gleaming in the\nsun.\n\nBaron Henry said never a word, but his lips curled in a grim smile.\n\nAnd as the mist wreaths parted One-eyed Hans looked behind and down\ninto the leafy valley beneath. \"Yonder they come,\" said he. \"They have\nfollowed sharply to gain so much upon us, even though our horses are\nwearied with all the travelling we have done hither and yon these five\ndays past. How far is it, Lord Baron, from here to Michaelsburg?\"\n\n\"About ten leagues,\" said the Baron, in a gloomy voice.\n\nHans puckered his mouth as though to whistle, but the Baron saw nothing\nof it, for he was gazing straight before him with a set and stony face.\nThose who followed him looked at one another, and the same thought was\nin the mind of each--how long would it be before those who pursued would\nclose the distance between them?\n\nWhen that happened it meant death to one and all.\n\nThey reached the crest of the hill, and down they dashed upon the other\nside; for there the road was smooth and level as it sloped away into the\nvalley, but it was in dead silence that they rode. Now and then those\nwho followed the Baron looked back over their shoulders. They had gained\na mile upon their pursuers when the helmeted heads rose above the crest\nof the mountain, but what was the gain of a mile with a smooth road\nbetween them, and fresh horses to weary ones?\n\nOn they rode and on they rode. The sun rose higher and higher, and\nhotter and hotter. There was no time to rest and water their panting\nhorses. Only once, when they crossed a shallow stretch of water, the\npoor animals bent their heads and caught a few gulps from the cool\nstream, and the One-eyed Hans washed a part of the soot from his hands\nand face. On and on they rode; never once did the Baron Conrad move his\nhead or alter that steadfast look as, gazing straight before him, he\nrode steadily forward along the endless stretch of road, with poor\nlittle Otto's yellow head and white face resting against his steel-clad\nshoulder--and St. Michaelsburg still eight leagues away.\n\nA little rise of ground lay before them, and as they climbed it, all,\nexcepting the baron, turned their heads as with one accord and looked\nbehind them. Then more than one heart failed, for through the leaves\nof the trees below, they caught the glint of armor of those who\nfollowed--not more than a mile away. The next moment they swept over the\ncrest, and there, below them, lay the broad shining river, and nearer a\ntributary stream spanned by a rude, narrow, three-arched, stone bridge\nwhere the road crossed the deep, slow-moving water.\n\nDown the slope plodded the weary horses, and so to the bridge-head.\n\n\"Halt,\" cried the baron suddenly, and drew rein.\n\nThe others stood bewildered. What did he mean to do? He turned to Hans\nand his blue eyes shone like steel.\n\n\"Hans,\" said he, in his deep voice, \"thou hast served me long and truly;\nwilt thou for this one last time do my bidding?\"\n\n\"Aye,\" said Hans, briefly.\n\n\"Swear it,\" said the Baron.\n\n\"I swear it,\" said Hans, and he drew the sign of the cross upon his\nheart.\n\n\"That is good,\" said the Baron, grimly. \"Then take thou this child,\nand with the others ride with all the speed that thou canst to St.\nMichaelsburg. Give the child into the charge of the Abbot Otto. Tell\nhim how that I have sworn fealty to the Emperor, and what I have gained\nthereby--my castle burnt, my people slain, and this poor, simple child,\nmy only son, mutilated by my enemy.\n\n\"And thou, my Lord Baron?\" said Hans.\n\n\"I will stay here,\" said the Baron, quietly, \"and keep back those who\nfollow as long as God will give me grace so to do.\"\n\nA murmur of remonstrance rose among the faithful few who were with\nhim, two of whom were near of kin. But Conrad of Drachenhausen turned\nfiercely upon them.\n\n\"How now,\" said he, \"have I fallen so low in my troubles that even ye\ndare to raise your voices against me? By the good Heaven, I will begin\nmy work here by slaying the first man who dares to raise word against\nmy bidding.\" Then he turned from them. \"Here, Hans,\" said he, \"take the\nboy; and remember, knave, what thou hast sworn.\"\n\nHe pressed Otto close to his breast in one last embrace. \"My little\nchild,\" he murmured, \"try not to hate thy father when thou thinkest of\nhim hereafter, even though he be hard and bloody as thou knowest.\"\n\nBut with his suffering and weakness, little Otto knew nothing of what\nwas passing; it was only as in a faint flickering dream that he lived in\nwhat was done around him.\n\n\"Farewell, Otto,\" said the Baron, but Otto's lips only moved faintly in\nanswer. His father kissed him upon either cheek. \"Come, Hans,\" said\nhe, hastily, \"take him hence;\" and he loosed Otto's arms from about his\nneck.\n\nHans took Otto upon the saddle in front of him.\n\n\"Oh! my dear Lord Baron,\" said he, and then stopped with a gulp, and\nturned his grotesquely twitching face aside.\n\n\"Go,\" said the Baron, harshly, \"there is no time to lose in woman's\ntears.\"\n\n\"Farewell, Conrad! farewell, Conrad!\" said his two kinsmen, and coming\nforward they kissed him upon the cheek then they turned and rode away\nafter Hans, and Baron Conrad was left alone to face his mortal foe.\n\n\n\n\nXIII. How Baron Conrad Held the Bridge.\n\nAs the last of his followers swept around the curving road and was lost\nto sight, Baron Conrad gave himself a shake, as though to drive away the\nthoughts that lay upon him. Then he rode slowly forward to the middle of\nthe bridge, where he wheeled his horse so as to face his coming enemies.\nHe lowered the vizor of his helmet and bolted it to its place, and then\nsaw that sword and dagger were loose in the scabbard and easy to draw\nwhen the need for drawing should arise.\n\n\nDown the steep path from the hill above swept the pursuing horsemen.\nDown the steep path to the bridge-head and there drew rein; for in the\nmiddle of the narrow way sat the motionless, steel-clad figure upon the\ngreat war-horse, with wide, red, panting nostrils, and body streaked\nwith sweat and flecked with patches of foam.\n\nOne side of the roadway of the bridge was guarded by a low stone wall;\nthe other side was naked and open and bare to the deep, slow-moving\nwater beneath. It was a dangerous place to attack a desperate man clad\nin armor of proof.\n\n\"Forward!\" cried Baron Henry, but not a soul stirred in answer, and\nstill the iron-clad figure sat motionless and erect upon the panting\nhorse.\n\n\"How,\" cried the Baron Henry, \"are ye afraid of one man? Then follow\nme!\" and he spurred forward to the bridge-head. But still no one moved\nin answer, and the Lord of Trutz-Drachen reined back his horse again.\nHe wheeled his horse and glared round upon the stolid faces of his\nfollowers, until his eyes seemed fairly to blaze with passion beneath\nthe bars of his vizor.\n\nBaron Conrad gave a roar of laughter. \"How now,\" he cried; \"are ye all\nafraid of one man? Is there none among ye that dares come forward and\nmeet me? I know thee, Baron Henry thou art not afraid to cut off the\nhand of a little child. Hast thou not now the courage to face the\nfather?\"\n\nBaron Henry gnashed his teeth with rage as he glared around upon the\nfaces of his men-at-arms. Suddenly his eye lit upon one of them. \"Ha!\nCarl Spigler,\" he cried, \"thou hast thy cross-bow with thee;--shoot me\ndown yonder dog! Nay,\" he said, \"thou canst do him no harm under his\narmor; shoot the horse upon which he sits.\"\n\nBaron Conrad heard the speech. \"Oh! thou coward villain!\" he cried,\n\"stay; do not shoot the good horse. I will dismount and fight ye upon\nfoot.\" Thereupon, armed as he was, he leaped clashing from his horse and\nturning the animal's head, gave it a slap upon the flank. The good horse\nfirst trotted and then walked to the further end of the bridge, where it\nstopped and began cropping at the grass that grew beside the road.\n\n\"Now then!\" cried Baron Henry, fiercely, \"now then, ye cannot fear him,\nvillains! Down with him! forward!\"\n\nSlowly the troopers spurred their horses forward upon the bridge and\ntoward that one figure that, grasping tightly the great two-handed\nsword, stood there alone guarding the passage.\n\nThen Baron Conrad whirled the great blade above his head, until it\ncaught the sunlight and flashed again. He did not wait for the attack,\nbut when the first of the advancing horsemen had come within a few feet\nof him, he leaped with a shout upon them. The fellow thrust at him with\nhis lance, and the Baron went staggering a few feet back, but instantly\nhe recovered himself and again leaped forward. The great sword flashed\nin the air, whistling; it fell, and the nearest man dropped his lance,\nclattering, and with a loud, inarticulate cry, grasped the mane of his\nhorse with both hands. Again the blade whistled in the air, and this\ntime it was stained with red. Again it fell, and with another shrill cry\nthe man toppled headlong beneath the horse's feet. The next instant they\nwere upon him, each striving to strike at the one figure, to ride him\ndown, or to thrust him down with their lances. There was no room now to\nswing the long blade, but holding the hilt in both hands, Baron Conrad\nthrust with it as though it were a lance, stabbing at horse or man, it\nmattered not. Crowded upon the narrow roadway of the bridge, those who\nattacked had not only to guard themselves against the dreadful strokes\nof that terrible sword, but to keep their wounded horses (rearing and\nmad with fright) from toppling bodily over with them into the water\nbeneath.\n\nPresently the cry was raised, \"Back! back!\" And those nearest the Baron\nbegan reining in their horses. \"Forward!\" roared Baron Henry, from the\nmidst of the crowd; but in spite of his command, and even the blows that\nhe gave, those behind were borne back by those in front, struggling and\nshouting, and the bridge was cleared again excepting for three figures\nthat lay motionless upon the roadway, and that one who, with the\nbrightness of his armor dimmed and stained, leaned panting against the\nwall of the bridge.\n\nThe Baron Henry raged like a madman. Gnashing his teeth together, he\nrode back a little way; then turning and couching his lance, he suddenly\nclapped spurs to his horse, and the next instant came thundering down\nupon his solitary enemy.\n\nBaron Conrad whirled his sword in the air, as he saw the other coming\nlike a thunderbolt upon him; he leaped aside, and the lance passed close\nto him. As it passed he struck, and the iron point flew from the shaft\nof the spear at the blow, and fell clattering upon the stone roadway of\nthe bridge.\n\nBaron Henry drew in his horse until it rested upon its haunches, then\nslowly reined it backward down the bridge, still facing his foe,\nand still holding the wooden stump of the lance in his hand. At the\nbridge-head he flung it from him.\n\n\"Another lance!\" he cried, hoarsely. One was silently reached to him\nand he took it, his hand trembling with rage. Again he rode to a little\ndistance and wheeled his horse; then, driving his steel spurs into its\nquivering side, he came again thundering down upon the other. Once more\nthe terrible sword whirled in the air and fell, but this time the lance\nwas snatched to one side and the blow fell harmlessly. The next instant,\nand with a twitch of the bridle-rein, the horse struck full and fair\nagainst the man.\n\nConrad of Drachenhausen was whirled backward and downward, and the cruel\niron hoofs crashed over his prostrate body, as horse and man passed with\na rush beyond him and to the bridge-head beyond. A shout went up from\nthose who stood watching. The next moment the prostrate figure rose and\nstaggered blindly to the side of the bridge, and stood leaning against\nthe stone wall.\n\nAt the further end of the bridge Baron Henry had wheeled his horse. Once\nagain he couched lance, and again he drove down upon his bruised and\nwounded enemy. This time the lance struck full and fair, and those who\nwatched saw the steel point pierce the iron breast-plate and then snap\nshort, leaving the barbed point within the wound.\n\nBaron Conrad sunk to his knees and the Roderburg, looming upon his horse\nabove him, unsheathed his sword to finish the work he had begun.\n\nThen those who stood looking on saw a wondrous thing happen: the wounded\nman rose suddenly to his feet, and before his enemy could strike he\nleaped, with a great and bitter cry of agony and despair, upon him as he\nsat in the saddle above.\n\nHenry of Trutz-Drachen grasped at his horse's mane, but the attack\nwas so fierce, so sudden, and so unexpected that before he could save\nhimself he was dragged to one side and fell crashing in his armor upon\nthe stone roadway of the bridge.\n\n\"The dragon! the dragon!\" roared Baron Conrad, in a voice of thunder,\nand with the energy of despair he dragged his prostrate foe toward the\nopen side of the bridge.\n\n\"Forward!\" cried the chief of the Trutz-Drachen men, and down they rode\nupon the struggling knights to the rescue of their master in this new\ndanger. But they were too late.\n\nThere was a pause at the edge of the bridge, for Baron Henry had gained\nhis feet and, stunned and bewildered as he was by the suddenness of his\nfall, he was now struggling fiercely, desperately. For a moment they\nstood swaying backward and forward, clasped in one another's arms, the\nblood from the wounded man's breast staining the armor of both. The\nmoment passed and then, with a shower of stones and mortar from beneath\ntheir iron-shod heels, they toppled and fell; there was a thunderous\nsplash in the water below, and as the men-at-arms came hurrying up and\npeered with awe-struck faces over the parapet of the bridge, they saw\nthe whirling eddies sweep down with the current of the stream, a few\nbubbles rise to the surface of the water, and then--nothing; for the\nsmooth river flowed onward as silently as ever.\n\nPresently a loud voice burst through the awed hush that followed. It\ncame from William of Roderburg, Baron Henry's kinsman.\n\n\"Forward!\" he cried. A murmur of voices from the others was all the\nanswer that he received. \"Forward!\" cried the young man again, \"the boy\nand those with him are not so far away but that we might yet catch up\nwith them.\"\n\nThen one of the men spoke up in answer--a man with a seamed,\nweather-beaten face and crisp grizzled hair. \"Nay,\" said he, \"our Lord\nBaron is gone, and this is no quarrel of ours; here be four of us that\nare wounded and three I misdoubt that are dead; why should we follow\nfurther only to suffer more blows for no gain?\" A growl of assent rose\nfrom those that stood around, and William of Roderburg saw that nothing\nmore was to be done by the Trutz-Dragons that day.\n\n\n\n\nXIV. How Otto Saw the Great Emperor.\n\nThrough weakness and sickness and faintness, Otto had lain in a half\nswoon through all that long journey under the hot May sun. It was as in\na dreadful nightmare that he had heard on and on and on that monotonous\nthrobbing of galloping hoofs upon the ground; had felt that last kiss\nthat his father had given him upon his cheek. Then the onward ride\nagain, until all faded away into a dull mist and he knew no more. When\nnext he woke it was with the pungent smell of burned vinegar in his\nnostrils and with the feeling of a cool napkin bathing his brow. He\nopened his eyes and then closed them again, thinking he must have been\nin a dream, for he lay in his old room at the peaceful monastery of the\nWhite Cross on the hill; the good Father Abbot sat near by, gazing upon\nhis face with the old absent student look, Brother John sat in the deep\nwindow seat also gazing at him, and Brother Theodore, the leech of the\nmonastery, sat beside him bathing his head. Beside these old familiar\nfaces were the faces of those who had been with him in that long flight;\nthe One-eyed Hans, old Master Nicholas his kinsman, and the others.\nSo he closed his eyes, thinking that maybe it was all a dream. But the\nsharp throbbing of the poor stump at his wrist soon taught him that he\nwas still awake.\n\n\"Am I then really home in St. Michaelsburg again?\" he murmured, without\nunclosing his eyes.\n\nBrother Theodore began snuffling through his nose; there was a pause.\n\"Yes,\" said the old Abbot at last, and his gentle voice trembled as\nhe spoke; \"yes, my dear little child, thou art back again in thine own\nhome; thou hast not been long out in the great world, but truly thou\nhast had a sharp and bitter trial of it.\"\n\n\"But they will not take me away again, will they?\" said Otto quickly,\nunclosing his blue eyes.\n\n\"Nay,\" said the Abbot, gently; \"not until thou art healed in body and\nart ready and willing to go.\"\n\nThree months and more had passed, and Otto was well again; and now,\nescorted by One-eyed Hans and those faithful few who had clung to the\nBaron Conrad through his last few bitter days, he was riding into the\nquaint old town of Nurnburg; for the Emperor Rudolph was there at that\ntime, waiting for King Ottocar of Bohemia to come thither and answer\nthe imperial summons before the Council, and Otto was travelling to the\ncourt.\n\nAs they rode in through the gates of the town, Otto looked up at the\nhigh-peaked houses with their overhanging gables, the like of which he\nhad never seen before, and he stared with his round blue eyes at seeing\nthem so crowded together along the length of the street. But most of\nall he wondered at the number of people that passed hither and thither,\njostling each other in their hurry, and at the tradesmen's booths\nopening upon the street with the wonderful wares hanging within; armor\nat the smiths, glittering ornaments at the goldsmiths, and rich fabrics\nof silks and satins at the mercers. He had never seen anything so rich\nand grand in all of his life, for little Otto had never been in a town\nbefore.\n\n\"Oh! look,\" he cried, \"at that wonderful lady; see, holy father! sure\nthe Emperor's wife can be no finer than that lady.\"\n\nThe Abbot smiled. \"Nay, Otto,\" said he, \"that is but a burgher's wife or\ndaughter; the ladies at the Emperor's court are far grander than such as\nshe.\"\n\n\"So!\" said Otto, and then fell silent with wonder.\n\nAnd now, at last the great moment had come when little Otto with his own\neyes was to behold the mighty Emperor who ruled over all the powerful\nkingdoms of Germany and Austria, and Italy and Bohemia, and other\nkingdoms and principalities and states. His heart beat so that he could\nhardly speak as, for a moment, the good Abbot who held him by the hand\nstopped outside of the arrased doorway to whisper some last instructions\ninto his ear. Then they entered the apartment.\n\nIt was a long, stone-paved room. The floor was covered with rich rugs\nand the walls were hung with woven tapestry wherein were depicted\nknights and ladies in leafy gardens and kings and warriors at battle.\nA long row of high glazed windows extended along the length of the\napartment, flooding it with the mellow light of the autumn day. At\nthe further end of the room, far away, and standing by a great carved\nchimney place wherein smouldered the remains of a fire, stood a group of\nnobles in gorgeous dress of velvet and silks, and with glittering golden\nchains hung about their necks.\n\nOne figure stood alone in front of the great yawning fireplace. His\nhands were clasped behind him, and his look bent thoughtfully upon the\nfloor. He was dressed only in a simple gray robe without ornament or\nadornment, a plain leathern belt girded his waist, and from it hung a\nsword with a bone hilt encased in a brown leathern scabbard. A noble\nstag-hound lay close behind him, curled up upon the floor, basking in\nthe grateful warmth of the fire.\n\nAs the Father Abbot and Otto drew near he raised his head and looked\nat them. It was a plain, homely face that Otto saw, with a wrinkled\nforehead and a long mouth drawn down at the corners. It was the face of\na good, honest burgher burdened with the cares of a prosperous trade.\n\"Who can he be,\" thought Otto, \"and why does the poor man stand there\namong all the great nobles?\"\n\nBut the Abbot walked straight up to him and kneeled upon the floor,\nand little Otto, full of wonder, did the same. It was the great Emperor\nRudolph.\n\n\"Who have we here,\" said the Emperor, and he bent his brow upon the\nAbbot and the boy.\n\n\"Sire,\" said Abbot Otto, \"we have humbly besought you by petition, in\nthe name of your late vassal, Baron Conrad of Vuelph of Drachenhausen,\nfor justice to this his son, the Baron Otto, whom, sire, as you may see,\nhath been cruelly mutilated at the hands of Baron Henry of Roderburg of\nTrutz-Drachen. He hath moreover been despoiled of his lands, his castle\nburnt, and his household made prisoner.\"\n\nThe Emperor frowned until the shaggy eyebrows nearly hid the keen gray\ntwinkle of the eyes beneath. \"Yes,\" said he, \"I do remember me of\nthat petition, and have given it consideration both in private and in\ncouncil.\" He turned to the group of listening nobles. \"Look,\" said he,\n\"at this little child marred by the inhumanity and the cruelty of those\nrobber villains. By heavens! I will put down their lawless rapine, if I\nhave to give every castle from the north to the south to the flames and\nto the sword.\" Then turning to Otto again, \"Poor little child,\" said he,\n\"thy wrongs shall be righted, and so far as they are able, those cruel\nRoderburgs shall pay thee penny for penny, and grain for grain, for what\nthou hast lost; and until such indemnity hath been paid the family of\nthe man who wrought this deed shall be held as surety.\"\n\nLittle Otto looked up in the kind, rugged face above him. \"Nay, Lord\nEmperor,\" said he, in his quaint, quiet way, \"there are but two in the\nfamily--the mother and the daughter--and I have promised to marry the\nlittle girl when she and I are old enough; so, if you please, I would\nnot have harm happen to her.\"\n\nThe Emperor continued to look down at the kneeling boy, and at last he\ngave a short, dry laugh. \"So be it,\" said he, \"thy plan is not without\nits wisdom. Mayhap it is all for the best that the affair should be\nended thus peacefully. The estates of the Roderburgs shall be held in\ntrust for thee until thou art come of age; otherwise it shall be as thou\nhast proposed, the little maiden shall be taken into ward under our own\ncare. And as to thee--art thou willing that I should take thee under my\nown charge in the room of thy father, who is dead?\"\n\n\"Aye,\" said Otto, simply, \"I am willing, for it seems to me that thou\nart a good man.\"\n\nThe nobles who stood near smiled at the boy's speech. As for the\nEmperor, he laughed outright. \"I give thee thanks, my Lord Baron,\" said\nhe; \"there is no one in all my court who has paid me greater courtesy\nthan that.\"\n\nSo comes the end of our tale.\n\nBut perhaps you may like to know what happened afterward, for no one\ncares to leave the thread of a story without tying a knot in it.\n\nEight years had passed, and Otto grew up to manhood in the Emperor's\ncourt, and was with him through war and peace.\n\nBut he himself never drew sword or struck a blow, for the right hand\nthat hung at his side was of pure silver, and the hard, cold fingers\nnever closed. Folks called him \"Otto of the Silver Hand,\" but perhaps\nthere was another reason than that for the name that had been given him,\nfor the pure, simple wisdom that the old monks of the White Cross on\nthe hill had taught him, clung to him through all the honors that the\nEmperor bestowed upon his favorite, and as he grew older his words were\nlistened to and weighed by those who were high in Council, and even by\nthe Emperor himself.\n\nAnd now for the end of all.\n\nOne day Otto stood uncertainly at the doorway of a room in the imperial\ncastle, hesitating before he entered; and yet there was nothing so very\ndreadful within, only one poor girl whose heart fluttered more than his.\nPoor little Pauline, whom he had not seen since that last day in the\nblack cell at Trutz-Drachen.\n\nAt last he pushed aside the hangings and entered the room.\n\nShe was sitting upon a rude bench beside the window, looking at him out\nof her great, dark eyes.\n\nHe stopped short and stood for a moment confused and silent; for he had\nno thought in his mind but of the little girl whom he had last seen, and\nfor a moment he stood confused before the fair maiden with her great,\nbeautiful dark eyes.\n\nShe on her part beheld a tall, slender youth with curling, golden hair,\none hand white and delicate, the other of pure and shining silver.\n\nHe came to her and took her hand and set it to his lips, and all that\nshe could do was to gaze with her great, dark eyes upon the hero of whom\nshe had heard so many talk; the favorite of the Emperor; the wise young\nOtto of the Silver Hand.\n\n\n\n\nAfterword\n\nThe ruins of Drachenhausen were rebuilt, for the walls were as sound as\never, though empty and gaping to the sky; but it was no longer the den\nof a robber baron for beneath the scutcheon over the great gate was\ncarved a new motto of the Vuelphs; a motto which the Emperor Rudolph\nhimself had given:\n\n\"Manus argentea quam manus ferrea melior est.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Otto of the Silver Hand, by Howard Pyle", "answers": ["Otto was so young."], "length": 27745, "dataset": "narrativeqa", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "36232c9c63d19d282643657b3da5b688cb14e3b44009c494"}

HTML version by Al Haines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Adventure of the Devil's Foot\n\n\nBy\n\nSir Arthur Conan Doyle\n\n\n\n\nIn recording from time to time some of the curious experiences and\ninteresting recollections which I associate with my long and intimate\nfriendship with Mr. Sherlock Holmes, I have continually been faced by\ndifficulties caused by his own aversion to publicity.  To his sombre\nand cynical spirit all popular applause was always abhorrent, and\nnothing amused him more at the end of a successful case than to hand\nover the actual exposure to some orthodox official, and to listen with\na mocking smile to the general chorus of misplaced congratulation.  It\nwas indeed this attitude upon the part of my friend and certainly not\nany lack of interesting material which has caused me of late years to\nlay very few of my records before the public.  My participation in some\nof his adventures was always a privilege which entailed discretion and\nreticence upon me.\n\nIt was, then, with considerable surprise that I received a telegram\nfrom Holmes last Tuesday--he has never been known to write where a\ntelegram would serve--in the following terms:\n\nWhy not tell them of the Cornish horror--strangest case I have handled.\n\nI have no idea what backward sweep of memory had brought the matter\nfresh to his mind, or what freak had caused him to desire that I should\nrecount it; but I hasten, before another cancelling telegram may\narrive, to hunt out the notes which give me the exact details of the\ncase and to lay the narrative before my readers.\n\nIt was, then, in the spring of the year 1897 that Holmes's iron\nconstitution showed some symptoms of giving way in the face of constant\nhard work of a most exacting kind, aggravated, perhaps, by occasional\nindiscretions of his own.  In March of that year Dr. Moore Agar, of\nHarley Street, whose dramatic introduction to Holmes I may some day\nrecount, gave positive injunctions that the famous private agent lay\naside all his cases and surrender himself to complete rest if he wished\nto avert an absolute breakdown.  The state of his health was not a\nmatter in which he himself took the faintest interest, for his mental\ndetachment was absolute, but he was induced at last, on the threat of\nbeing permanently disqualified from work, to give himself a complete\nchange of scene and air.  Thus it was that in the early spring of that\nyear we found ourselves together in a small cottage near Poldhu Bay, at\nthe further extremity of the Cornish peninsula.\n\nIt was a singular spot, and one peculiarly well suited to the grim\nhumour of my patient.  From the windows of our little whitewashed\nhouse, which stood high upon a grassy headland, we looked down upon the\nwhole sinister semicircle of Mounts Bay, that old death trap of sailing\nvessels, with its fringe of black cliffs and surge-swept reefs on which\ninnumerable seamen have met their end.  With a northerly breeze it lies\nplacid and sheltered, inviting the storm-tossed craft to tack into it\nfor rest and protection.\n\nThen come the sudden swirl round of the wind, the blistering gale from\nthe south-west, the dragging anchor, the lee shore, and the last battle\nin the creaming breakers.  The wise mariner stands far out from that\nevil place.\n\nOn the land side our surroundings were as sombre as on the sea. It was\na country of rolling moors, lonely and dun-colored, with an occasional\nchurch tower to mark the site of some old-world village.  In every\ndirection upon these moors there were traces of some vanished race\nwhich had passed utterly away, and left as its sole record strange\nmonuments of stone, irregular mounds which contained the burned ashes\nof the dead, and curious earthworks which hinted at prehistoric strife.\nThe glamour and mystery of the place, with its sinister atmosphere of\nforgotten nations, appealed to the imagination of my friend, and he\nspent much of his time in long walks and solitary meditations upon the\nmoor. The ancient Cornish language had also arrested his attention, and\nhe had, I remember, conceived the idea that it was akin to the\nChaldean, and had been largely derived from the Phoenician traders in\ntin.  He had received a consignment of books upon philology and was\nsettling down to develop this thesis when suddenly, to my sorrow and to\nhis unfeigned delight, we found ourselves, even in that land of dreams,\nplunged into a problem at our very doors which was more intense, more\nengrossing, and infinitely more mysterious than any of those which had\ndriven us from London.  Our simple life and peaceful, healthy routine\nwere violently interrupted, and we were precipitated into the midst of\na series of events which caused the utmost excitement not only in\nCornwall but throughout the whole west of England. Many of my readers\nmay retain some recollection of what was called at the time \"The\nCornish Horror,\" though a most imperfect account of the matter reached\nthe London press. Now, after thirteen years, I will give the true\ndetails of this inconceivable affair to the public.\n\nI have said that scattered towers marked the villages which dotted this\npart of Cornwall.  The nearest of these was the hamlet of Tredannick\nWollas, where the cottages of a couple of hundred inhabitants clustered\nround an ancient, moss-grown church.  The vicar of the parish, Mr.\nRoundhay, was something of an archaeologist, and as such Holmes had\nmade his acquaintance. He was a middle-aged man, portly and affable,\nwith a considerable fund of local lore.  At his invitation we had taken\ntea at the vicarage and had come to know, also, Mr. Mortimer Tregennis,\nan independent gentleman, who increased the clergyman's scanty\nresources by taking rooms in his large, straggling house.  The vicar,\nbeing a bachelor, was glad to come to such an arrangement, though he\nhad little in common with his lodger, who was a thin, dark, spectacled\nman, with a stoop which gave the impression of actual, physical\ndeformity.  I remember that during our short visit we found the vicar\ngarrulous, but his lodger strangely reticent, a sad-faced,\nintrospective man, sitting with averted eyes, brooding apparently upon\nhis own affairs.\n\nThese were the two men who entered abruptly into our little\nsitting-room on Tuesday, March the 16th, shortly after our breakfast\nhour, as we were smoking together, preparatory to our daily excursion\nupon the moors.\n\n\"Mr. Holmes,\" said the vicar in an agitated voice, \"the most\nextraordinary and tragic affair has occurred during the night. It is\nthe most unheard-of business.  We can only regard it as a special\nProvidence that you should chance to be here at the time, for in all\nEngland you are the one man we need.\"\n\nI glared at the intrusive vicar with no very friendly eyes; but Holmes\ntook his pipe from his lips and sat up in his chair like an old hound\nwho hears the view-halloa.  He waved his hand to the sofa, and our\npalpitating visitor with his agitated companion sat side by side upon\nit.  Mr. Mortimer Tregennis was more self-contained than the clergyman,\nbut the twitching of his thin hands and the brightness of his dark eyes\nshowed that they shared a common emotion.\n\n\"Shall I speak or you?\" he asked of the vicar.\n\n\"Well, as you seem to have made the discovery, whatever it may be, and\nthe vicar to have had it second-hand, perhaps you had better do the\nspeaking,\" said Holmes.\n\nI glanced at the hastily clad clergyman, with the formally dressed\nlodger seated beside him, and was amused at the surprise which Holmes's\nsimple deduction had brought to their faces.\n\n\"Perhaps I had best say a few words first,\" said the vicar, \"and then\nyou can judge if you will listen to the details from Mr. Tregennis, or\nwhether we should not hasten at once to the scene of this mysterious\naffair.  I may explain, then, that our friend here spent last evening\nin the company of his two brothers, Owen and George, and of his sister\nBrenda, at their house of Tredannick Wartha, which is near the old\nstone cross upon the moor.  He left them shortly after ten o'clock,\nplaying cards round the dining-room table, in excellent health and\nspirits. This morning, being an early riser, he walked in that\ndirection before breakfast and was overtaken by the carriage of Dr.\nRichards, who explained that he had just been sent for on a most urgent\ncall to Tredannick Wartha.  Mr. Mortimer Tregennis naturally went with\nhim.  When he arrived at Tredannick Wartha he found an extraordinary\nstate of things.  His two brothers and his sister were seated round the\ntable exactly as he had left them, the cards still spread in front of\nthem and the candles burned down to their sockets.  The sister lay back\nstone-dead in her chair, while the two brothers sat on each side of her\nlaughing, shouting, and singing, the senses stricken clean out of them.\nAll three of them, the dead woman and the two demented men, retained\nupon their faces an expression of the utmost horror--a convulsion of\nterror which was dreadful to look upon.  There was no sign of the\npresence of anyone in the house, except Mrs. Porter, the old cook and\nhousekeeper, who declared that she had slept deeply and heard no sound\nduring the night.  Nothing had been stolen or disarranged, and there is\nabsolutely no explanation of what the horror can be which has\nfrightened a woman to death and two strong men out of their senses.\nThere is the situation, Mr. Holmes, in a nutshell, and if you can help\nus to clear it up you will have done a great work.\"\n\nI had hoped that in some way I could coax my companion back into the\nquiet which had been the object of our journey; but one glance at his\nintense face and contracted eyebrows told me how vain was now the\nexpectation.  He sat for some little time in silence, absorbed in the\nstrange drama which had broken in upon our peace.\n\n\"I will look into this matter,\" he said at last.  \"On the face of it,\nit would appear to be a case of a very exceptional nature. Have you\nbeen there yourself, Mr. Roundhay?\"\n\n\"No, Mr. Holmes.  Mr. Tregennis brought back the account to the\nvicarage, and I at once hurried over with him to consult you.\"\n\n\"How far is it to the house where this singular tragedy occurred?\"\n\n\"About a mile inland.\"\n\n\"Then we shall walk over together.  But before we start I must ask you\na few questions, Mr. Mortimer Tregennis.\"\n\nThe other had been silent all this time, but I had observed that his\nmore controlled excitement was even greater than the obtrusive emotion\nof the clergyman.  He sat with a pale, drawn face, his anxious gaze\nfixed upon Holmes, and his thin hands clasped convulsively together.\nHis pale lips quivered as he listened to the dreadful experience which\nhad befallen his family, and his dark eyes seemed to reflect something\nof the horror of the scene.\n\n\"Ask what you like, Mr. Holmes,\" said he eagerly.  \"It is a bad thing\nto speak of, but I will answer you the truth.\"\n\n\"Tell me about last night.\"\n\n\"Well, Mr. Holmes, I supped there, as the vicar has said, and my elder\nbrother George proposed a game of whist afterwards.  We sat down about\nnine o'clock.  It was a quarter-past ten when I moved to go.  I left\nthem all round the table, as merry as could be.\"\n\n\"Who let you out?\"\n\n\"Mrs. Porter had gone to bed, so I let myself out.  I shut the hall\ndoor behind me.  The window of the room in which they sat was closed,\nbut the blind was not drawn down.  There was no change in door or\nwindow this morning, or any reason to think that any stranger had been\nto the house.  Yet there they sat, driven clean mad with terror, and\nBrenda lying dead of fright, with her head hanging over the arm of the\nchair.  I'll never get the sight of that room out of my mind so long as\nI live.\"\n\n\"The facts, as you state them, are certainly most remarkable,\" said\nHolmes.  \"I take it that you have no theory yourself which can in any\nway account for them?\"\n\n\"It's devilish, Mr. Holmes, devilish!\" cried Mortimer Tregennis. \"It is\nnot of this world.  Something has come into that room which has dashed\nthe light of reason from their minds.  What human contrivance could do\nthat?\"\n\n\"I fear,\" said Holmes, \"that if the matter is beyond humanity it is\ncertainly beyond me.  Yet we must exhaust all natural explanations\nbefore we fall back upon such a theory as this.  As to yourself, Mr.\nTregennis, I take it you were divided in some way from your family,\nsince they lived together and you had rooms apart?\"\n\n\"That is so, Mr. Holmes, though the matter is past and done with. We\nwere a family of tin-miners at Redruth, but we sold our venture to a\ncompany, and so retired with enough to keep us.  I won't deny that\nthere was some feeling about the division of the money and it stood\nbetween us for a time, but it was all forgiven and forgotten, and we\nwere the best of friends together.\"\n\n\"Looking back at the evening which you spent together, does anything\nstand out in your memory as throwing any possible light upon the\ntragedy?  Think carefully, Mr. Tregennis, for any clue which can help\nme.\"\n\n\"There is nothing at all, sir.\"\n\n\"Your people were in their usual spirits?\"\n\n\"Never better.\"\n\n\"Were they nervous people?  Did they ever show any apprehension of\ncoming danger?\"\n\n\"Nothing of the kind.\"\n\n\"You have nothing to add then, which could assist me?\"\n\nMortimer Tregennis considered earnestly for a moment.\n\n\"There is one thing occurs to me,\" said he at last.  \"As we sat at the\ntable my back was to the window, and my brother George, he being my\npartner at cards, was facing it.  I saw him once look hard over my\nshoulder, so I turned round and looked also.  The blind was up and the\nwindow shut, but I could just make out the bushes on the lawn, and it\nseemed to me for a moment that I saw something moving among them.  I\ncouldn't even say if it was man or animal, but I just thought there was\nsomething there.  When I asked him what he was looking at, he told me\nthat he had the same feeling.  That is all that I can say.\"\n\n\"Did you not investigate?\"\n\n\"No; the matter passed as unimportant.\"\n\n\"You left them, then, without any premonition of evil?\"\n\n\"None at all.\"\n\n\"I am not clear how you came to hear the news so early this morning.\"\n\n\"I am an early riser and generally take a walk before breakfast. This\nmorning I had hardly started when the doctor in his carriage overtook\nme.  He told me that old Mrs. Porter had sent a boy down with an urgent\nmessage.  I sprang in beside him and we drove on. When we got there we\nlooked into that dreadful room.  The candles and the fire must have\nburned out hours before, and they had been sitting there in the dark\nuntil dawn had broken.  The doctor said Brenda must have been dead at\nleast six hours.  There were no signs of violence.  She just lay across\nthe arm of the chair with that look on her face.  George and Owen were\nsinging snatches of songs and gibbering like two great apes.  Oh, it\nwas awful to see!  I couldn't stand it, and the doctor was as white as\na sheet.  Indeed, he fell into a chair in a sort of faint, and we\nnearly had him on our hands as well.\"\n\n\"Remarkable--most remarkable!\" said Holmes, rising and taking his hat.\n\"I think, perhaps, we had better go down to Tredannick Wartha without\nfurther delay.  I confess that I have seldom known a case which at\nfirst sight presented a more singular problem.\"\n\n\nOur proceedings of that first morning did little to advance the\ninvestigation.  It was marked, however, at the outset by an incident\nwhich left the most sinister impression upon my mind. The approach to\nthe spot at which the tragedy occurred is down a narrow, winding,\ncountry lane.  While we made our way along it we heard the rattle of a\ncarriage coming towards us and stood aside to let it pass.  As it drove\nby us I caught a glimpse through the closed window of a horribly\ncontorted, grinning face glaring out at us.  Those staring eyes and\ngnashing teeth flashed past us like a dreadful vision.\n\n\"My brothers!\" cried Mortimer Tregennis, white to his lips. \"They are\ntaking them to Helston.\"\n\nWe looked with horror after the black carriage, lumbering upon its way.\nThen we turned our steps towards this ill-omened house in which they\nhad met their strange fate.\n\nIt was a large and bright dwelling, rather a villa than a cottage, with\na considerable garden which was already, in that Cornish air, well\nfilled with spring flowers.  Towards this garden the window of the\nsitting-room fronted, and from it, according to Mortimer Tregennis,\nmust have come that thing of evil which had by sheer horror in a single\ninstant blasted their minds.  Holmes walked slowly and thoughtfully\namong the flower-plots and along the path before we entered the porch.\nSo absorbed was he in his thoughts, I remember, that he stumbled over\nthe watering-pot, upset its contents, and deluged both our feet and the\ngarden path.  Inside the house we were met by the elderly Cornish\nhousekeeper, Mrs. Porter, who, with the aid of a young girl, looked\nafter the wants of the family.  She readily answered all Holmes's\nquestions.  She had heard nothing in the night.  Her employers had all\nbeen in excellent spirits lately, and she had never known them more\ncheerful and prosperous.  She had fainted with horror upon entering the\nroom in the morning and seeing that dreadful company round the table.\nShe had, when she recovered, thrown open the window to let the morning\nair in, and had run down to the lane, whence she sent a farm-lad for\nthe doctor.  The lady was on her bed upstairs if we cared to see her.\nIt took four strong men to get the brothers into the asylum carriage.\nShe would not herself stay in the house another day and was starting\nthat very afternoon to rejoin her family at St. Ives.\n\nWe ascended the stairs and viewed the body.  Miss Brenda Tregennis had\nbeen a very beautiful girl, though now verging upon middle age.  Her\ndark, clear-cut face was handsome, even in death, but there still\nlingered upon it something of that convulsion of horror which had been\nher last human emotion.  From her bedroom we descended to the\nsitting-room, where this strange tragedy had actually occurred.  The\ncharred ashes of the overnight fire lay in the grate.  On the table\nwere the four guttered and burned-out candles, with the cards scattered\nover its surface.  The chairs had been moved back against the walls,\nbut all else was as it had been the night before.  Holmes paced with\nlight, swift steps about the room; he sat in the various chairs,\ndrawing them up and reconstructing their positions.  He tested how much\nof the garden was visible; he examined the floor, the ceiling, and the\nfireplace; but never once did I see that sudden brightening of his eyes\nand tightening of his lips which would have told me that he saw some\ngleam of light in this utter darkness.\n\n\"Why a fire?\" he asked once.  \"Had they always a fire in this small\nroom on a spring evening?\"\n\nMortimer Tregennis explained that the night was cold and damp. For that\nreason, after his arrival, the fire was lit.  \"What are you going to do\nnow, Mr. Holmes?\" he asked.\n\nMy friend smiled and laid his hand upon my arm.  \"I think, Watson, that\nI shall resume that course of tobacco-poisoning which you have so often\nand so justly condemned,\" said he.  \"With your permission, gentlemen,\nwe will now return to our cottage, for I am not aware that any new\nfactor is likely to come to our notice here.  I will turn the facts\nover in my mind, Mr. Tregennis, and should anything occur to me I will\ncertainly communicate with you and the vicar.  In the meantime I wish\nyou both good-morning.\"\n\nIt was not until long after we were back in Poldhu Cottage that Holmes\nbroke his complete and absorbed silence.  He sat coiled in his\narmchair, his haggard and ascetic face hardly visible amid the blue\nswirl of his tobacco smoke, his black brows drawn down, his forehead\ncontracted, his eyes vacant and far away.  Finally he laid down his\npipe and sprang to his feet.\n\n\"It won't do, Watson!\" said he with a laugh.  \"Let us walk along the\ncliffs together and search for flint arrows.  We are more likely to\nfind them than clues to this problem.  To let the brain work without\nsufficient material is like racing an engine.  It racks itself to\npieces.  The sea air, sunshine, and patience, Watson--all else will\ncome.\n\n\"Now, let us calmly define our position, Watson,\" he continued as we\nskirted the cliffs together.  \"Let us get a firm grip of the very\nlittle which we DO know, so that when fresh facts arise we may be ready\nto fit them into their places.  I take it, in the first place, that\nneither of us is prepared to admit diabolical intrusions into the\naffairs of men.  Let us begin by ruling that entirely out of our minds.\nVery good.  There remain three persons who have been grievously\nstricken by some conscious or unconscious human agency.  That is firm\nground.  Now, when did this occur?  Evidently, assuming his narrative\nto be true, it was immediately after Mr. Mortimer Tregennis had left\nthe room.  That is a very important point.  The presumption is that it\nwas within a few minutes afterwards.  The cards still lay upon the\ntable. It was already past their usual hour for bed.  Yet they had not\nchanged their position or pushed back their chairs.  I repeat, then,\nthat the occurrence was immediately after his departure, and not later\nthan eleven o'clock last night.\n\n\"Our next obvious step is to check, so far as we can, the movements of\nMortimer Tregennis after he left the room.  In this there is no\ndifficulty, and they seem to be above suspicion. Knowing my methods as\nyou do, you were, of course, conscious of the somewhat clumsy water-pot\nexpedient by which I obtained a clearer impress of his foot than might\notherwise have been possible.  The wet, sandy path took it admirably.\nLast night was also wet, you will remember, and it was not\ndifficult--having obtained a sample print--to pick out his track among\nothers and to follow his movements.  He appears to have walked away\nswiftly in the direction of the vicarage.\n\n\"If, then, Mortimer Tregennis disappeared from the scene, and yet some\noutside person affected the card-players, how can we reconstruct that\nperson, and how was such an impression of horror conveyed?  Mrs. Porter\nmay be eliminated.  She is evidently harmless.  Is there any evidence\nthat someone crept up to the garden window and in some manner produced\nso terrific an effect that he drove those who saw it out of their\nsenses?  The only suggestion in this direction comes from Mortimer\nTregennis himself, who says that his brother spoke about some movement\nin the garden.  That is certainly remarkable, as the night was rainy,\ncloudy, and dark.  Anyone who had the design to alarm these people\nwould be compelled to place his very face against the glass before he\ncould be seen.  There is a three-foot flower-border outside this\nwindow, but no indication of a footmark.  It is difficult to imagine,\nthen, how an outsider could have made so terrible an impression upon\nthe company, nor have we found any possible motive for so strange and\nelaborate an attempt.  You perceive our difficulties, Watson?\"\n\n\"They are only too clear,\" I answered with conviction.\n\n\"And yet, with a little more material, we may prove that they are not\ninsurmountable,\" said Holmes.  \"I fancy that among your extensive\narchives, Watson, you may find some which were nearly as obscure.\nMeanwhile, we shall put the case aside until more accurate data are\navailable, and devote the rest of our morning to the pursuit of\nneolithic man.\"\n\nI may have commented upon my friend's power of mental detachment, but\nnever have I wondered at it more than upon that spring morning in\nCornwall when for two hours he discoursed upon celts, arrowheads, and\nshards, as lightly as if no sinister mystery were waiting for his\nsolution.  It was not until we had returned in the afternoon to our\ncottage that we found a visitor awaiting us, who soon brought our minds\nback to the matter in hand.  Neither of us needed to be told who that\nvisitor was.  The huge body, the craggy and deeply seamed face with the\nfierce eyes and hawk-like nose, the grizzled hair which nearly brushed\nour cottage ceiling, the beard--golden at the fringes and white near\nthe lips, save for the nicotine stain from his perpetual cigar--all\nthese were as well known in London as in Africa, and could only be\nassociated with the tremendous personality of Dr. Leon Sterndale, the\ngreat lion-hunter and explorer.\n\nWe had heard of his presence in the district and had once or twice\ncaught sight of his tall figure upon the moorland paths. He made no\nadvances to us, however, nor would we have dreamed of doing so to him,\nas it was well known that it was his love of seclusion which caused him\nto spend the greater part of the intervals between his journeys in a\nsmall bungalow buried in the lonely wood of Beauchamp Arriance.  Here,\namid his books and his maps, he lived an absolutely lonely life,\nattending to his own simple wants and paying little apparent heed to\nthe affairs of his neighbours.  It was a surprise to me, therefore, to\nhear him asking Holmes in an eager voice whether he had made any\nadvance in his reconstruction of this mysterious episode.  \"The county\npolice are utterly at fault,\" said he, \"but perhaps your wider\nexperience has suggested some conceivable explanation.  My only claim\nto being taken into your confidence is that during my many residences\nhere I have come to know this family of Tregennis very well--indeed,\nupon my Cornish mother's side I could call them cousins--and their\nstrange fate has naturally been a great shock to me.  I may tell you\nthat I had got as far as Plymouth upon my way to Africa, but the news\nreached me this morning, and I came straight back again to help in the\ninquiry.\"\n\nHolmes raised his eyebrows.\n\n\"Did you lose your boat through it?\"\n\n\"I will take the next.\"\n\n\"Dear me! that is friendship indeed.\"\n\n\"I tell you they were relatives.\"\n\n\"Quite so--cousins of your mother.  Was your baggage aboard the ship?\"\n\n\"Some of it, but the main part at the hotel.\"\n\n\"I see.  But surely this event could not have found its way into the\nPlymouth morning papers.\"\n\n\"No, sir; I had a telegram.\"\n\n\"Might I ask from whom?\"\n\nA shadow passed over the gaunt face of the explorer.\n\n\"You are very inquisitive, Mr. Holmes.\"\n\n\"It is my business.\"\n\nWith an effort Dr. Sterndale recovered his ruffled composure.\n\n\"I have no objection to telling you,\" he said.  \"It was Mr. Roundhay,\nthe vicar, who sent me the telegram which recalled me.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Holmes.  \"I may say in answer to your original\nquestion that I have not cleared my mind entirely on the subject of\nthis case, but that I have every hope of reaching some conclusion.  It\nwould be premature to say more.\"\n\n\"Perhaps you would not mind telling me if your suspicions point in any\nparticular direction?\"\n\n\"No, I can hardly answer that.\"\n\n\"Then I have wasted my time and need not prolong my visit.\"  The famous\ndoctor strode out of our cottage in considerable ill-humour, and within\nfive minutes Holmes had followed him.  I saw him no more until the\nevening, when he returned with a slow step and haggard face which\nassured me that he had made no great progress with his investigation.\nHe glanced at a telegram which awaited him and threw it into the grate.\n\n\"From the Plymouth hotel, Watson,\" he said.  \"I learned the name of it\nfrom the vicar, and I wired to make certain that Dr. Leon Sterndale's\naccount was true.  It appears that he did indeed spend last night\nthere, and that he has actually allowed some of his baggage to go on to\nAfrica, while he returned to be present at this investigation.  What do\nyou make of that, Watson?\"\n\n\"He is deeply interested.\"\n\n\"Deeply interested--yes.  There is a thread here which we had not yet\ngrasped and which might lead us through the tangle.  Cheer up, Watson,\nfor I am very sure that our material has not yet all come to hand.\nWhen it does we may soon leave our difficulties behind us.\"\n\nLittle did I think how soon the words of Holmes would be realized, or\nhow strange and sinister would be that new development which opened up\nan entirely fresh line of investigation.  I was shaving at my window in\nthe morning when I heard the rattle of hoofs and, looking up, saw a\ndog-cart coming at a gallop down the road.  It pulled up at our door,\nand our friend, the vicar, sprang from it and rushed up our garden\npath. Holmes was already dressed, and we hastened down to meet him.\n\nOur visitor was so excited that he could hardly articulate, but at last\nin gasps and bursts his tragic story came out of him.\n\n\"We are devil-ridden, Mr. Holmes!  My poor parish is devil-ridden!\" he\ncried.  \"Satan himself is loose in it!  We are given over into his\nhands!\"  He danced about in his agitation, a ludicrous object if it\nwere not for his ashy face and startled eyes.  Finally he shot out his\nterrible news.\n\n\"Mr. Mortimer Tregennis died during the night, and with exactly the\nsame symptoms as the rest of his family.\"\n\nHolmes sprang to his feet, all energy in an instant.\n\n\"Can you fit us both into your dog-cart?\"\n\n\"Yes, I can.\"\n\n\"Then, Watson, we will postpone our breakfast.  Mr. Roundhay, we are\nentirely at your disposal.  Hurry--hurry, before things get\ndisarranged.\"\n\nThe lodger occupied two rooms at the vicarage, which were in an angle\nby themselves, the one above the other.  Below was a large\nsitting-room; above, his bedroom.  They looked out upon a croquet lawn\nwhich came up to the windows.  We had arrived before the doctor or the\npolice, so that everything was absolutely undisturbed.  Let me describe\nexactly the scene as we saw it upon that misty March morning.  It has\nleft an impression which can never be effaced from my mind.\n\nThe atmosphere of the room was of a horrible and depressing stuffiness.\nThe servant who had first entered had thrown up the window, or it would\nhave been even more intolerable.  This might partly be due to the fact\nthat a lamp stood flaring and smoking on the centre table.  Beside it\nsat the dead man, leaning back in his chair, his thin beard projecting,\nhis spectacles pushed up on to his forehead, and his lean dark face\nturned towards the window and twisted into the same distortion of\nterror which had marked the features of his dead sister.  His limbs\nwere convulsed and his fingers contorted as though he had died in a\nvery paroxysm of fear.  He was fully clothed, though there were signs\nthat his dressing had been done in a hurry.  We had already learned\nthat his bed had been slept in, and that the tragic end had come to him\nin the early morning.\n\nOne realized the red-hot energy which underlay Holmes's phlegmatic\nexterior when one saw the sudden change which came over him from the\nmoment that he entered the fatal apartment.  In an instant he was tense\nand alert, his eyes shining, his face set, his limbs quivering with\neager activity.  He was out on the lawn, in through the window, round\nthe room, and up into the bedroom, for all the world like a dashing\nfoxhound drawing a cover.  In the bedroom he made a rapid cast around\nand ended by throwing open the window, which appeared to give him some\nfresh cause for excitement, for he leaned out of it with loud\nejaculations of interest and delight.  Then he rushed down the stair,\nout through the open window, threw himself upon his face on the lawn,\nsprang up and into the room once more, all with the energy of the\nhunter who is at the very heels of his quarry.  The lamp, which was an\nordinary standard, he examined with minute care, making certain\nmeasurements upon its bowl.  He carefully scrutinized with his lens the\ntalc shield which covered the top of the chimney and scraped off some\nashes which adhered to its upper surface, putting some of them into an\nenvelope, which he placed in his pocketbook.  Finally, just as the\ndoctor and the official police put in an appearance, he beckoned to the\nvicar and we all three went out upon the lawn.\n\n\"I am glad to say that my investigation has not been entirely barren,\"\nhe remarked.  \"I cannot remain to discuss the matter with the police,\nbut I should be exceedingly obliged, Mr. Roundhay, if you would give\nthe inspector my compliments and direct his attention to the bedroom\nwindow and to the sitting-room lamp.  Each is suggestive, and together\nthey are almost conclusive.  If the police would desire further\ninformation I shall be happy to see any of them at the cottage.  And\nnow, Watson, I think that, perhaps, we shall be better employed\nelsewhere.\"\n\nIt may be that the police resented the intrusion of an amateur, or that\nthey imagined themselves to be upon some hopeful line of investigation;\nbut it is certain that we heard nothing from them for the next two\ndays.  During this time Holmes spent some of his time smoking and\ndreaming in the cottage; but a greater portion in country walks which\nhe undertook alone, returning after many hours without remark as to\nwhere he had been.  One experiment served to show me the line of his\ninvestigation.  He had bought a lamp which was the duplicate of the one\nwhich had burned in the room of Mortimer Tregennis on the morning of\nthe tragedy.  This he filled with the same oil as that used at the\nvicarage, and he carefully timed the period which it would take to be\nexhausted. Another experiment which he made was of a more unpleasant\nnature, and one which I am not likely ever to forget.\n\n\"You will remember, Watson,\" he remarked one afternoon, \"that there is\na single common point of resemblance in the varying reports which have\nreached us.  This concerns the effect of the atmosphere of the room in\neach case upon those who had first entered it.  You will recollect that\nMortimer Tregennis, in describing the episode of his last visit to his\nbrother's house, remarked that the doctor on entering the room fell\ninto a chair? You had forgotten?  Well I can answer for it that it was\nso. Now, you will remember also that Mrs. Porter, the housekeeper, told\nus that she herself fainted upon entering the room and had afterwards\nopened the window.  In the second case--that of Mortimer Tregennis\nhimself--you cannot have forgotten the horrible stuffiness of the room\nwhen we arrived, though the servant had thrown open the window.  That\nservant, I found upon inquiry, was so ill that she had gone to her bed.\nYou will admit, Watson, that these facts are very suggestive.  In each\ncase there is evidence of a poisonous atmosphere.  In each case, also,\nthere is combustion going on in the room--in the one case a fire, in\nthe other a lamp.  The fire was needed, but the lamp was lit--as a\ncomparison of the oil consumed will show--long after it was broad\ndaylight.  Why?  Surely because there is some connection between three\nthings--the burning, the stuffy atmosphere, and, finally, the madness\nor death of those unfortunate people.  That is clear, is it not?\"\n\n\"It would appear so.\"\n\n\"At least we may accept it as a working hypothesis.  We will suppose,\nthen, that something was burned in each case which produced an\natmosphere causing strange toxic effects.  Very good. In the first\ninstance--that of the Tregennis family--this substance was placed in\nthe fire.  Now the window was shut, but the fire would naturally carry\nfumes to some extent up the chimney.  Hence one would expect the\neffects of the poison to be less than in the second case, where there\nwas less escape for the vapour.  The result seems to indicate that it\nwas so, since in the first case only the woman, who had presumably the\nmore sensitive organism, was killed, the others exhibiting that\ntemporary or permanent lunacy which is evidently the first effect of\nthe drug.  In the second case the result was complete.  The facts,\ntherefore, seem to bear out the theory of a poison which worked by\ncombustion.\n\n\"With this train of reasoning in my head I naturally looked about in\nMortimer Tregennis's room to find some remains of this substance.  The\nobvious place to look was the talc shelf or smoke-guard of the lamp.\nThere, sure enough, I perceived a number of flaky ashes, and round the\nedges a fringe of brownish powder, which had not yet been consumed.\nHalf of this I took, as you saw, and I placed it in an envelope.\"\n\n\"Why half, Holmes?\"\n\n\"It is not for me, my dear Watson, to stand in the way of the official\npolice force.  I leave them all the evidence which I found.  The poison\nstill remained upon the talc had they the wit to find it.  Now, Watson,\nwe will light our lamp; we will, however, take the precaution to open\nour window to avoid the premature decease of two deserving members of\nsociety, and you will seat yourself near that open window in an\narmchair unless, like a sensible man, you determine to have nothing to\ndo with the affair.  Oh, you will see it out, will you?  I thought I\nknew my Watson.  This chair I will place opposite yours, so that we may\nbe the same distance from the poison and face to face.  The door we\nwill leave ajar.  Each is now in a position to watch the other and to\nbring the experiment to an end should the symptoms seem alarming.  Is\nthat all clear?  Well, then, I take our powder--or what remains of\nit--from the envelope, and I lay it above the burning lamp.  So!  Now,\nWatson, let us sit down and await developments.\"\n\nThey were not long in coming.  I had hardly settled in my chair before\nI was conscious of a thick, musky odour, subtle and nauseous.  At the\nvery first whiff of it my brain and my imagination were beyond all\ncontrol.  A thick, black cloud swirled before my eyes, and my mind told\nme that in this cloud, unseen as yet, but about to spring out upon my\nappalled senses, lurked all that was vaguely horrible, all that was\nmonstrous and inconceivably wicked in the universe.  Vague shapes\nswirled and swam amid the dark cloud-bank, each a menace and a warning\nof something coming, the advent of some unspeakable dweller upon the\nthreshold, whose very shadow would blast my soul.  A freezing horror\ntook possession of me.  I felt that my hair was rising, that my eyes\nwere protruding, that my mouth was opened, and my tongue like leather.\nThe turmoil within my brain was such that something must surely snap.\nI tried to scream and was vaguely aware of some hoarse croak which was\nmy own voice, but distant and detached from myself.  At the same moment,\nin some effort of escape, I broke through that cloud of despair and had\na glimpse of Holmes's face, white, rigid, and drawn with horror--the\nvery look which I had seen upon the features of the dead.  It was that\nvision which gave me an instant of sanity and of strength.  I dashed\nfrom my chair, threw my arms round Holmes, and together we lurched\nthrough the door, and an instant afterwards had thrown ourselves down\nupon the grass plot and were lying side by side, conscious only of the\nglorious sunshine which was bursting its way through the hellish cloud\nof terror which had girt us in. Slowly it rose from our souls like the\nmists from a landscape until peace and reason had returned, and we were\nsitting upon the grass, wiping our clammy foreheads, and looking with\napprehension at each other to mark the last traces of that terrific\nexperience which we had undergone.\n\n\"Upon my word, Watson!\" said Holmes at last with an unsteady voice, \"I\nowe you both my thanks and an apology.  It was an unjustifiable\nexperiment even for one's self, and doubly so for a friend.  I am\nreally very sorry.\"\n\n\"You know,\" I answered with some emotion, for I have never seen so much\nof Holmes's heart before, \"that it is my greatest joy and privilege to\nhelp you.\"\n\nHe relapsed at once into the half-humorous, half-cynical vein which was\nhis habitual attitude to those about him.  \"It would be superfluous to\ndrive us mad, my dear Watson,\" said he.  \"A candid observer would\ncertainly declare that we were so already before we embarked upon so\nwild an experiment.  I confess that I never imagined that the effect\ncould be so sudden and so severe.\"  He dashed into the cottage, and,\nreappearing with the burning lamp held at full arm's length, he threw\nit among a bank of brambles. \"We must give the room a little time to\nclear.  I take it, Watson, that you have no longer a shadow of a doubt\nas to how these tragedies were produced?\"\n\n\"None whatever.\"\n\n\"But the cause remains as obscure as before.  Come into the arbour here\nand let us discuss it together.  That villainous stuff seems still to\nlinger round my throat.  I think we must admit that all the evidence\npoints to this man, Mortimer Tregennis, having been the criminal in the\nfirst tragedy, though he was the victim in the second one.  We must\nremember, in the first place, that there is some story of a family\nquarrel, followed by a reconciliation.  How bitter that quarrel may\nhave been, or how hollow the reconciliation we cannot tell.   When I\nthink of Mortimer Tregennis, with the foxy face and the small shrewd,\nbeady eyes behind the spectacles, he is not a man whom I should judge\nto be of a particularly forgiving disposition. Well, in the next place,\nyou will remember that this idea of someone moving in the garden, which\ntook our attention for a moment from the real cause of the tragedy,\nemanated from him.  He had a motive in misleading us.  Finally, if he\ndid not throw the substance into the fire at the moment of leaving the\nroom, who did do so?  The affair happened immediately after his\ndeparture. Had anyone else come in, the family would certainly have\nrisen from the table.  Besides, in peaceful Cornwall, visitors did not\narrive after ten o'clock at night.  We may take it, then, that all the\nevidence points to Mortimer Tregennis as the culprit.\"\n\n\"Then his own death was suicide!\"\n\n\"Well, Watson, it is on the face of it a not impossible supposition.\nThe man who had the guilt upon his soul of having brought such a fate\nupon his own family might well be driven by remorse to inflict it upon\nhimself.  There are, however, some cogent reasons against it.\nFortunately, there is one man in England who knows all about it, and I\nhave made arrangements by which we shall hear the facts this afternoon\nfrom his own lips. Ah! he is a little before his time.  Perhaps you\nwould kindly step this way, Dr. Leon Sterndale. We have been conducing\na chemical experiment indoors which has left our little room hardly fit\nfor the reception of so distinguished a visitor.\"\n\nI had heard the click of the garden gate, and now the majestic figure\nof the great African explorer appeared upon the path.  He turned in\nsome surprise towards the rustic arbour in which we sat.\n\n\"You sent for me, Mr. Holmes.  I had your note about an hour ago, and I\nhave come, though I really do not know why I should obey your summons.\"\n\n\"Perhaps we can clear the point up before we separate,\" said Holmes.\n\"Meanwhile, I am much obliged to you for your courteous acquiescence.\nYou will excuse this informal reception in the open air, but my friend\nWatson and I have nearly furnished an additional chapter to what the\npapers call the Cornish Horror, and we prefer a clear atmosphere for\nthe present.  Perhaps, since the matters which we have to discuss will\naffect you personally in a very intimate fashion, it is as well that we\nshould talk where there can be no eavesdropping.\"\n\nThe explorer took his cigar from his lips and gazed sternly at my\ncompanion.\n\n\"I am at a loss to know, sir,\" he said, \"what you can have to speak\nabout which affects me personally in a very intimate fashion.\"\n\n\"The killing of Mortimer Tregennis,\" said Holmes.\n\nFor a moment I wished that I were armed.  Sterndale's fierce face\nturned to a dusky red, his eyes glared, and the knotted, passionate\nveins started out in his forehead, while he sprang forward with\nclenched hands towards my companion.  Then he stopped, and with a\nviolent effort he resumed a cold, rigid calmness, which was, perhaps,\nmore suggestive of danger than his hot-headed outburst.\n\n\"I have lived so long among savages and beyond the law,\" said he, \"that\nI have got into the way of being a law to myself.  You would do well,\nMr. Holmes, not to forget it, for I have no desire to do you an injury.\"\n\n\"Nor have I any desire to do you an injury, Dr. Sterndale. Surely the\nclearest proof of it is that, knowing what I know, I have sent for you\nand not for the police.\"\n\nSterndale sat down with a gasp, overawed for, perhaps, the first time\nin his adventurous life.  There was a calm assurance of power in\nHolmes's manner which could not be withstood.  Our visitor stammered\nfor a moment, his great hands opening and shutting in his agitation.\n\n\"What do you mean?\" he asked at last.  \"If this is bluff upon your\npart, Mr. Holmes, you have chosen a bad man for your experiment. Let us\nhave no more beating about the bush.  What DO you mean?\"\n\n\"I will tell you,\" said Holmes, \"and the reason why I tell you is that\nI hope frankness may beget frankness.  What my next step may be will\ndepend entirely upon the nature of your own defence.\"\n\n\"My defence?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"My defence against what?\"\n\n\"Against the charge of killing Mortimer Tregennis.\"\n\nSterndale mopped his forehead with his handkerchief.  \"Upon my word,\nyou are getting on,\" said he.  \"Do all your successes depend upon this\nprodigious power of bluff?\"\n\n\"The bluff,\" said Holmes sternly, \"is upon your side, Dr. Leon\nSterndale, and not upon mine.  As a proof I will tell you some of the\nfacts upon which my conclusions are based.  Of your return from\nPlymouth, allowing much of your property to go on to Africa, I will say\nnothing save that it first informed me that you were one of the factors\nwhich had to be taken into account in reconstructing this drama--\"\n\n\"I came back--\"\n\n\"I have heard your reasons and regard them as unconvincing and\ninadequate.  We will pass that.  You came down here to ask me whom I\nsuspected.  I refused to answer you. You then went to the vicarage,\nwaited outside it for some time, and finally returned to your cottage.\"\n\n\"How do you know that?\"\n\n\"I followed you.\"\n\n\"I saw no one.\"\n\n\"That is what you may expect to see when I follow you.  You spent a\nrestless night at your cottage, and you formed certain plans, which in\nthe early morning you proceeded to put into execution. Leaving your\ndoor just as day was breaking, you filled your pocket with some reddish\ngravel that was lying heaped beside your gate.\"\n\nSterndale gave a violent start and looked at Holmes in amazement.\n\n\"You then walked swiftly for the mile which separated you from the\nvicarage.  You were wearing, I may remark, the same pair of ribbed\ntennis shoes which are at the present moment upon your feet.  At the\nvicarage you passed through the orchard and the side hedge, coming out\nunder the window of the lodger Tregennis. It was now daylight, but the\nhousehold was not yet stirring.  You drew some of the gravel from your\npocket, and you threw it up at the window above you.\"\n\nSterndale sprang to his feet.\n\n\"I believe that you are the devil himself!\" he cried.\n\nHolmes smiled at the compliment.  \"It took two, or possibly three,\nhandfuls before the lodger came to the window.  You beckoned him to\ncome down.  He dressed hurriedly and descended to his sitting-room.\nYou entered by the window.  There was an interview--a short one--during\nwhich you walked up and down the room.  Then you passed out and closed\nthe window, standing on the lawn outside smoking a cigar and watching\nwhat occurred. Finally, after the death of Tregennis, you withdrew as\nyou had come.  Now, Dr. Sterndale, how do you justify such conduct, and\nwhat were the motives for your actions?  If you prevaricate or trifle\nwith me, I give you my assurance that the matter will pass out of my\nhands forever.\"\n\nOur visitor's face had turned ashen gray as he listened to the words of\nhis accuser.  Now he sat for some time in thought with his face sunk in\nhis hands.  Then with a sudden impulsive gesture he plucked a\nphotograph from his breast-pocket and threw it on the rustic table\nbefore us.\n\n\"That is why I have done it,\" said he.\n\nIt showed the bust and face of a very beautiful woman.  Holmes stooped\nover it.\n\n\"Brenda Tregennis,\" said he.\n\n\"Yes, Brenda Tregennis,\" repeated our visitor.  \"For years I have loved\nher.  For years she has loved me.  There is the secret of that Cornish\nseclusion which people have marvelled at.  It has brought me close to\nthe one thing on earth that was dear to me. I could not marry her, for\nI have a wife who has left me for years and yet whom, by the deplorable\nlaws of England, I could not divorce.  For years Brenda waited.  For\nyears I waited.  And this is what we have waited for.\"  A terrible sob\nshook his great frame, and he clutched his throat under his brindled\nbeard.  Then with an effort he mastered himself and spoke on:\n\n\"The vicar knew.  He was in our confidence.  He would tell you that she\nwas an angel upon earth.  That was why he telegraphed to me and I\nreturned.  What was my baggage or Africa to me when I learned that such\na fate had come upon my darling?  There you have the missing clue to my\naction, Mr. Holmes.\"\n\n\"Proceed,\" said my friend.\n\nDr. Sterndale drew from his pocket a paper packet and laid it upon the\ntable.  On the outside was written \"Radix pedis diaboli\" with a red\npoison label beneath it.  He pushed it towards me.  \"I understand that\nyou are a doctor, sir.  Have you ever heard of this preparation?\"\n\n\"Devil's-foot root!  No, I have never heard of it.\"\n\n\"It is no reflection upon your professional knowledge,\" said he, \"for I\nbelieve that, save for one sample in a laboratory at Buda, there is no\nother specimen in Europe.  It has not yet found its way either into the\npharmacopoeia or into the literature of toxicology.  The root is shaped\nlike a foot, half human, half goatlike; hence the fanciful name given\nby a botanical missionary.  It is used as an ordeal poison by the\nmedicine-men in certain districts of West Africa and is kept as a\nsecret among them.  This particular specimen I obtained under very\nextraordinary circumstances in the Ubangi country.\"  He opened the\npaper as he spoke and disclosed a heap of reddish-brown, snuff-like\npowder.\n\n\"Well, sir?\" asked Holmes sternly.\n\n\"I am about to tell you, Mr. Holmes, all that actually occurred, for\nyou already know so much that it is clearly to my interest that you\nshould know all.  I have already explained the relationship in which I\nstood to the Tregennis family. For the sake of the sister I was\nfriendly with the brothers.  There was a family quarrel about money\nwhich estranged this man Mortimer, but it was supposed to be made up,\nand I afterwards met him as I did the others.  He was a sly, subtle,\nscheming man, and several things arose which gave me a suspicion of\nhim, but I had no cause for any positive quarrel.\n\n\"One day, only a couple of weeks ago, he came down to my cottage and I\nshowed him some of my African curiosities.  Among other things I\nexhibited this powder, and I told him of its strange properties, how it\nstimulates those brain centres which control the emotion of fear, and\nhow either madness or death is the fate of the unhappy native who is\nsubjected to the ordeal by the priest of his tribe.  I told him also\nhow powerless European science would be to detect it.  How he took it I\ncannot say, for I never left the room, but there is no doubt that it\nwas then, while I was opening cabinets and stooping to boxes, that he\nmanaged to abstract some of the devil's-foot root.  I well remember how\nhe plied me with questions as to the amount and the time that was\nneeded for its effect, but I little dreamed that he could have a\npersonal reason for asking.\n\n\"I thought no more of the matter until the vicar's telegram reached me\nat Plymouth.  This villain had thought that I would be at sea before\nthe news could reach me, and that I should be lost for years in Africa.\nBut I returned at once.  Of course, I could not listen to the details\nwithout feeling assured that my poison had been used.  I came round to\nsee you on the chance that some other explanation had suggested itself\nto you.  But there could be none.  I was convinced that Mortimer\nTregennis was the murderer; that for the sake of money, and with the\nidea, perhaps, that if the other members of his family were all insane\nhe would be the sole guardian of their joint property, he had used the\ndevil's-foot powder upon them, driven two of them out of their senses,\nand killed his sister Brenda, the one human being whom I have ever\nloved or who has ever loved me.  There was his crime; what was to be\nhis punishment?\n\n\"Should I appeal to the law?  Where were my proofs?  I knew that the\nfacts were true, but could I help to make a jury of countrymen believe\nso fantastic a story?  I might or I might not. But I could not afford\nto fail.  My soul cried out for revenge. I have said to you once\nbefore, Mr. Holmes, that I have spent much of my life outside the law,\nand that I have come at last to be a law to myself.  So it was even\nnow.  I determined that the fate which he had given to others should be\nshared by himself. Either that or I would do justice upon him with my\nown hand.  In all England there can be no man who sets less value upon\nhis own life than I do at the present moment.\n\n\"Now I have told you all.  You have yourself supplied the rest. I did,\nas you say, after a restless night, set off early from my cottage.  I\nforesaw the difficulty of arousing him, so I gathered some gravel from\nthe pile which you have mentioned, and I used it to throw up to his\nwindow.  He came down and admitted me through the window of the\nsitting-room.  I laid his offence before him. I told him that I had\ncome both as judge and executioner.  The wretch sank into a chair,\nparalyzed at the sight of my revolver. I lit the lamp, put the powder\nabove it, and stood outside the window, ready to carry out my threat to\nshoot him should he try to leave the room.  In five minutes he died.\nMy God! how he died!  But my heart was flint, for he endured nothing\nwhich my innocent darling had not felt before him.  There is my story,\nMr. Holmes.  Perhaps, if you loved a woman, you would have done as much\nyourself.  At any rate, I am in your hands.  You can take what steps\nyou like.  As I have already said, there is no man living who can fear\ndeath less than I do.\"\n\nHolmes sat for some little time in silence.\n\n\"What were your plans?\" he asked at last.\n\n\"I had intended to bury myself in central Africa.  My work there is but\nhalf finished.\"\n\n\"Go and do the other half,\" said Holmes.  \"I, at least, am not prepared\nto prevent you.\"\n\nDr. Sterndale raised his giant figure, bowed gravely, and walked from\nthe arbour.  Holmes lit his pipe and handed me his pouch.\n\n\"Some fumes which are not poisonous would be a welcome change,\" said\nhe.  \"I think you must agree, Watson, that it is not a case in which we\nare called upon to interfere.  Our investigation has been independent,\nand our action shall be so also.  You would not denounce the man?\"\n\n\"Certainly not,\" I answered.\n\n\"I have never loved, Watson, but if I did and if the woman I loved had\nmet such an end, I might act even as our lawless lion-hunter has done.\nWho knows?  Well, Watson, I will not offend your intelligence by\nexplaining what is obvious.  The gravel upon the window-sill was, of\ncourse, the starting-point of my research.  It was unlike anything in\nthe vicarage garden.  Only when my attention had been drawn to Dr.\nSterndale and his cottage did I find its counterpart.  The lamp shining\nin broad daylight and the remains of powder upon the shield were\nsuccessive links in a fairly obvious chain.  And now, my dear Watson, I\nthink we may dismiss the matter from our mind and go back with a clear\nconscience to the study of those Chaldean roots which are surely to be\ntraced in the Cornish branch of the great Celtic speech.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Adventure of the Devil's Foot, by \nArthur Conan Doyle", "answers": ["Six hours."], "length": 10020, "dataset": "narrativeqa", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "0bf1995158cbf08134d5dc15475c27f38b3ab5441c422419"}
{"input": "With whom does the entertainers' manager have an affair?", "context": "The Seventh Seal\n<b> \n</b>The night had brought little relief from the heat, and at dawn a hot gust of\nwind blows across the colorless sea. The KNIGHT, Antonius Block, lies\nprostrate on some spruce branches spread over the fine sand. His eyes are \nwide-open and bloodshot from lack of sleep. \n\nNearby his squire JONS is snoring loudly. He has fallen asleep where he \ncollapsed, at the edge of the forest among the wind-gnarled fir trees. His \nopen mouth gapes towards the dawn, and unearthly sounds come from his throat.\nAt the sudden gust of wind, the horses stir, stretching their parched muzzles \ntowards the sea. They are as thin and worn as their masters.\n\nThe KNIGHT has risen and waded into the shallow water, where he rinses his \nsunburned face and blistered lips. JONS rolls over to face the forest and the \ndarkness. He moans in his sleep and vigorously scratches the stubbled hair on \nhis head. A scar stretches diagonally across his scalp, as white as lightning \nagainst the grime. \n\nThe KNIGHT returns to the beach and falls on his knees. With his eyes closed \nand brow furrowed, he says his morning prayers. His hands are clenched \ntogether and his lips form the words silently. His face is sad and bitter. He \nopens his eyes and stares directly into the morning sun which wallows up from \nthe misty sea like some bloated, dying fish. The sky is gray and immobile, a \ndome of lead. A cloud hangs mute and dark over the western horizon. High up, \nbarely visible, a seagull floats on motionless wings. Its cry is weird and \nrestless. The KNIGHT'S large gray horse lifts its head and whinnies. Antonius \nBlock turns around.\n\nBehind him stands a man in black. His face is very pale and he keeps his \nhands hidden in the wide folds of his cloak. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tWho are you? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tI am Death.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tHave you come for me?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tI have been walking by your side for a long \n\t\ttime. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tThat I know. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tAre you prepared?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT\n</b>\t\tMy body is frightened, but I am not. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tWell, there is no shame in that.\n\nThe KNIGHT has risen to his feet. He shivers. DEATH opens his cloak to place \nit around the KNIGHT'S shoulders. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tWait a moment.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tThat's what they all say. I grant no reprieves. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tYou play chess, don't you?\n\nA gleam of interest kindles in DEATH'S eyes. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tHow did you know that?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tI have seen it in paintings and heard it sung \n\t\tin ballads.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tYes, in fact I'm quite a good chess player. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tBut you can't be better than I am.\n\nThe KNIGHT rummages in the big black bag which he keeps beside him and takes \nout a small chessboard. He places it carefully on the ground and begins \nsetting up the pieces.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tWhy do you want to play chess with me? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tI have my reasons. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tThat is your privilege.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tThe condition is that I may live as long as I \n\t\thold out against you. If I win, you will \n\t\trelease me. Is it agreed? \n\nThe KNIGHT holds out his two fists to DEATH, who smiles at him suddenly. \nDEATH points to one of the KNIGHT'S hands; it contains a black pawn. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tYou drew black!\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tVery appropriate. Don't you think so?\n\nThe KNIGHT and DEATH bend over the chessboard. After a moment of hesitation, \nAntonius Block opens with his king's pawn. DEATH moves, also using his king's \npawn.\n<b> \n</b>\n\nThe morning breeze has died down. The restless movement of the sea has \nceased, the water is silent. The sun rises from the haze and its glow \nwhitens. The sea gull floats under the dark cloud, frozen in space. The day \nis already scorchingly hot.\n\nThe squire JONS is awakened by a kick in the rear. Opening his eyes, he \ngrunts like a pig and yawns broadly. He scrambles to his feet, saddles his \nhorse and picks up the heavy pack.\n\nThe KNIGHT slowly rides away from the sea, into the forest near the beach and \nup towards the road. He pretends not to hear the morning prayers of his \nsquire. JONS soon overtakes him.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\t\t(sings)\n\t \tBetween a strumpet's legs to lie \n\t\tIs the life for which I sigh.\n\nHe stops and looks at his master, but the KNIGHT hasn't heard JON'S song, or \nhe pretends that he hasn't. To give further vent to his irritation, JONS \nsings even louder. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\t\t(sings)\n\t\tUp above is God Almighty \n\t\tSo very far away, \n\t\tBut your brother the Devil \n\t\tYou will meet on every level.\n\nJONS finally gets the KNIGHT'S attention. He stops singing. The KNIGHT, his \nhorse, JONS'S own horse and JONS himself know all the songs by heart. The \nlong, dusty journey from the Holy Land hasn't made them any cleaner. They \nride across a mossy heath which stretches towards the horizon. Beyond it, the \nsea lies shimmering in the white glitter of the sun.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tIn Frjestad everyone was talking about evil \n\t\tomens and other horrible things. Two horses had \n\t\teaten each other in the night, and, in the \n\t\tchurchyard, graves had been opened and the \n\t\tremains of corpses scattered all over the \n\t\tplace. Yesterday afternoon there were as many \n\t\tas four suns in the heavens.\n<b> \n</b>The KNIGHT doesn't answer. Close by, a scrawny dog is whining, crawling \ntowards its master, who is sleeping in a sitting position in the blazing hot \nsun. A black cloud of flies clusters around his head and shoulders. The \nmiserable-looking dog whines incessantly as it lies flat on its stomach, \nwagging its tail.\n\nJONS dismounts and approaches the sleeping man. JONS addresses him politely. \nWhen he doesn't receive an answer, he walks up to the man in order to shake \nhim awake. He bends over the sleeping man's shoulder, but quickly pulls back \nhis hand. The man falls backward on the heath, his face turned towards JONS. \nIt is a corpse, staring at JONS with empty eye sockets and white teeth. \n\nJONS remounts and overtakes his master. He takes a drink from his waterskin \nand hands the bag to the knight. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tWell, did he show you the way? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tNot exactly.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tWhat did he say? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tNothing.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tWas he a mute?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tNo, sir, I wouldn't say that. As a matter of \n\t\tfact, he was quite eloquent. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tOh?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tHe was eloquent, all right. The trouble is that \n\t\twhat he had to say was most depressing.\n\t\t\t(sings)\n\t\tOne moment you're bright and lively, \n\t\tThe next you're crawling with worms. \n\t\tFate is a terrible villain \n\t\tAnd you, my friend, its poor victim. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tMust you sing? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tNo.\n\nThe KNIGHT hands his squire a piece of bread, which keeps him quiet for a \nwhile. The sun burns down on them cruelly, and beads of perspiration trickle \ndown their faces. There is a cloud of dust around the horses' hooves. They \nride past an inlet and along verdant groves. In the shade of some large trees \nstands a bulging wagon covered with a mottled canvas. A horse whinnies nearby \nand is answered by the KNIGHT'S horse. The two travelers do not stop to rest \nunder the shade of the trees but continue riding until they disappear at the \nbend of the road.\n<b> \n</b>\n\nIn his sleep, JOF the juggler hears the neighing of his horse and the answer \nfrom a distance. He tries to go on sleeping, but it is stifling inside the \nwagon. The rays of the sun filtering through the canvas cast streaks of light \nacross the face of JOF'S wife, MIA, and their one-year-old son, MIKAEL, who \nare sleeping deeply and peacefully. Near them, JONAS SKAT, an older man, \nsnores loudly. \n\nJOF crawls out of the wagon. There is still a spot of shade under the big \ntrees. He takes a drink of water, gargles, stretches and talks to his scrawny \nold horse. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tGood morning. Have you had breakfast? I can't \n\t\teat grass, worse luck. Can't you teach me how? \n\t\tWe're a little hard up. People aren't very \n\t\tinterested in juggling in this part of the \n\t\tcountry.\n\nHe has picked up the juggling balls and slowly begins to toss them. Then he \nstands on his head and cackles like a hen. Suddenly he stops and sits down \nwith a look of utter astonishment on his face. The wind causes the trees to \nsway slightly. The leaves stir and there is a soft murmur. The flowers and \nthe grass bend gracefully, and somewhere a bird raises its voice in a long \nwarble.\n\nJOF'S face breaks into a smile and his eyes fill with tears. With a dazed \nexpression he sits flat on his behind while the grass rustles softly, and \nbees and butterflies hum around his head. The unseen bird continues to sing.\n\nSuddenly the breeze stops blowing, the bird stops singing, JOF'S smile fades, \nthe flowers and grass wilt in the heat. The old horse is still walking around \ngrazing and swishing its tail to ward off the flies. \n\nJOF comes to life. He rushes into the wagon and shakes MIA awake.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tMia, wake up. Wake up! Mia, I've just seen \n\t\tsomething. I've got to tell you about it!\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\t\t(sits up, terrified)\n\t\tWhat is it? What's happened? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tListen, I've had a vision. No, it wasn't a \n\t\tvision. It was real, absolutely real.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tOh, so you've had a vision again!\n\nMIA's voice is filled with gentle irony. JOF shakes his head and grabs her by \nthe shoulders. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tBut I did see her! \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tWhom did you see? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tThe Virgin Mary.\n\nMIA can't help being impressed by her husband's fervor. She lowers her voice.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tDid you really see her?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tShe was so close to me that I could have \n\t\ttouched her. She had a golden crown on her head \n\t\tand wore a blue gown with flowers of gold. She \n\t\twas barefoot and had small brown hands with \n\t\twhich she was holding the Child and teaching \n\t\tHim to walk. And then she saw me watching her \n\t\tand she smiled at me. My eyes filled with tears \n\t\tand when I wiped them away, she had disappeared. \n\t\tAnd everything became so still in the sky and \n\t\ton the earth. Can you understand ... \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tWhat an imagination you have.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tYou don't believe me! But it was real, I tell \n\t\tyou, not the kind of reality you see every day, \n\t\tbut a different kind. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA\n</b>\t\tPerhaps it was the kind of reality you told us \n\t\tabout when you saw the Devil painting our wagon \n\t\twheels red, using his tail as a brush.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\t\t(embarrassed)\n\t\tWhy must you keep bringing that up? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA\n</b>\t\tAnd then you discovered that you had red paint \n\t\tunder your nails.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tWell, perhaps that time I made it up. \n\t\t\t(eagerly)  \n\t\tI did it just so that you would believe in my \n\t\tother visions. The real ones. The ones that I \n\t\tdidn't make up. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\t\t(severely)\n\t\tYou have to keep your visions under control.\n\t\tOtherwise people will think that you're a \n\t\thalf-wit, which you're not. At least not yet -- \n\t\tas far as I know. But, come to think of it, I'm \n\t\tnot so sure about that.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\t\t(angry)\n\t\tI didn't ask to have visions. I can't help it \n\t\tif voices speak to me, if the Holy Virgin \n\t\tappears before me and angels and devils like my \n\t\tcompany.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSKAT \n</b>\t\t\t(sits up)\n\t\tHaven't I told you once and for all that I need \n\t\tmy morning's sleep! I have asked you politely, \n\t\tpleaded with you, but nothing works. So now I'm \n\t\ttelling you to shut up!\n\nHis eyes are popping with rage. He turns over and continues snoring where he \nleft off. MIA and JOF decide that it would be wisest to leave the wagon. They \nsit down on a crate. MIA has MIKAEL on her knees. He is naked and squirms \nvigorously. JOF sits close to his wife. Slumped over, he still looks dazed \nand astonished. A dry, hot wind blows from the sea.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tIf we would only get some rain. Everything is \n\t\tburned to cinders. We won't have anything to \n\t\teat this winter. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\t\t(yawning)\n\t\tWe'll get by.\n\nHe says this smilingly, with a casual air. He stretches and laughs \ncontentedly.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tI want Mikael to have a better life than ours. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tMikael will grow up to be a great acrobat -- or \n\t\ta juggler who can do the one impossible trick. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tWhat's that?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tTo make one of the balls stand absolutely still\n\t\tin the air. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tBut that's impossible.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tImpossible for us -- but not for him. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tYou're dreaming again.\n\nShe yawns. The sun, has made her a bit drowsy and she lies down on the grass.\nJOF does likewise and puts one arm around his wife's shoulders.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tI've composed a song. I made it up during the \n\t\tnight when I couldn't sleep. Do you want to \n\t\thear it? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tSing it. I'm very curious.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tI have to sit up first.\n\nHe sits with his legs crossed, makes a dramatic gesture with his arms and \nsings in a loud voice. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\t\t(sings)\n\t\tOn a lily branch a dove is perched \n\t\tAgainst the summer sky, \n\t\tShe sings a wondrous song of Christ \n\t\tAnd there's great joy on high.\n\nHe interrupts his singing in order to be complimented by his wife.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tMia! Are you asleep? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tIt's a lovely song. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tI haven't finished yet.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tI heard it, but I think I'll sleep a little \n\t\tlonger. You can sing the rest to me afterwards. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tAll you do is sleep.\n\nJOF is a bit offended and glances over at his son, MIKAEL, but he is also \nsleeping soundly in the high grass. JONAS SKAT comes out from the wagon. He \nyawns; he is very tired and in a bad humor. In his hands he holds a crudely \nmade death mask.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSKAT \n</b>\t\tIs this supposed to be a mask for an actor? If \n\t\tthe priests didn't pay us so well, I'd say no \n\t\tthank you. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tAre you going to play Death?\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tSKAT \n</b>\t\tJust think, scaring decent folk out of their \n\t\twits with this kind of nonsense.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tWhen are we supposed to do this play?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSKAT \n</b>\t\tAt the saints' feast in Elsinore. We're going \n\t\tto perform right on the church steps, believe \n\t\tit or not.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tWouldn't it be better to play something bawdy? \n\t\tPeople like it better, and, besides, it's more \n\t\tfun.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSKAT \n</b>\t\tIdiot. There's a rumor going around that \n\t\tthere's a terrible pestilence in the land, and \n\t\tnow the priests are prophesying sudden death \n\t\tand all sorts of spiritual agonies. \n\nMIA is awake now and lies contentedly on her back, sucking on a blade of \ngrass and looking smilingly at her husband.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tAnd what part am I to play?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSKAT \n</b>\t\tYou're such a damn fool, so you're going to be \n\t\tthe Soul of Man.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tThat's a bad part, of course.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSKAT \n</b>\t\tWho makes the decisions around here? Who is the\n\t\tdirector of this company anyhow?\n\nSKAT, grinning, holds the mask in front of his face and recites dramatically.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSKAT \n</b>\t\tBear this in mind, you fool. Your life hangs by \n\t\ta thread. Your time is short. \n\t\t\t(in his usual voice) \n\t\tAre the women going to like me in this getup? \n\t\tWill I make a hit? No! I feel as if I were dead \n\t\talready.\n\nHe stumbles into the wagon muttering furiously. JOF sits, leaning forward. \nMIA lies beside him on the grass. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tJof!\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tWhat is it?\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tSit still.

I love you.\n<b> \n</b>\n\nWaves of heat envelop the gray stone church in a strange white mist. The \nKNIGHT dismounts and enters. After tying up the horses, JONS slowly follows \nhim in. When he comes onto the church porch he stops in surprise. To the \nright of the entrance there is a large fresco on the wall, not quite \nfinished. Perched on a crude scaffolding is a PAINTER wearing a red cap and \npaint-stained clothes. He has one brush in his mouth, while with another in \nhis hand he outlines a small, terrified human face amidst a sea of other \nfaces.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tWhat is this supposed to represent? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPAINTER \n</b>\t\tThe Dance of Death. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tAnd that one is Death?\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tPAINTER \n</b>\t\tYes, he dances off with all of them.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tWhy do you paint such nonsense?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPAINTER \n</b>\t\tI thought it would serve to remind people that \n\t\tthey must die.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tWell, it's not going to make them feel any \n\t\thappier. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPAINTER \n</b>\t\tWhy should one always make people happy? It \n\t\tmight not be a bad idea to scare them a little \n\t\tonce in a while.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tThen they'll close their eyes and refuse to \n\t\tlook at your painting.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tPAINTER \n</b>\t\tOh, they'll look. A skull is almost more \n\t\tinteresting than a naked woman.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tIf you do scare them ... \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPAINTER \n</b>\t\tThey'll think. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tAnd if they think ...\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tPAINTER \n</b>\t\tThey'll become still more scared.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tAnd then they'll run right into the arms of the \n\t\tpriests. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPAINTER \n</b>\t\tThat's not my business.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tYou're only painting your Dance of Death. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPAINTER \n</b>\t\tI'm only painting things as they are. Everyone \n\t\telse can do as he likes.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tJust think how some people will curse you. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPAINTER \n</b>\t\tMaybe. But then I'll paint something amusing \n\t\tfor them to look at. I have to make a living \n\t\t-- at least until the plague takes me.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tThe plague. That sounds horrible.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPAINTER \n</b>\t\tYou should see the boils on a diseased man's \n\t\tthroat. You should see how his body shrivels up \n\t\tso that his legs look like knotted strings -- \n\t\tlike the man I've painted over there.\n\nThe PAINTER points with his brush. JONS sees a small human form writhing in \nthe grass, its eyes turned upwards in a frenzied look of horror and pain. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tThat looks terrible.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPAINTER \n</b>\t\tIt certainly does. He tries to rip out the \n\t\tboil, he bites his hands, tears his veins open \n\t\twith his fingernails and his screams can be \n\t\theard everywhere. Does that scare you?\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tScare? Me? You don't know me. What are the \n\t\thorrors you've painted over there?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPAINTER \n</b>\t\tThe remarkable thing is that the poor creatures\n\t\tthink the pestilence is the Lord's punishment. \n\t\tMobs of people who call themselves Slaves of \n\t\tSin are swarming over the country, flagellating \n\t\tthemselves and others, all for the glory of God.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tDo they really whip themselves?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPAINTER \n</b>\t\tYes, it's a terrible sight. I crawl into a \n\t\tditch and hide when they pass by.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tDo you have any brandy? I've been drinking \n\t\twater all day and it's made me as thirsty as a \n\t\tcamel in the desert. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPAINTER \n</b>\t\tI think I frightened you after all.\n\nJONS sits down with the PAINTER, who produces a jug of brandy.\n\n\n\nThe KNIGHT is kneeling before a small altar. It is dark and quiet around him.\nThe air is cool and musty. Pictures of saints look down on him with stony \neyes. Christ's face is turned upwards, His mouth open as if in a cry of \nanguish. On the ceiling beam there is a representation of a hideous devil \nspying on a miserable human being. The KNIGHT hears a sound from the \nconfession booth and approaches it. The face of DEATH appears behind the \ngrille for an instant, but the KNIGHT doesn't see him. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tI want to talk to you as openly as I can, but \n\t\tmy heart is empty.\n\nDEATH doesn't answer.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tThe emptiness is a mirror turned towards my \n\t\town face. I see myself in it, and I am filled \n\t\twith fear and disgust. \n\nDEATH doesn't answer.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tThrough my indifference to my fellow men, I \n\t\thave isolated myself from their company. Now I \n\t\tlive in a world of phantoms. I am imprisoned in \n\t\tmy dreams and fantasies. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tAnd yet you don't want to die. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tYes, I do.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tWhat are you waiting for? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tI want knowledge. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tYou want guarantees?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tCall it whatever you like. Is it so cruelly \n\t\tinconceivable to grasp God with the senses? Why \n\t\tshould He hide himself in a mist of half-spoken \n\t\tpromises and unseen miracles? \n\nDEATH doesn't answer.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tHow can we have faith in those who believe when \n\t\twe can't have faith in ourselves? What is going \n\t\tto happen to those of us who want to believe \n\t\tbut aren't able to? And what is to become of \n\t\tthose who neither want to nor are capable of \n\t\tbelieving?\n\nThe KNIGHT stops and waits for a reply, but no one speaks or answers him. \nThere is complete silence. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tWhy can't I kill God within me? Why does He \n\t\tlive on in this painful and humiliating way \n\t\teven though I curse Him and want to tear Him \n\t\tout of my heart? Why, in spite of everything, \n\t\tis He a baffling reality that I can't shake \n\t\toff? Do you hear me? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tYes, I hear you.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tI want knowledge, not faith, not suppositions, \n\t\tbut knowledge. I want God to stretch out His \n\t\thand towards me, reveal Himself and speak to \n\t\tme. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tBut He remains silent.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT\n</b>\t\tI call out to Him in the dark but no one seems \n\t\tto be there.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tPerhaps no one is there.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tThen life is an outrageous horror. No one can \n\t\tlive in the face of death, knowing that all is \n\t\tnothingness. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tMost people never reflect about either death or \n\t\tthe futility of life.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tBut one day they will have to stand at that \n\t\tlast moment of life and look towards the \n\t\tdarkness. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tWhen that day comes ...\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tIn our fear, we make an image, and that image \n\t\twe call God.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tYou are worrying ...\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tDeath visited me this morning.

I feel no \n\t\tbitterness or self-reproach because the lives \n\t\tof most people are very much like this. But I \n\t\twill use my reprieve for one meaningful deed. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tIs that why you are playing chess with Death? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tHe is a clever opponent, but up to now I \n\t\thaven't lost a single man.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tHow will you outwit Death in your game? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tI use a combination of the bishop and the \n\t\tknight which he hasn't yet discovered. In the \n\t\tnext move I'll shatter one of his flanks.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tI'll remember that.\n\nDEATH shows his face at the grill of the confession booth for a moment but \ndisappears instantly.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tYou've tricked and cheated me! But we'll meet \n\t\tagain, and I'll find a way.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\t\t(invisible)\n\t\tWe'll meet at the inn, and there we'll continue \n\t\tplaying.\n\nThe KNIGHT raises his hand and looks at it in the sunlight which comes \nthrough the tiny window. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tThis is my hand. I can move it, feel the blood \n\t\tpulsing through it. The sun is still high in \n\t\tthe sky and I, Antonius Block, am playing \n\t\tchess with Death. \n\nHe makes a fist of his hand and lifts it to his temple.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, JONS and the PAINTER have got drunk and are talking animatedly \ntogether.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tMe and my master have been abroad and have just \n\t\tcome home. Do you understand, you little \n\t\tpictor? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPAINTER \n</b>\t\tThe Crusade.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\t\t(drunk)\n\t\tPrecisely. For ten years we sat in the Holy \n\t\tLand and let snakes bite us, flies sting us, \n\t\twild animals eat us, heathens butcher us, the \n\t\twine poison us, the women give us lice, the \n\t\tlice devour us, the fevers rot us, all for the \n\t\tGlory of God. Our crusade was such madness that \n\t\tonly a real idealist could have thought it up. \n\t\tBut what you said about the plague was \n\t\thorrible. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPAINTER \n</b>\t\tIt's worse than that.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tAh, me. No matter which way you turn, you have \n\t\tyour rump behind you. That's the truth.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPAINTER \n</b>\t\tThe rump behind you, the rump behind you \n\t\tthere's a profound truth.\n\nJONS paints a small figure which is supposed to represent himself.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tThis is squire Jns. He grins at Death, mocks \n\t\tthe Lord, laughs at himself and leers at the \n\t\tgirls. His world is a Jnsworld, believable \n\t\tonly to himself, ridiculous to all including \n\t\thimself, meaningless to Heaven and of no \n\t\tinterest to Hell. \n\nThe KNIGHT walks by, calls to his squire and goes out into the bright \nsunshine. JONS manages to set himself down from the scaffolding.\n\nOutside the church, four soldiers and a monk are in the process of putting a \nwoman in the stocks. Her face is pale and child-like, her head has been \nshaved, and her knuckles are bloody and broken. Her eyes are wide open, yet \nshe doesn't appear to be fully conscious. \n\nJONS and the KNIGHT stop and watch in silence. The soldiers are working \nquickly and skillfully, but they seem frightened and dejected. The monk \nmumbles from a small book. One of the soldiers picks up a wooden bucket and \nwith his hand begins to smear a bloody paste on the wall of the church and \naround the woman. JONS holds his nose.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tThat soup of yours has a hell of a stink. What \n\t\tis it good for?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSOLDIER \n</b>\t\tShe has had carnal intercourse with the Evil \n\t\tOne. \n\nHe whispers this with a horrified face and continues to splash the sticky \nmess on the wall. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tAnd now she's in the stocks.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSOLDIER \n</b>\t\tShe will be burned tomorrow morning at the \n\t\tparish boundary. But we have to keep the Devil \n\t\taway from the rest of us.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\t\t(holding his nose)\n\t\tAnd you do that with this stinking mess?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSOLDIER \n</b>\t\tIt's the best remedy: blood mixed with the bile \n\t\tof a big black dog. The Devil can't stand the \n\t\tsmell. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tNeither can I.\n<b> \n</b>JONS walks over towards the horses. The KNIGHT stands for a few, moments \nlooking at the young girl. She is almost a child. Slowly she turns her eyes \ntowards him. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tHave you seen the Devil?\n\nThe MONK stops reading and raises his head. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMONK \n</b>\t\tYou must not talk to her. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tCan that be so dangerous?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMONK \n</b>\t\tI don't know, but she is believed to have \n\t\tcaused the pestilence with which we are \n\t\taffected. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tI understand.\n\nHe nods resignedly and walks away. The young woman starts to moan as though \nshe were having a horrible nightmare. The sound of her cries follows the two \nriders for a considerable distance down the road.\n<b> \n</b>\n\nThe sun stands high in the sky, like a red ball of fire. The waterskin is \nempty and JONS looks for a well where he can fill it.\n\nThey approach a group of peasant cottages at the edge of the forest. JONS \nties up the horses, slings the skin over his shoulder and walks along the \npath towards the nearest cottage. As always, his movements are light and \nalmost soundless. The door to the cottage is open. He stops outside, but when \nno one appears he enters. It is very dark inside and his foot touches a soft \nobject. He looks down. Beside the whitewashed fireplace, a woman is lying \nwith her face to the ground.\n\nAt the sound of approaching steps, JONS quickly hides behind the door. A man \ncomes down a ladder from the loft. He is broad and thick-set. His eyes are \nblack and his face is pale and puffy. His clothes are well cut but dirty and \nin rags. He carries a cloth sack. Looking around, he goes into the inner \nroom, bends over the bed, tucks something into the bag, slinks along the \nwalls, looking on the shelves, finds something else which he tucks in his \nbag.\n\nSlowly he re-enters the outer room, bends over the dead woman and carefully \nslips a ring from her finger. At that moment a young woman comes through the \ndoor. She stops and stares at the stranger.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRAVEL \n</b>\t\tWhy do you look so surprised? I steal from the \n\t\tdead. These days it's quite a lucrative \n\t\tenterprise. \n\nThe GIRL makes a movement as if to run away. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRAVEL \n</b>\t\tYou're thinking of running to the village and \n\t\ttelling. That wouldn't serve any purpose. Each \n\t\tof us has to save his own skin. It's as simple \n\t\tas that. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tGIRL \n</b>\t\tDon't touch me.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRAVAL \n</b>\t\tDon't try to scream. There's no one around to \n\t\thear you, neither God nor man.\n\nSlowly he closes the door behind the GIRL. The stuffy room is now in almost \ntotal darkness. But JONS becomes clearly visible.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tI recognize you, although it's a long time \n\t\tsince we met. Your name is Raval, from the \n\t\ttheological college at Roskilde. You are Dr. \n\t\tMirabilis, Coelestis et Diabilis. \n\nRAVAL smiles uneasily and looks around. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tAm I not right?\n\nThe GIRL stands immobile.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tYou were the one who, ten years ago, convinced \n\t\tmy master of the necessity to join a better-\n\t\tclass crusade to the Holy Land.\n\nRAVAL looks around.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tYou look uncomfortable. Do you have a stomach-\n\t\tache? \n\nRAVAL smiles anxiously.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tWhen I see you, I suddenly understand the \n\t\tmeaning of these ten years, which previously \n\t\tseemed to me such a waste. Our life was too \n\t\tgood and we were too satisfied with ourselves. \n\t\tThe Lord wanted to punish us for our \n\t\tcomplacency. That is why He sent you to spew \n\t\tout your holy venom and poison the knight.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRAVEL \n</b>\t\tI acted in good faith.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tBut now you know better, don't you? Because \n\t\tnow you have turned into a thief. A more \n\t\tfitting and rewarding occupation for \n\t\tscoundrels. Isn't that so?\n\nWith a quick movement he knocks the knife out of RAVAL'S hand, gives him a \nkick so that he falls on the floor and is about to finish him off. Suddenly \nthe GIRL screams. JONS stops and makes a gesture of generosity with his hand.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tBy all means. I'm not bloodthirsty. \n\nHe bends over RAVAL. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRAVEL \n</b>\t\tDon't beat me.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tI don't have the heart to touch you, Doctor. \n\t\tBut remember this: the next time we meet, I'll \n\t\tbrand your face the way one does with thieves. \n\t\t\t(he rises)\n\t\tWhat I really came for is to get my waterskin \n\t\tfilled.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tGIRL \n</b>\t\tWe have a deep well with cool, fresh water. \n\t\tCome, I'll show you.\n\nThey walk out of the house. RAVAL lies still for a few moments, then he rises \nslowly and looks around. When no one is in sight, he takes his bag and steals \naway. JONS quenches his thirst and fills his bag with water. The GIRL helps \nhim.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tJns is my name. I am a pleasant and talkative \n\t\tyoung man who has never had anything but kind \n\t\tthoughts and has only done beautiful and noble \n\t\tdeeds. I'm kindest of all to young women. With \n\t\tthem, there is no limit to my kindness. \n\nHe embraces her and tries to kiss her, but she holds herself back. Almost \nimmediately he loses interest, hoists the waterbag on his shoulder and pats \nthe GIRL on the cheek.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tGoodbye, my girl. I could very well have raped \n\t\tyou, but between you and me, I'm tired of that \n\t\tkind of love. It runs a little dry in the end.\n\nHe laughs kindly and walks away from her. When he has walked a short distance \nhe turns; the GIRL is still there.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tNow that I think of it, I will need a \n\t\thousekeeper. Can you prepare good food? \n\t\t\t(the GIRL nods)\n\t\tAs far as I know, I'm still a married man, but\n\t\tI have high hopes that my wife is dead by now.\n\t\tThat's why I need a housekeeper. \n\t\t\t(the GIRL doesn't \n\t\t\tanswer but gets up)\n\t\tThe devil with it! Come along and don't stand \n\t\tthere staring. I've saved your life, so you owe \n\t\tme a great deal.\n\nShe begins walking towards him, her head bent. He doesn't wait for her but \nwalks towards the KNIGHT, who patiently awaits his squire.\n<b> \n</b>\n\nThe Embarrassment Inn lies in the eastern section of the province. The plague \nhas not yet reached this area on its way along the coast.\n\nThe actors have placed their wagon under a tree in the yard of the inn. \nDressed in colorful costumes, they perform a farce.\n\nThe spectators watch the performance, commenting on it noisily. There are\nmerchants with fat, beer-sweaty faces, apprentices and journeymen, farmhands \nand milkmaids. A whole flock of children perch in the trees around the wagon.\n<b> \n</b>The KNIGHT and his squire have sat down in the shadow of a wall. They drink \nbeer and doze in the midday heat. The GIRL from the deserted village sleeps \nat JONS'S side. SKAT beats the drums, JOF blows the flute, MIA performs a gay \nand lively dance. They perspire under the hot white sun. When they have \nfinished SKAT comes forward and bows.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSKAT \n</b>\t\tNoble ladies and gentlemen, I thank you for \n\t\tyour interest. Please remain standing for a\n\t\tlittle longer, or sit on the ground, because \n\t\twe are now going to perform a tragedia about \n\t\tan unfaithful wife, her jealous husband, and \n\t\tthe handsome lover -- that's me.\n\nMIA and JOF have quickly changed costumes and again step out on the stage. \nThey bow, to the public. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSKAT \n</b>\t\tHere is the husband. Here is the wife. If \n\t\tyou'll shut up over there, you'll see something \n\t\tsplendid. As I said, I play the lover and I \n\t\thaven't entered yet. That's why I'm going to \n\t\thide behind the curtain for the time being. \n\t\t\t(he wipes the sweat \n\t\t\tfrom his forehead)\n\t\tIt's damned hot. I think we'll have a \n\t\tthunderstorm.\n\nHe places his leg in front of JOF as if to trip him, raises MIA's skirt, \nmakes a face as if he could see all the wonders of the world underneath it, \nand disappears behind the gaudily patched curtains.\n\nSKAT is very handsome, now that he can see himself in the reflection of a tin \nwashbowl. His hair is tightly curled, his eyebrows are beautifully bushy, \nglittering earrings vie for equal attention with his teeth, and his cheeks \nare flushed rose red.\n<b> \n</b>He sits out in back on the tailboard of the wagon, dangling his legs and \nwhistling to himself.\n<b> \n</b>In the meantime JOF and MIA play their tragedy; it is not, however, received \nwith great acclaim. SKAT suddenly discovers that someone is watching him as \nhe gazes contentedly into the tin bowl. A woman stands there, stately in both \nheight and volume.\n<b> \n</b>SKAT frowns, toys with his small dagger and occasionally throws a roguish but \nfiery glance at the beautiful visitor. She suddenly discovers that one of her \nshoes doesn't quite fit. She leans down to fix it and in doing so allows her \ngenerous bosom to burst out of its prison -- no more than honor and chastity \nallow, but still enough so that the actor with his experienced eye \nimmediately sees that there are ample rewards to be had here.\n\nNow she comes a little closer, kneels down and opens a bundle containing \nseveral dainty morsels and a skin filled with red wine. JONAS SKAT manages \nnot to fall off the wagon in his excitement. Standing on the steps of the \nwagon, he supports himself against a nearby tree, crosses his legs and bows.\n<b> \n</b>The woman quietly bites into a chicken leg dripping with fat. At this moment \nthe actor is stricken by a radiant glance full of lustful appetites.\n\nWhen he sees this look, SKAT makes an instantaneous decision, jumps down from \nthe wagon and kneels in front of the blushing damsel.\n\nShe becomes weak and faint from his nearness, looks at him with a glassy \nglance and breathes heavily. SKAT doesn't neglect to press kisses on her \nsmall, chubby hands. The sun shines brightly and small birds make noises in \nthe bushes.\n\nNow she is forced to sit back; her legs seem unwilling to support her any \nlonger. Bewildered, she singles out another chicken leg from the large sack \nof food and holds it up in front of SKAT with an appealing and triumphant \nexpression, as if it were her maidenhood being offered as a prize.\n\nSKAT hesitates momentarily, but he is still the strategist. He lets the \nchicken leg fall to the grass, and murmurs in the woman's rosy ear.\n\nHis words seem to please her. She puts her arms around the actor's neck and \npulls him to her with such fierceness that both of them lose their balance \nand tumble down on the soft grass. The small birds take to their wings with \nfrightened shrieks.\n\n\n\nJOF stands in the hot sun with a flickering lantern in his hand. MIA pretends \nto be asleep on a bench which has been pulled forward on the stage. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tNight and moonlight now prevail \n\t\tHere sleeps my wife so frail ... \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tVOICE FROM THE PUBLIC\n</b>\t\tDoes she snore?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tMay I point out that this is a tragedy, and in \n\t\ttragedies one doesn't snore.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tVOICE FROM THE PUBLIC\n</b>\t\tI think she should snore anyhow. \n\nThis opinion causes mirth in the audience. JOF becomes slightly confused and \ngoes out of character, but MIA keeps her head and begins snoring. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tNight and moonlight now prevail.\n\t\tThere snores -- I mean sleeps -- my wife so frail. \n\t\tJealous I am, as never before, \n\t\tI hide myself behind this door. \n\t\tFaithful is she \n\t\tTo her lover -- not me. \n\t\tHe soon comes a-stealing \n\t\tTo awaken her lusty feeling. \n\t\tI shall now kill him dead \n\t\tFor cuckolding me in my bed. \n\t\tThere he comes in the moonlight, \n\t\tHis white legs shining bright. \n\t\tQuiet as a mouse, here I'll lie, \n\t\tTell him not that he's about to die.\n\nJOF hides himself. MIA immediately ends her snoring and sits up, looking to \nthe left. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tLook, there he comes in the night \n\t\tMy lover, my heart's delight.\n\nShe becomes silent and looks wide-eyed in front of her. The mood in the yard \nin front of the inn has, up to now, been rather lighthearted despite the \nheat.\n<b> \n</b>Now a rapid change occurs. People who had been laughing and chattering fall \nsilent. Their faces seem to pale under their sunbrowned skins, the children \nstop their games and stand with gaping mouths and frightened eyes.\n<b> \n</b>JOF steps out in front of the curtain. His painted face bears an expression \nof horror. MIA has risen with MIKAEL in her arms. Some of the women in the \nyard have fallen on their knees, others hide their faces, many begin to \nmutter half-forgotten prayers.\n\nAll have turned their faces towards the white road. Now a shrill song is \nheard. It is frenzied, almost a scream. A crucified Christ sways above the \nhilltop.\n\nThe cross-bearers soon come into sight. They are Dominican monks, their hoods \npulled down over their faces. More and more of them follow, carrying litters \nwith heavy coffins or clutching holy relics, their hands stretched out \nspasmodically. The dust wells up around their black hoods; the censers sway \nand emit a thick, ashen smoke which smells of rancid herbs.\n\nAfter the line of monks comes another procession. It is a column of men, \nboys, old men, women, girls, children. All of them have steel-edged scourges \nin their hands with which they whip themselves and each other, howling \necstatically. They twist in pain; their eyes bulge wildly; their lips are \ngnawed to shreds and dripping with foam. They have been seized by madness. \nThey bite their own hands and arms, whip each other in violent, almost \nrhythmic outbursts. Throughout it all the shrill song howls from their \nbursting throats. Many sway and fall, lift themselves up again, support each\nother and help each other to intensify the scourging.\n\nNow the procession pauses at the crossroads in front of the inn. The monks \nfall on their knees, hiding their faces with clenched hands, arms pressed \ntightly together. Their song never stops. The Christ figure on its timbered \ncross is raised above the heads of the crowd. It is not Christ triumphant, \nbut the suffering Jesus with the sores, the blood, the hammered nails and the \nface in convulsive pain. The Son of God, nailed on the wood of the cross, \nsuffering scorn and shame.\n<b> \n</b>The penitents have now sunk down in the dirt of the road. They collapse where \nthey stood like slaughtered cattle. Their screams rise with the song of the \nmonks, through misty clouds of incense, towards the white fire of the sun.\n<b> \n</b>A large square monk rises from his knees and reveals his face, which is red-\nbrown from the sun. His eyes glitter; his voice is thick with impotent scorn.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMONK\n</b>\t\tGod has sentenced us to punishment. We shall \n\t\tall perish in the black death. You, standing \n\t\tthere like gaping cattle, you who sit there in \n\t\tyour glutted complacency, do you know that this \n\t\tmay be your last hour? Death stands right \n\t\tbehind you. I can see how his crown gleams in \n\t\tthe sun. His scythe flashes as he raises it \n\t\tabove your heads. Which one of you shall he \n\t\tstrike first? You there, who stand staring like \n\t\ta goat, will your mouth be twisted into the \n\t\tlast unfinished gasp before nightfall? And you, \n\t\twoman, who bloom with life and self-\n\t\tsatisfaction, will you pale and become \n\t\textinguished before the morning dawns? You back\n\t\tthere, with your swollen nose and stupid grin, \n\t\tdo you have another year left to dirty the \n\t\tearth with your refuse? Do you know, you \n\t\tinsensible fools, that you shall die today or \n\t\ttomorrow, or the next day, because all of you \n\t\thave been sentenced? Do you hear what I say? Do \n\t\tyou hear the word? You have been sentenced, \n\t\tsentenced! \n\nThe MONK falls silent, looking around with a bitter face and a cold, scornful\nglance. Now, he clenches his hands, straddles the ground and turns his face\nupwards. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMONK\n</b>\t\tLord have mercy on us in our humiliation! Don't \n\t\tturn your face from us in loathing and \n\t\tcontempt, but be merciful to us for the sake of \n\t\tyour son, Jesus Christ. \n\nHe makes the sign of the cross over the crowd and then begins a new song in a\nstrong voice. The monks rise and join in the song. As if driven by some \nsuperhuman force, the penitents begin to whip themselves again, still wailing \nand moaning.\n\nThe procession continues. New members have joined the rear of the column; \nothers who were unable to go on lie weeping in the dust of the road. JONS the \nsquire drinks his beer.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tThis damned ranting about doom. Is that food \n\t\tfor the minds of modern people? Do they really \n\t\texpect us to take them seriously?\n\nThe KNIGHT grins tiredly.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tYes, now you grin at me, my lord. But allow me \n\t\tto point out that I've either read, heard or \n\t\texperienced most of the tales which we people \n\t\ttell each other. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\t\t(yawns) \n\t\tYes, yes.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tEven the ghost stories about God the Father, \n\t\tthe angels, Jesus Christ and the Holy Ghost --\n\t\tall these I've accepted without too much \n\t\temotion.\n\nHe leans down over the GIRL as she crouches at his feet and pats her on the \nhead. The KNIGHT drinks his beer silently.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\t\t(contentedly)\n\t\tMy little stomach is my world, my head is my \n\t\teternity, and my hands, two wonderful suns. My \n\t\tlegs are time's damned pendulums, and my dirty \n\t\tfeet are two splendid starting points for my \n\t\tphilosophy. Everything is worth precisely as \n\t\tmuch as a belch, the only difference being that \n\t\ta belch is more satisfying.\n\nThe beer mug is empty. Sighing, JONS gets to his feet. The GIRL follows him \nlike a shadow.\n\nIn the yard he meets a large man with a sooty face and a dark expression. He \nstops JONS with a roar. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tWhat are you screaming about?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\tI am Plog, the smith, and you are the squire \n\t\tJns. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tThat's possible.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\tHave you seen my wife?\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tNo, I haven't. But if I had seen her and she \n\t\tlooked like you, I'd quickly forget that I'd \n\t\tseen her. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG\n</b>\t\tWell, in that case you haven't seen her. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tMaybe she's run off. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\tDo you know anything?\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tI know quite a lot, but not about your wife. Go \n\t\tto the inn. Maybe they can help you.\n\nThe smith sighs sadly and goes inside.\n\nThe inn is very small and full of people eating and drinking to forget their \nnewly aroused fears of eternity. In the open fireplace a roasting pig turns\non an iron spit. The sun shines outside the casement window, its sharp rays\npiercing the darkness of the room, which is thick with fumes and\nperspiration.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tMERCHANT\n</b>\t\tYes, it's true! The plague is spreading along \n\t\tthe west coast. People are dying like flies. \n\t\tUsually business would be good at this time of \n\t\tyear, but, damn it, I've still got my whole \n\t\tstock unsold.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tWOMAN \n</b>\t\tThey speak of the judgment day. And all these \n\t\tomens are terrible. Worms, chopped-off hands \n\t\tand other monstrosities began pouring out of \n\t\tan old woman, and down in the village another \n\t\twoman gave birth to a calf's head. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tOLD MAN \n</b>\t\tThe day of judgment. Imagine.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tFARMER\n</b>\t\tIt hasn't rained here for a month. We'll surely \n\t\tlose our crops.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMERCHANT\n</b>\t\tAnd people are acting crazy, I'd say. They flee \n\t\tthe country and carry the plague with them \n\t\twherever they go. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tOLD MAN \n</b>\t\tThe day of judgment. Just think, just think! \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tFARMER \n</b>\t\tIf it's as they say, I suppose a person should \n\t\tlook after his house and try to enjoy life as \n\t\tlong as he can. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tWOMAN \n</b>\t\tBut there have been other things too, such \n\t\tthings that can't even be spoken of. \n\t\t\t(whispers)\n\t\tThings that mustn't be named -- but the priests \n\t\tsay that the woman carries it between her legs \n\t\tand that's why she must cleanse herself. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tOLD MAN \n</b>\t\tJudgment day. And the Riders of the Apocalypse \n\t\tstand at the bend in the village road. I \n\t\timagine they'll come on judgment night, at \n\t\tsundown.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tWOMAN \n</b>\t\tThere are many who have purged themselves with\n\t \tfire and died from it, but the priests say that \n\t\tit's better to die pure than to live for hell.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tMERCHANT \n</b>\t\tThis is the end, yes, it is. No one says it out\n\t\tloud, but all of us know that it's the end.

It will be \n\t\tterrible to see. \n\nThey whisper in low tones and sit close to each other.\n\n\n\nPLOG, the smith, shoves his way into a place next to JOF, who is still \ndressed in his costume. Opposite him sits RAVAL, leaning slightly forward, \nhis face perspiring heavily. RAVAL rolls an armlet out on the table. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRAVAL \n</b>\t\tDo you want this armlet? You can have it \n\t\tcheap. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tI can't afford it. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRAVAL \n</b>\t\tIt's real silver.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tIt's nice. But it's surely too expensive for \n\t\tme. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\tExcuse me, but has anyone here seen my wife? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tHas she disappeared? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\tThey say she's run away. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tHas she deserted you? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\tWith an actor.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tAn actor!

But to murder her, that's a terrible thing \n\t\tto do. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\tI'm also going to kill the actor. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tThe actor?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\tOf course, the one she eloped with. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tWhat has he done to deserve that? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\tAre you stupid?\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tThe actor! Now I understand. There are too many \n\t\tof them, so even if he hasn't done anything in \n\t\tparticular you ought to kill him merely because \n\t\the's an actor. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\tYou see, my wife has always been interested in \n\t\tthe tricks of the theatre.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tAnd that turned out to be her misfortune. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\tHer misfortune, but not mine, because a person \n\t\twho's born unfortunate can hardly suffer from \n\t\tany further misfortune.

He gets up.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\t\t(shouting)\n\t\tWhat have you done with my wife? \n\nThe room becomes silent. JOF looks around, but there is no exit, no way to \nescape. He puts his hands on the table. Suddenly a knife flashes through the \nair and sinks into the table top between his fingers.\n\nJOF snatches away his hands and raises his head. He looks half surprised, as \nif the truth had just become apparent to him.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tDo you want to hurt me? Why? Have I provoked \n\t\tsomeone, or got in the way? I'll leave right \n\t\tnow and never come back.\n\nJOF looks from one face to another, but no one seems ready to help him or \ncome to his defense.\n<b> \n</b><b> \t\t\t\tRAVAL \n</b>\t\tGet up so everyone can hear you. Talk louder. \n\nTrembling, JOF rises. He opens his mouth as if to say something, but not a \nword comes out.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tRAVAL \n</b>\t\tStand on your head so that we can see how good \n\t\tan actor you are.\n\nJOF gets up on the table and stands on his head. A hand pushes him forward so\nthat he collapses on the floor. PLOG rises, pulls him to his feet with one \nhand. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\t\t(shouts) \n\t\tWhat have you done with my wife? \n\nPLOG beats him so furiously that JOF flies across the table. RAVAL leans over\nhim.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tRAVAL \n</b>\t\tDon't lie there moaning. Get up and dance. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tI don't want to. I can't.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRAVEL \n</b>\t\tShow us how you imitate a bear. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tI can't play a bear.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRAVAL \n</b>\t\tLet's see if you can't after all.\n\nRAVAL prods JOF lightly with the knife point. JOF gets up with cold sweat on \nhis cheeks and forehead, frightened half to death. He begins to jump and hop \non top of the tables, swinging his arms and legs and making grotesque faces.\nSome laugh, but most of the people sit silently. JOF gasps as if his lungs \nwere about to burst. He sinks to his knees, and someone pours beer over him. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRAVEL \n</b>\t\tUp again! Be a good bear.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tI haven't done any harm. I haven't got the \n\t\tstrength to play a bear any more.\n\nAt that moment the door opens and JONS enters. JOF sees his chance and steals\nout. RAVAL intends to follow him, but suddenly stops. JONS and RAVAL look at \neach other. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tDo you remember what I was going to do to you \n\t\tif we met again?\n\nRAVAL steps back without speaking. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tI'm a man who keeps his word.\n\nJONS raises his knife and cuts RAVAL from forehead to cheek. RAVAL staggers \ntowards the wall.\n<b> \n</b>\n\nThe hot day has become night. Singing and howling can be heard from the inn. \nIn a hollow near the forest, the light still lingers. Hidden in the grass and\nthe shrubbery, nightingales sing and their voices echo through the stillness.\n<b> \n</b>The players' wagon stands in a small ravine, and not far away the horse \ngrazes on the dry grass. MIA has sat down in front of the wagon with her son \nin her arms. They play together and laugh happily.\n\nNow, a soft gleam of light strokes the hilltops, a last reflection from the \nred clouds over the sea.\n\nNot far from the wagon, the KNIGHT sits crouched over his chess game. He \nlifts his head.\n\nThe evening light moves across the heavy wagon wheels, across the woman and \nthe child. The KNIGHT gets up.\n\nMIA sees him and smiles. She holds up her struggling son, as if to amuse the \n<b>KNIGHT. \n</b>\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tWhat's his name? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tMikael.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tHow old is he? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tOh, he'll soon be two. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tHe's big for his age.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tDo you think so? Yes, I guess he's rather big. \n\nShe puts the child down on the ground and half rises to shake out her red \nskirt. When she sits down again, the KNIGHT steps closer.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tYou played some kind of show this afternoon. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tDid you think it was bad?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tYou are more beautiful now without your face \n\t\tpainted, and this gown is more becoming.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tYou see, Jonas Skat has run off and left us, \n\t\tso we're in real trouble now.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tIs that your husband?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\t\t(laughs)\n\t\tJonas! The other man is my husband. His name is \n\t\tJof.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tOh, that one.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tAnd now there's only him and me. We'll have to \n\t\tstart doing tricks again and that's more \n\t\ttrouble than it's worth. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tDo you do tricks also?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tWe certainly do. And Jof is a very skillful \n\t\tjuggler.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tIs Mikael going to be an acrobat? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tJof wants him to be. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tBut you don't.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tI don't know.\n\t\t\t(smiling)\n\t\tPerhaps he'll become a knight. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tLet me assure you, that's no pleasure either. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tNo, you don't look so happy. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tNo.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tAre you tired? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tYes. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tWhy?\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tI have dull company. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tDo you mean your squire? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tNo, not him.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tWho do you mean, then? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tMyself. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tI understand. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tDo you, really?\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tYes, I understand rather well. I have often \n\t\twondered why people torture themselves as often \n\t\tas they can. Isn't that so?\n\nShe nods energetically and the KNIGHT smiles seriously. Now the shrieks and \nthe noise from the inn become louder. Black figures flicker across the grass \nmound. Someone collapses, gets up and runs. It is JOF. MIA stretches out her \narms and receives him. He holds his hands in front of his face, moaning like \na child, and his body sways. He kneels. MIA holds him close to her and \nsprinkles him with small, anxious questions: What have you done? How are you?\nWhat is it? Does it hurt? What can I do? Have they been cruel to you? She \nruns for a rag, which she dips in water, and carefully bathes her husband's\ndirty, bloody face.\n<b> \n</b>Eventually a rather sorrowful visage emerges. Blood runs from a bruise on his \nforehead and his nose, and a tooth has been loosened, but otherwise JOF seems \nunhurt. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tOuch, it hurts.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA\n</b>\t\tWhy did you have to go there? And of course you \n\t\tdrank.\n\nMIA's anxiety has been replaced by a mild anger. She pats him a little harder \nthan necessary. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tOuch! I didn't drink anything.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA\n</b>\t\tThen I suppose you were boasting about the \n\t\tangels and devils you consort with. People \n\t\tdon't like someone who has too many ideas and \n\t\tfantasies.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tI swear to you that I didn't say a word about \n\t\tangels. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA\n</b>\t\tYou were, of course, busy singing and dancing. \n\t\tYou can never stop being an actor. People also \n\t\tbecome angry at that, and you know it.\n\nJOF doesn't answer but searches for the armlet. He holds it up in front of \nMIA with an injured expression. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tLook what I bought for you. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tYou couldn't afford it. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\t\t(angry)\n\t\tBut I got it anyhow.\n\nThe armlet glitters faintly in the twilight. MIA now pulls it across her \nwrist. They look at it in silence, and their faces soften. They look at each \nother, touch each other's hands. JOF puts his head against MIA'S shoulder and \nsighs.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tOh, how they beat me.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tWhy didn't you beat them back?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tI only become frightened and angry. I never get \n\t\ta chance to hit back. I can get angry, you know \n\t\tthat. I roared like a lion.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA\n</b>\t\tWere they frightened? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tNo, they just laughed.\n\nTheir son MIKAEL crawls over to them. JOF lies down on the ground and pulls \nhis son on top of him. MIA gets down on her hands and knees and playfully \nsniffs at MIKAEL.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tDo you notice how good he smells?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tAnd he is so compact to hold. You're a sturdy \n\t\tone. A real acrobat's body.\n\nHe lifts MIKAEL up and holds him by the legs. MIA looks up suddenly, \nremembering the knight's presence. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tYes, this is my husband, Jof. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tGood evening. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tGood evening.\n<b> \n</b>JOF becomes a little embarrassed and rises. All three of them look at one \nanother silently.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tI have just told your wife that you have a \n\t\tsplendid son. He'll bring great joy to you. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tYes, he's fine.\n<b>     \n</b>They become silent again.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tHave we nothing to offer the knight, Mia? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tThank you, I don't want anything.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\t\t(housewifely)\n\t\tI picked a basket of wild strawberries this \n\t\tafternoon. And we have a drop of milk fresh \n\t\tfrom a cow ... \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\t... that we were allowed to milk. So, if you \n\t\twould like to partake of this humble fare, it \n\t\twould be a great honor. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tPlease be seated and I'll bring the food. \n\nThey sit down. MIA disappears with MIKAEL. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tWhere are you going next? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tUp to the saints' feast at Elsinore. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tI wouldn't advise you to go there. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tWhy not, if I may ask?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tThe plague has spread in that direction, \n\t\tfollowing the coast line south. It's said that \n\t\tpeople are dying by the tens of thousands.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tReally! Well, sometimes life is a little hard. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tMay I suggest ... \n\t\t\t(JOF looks at him, surprised)\n \t\t... that you follow me through the forest \n\t\ttonight and stay at my home if you like. Or go \n\t\talong the east coast. You'll probably be safer \n\t\tthere.\n\nMIA has returned with a bowl of wild strawberries and the milk, places it \nbetween them and gives each of them a spoon.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tI wish you good appetite. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tI humbly thank you.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tThese are wild strawberries from the forest. I \n\t\thave never seen such large ones. They grow up \n\t\tthere on the hillside. Notice how they smell!\n\nShe points with a spoon and smiles. The KNIGHT nods, as if he were pondering \nsome profound thought. JOF eats heartily.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tYour suggestion is good, but I must think it \n\t\tover. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tIt might be wise to have company going through \n\t\tthe forest. It's said to be full of trolls and \n\t\tghosts and bandits. That's what I've heard.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\t\t(staunchly)\n\t\tYes, I'd say that it's not a bad idea, but I \n\t\thave to think about it. Now that Skat has left, \n\t\tI am responsible for the troupe. After all, I \n\t\thave become director of the whole company.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\t\t(mimics) \n\t\tAfter all, I have become director of the whole \n\t\tcompany.\n\nJONS comes walking slowly down the hill, closely followed by the GIRL. MIA \npoints with her spoon. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tDo you want some strawberries?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tThis man saved my life. Sit down, my friend, \n\t\tand let us be together.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\t\t(stretches herself) \n\t\tOh, how nice this is. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tFor a short while.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tNearly always. One day is like another. There \n\t\tis nothing strange about that. The summer, of \n\t\tcourse, is better than the winter, because in \n\t\tsummer you don't have to be cold. But spring is \n\t\tbest of all.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tI have written a poem about the spring. Perhaps \n\t\tyou'd like to hear it. I'll run and get my lyre. \n\nHe sprints towards the wagon.\n<b> \n</b><b> \t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tNot now, Jof. Our guests may not be amused by \n\t\tyour songs.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\t\t(politely) \n\t\tBy all means. I write little songs myself. For \n\t\texample, I know a very funny song about a \n\t\twanton fish which I doubt that you've heard yet. \n\nThe KNIGHT looks at him.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tYou'll not get to hear it either. There are \n\t\tpersons here who don't appreciate my art and I \n\t\tdon't want to upset anyone. I'm a sensitive \n\t\tsoul.\n\nJOF has come out with his lyre, sits on a small, gaudy box and plucks at the \ninstrument, humming quietly, searching for his melody. JONS yawns and lies \ndown. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tPeople are troubled by so much.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tIt's always better when one is two. Have you no \n\t\tone of your own?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tYes, I think I had someone. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tAnd what is she doing now? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tI don't know.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tYou look so solemn. Was she your beloved? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tWe were newly married and we played together. \n\t\tWe laughed a great deal. I wrote songs to her \n\t\teyes, to her nose, to her beautiful little \n\t\tears. We went hunting together and at night we \n\t\tdanced. The house was full of life ... \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tDo you want some more strawberries?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\t\t(shakes his head)\n\t\tFaith is a torment, did you know that? It is \n\t\tlike loving someone who is out there in the \n\t\tdarkness but never appears, no matter how \n\t\tloudly you call. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tI don't understand what you mean.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tEverything I've said seems meaningless and \n\t\tunreal while I sit here with you and your \n\t\thusband. How unimportant it all becomes \n\t\tsuddenly.\n\nHe takes the bowl of milk in his hand and drinks deeply from it several \ntimes. Then he carefully puts it down and looks up, smiling.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tNow you don't look so solemn.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tI shall remember this moment. The silence, the \n\t\ttwilight, the bowls of strawberries and milk,\n\t\tyour faces in the evening light. Mikael \n\t\tsleeping, Jof with his lyre. I'll try to \n\t\tremember what we have talked about. I'll carry \n\t\tthis memory between my hands as carefully as \n\t\tif it were a bowl filled to the brim with fresh \n\t\tmilk. \n\nHe turns his face away and looks out towards the sea and the colorless gray \nsky. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tAnd it will be an adequate sign -- it will be \n\t\tenough for me.\n\nHe rises, nods to the others and walks down towards the forest. JOF continues \nto play on his lyre. MIA stretches out on the grass.\n\nThe KNIGHT picks up his chess game and carries it towards the beach. It is \nquiet and deserted; the sea is still. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tI have been waiting for you.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tPardon me. I was detained for a few moments. \n\t\tBecause I revealed my tactics to you, I'm in \n\t\tretreat. It's your move.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tWhy do you look so satisfied? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tThat's my secret.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tOf course. Now I take your knight. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tYou did the right thing. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tHave you tricked me?\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tOf course.

Check! \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tWhat are you laughing at?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tDon't worry about my laughter; save your king \n\t\tinstead.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tYou're rather arrogant. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tOur game amuses me.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tIt's your move. Hurry up. I'm a little pressed \n\t\tfor time.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tI understand that you've a lot to do, but you \n\t\tcan't get out of our game. It takes time.\n\nDEATH is about to answer him but stops and leans over the board. The KNIGHT \nsmiles.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tAre you going to escort the juggler and his \n\t\twife through the forest? Those whose names are \n\t\tJof and Mia and who have a small son? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tWhy do you ask? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tOh, no reason at all.\n<b> \n</b>The KNIGHT suddenly stops smiling. DEATH looks at him scornfully.\n<b> \n</b>\n\nImmediately after sundown, the little company gathers in the yard of the inn.\nThere is the KNIGHT, JONS and the GIRL, JOF and MIA in their wagon. Their \nson, MIKAEL, is already asleep. JONAS SKAT is still missing. \n\nJONS goes into the inn to get provisions for the night journey and to have a \nlast mug of beer. The inn is now empty and quiet except for a few farmhands \nand maidens who are eating their evening meal in a corner. At one of the \nsmall windows sits a lonely, hunched-over fellow, with a jug of brandy in his \nhands. His expression is very sad. Once in a while he is shaken by a gigantic \nsob. It is PLOG, the smith, who sits there and whimpers. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tGod in heaven, isn't this Plog, the smith? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\tGood evening.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tAre you sitting here sniveling in loneliness? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\tYes, yes, look at the smith. He moans like a \n\t\trabbit. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tIf I were in your boots, I'd be happy to get \n\t\trid of a wife in such an easy way.\n\nJONS pats the smith on the back, quenches his thirst with beer, and sits down \nby his side. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\tAre you married?\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tI! A hundred times and more. I can't keep count \n\t\tof all my wives any longer. But it's often that \n\t\tway when you're a traveling man.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\tI can assure you that one wife is worse than a \n\t\thundred, or else I've had worse luck than any \n\t\tpoor wretch in this miserable world, which \n\t\tisn't impossible.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tYes, it's hell with women and hell without \n\t\tthem. So, however you look at it, it's still \n\t\tbest to kill them off while it's most amusing.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\tWomen's nagging, the shrieking of children and \n\t\twet diapers, sharp nails and sharp words, blows \n\t\tand pokes, and the devil's aunt for a \n\t\tmother-in-law. And then, when one wants to \n\t\tsleep after a long day, there's a new song -- \n\t\ttears, whining and moans loud enough to wake \n\t\tthe dead. \n\nJONS nods delightedly. He has drunk deeply and talks with an old woman's \nvoice. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tWhy don't you kiss me good night?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\t\t(in the same way)\n\t\tWhy don't you sing a song for me? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tWhy don't you love me the way you did when we \n\t\tfirst met?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\tWhy don't you look at my new slip? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tYou only turn your back and snore. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\tOh hell!\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tOh hell.

Rejoice!\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\t\t(furious) \n\t\tI'll snip their noses with pliers, I'll bash in \n\t\ttheir chests with a small hammer, I'll tap \n\t\ttheir heads ever so lightly with a sledge.\n\nPLOG begins to cry loudly and his whole body sways in an enormous attack of \nsorrow. JONS looks at him with interest.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS\n</b>\t\tLook how he howls again. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\tMaybe I love her.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tSo, maybe you love her! Then, you poor \n\t\tmisguided ham shank, I'll tell you that love is \n\t\tanother word for lust, plus lust, plus lust \n\t\tand a damn lot of cheating, falseness, lies and \n\t\tall kinds of other fooling around. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG\n</b>\t\tYes, but it hurts anyway.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tOf course. Love is the blackest of all plagues, \n\t\tand if one could die of it, there would be \n\t\tsome pleasure in love. But you almost always \n\t\tget over it. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG\n</b>\t\tNo, no, not me.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tYes, you too. There are only a couple of poor \n\t\twretches who die of love once in a while. Love \n\t\tis as contagious as a cold in the nose. It eats \n\t\taway at your strength, your independence, your \n\t\tmorale, if you have any. If everything is \n\t\timperfect in this imperfect world, love is most \n\t\tperfect in its perfect imperfection.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\tYou're happy, you with your oily words, and, \n\t\tbesides, you believe your own drivel.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tBelieve! Who said that I believed it? But I \n\t\tlove to give good advice. If you ask me for \n\t\tadvice you'll get two pieces for the price of \n\t\tone, because after all I really am an educated \n\t\tman.\n\nJONS gets up from the table and strokes his face with his hands. PLOG becomes \nvery unhappy and grabs his belt. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\tListen, Jns. May I go with you through the \n\t\tforest? I'm so lonely and don't want to go home \n\t\tbecause everyone will laugh at me.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tOnly if you don't whimper all the time, because \n\t\tin that case we'll all have to avoid you.\n\nPLOG gets up and embraces JONS. Slightly drunk, the two new friends walk \ntowards the door.\n<b> \n</b>When they come out in the yard, JOF immediately catches sight of them, \nbecomes angry and yells a warning to JONS.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tJns! Watch out. That one wants to fight all \n\t\tthe time. He's not quite sane.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tYes, but now he's just sniveling.\n\nPLOG steps up to JOF, who blanches with fear. PLOG offers his hand.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\tI'm really sorry if I hurt you. But I have \n\t\tsuch a hell of a temper, you know. Shake hands.\n\nJOF gingerly proffers a frightened hand and gets it thoroughly shaken and \nsqueezed. While JOF tries to straighten out his fingers, PLOG is seized by \ngreat good will and opens his arms.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\tCome in my arms, little brother.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tThank you, thank you, perhaps later. But now \n\t\twe're really in a hurry.\n\nJOF climbs up on the wagon seat quickly and clucks at the horse.\n<b> \n</b>\n\nThe small company is on its way towards the forest and the night.\n\nIt is dark in the forest.\n<b> \n</b>First comes the KNIGHT on his large horse. Then JOF and MIA follow, sitting \nclose to each other in the juggler's wagon. MIA holds her son in her arms. \nJONS follows them with his heavily laden horse. He has the smith in tow. The \nGIRL sits on top of the load on the horse's back, hunched over as if asleep.\n\nThe footsteps, the horses' heavy tramp on the soft path, the human breathing \n-- yet it is quiet.\n<b> \n</b>Then the moon sails out of the clouds. The forest suddenly becomes alive with \nthe night's unreality. The dazzling light pours through the thick foliage of \nthe beech trees, a moving, quivering world of light and shadow.\n\nThe wanderers stop. Their eyes are dark with anxiety and foreboding. Their \nfaces are pale and unreal in the floating light. It is very quiet.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG\n</b>\t\tNow the moon has come out of the clouds. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tThat's good. Now we can see the road better. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tI don't like the moon tonight. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tThe trees stand so still.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tThat's because there's no wind. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\tI guess he means that they stand very still. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tIt's completely quiet.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tIf one could hear a fox at least. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tOr an owl.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tOr a human voice besides one's own.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tGIRL\n</b>\t\tThey say it's dangerous to remain standing in \n\t\tmoonlight.\n\nSuddenly, out of the silence and the dim light falling across the forest \nroad, a ghostlike cart emerges. It is the WITCH being taken to the place \nwhere she will be burned. Next to her eight soldiers shuffle along tiredly, \ncarrying their lances on their backs. The girl sits in the cart, bound with \niron chains around her throat and arms. She stares fixedly into the \nmoonlight.\n<b> \n</b>A black figure sits next to her, a monk with his hood pulled down over his \nhead. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tWhere are you going? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSOLDIER\n</b>\t\tTo the place of execution.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tYes, now I can see. It's the girl who has done \n\t\tit with the Black One. The witch?\n\nThe SOLDIER nods sourly. Hesitantly, the travelers follow. The KNIGHT guides \nhis horse over to the side of the cart. The WITCH seems to be half-conscious, \nbut her eyes are wide open.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tI see that they have hurt your hands.\n\nThe WITCH'S pale, childish face turns towards the KNIGHT and she shakes her \nhead. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tI have a potion that will stop your pain.\n\nShe shakes her head again.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tWhy do you burn her at this time of night? \n\t\tPeople have so few diversions these days.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tSOLDIER \n</b>\t\tSaints preserve us, be quiet! It's said that \n\t\tshe brings the Devil with her wherever she \n\t\tgoes. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tYou are eight brave men, then.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSOLDIER \n</b>\t\tWell, we've been paid. And this is a volunteer \n\t\tjob. \n\nThe SOLDIER speaks in whispers while glancing anxiously at the WITCH.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\t\t(to the WITCH)\n\t\tWhat's your name? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTYAN\n</b>\t\tMy name is Tyan, my lord. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tHow old are you? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTYAN\n</b>\t\tFourteen, my lord.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tAnd is it true that you have been in league \n\t\twith the Devil?\n\nTYAN nods quietly and looks away. Now they arrive at the parish border. At \nthe foot of the nearby hills lies a crossroads. The pyre has already been \nstacked in the center of the forest clearing. The travelers remain there, \nhesitant and curious.\n<b> \n</b>The soldiers have tied up the cart horse and bring out two long wooden beams.\nThey nail rungs across the beams so that it looks like a ladder. TYAN will be \nbound to this like an eelskin stretched out to dry.\n\nThe sound of the hammering echoes through the forest. The KNIGHT has \ndismounted and walks closer to the cart. Again he tries to catch TYAN'S eyes, \ntouches her very lightly as if to waken her. Slowly she turns her face \ntowards him.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tThey say that you have been in league with the \n\t\tDevil.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTYAN\n</b>\t\tWhy do you ask?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tNot out of curiosity, but for very personal \n\t\treasons. I too want to meet him. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTYAN \n</b>\t\tWhy?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tI want to ask him about God. He, if anyone, \n\t\tmust know.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTYAN \n</b>\t\tYou can see him anytime. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tHow?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTYAN \n</b>\t\tYou must do as I tell you.\n\nThe KNIGHT grips the wooden rail of the cart so tightly that his knuckles \nwhiten. TYAN leans forward and joins her gaze with his. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTYAN \n</b>\t\tLook into my eyes.\n\nThe KNIGHT meets her gaze. They stare at each other for a long time.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTYAN \n</b>\t\tWhat do you see? Do you see him?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tI see fear in your eyes, an empty, numb fear. \n\t\tBut nothing else.\n\nHe falls silent. The soldiers work at the stakes; their hammering echoes in \nthe forest. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTYAN \n</b>\t\tNo one, nothing, no one? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\t\t(shakes his head)\n\t\tNo.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTYAN\n</b>\t\tCan't you see him behind your back? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\t\t(looks around) \n\t\tNo, there is no one there. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTYAN \n</b>\t\tBut he is with me everywhere. I only have to \n\t\tstretch out my hand and I can feel his hand. He \n\t\tis with me now too. The fire won't hurt me. He \n\t\twill protect me from everything evil.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tHas he told you this? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTYAN \n</b>\t\tI know it.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tHas he said it?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTYAN \n</b>\t\tI know it, I know it. You must see him \n\t\tsomewhere, you must. The priests had no \n\t\tdifficulty seeing him, nor did the soldiers. \n\t\tThey are so afraid of him that they don't even \n\t\tdare touch me.\n\nThe sounds of the hammers stops. The soldiers stand like black shadows rooted \nin the moss. They fumble with the chains and pull at the neck iron. TYAN \nmoans weakly, as if she were far away.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tWhy have you crushed her hands? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSOLDIER\n</b>\t\t\t(surly) \n\t\tWe didn't do it. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tWho did? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSOLDIER\n</b>\t\tAsk the monk.\n\nThe soldiers pull the iron and the chains. TYAN'S shaven head sways, gleaming \nin the moonlight. Her blackened mouth opens as if to scream, but no sound \nemerges. They take her down from the cart and lead her towards the ladder and \nthe stake. The KNIGHT turns to the MONK, who remains seated in the cart. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tWhat have you done with the child? \n\nDEATH turns around and looks at him. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tDon't you ever stop asking questions? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tNo, I'll never stop.\n\nThe soldiers chain TYAN to the rungs of the ladder. She submits resignedly, \nmoans weakly like an animal and tries to ease her body into position.\n<b> \n</b>When they have fastened her, they walk over to light the pyre. The KNIGHT \nsteps up and leans over her. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tFor a moment I thought of killing the soldiers, \n\t\tbut it would do no good. She's nearly dead \n\t\talready. \n\nOne of the soldiers approaches. Thick smoke wells down from the pyre and \nsweeps over the quiet shadows near the crossroads and the hill.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSOLDIER\n</b>\t\tI've told you to be careful. Don't go too close \n\t\tto her.\n\nThe KNIGHT doesn't heed this warning. He cups his hand, fills it with water \nfrom the skin and gives it to TYAN. Then he gives her a potion.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tTake this and it will stop the pain.\n\nSmoke billows down over them and they begin to cough. The soldiers step \nforward and raise the ladder against a nearby fir tree. TYAN hangs there \nmotionlessly, her eyes wide open.\n\nThe KNIGHT straightens up and stands immobile. JONS is behind him, his voice \nnearly choked with rage. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tWhat does she see? Can you tell me? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\t\t(shakes his head) \n\t\tShe feels no more pain. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tYou don't answer my question. Who watches over \n\t\tthat child? Is it the angels, or God, or the \n\t\tDevil, or only the emptiness? Emptiness, my \n\t\tlord!\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tThis cannot be.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tLook at her eyes, my lord. Her poor brain has \n\t\tjust made a discovery. Emptiness under the \n\t\tmoon. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tNo.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tWe stand powerless, our arms hanging at our \n\t\tsides, because we see what she sees, and our \n\t\tterror and hers are the same. \n\t\t\t(an outburst) \n\t\tThat poor little child. I can't stand it, I \n\t\tcan't stand it ...\n\nHis voice sticks in his throat and he suddenly walks away. The KNIGHT mounts\nhis horse. The travelers depart from the crossroads. TYAN finally closes her \neyes.\n<b> \n</b>\n\nThe forest is now very dark. The road winds between the trees. The wagon \nsqueaks and rattles over stones and roots. A bird suddenly shrieks.\n<b> \n</b>JOF lifts his head and wakes up. He has been asleep with his arms around \nMIA's shoulders. The KNIGHT is sharply silhouetted against the tree trunks.\n\nHis silence makes him seem almost unreal. JONS and PLOG are slightly drunk \nand support each other. Suddenly PLOG has to sit down. He puts his hands over \nhis face and howls piteously. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\tOh, now it came over me again! \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tDon't scream. What came over you?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\tMy wife, damn it. She is so beautiful. She is \n\t\tso beautiful that she can't be described \n\t\twithout the accompaniment of a lyre.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tNow it starts again.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\tHer smile is like brandy. Her eyes like \n\t\tblackberries ...\n\nPLOG searches for beautiful words. He gestures gropingly with his large \nhands.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\t\t(sighs) \n\t\tGet up, you tear-drenched pig. We'll lose the \n\t\tothers.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\tYes, of course, of course. Her nose is like a \n\t\tlittle pink potato; her behind is like a juicy \n\t\tpear -- yes, the whole woman is like a \n\t\tstrawberry patch. I can see her in front of me, \n\t\twith arms like wonderful cucumbers.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tSaints almighty, stop! You're a very bad poet, \n\t\tdespite the fact that you're drunk. And your \n\t\tvegetable garden bores me.\n\nThey walk across an open meadow. Here it is a little brighter and the moon \nshimmers behind a thin sky. Suddenly PLOG points a large finger towards the \nedge of the forest. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\tLook there.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tDo you see something? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\tThere, over there! \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tI don't see anything.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\tHang on to something, my friends. The hour is \n\t\tnear! Who is that at the edge of the forest if \n\t\tnot my own dearly beloved, with actor attached?\n\nThe two lovers discover PLOG and it's too late. They cannot retreat. SKAT \nimmediately takes to his heels. PLOG chases him, swinging his sledge and \nbellowing like a wild boar.\n\nFor a few confusing moments the two rivals stumble among the stones and \nbushes in the gray gloom of the forest. The duel begins to look senseless, \nbecause both of them are equally frightened.\n\nThe travelers silently observe this confused performance. LISA screams once \nin a while, more out of duty than out of impulse.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSKAT \n</b>\t\t\t(panting) \n\t\tYou miserable stubbleheaded bastard of seven \n\t\tscurvy bitches, if I were in your lousy rags I \n\t\twould be stricken with such eternal shame about \n\t\tmy breath, my voice, my arms and legs -- in \n\t\tshort, about my whole body -- that I would \n\t\timmediately rid nature of my own embarrassing \n\t\tself. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\t\t(angry) \n\t\tWatch out, you perfumed slob, that I don't fart \n\t\ton you and immediately blow you down to the \n\t\tactor's own red-hot hell, where you can sit and \n\t\trecite monologues to each other until the dust \n\t\tcomes out of the Devil's ears. \n\nThen LISA throws herself around her husband's neck. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLISA \n</b>\t\tForgive me, dear little husband, I'll never do \n\t\tit again. I am so sorry and you can't imagine \n\t\thow terribly that man over there betrayed me. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\tI'll kill him anyway.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLISA \n</b>\t\tYes, do that, just kill him. He isn't even a \n\t\thuman being.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tHell, he's an actor.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLISA \n</b>\t\tHe is only a false beard, false teeth, false \n\t\tsmiles, rehearsed lines, and he's as empty as a \n\t\tjug. Just kill him. \n\nLISA sobs with excitement and sorrow. PLOG looks around, a little confused. \nSKAT uses this opportunity. He pulls out a dagger and places the point \nagainst his breast.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSKAT \n</b>\t\tShe's right. Just kill me. If you thought that \n\t\tI was going to apologize for being what I am, \n\t\tyou are mistaken. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLISA \n</b>\t\tLook how sickening he is. How he makes a fool \n\t\tof himself, how he puts on an act. Dear Plog, \n\t\tkill him. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSKAT \n</b>\t\tMy friends, you have only to push, and my \n\t\tunreality will soon be transformed into a new, \n\t\tsolid reality. An absolutely tangible corpse.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLISA \n</b>\t\tDo something then. Kill him.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\t\t(embarrassed) \n\t\tHe has to fight me, otherwise I can't kill him.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSKAT \n</b>\t\tYour life's thread now hangs by a very ragged \n\t\tshred. Idiot, your day is short.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\tYou'll have to irritate me a little more to get \n\t\tme as angry as before.\n\nSKAT looks at the travelers with a pained expression and then lifts his eyes \ntowards the night sky. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSKAT \n</b>\t\tI forgive all of you. Pray for me sometimes. \n\nSKAT sinks the dagger into his breast and slowly falls to the ground. The \ntravelers stand confused. PLOG rushes forward and begins to pull at SKAT'S hands. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\tOh dear, dear, I didn't mean it that way! Look, \n\t\tthere's no life left in him. I was beginning to \n\t\tlike him, and in my opinion Lisa was much too \n\t\tspiteful. \n\nJOF leans over his colleague.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tHe's dead, totally, enormously dead. In fact, \n\t\tI've never seen such a dead actor.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLISA \n</b>\t\tCome on, let's go. This is nothing to mourn \n\t\tover. He has only himself to blame.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\tAnd I have to be married to her. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tWe must go on.\n\nSKAT lies in the grass and keeps the dagger pressed tightly to his breast. \nThe travelers depart and soon they have disappeared into the dark forest on \nthe other side of the meadow. When SKAT is sure that no one can see him, he \nsits up and lifts the dagger from his breast. It is a stage dagger with a \nblade that pushes into the handle. SKAT laughs to himself.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSKAT \n</b>\t\tNow that was a good scene. I'm really a good \n\t\tactor. After all, why shouldn't I be a little \n\t\tpleased with myself? But where shall I go? I'll \n\t\twait until it becomes light and then I'll find \n\t\tthe easiest way out of the forest. I'll climb \n\t\tup a tree for the time being so that no bears, \n\t\twolves or ghosts can get at me.\n\nHe soon finds a likely tree and climbs up into its thick foliage. He sits \ndown as comfortably as possible and reaches for his food pouch.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSKAT \n</b>\t\t\t(yawns) \n\t\tTomorrow I'll find Jof and Mia and then we'll \n\t\tgo to the saints' feast in Elsinore.

The sound of industrious sawing is heard \nthrough the silence.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSKAT \n</b>\t\tWorkmen in the forest. Oh, well! \n\t\t\t(sings)\n\t\tThe terrible night doesn't frighten me ... \n\t\t\t(speaks)\n\t\tHey, what the devil ... it's my tree they're \n\t\tcutting down.\n\nHe peers through the foliage. Below him stands a dark figure diligently \nsawing away at the base of the tree. SKAT becomes frightened and angry.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tSKAT \n</b>\t\tHey, you! Do you hear me, you tricky bastard? \n\t\tWhat are you doing with my tree?\n\nThe sawing continues without a pause. SKAT becomes more frightened.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSKAT \n</b>\t\tCan't you at least answer me? Politeness costs \n\t\tso little. Who are you?\n\nDEATH straightens his back and squints up at him. SKAT cries out in terror.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tI'm sawing down your tree because your time is\n\t\tup.\n<b>  \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tSKAT\n</b>\t\tIt won't do.

The forest becomes silent again.\n<b> \n</b>\n\nNight and then dawn.\n\nThe travelers have come to a sort of clearing and have collapsed on the moss.\nThey lie quietly and listen to their own breathing, their heartbeats, and the \nwind in the tree tops. Here the forest is wild and impenetrable. Huge \nboulders stick up out of the ground like the heads of black giants. A fallen \ntree lies like a mighty barrier between light and shadow.\n\nMIA, JOF and their child have sat down apart from the others. They look at \nthe light of the moon, which is no longer full and dead but mysterious and \nunstable. The KNIGHT sits bent over his chess game. LISA cries quietly behind \nPLOG'S back. JONS lies on the ground and looks up at the heavens.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tSoon dawn will come, but the heat continues to \n\t\thang over us like a smothering blanket.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLISA \n</b>\t\tI'm so frightened.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\tWe feel that something is going to happen to \n\t\tus, but we don't know what.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tMaybe it's the day of judgment. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\tThe day of judgment ...\n\nNow, something moves behind the fallen tree. There is a rustling sound and a \nmoaning cry that seems to come from a wounded animal. Everyone listens\nintently, all faces turned towards the sound. A voice comes out of the\ndarkness. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRAVAL \n</b>\t\tDo you have some water?\n\nRAVAL'S perspiring face soon becomes visible. He disappears in the darkness, \nbut his voice is heard again. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRAVAL \n</b>\t\tCan't you give me a little water? \n\t\t\t(pause) \n\t\tI have the plague.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tDon't come here. If you do I'll slit your \n\t\tthroat. Keep to the other side of the tree. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRAVEL \n</b>\t\tI'm afraid of death.\n\nNo one answers. There is complete silence. RAVAL gasps heavily for air. The \ndry leaves rustle with his movements. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRAVEL \n</b>\t\tI don't want to die! I don't want to!\n<b> \n</b>No one answers. RAVAL'S face appears suddenly at the base of the tree. His \neyes bulge wildly and his mouth is ringed with foam.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRAVAL \n</b>\t\tCan't you have pity on me? Help me! At least \n\t\ttalk to me.\n\nNo one answers. The trees sigh. RAVAL begins to cry. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRAVAL \n</b>\t\tI am going to die. I. I. I! What will happen to \n\t\tme! Can no one console me? Haven't you any \n\t\tcompassion? Can't you see that I ...\n\nHis words are choked off by a gurgling sound. He disappears in the darkness \nbehind the fallen tree. It becomes quiet for a few moments.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRAVAL \n</b>\t\t\t(whispers) \n\t\tCan't anyone ... only a little water. \n\nSuddenly the GIRL gets up with a quick movement, snatches JONS'S water bag \nand runs a few steps. JONS grabs her and holds her fast.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tIt's no use. It's no use. I know that it's no \n\t\tuse. It's meaningless. It's totally \n\t\tmeaningless.

RAVAL'S sobs are dry and convulsive, like a \nfrightened child's. His sudden scream is cut off in the middle. Then it \nbecomes quiet.\n<b> \n</b>The GIRL sinks down and hides her face in her hands. JONS places his hand on \nher shoulder.\n<b> \n</b>\n<b>16\n</b>The KNIGHT is no longer alone. DEATH has come to him and he raises his hand.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tShall we play our game to the end? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tYour move!\n\nDEATH raises his hand and strikes the KNIGHT'S queen.

The moonlight moves over the chess pieces, \nwhich seem to have a life of their own.\n\nJOF has dozed off for a few moments, but suddenly he wakens. Then he sees the \nKNIGHT and DEATH together. He becomes very frightened and awakens MIA. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tMia!\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tYes, what is it?\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tI see something terrible.

They are so occupied with their \n\t\tgame that if we move very quietly, they won't \n\t\tnotice us. \n\nJOF gets up carefully and disappears into the darkness behind the trees. MIA \nremains standing, as if paralyzed by fear. She stares fixedly at the KNIGHT \nand the chess game. She holds her son in her arms. Now JOF returns.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tI have harnessed the horse. The wagon is \n\t\tstanding near the big tree. You go first and \n\t\tI'll follow you with the packs. See that Mikael \n\t\tdoesn't wake up.\n\nMIA does what JOF has told her. At the same moment, the KNIGHT looks up from\nhis game. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tIt is your move, Antonius Block.\n\nThe KNIGHT remains silent. He sees MIA go through the moonlight towards the\nwagon. JOF bends down to pick up the pack and follows at a distance. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tHave you lost interest in our game?\n<b> \n</b>The KNIGHT'S eyes become alarmed. DEATH looks at him intently.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT\n</b>\t\tLost interest? On the contrary.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tYou seem anxious. Are you hiding anything? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tNothing escapes you -- or does it? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tNothing escapes me. No one escapes from me. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tIt's true that I'm worried.\n\nHe pretends to be clumsy and knocks the chess pieces over with the hem of his \ncoat. He looks up at DEATH. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT\n</b>\t\tI've forgotten how the pieces stood.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\t\t(laughs contentedly) \n\t\tBut I have not forgotten. You can't get away \n\t\tthat easily.\n<b> \n</b>DEATH leans over the board and rearranges the pieces. The KNIGHT looks past \nhim towards the road. MIA has just climbed up on the wagon. JOF takes the \nhorse by the bridle and leads it down the road. DEATH notices nothing; he is \ncompletely occupied with reconstructing the game.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tNow I see something interesting. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tWhat do you see?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tYou are mated on the next move, Antonius Block. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tThat's true.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tDid you enjoy your reprieve? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tYes, I did.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tI'm happy to hear that.

Dawn comes, a flickering light without \nlife, making the forest seem threatening and evil. JOF drives over the \ntwisting road. MIA sits beside him. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA\n</b>\t\tWhat a strange light.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tI guess it's the thunderstorm which comes with \n\t\tdawn. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tNo, it's something else.

He has seen us and he's \n\t\tfollowing us. He has overtaken us; he's coming \n\t\ttowards us. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tNot yet, Mia. In any case, not yet. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tI'm so afraid. I'm so afraid.\n\nThe wagon rattles over roots and stones; it sways and creaks. Now the horse \nstops with his ears flat against his head. The forest sighs and stirs \nponderously. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tGet into the wagon, Mia. Crawl in quickly. \n\t\tWe'll lie down, Mia, with Mikael between us.\n\nThey crawl into the wagon and crouch around the sleeping child.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tIt is the Angel of Death that's passing over \n\t\tus, Mia. It's the Angel of Death. The Angel of \n\t\tDeath, and he's very big.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tDo you feel how cold it is? I'm freezing. I'm \n\t\tterribly cold.\n\nShe shivers as if she had a fever. They pull the blankets over them and lie \nclosely together. The wagon canvas flutters and beats in the wind. The roar \noutside is like a giant bellowing.\n<b> \n</b>\n\nThe castle is silhouetted like a black boulder against the heavy dawn. Now\nthe storm moves there, throwing itself powerfully against walls and\nabutments.  The sky darkens; it is almost like night.\n\nAntonius Block has brought his companions with him to the castle. But it\nseems deserted. They walk from room to room. There is only emptiness and\nquiet echoes. Outside, the rain is heard roaring noisily.\n\nSuddenly the KNIGHT stands face to face with his wife. They look at each\nother quietly.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKARIN\n</b>\t\tI heard from people who came from the crusade \n\t\tthat you were on your way home. I've been \n\t\twaiting for you here. All the others have fled \n\t\tfrom the plague. \n\nThe KNIGHT is silent. He looks at her. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKARIN \n</b>\t\tDon't you recognize me any more? \n\nThe KNIGHT nods, silent. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKARIN \n</b>\t\tYou also have changed.\n\nShe walks closer and looks searchingly into his face. The smile lingers in \nher eyes and she touches his hand lightly.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKARIN \n</b>\t\tNow I can see that it's you. Somewhere in your \n\t\teyes, somewhere in your face, but hidden and \n\t\tfrightened, is that boy who went away so many \n\t\tyears ago. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tIt's over now and I'm a little tired. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKARIN \n</b>\t\tI see that you're tired. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tOver there stand my friends.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKARIN \n</b>\t\tAsk them in. They will break the fast with us. \n\nThey all sit down at the table in the room, which is lit by torches on the \nwalls. Silently they eat the hard bread and the salt-darkened meat. KARIN \nsits at the head of the table and reads aloud from a thick book. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKARIN \n</b>\t\t\"And when the Lamb broke the seventh seal, \n\t\tthere was silence in heaven for about the space \n\t\tof half an hour. And I saw the seven angels \n\t\twhich stood before God; and to them were given \n\t\tseven trumpets. And another ...\" \n\nThree mighty knocks sound on the large portal. KARIN interrupts her reading \nand looks up from the book. JONS rises quickly and goes to open the door.\n\n<b> \t\t\t\tKARIN \n</b>\t\t\"The first angel sounded, and there followed \n\t\thail and fire mingled with blood, and they were \n\t\tcast upon the earth; and the third part of the \n\t\ttrees was burnt up and all the green grass was \n\t\tburnt up.\"\n\nNow the rain becomes quiet. There is suddenly an immense, frightening silence \nin the large, murky room where the burning torches throw uneasy shadows over \nthe ceiling and the walls. Everyone listens tensely to the stillness.\n\n<b> \t\t\t\tKARIN \n</b>\t\t\"And the second angel sounded, and as it were a \n\t\tgreat mountain burning with fire was cast into \n\t\tthe sea; and a third part of the sea became \n\t\tblood ...\"\n\nSteps are heard on the stairs. JONS returns and sits down silently at his \nplace but does not continue to eat. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tWas someone there? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tNo, my lord. I saw no one.\n\nKARIN lifts her head for a moment but once again leans over the large book.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKARIN \n</b>\t\t\"And the third angel sounded, and there fell a \n\t\tgreat star from heaven, burning as it were a \n\t\ttorch, and it fell upon the third part of the \n\t\trivers and upon the fountains of waters; and \n\t\tthe name of the star is called Wormwood ...\" \n\nThey all lift their heads, and when they see who is coming towards them\nthrough the twilight of the large room, they rise from the table and stand \nclose together. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tGood morning, noble lord.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKARIN \n</b>\t\tI am Karin, the knight's wife, and welcome you \n\t\tcourteously to my house.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\tI am a smith by profession and rather good at \n\t\tmy trade, if I say so myself.

The wagon stands on a height above a \nslope, protected by an enormous tree. They look across ridges, forests, the \nwide plains, and the sea, which glistens in the sunlight breaking through the \nclouds.\n<b> \n</b>JOF stretches his arms and legs. MIA dries the wagon seat and sits down next\nto her husband. MIKAEL crawls between JOF'S knees.\n\nA lone bird tests its voice after the storm. The trees and bushes drip. From \nthe sea comes a strong and fragrant wind.\n\nJOF points to the dark, retreating sky where summer lightning glitters like \nsilver needles over the horizon. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tI see them, Mia!

And Death, the severe master, \n\t\tinvites them to dance. He tells them to hold \n\t\teach other's hands and then they must tread the \n\t\tdance in a long row. And first goes the master \n\t\twith his scythe and hourglass, but Skat dangles \n\t\tat the end with his lyre. They dance away from \n\t\tthe dawn and it's a solemn dance towards the \n\t\tdark lands, while the rain washes their faces \n\t\tand cleans the salt of the tears from their \n\t\tcheeks. \n\nHe is silent. He lowers his hand. His son, MIKAEL, has listened to his words.\nNow, he crawls up to MIA and sits down in her lap. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\t\t(smiling) \n\t\tYou with your visions and dreams.\n<b> \n</b>\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScreenplay by Ingmar Bergman \n<b> \n</b>", "answers": ["Lisa, the blacksmith's wife."], "length": 18054, "dataset": "narrativeqa", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "9fbcbb5460066a68460ba92626c25371e0a1ff65b3bd5e84"}

I won’t pretend to have\ntaken his vast measure on that first occasion, but I think I had achieved\na glimpse of what the privilege of his acquaintance might mean for many\npersons in the way of charges accepted.  He had been a great experience,\nand it was this perhaps that had put me into the frame of foreseeing how\nwe should all, sooner or later, have the honour of dealing with him as a\nwhole.  Whatever impression I then received of the amount of this total,\nI had a full enough vision of the patience of the Mulvilles.  He was to\nstay all the winter: Adelaide dropped it in a tone that drew the sting\nfrom the inevitable emphasis.  These excellent people might indeed have\nbeen content to give the circle of hospitality a diameter of six months;\nbut if they didn’t say he was to stay all summer as well it was only\nbecause this was more than they ventured to hope.  I remember that at\ndinner that evening he wore slippers, new and predominantly purple, of\nsome queer carpet-stuff; but the Mulvilles were still in the stage of\nsupposing that he might be snatched from them by higher bidders.  At a\nlater time they grew, poor dears, to fear no snatching; but theirs was a\nfidelity which needed no help from competition to make them proud.\nWonderful indeed as, when all was said, you inevitably pronounced Frank\nSaltram, it was not to be overlooked that the Kent Mulvilles were in\ntheir way still more extraordinary: as striking an instance as could\neasily be encountered of the familiar truth that remarkable men find\nremarkable conveniences.\n\nThey had sent for me from Wimbledon to come out and dine, and there had\nbeen an implication in Adelaide’s note—judged by her notes alone she\nmight have been thought silly—that it was a case in which something\nmomentous was to be determined or done.  I had never known them not be in\na “state” about somebody, and I dare say I tried to be droll on this\npoint in accepting their invitation.  On finding myself in the presence\nof their latest discovery I had not at first felt irreverence droop—and,\nthank heaven, I have never been absolutely deprived of that alternative\nin Mr. Saltram’s company.  I saw, however—I hasten to declare it—that\ncompared to this specimen their other phoenixes had been birds of\ninconsiderable feather, and I afterwards took credit to myself for not\nhaving even in primal bewilderments made a mistake about the essence of\nthe man.  He had an incomparable gift; I never was blind to it—it dazzles\nme still.  It dazzles me perhaps even more in remembrance than in fact,\nfor I’m not unaware that for so rare a subject the imagination goes to\nsome expense, inserting a jewel here and there or giving a twist to a\nplume.  How the art of portraiture would rejoice in this figure if the\nart of portraiture had only the canvas!  Nature, in truth, had largely\nrounded it, and if memory, hovering about it, sometimes holds her breath,\nthis is because the voice that comes back was really golden.\n\nThough the great man was an inmate and didn’t dress, he kept dinner on\nthis occasion waiting, and the first words he uttered on coming into the\nroom were an elated announcement to Mulville that he had found out\nsomething.  Not catching the allusion and gaping doubtless a little at\nhis face, I privately asked Adelaide what he had found out.  I shall\nnever forget the look she gave me as she replied: “Everything!”  She\nreally believed it.  At that moment, at any rate, he had found out that\nthe mercy of the Mulvilles was infinite.  He had previously of course\ndiscovered, as I had myself for that matter, that their dinners were\nsoignés.  Let me not indeed, in saying this, neglect to declare that I\nshall falsify my counterfeit if I seem to hint that there was in his\nnature any ounce of calculation.  He took whatever came, but he never\nplotted for it, and no man who was so much of an absorbent can ever have\nbeen so little of a parasite.  He had a system of the universe, but he\nhad no system of sponging—that was quite hand-to-mouth.  He had fine\ngross easy senses, but it was not his good-natured appetite that wrought\nconfusion.  If he had loved us for our dinners we could have paid with\nour dinners, and it would have been a great economy of finer matter.  I\nmake free in these connexions with the plural possessive because if I was\nnever able to do what the Mulvilles did, and people with still bigger\nhouses and simpler charities, I met, first and last, every demand of\nreflexion, of emotion—particularly perhaps those of gratitude and of\nresentment.  No one, I think, paid the tribute of giving him up so often,\nand if it’s rendering honour to borrow wisdom I’ve a right to talk of my\nsacrifices.  He yielded lessons as the sea yields fish—I lived for a\nwhile on this diet.  Sometimes it almost appeared to me that his massive\nmonstrous failure—if failure after all it was—had been designed for my\nprivate recreation.  He fairly pampered my curiosity; but the history of\nthat experience would take me too far.  This is not the large canvas I\njust now spoke of, and I wouldn’t have approached him with my present\nhand had it been a question of all the features.  Frank Saltram’s\nfeatures, for artistic purposes, are verily the anecdotes that are to be\ngathered.  Their name is legion, and this is only one, of which the\ninterest is that it concerns even more closely several other persons.\nSuch episodes, as one looks back, are the little dramas that made up the\ninnumerable facets of the big drama—which is yet to be reported.\n\n\n\n\nII\n\n\nIT is furthermore remarkable that though the two stories are distinct—my\nown, as it were, and this other—they equally began, in a manner, the\nfirst night of my acquaintance with Frank Saltram, the night I came back\nfrom Wimbledon so agitated with a new sense of life that, in London, for\nthe very thrill of it, I could only walk home.  Walking and swinging my\nstick, I overtook, at Buckingham Gate, George Gravener, and George\nGravener’s story may be said to have begun with my making him, as our\npaths lay together, come home with me for a talk.  I duly remember, let\nme parenthesise, that it was still more that of another person, and also\nthat several years were to elapse before it was to extend to a second\nchapter.  I had much to say to him, none the less, about my visit to the\nMulvilles, whom he more indifferently knew, and I was at any rate so\namusing that for long afterwards he never encountered me without asking\nfor news of the old man of the sea.  I hadn’t said Mr. Saltram was old,\nand it was to be seen that he was of an age to outweather George\nGravener.  I had at that time a lodging in Ebury Street, and Gravener was\nstaying at his brother’s empty house in Eaton Square.  At Cambridge, five\nyears before, even in our devastating set, his intellectual power had\nseemed to me almost awful.  Some one had once asked me privately, with\nblanched cheeks, what it was then that after all such a mind as that left\nstanding.  “It leaves itself!” I could recollect devoutly replying.  I\ncould smile at present for this remembrance, since before we got to Ebury\nStreet I was struck with the fact that, save in the sense of being well\nset up on his legs, George Gravener had actually ceased to tower.  The\nuniverse he laid low had somehow bloomed again—the usual eminences were\nvisible.  I wondered whether he had lost his humour, or only, dreadful\nthought, had never had any—not even when I had fancied him most\nAristophanesque.  What was the need of appealing to laughter, however, I\ncould enviously enquire, where you might appeal so confidently to\nmeasurement?  Mr. Saltram’s queer figure, his thick nose and hanging lip,\nwere fresh to me: in the light of my old friend’s fine cold symmetry they\npresented mere success in amusing as the refuge of conscious ugliness.\nAlready, at hungry twenty-six, Gravener looked as blank and parliamentary\nas if he were fifty and popular.  In my scrap of a residence—he had a\nworldling’s eye for its futile conveniences, but never a comrade’s joke—I\nsounded Frank Saltram in his ears; a circumstance I mention in order to\nnote that even then I was surprised at his impatience of my enlivenment.\nAs he had never before heard of the personage it took indeed the form of\nimpatience of the preposterous Mulvilles, his relation to whom, like\nmine, had had its origin in an early, a childish intimacy with the young\nAdelaide, the fruit of multiplied ties in the previous generation.  When\nshe married Kent Mulville, who was older than Gravener and I and much\nmore amiable, I gained a friend, but Gravener practically lost one.  We\nreacted in different ways from the form taken by what he called their\ndeplorable social action—the form (the term was also his) of nasty\nsecond-rate gush.  I may have held in my ‘for intérieur’ that the good\npeople at Wimbledon were beautiful fools, but when he sniffed at them I\ncouldn’t help taking the opposite line, for I already felt that even\nshould we happen to agree it would always be for reasons that differed.\nIt came home to me that he was admirably British as, without so much as a\nsociable sneer at my bookbinder, he turned away from the serried rows of\nmy little French library.\n\n“Of course I’ve never seen the fellow, but it’s clear enough he’s a\nhumbug.”\n\n“Clear ‘enough’ is just what it isn’t,” I replied; “if it only were!”\nThat ejaculation on my part must have been the beginning of what was to\nbe later a long ache for final frivolous rest.  Gravener was profound\nenough to remark after a moment that in the first place he couldn’t be\nanything but a Dissenter, and when I answered that the very note of his\nfascination was his extraordinary speculative breadth my friend retorted\nthat there was no cad like your cultivated cad, and that I might depend\nupon discovering—since I had had the levity not already to have\nenquired—that my shining light proceeded, a generation back, from a\nMethodist cheesemonger.  I confess I was struck with his insistence, and\nI said, after reflexion: “It may be—I admit it may be; but why on earth\nare you so sure?”—asking the question mainly to lay him the trap of\nsaying that it was because the poor man didn’t dress for dinner.  He took\nan instant to circumvent my trap and come blandly out the other side.\n\n“Because the Kent Mulvilles have invented him.  They’ve an infallible\nhand for frauds.  All their geese are swans.  They were born to be duped,\nthey like it, they cry for it, they don’t know anything from anything,\nand they disgust one—luckily perhaps!—with Christian charity.”  His\nvehemence was doubtless an accident, but it might have been a strange\nforeknowledge.  I forget what protest I dropped; it was at any rate\nsomething that led him to go on after a moment: “I only ask one\nthing—it’s perfectly simple.  Is a man, in a given case, a real\ngentleman?”\n\n“A real gentleman, my dear fellow—that’s so soon said!”\n\n“Not so soon when he isn’t!  If they’ve got hold of one this time he must\nbe a great rascal!”\n\n“I might feel injured,” I answered, “if I didn’t reflect that they don’t\nrave about me.”\n\n“Don’t be too sure!  I’ll grant that he’s a gentleman,” Gravener\npresently added, “if you’ll admit that he’s a scamp.”\n\n“I don’t know which to admire most, your logic or your benevolence.”\n\nMy friend coloured at this, but he didn’t change the subject.  “Where did\nthey pick him up?”\n\n“I think they were struck with something he had published.”\n\n“I can fancy the dreary thing!”\n\n“I believe they found out he had all sorts of worries and difficulties.”\n\n“That of course wasn’t to be endured, so they jumped at the privilege of\npaying his debts!”  I professed that I knew nothing about his debts, and\nI reminded my visitor that though the dear Mulvilles were angels they\nwere neither idiots nor millionaires.  What they mainly aimed at was\nreuniting Mr. Saltram to his wife.  “I was expecting to hear he has\nbasely abandoned her,” Gravener went on, at this, “and I’m too glad you\ndon’t disappoint me.”\n\nI tried to recall exactly what Mrs. Mulville had told me.  “He didn’t\nleave her—no.  It’s she who has left him.”\n\n“Left him to us?” Gravener asked.  “The monster—many thanks!  I decline\nto take him.”\n\n“You’ll hear more about him in spite of yourself.  I can’t, no, I really\ncan’t resist the impression that he’s a big man.”  I was already\nmastering—to my shame perhaps be it said—just the tone my old friend\nleast liked.\n\n“It’s doubtless only a trifle,” he returned, “but you haven’t happened to\nmention what his reputation’s to rest on.”\n\n“Why on what I began by boring you with—his extraordinary mind.”\n\n“As exhibited in his writings?”\n\n“Possibly in his writings, but certainly in his talk, which is far and\naway the richest I ever listened to.”\n\n“And what’s it all about?”\n\n“My dear fellow, don’t ask me!  About everything!” I pursued, reminding\nmyself of poor Adelaide.  “About his ideas of things,” I then more\ncharitably added.  “You must have heard him to know what I mean—it’s\nunlike anything that ever was heard.”  I coloured, I admit, I overcharged\na little, for such a picture was an anticipation of Saltram’s later\ndevelopment and still more of my fuller acquaintance with him.  However,\nI really expressed, a little lyrically perhaps, my actual imagination of\nhim when I proceeded to declare that, in a cloud of tradition, of legend,\nhe might very well go down to posterity as the greatest of all great\ntalkers.  Before we parted George Gravener had wondered why such a row\nshould be made about a chatterbox the more and why he should be pampered\nand pensioned.  The greater the wind-bag the greater the calamity.  Out\nof proportion to everything else on earth had come to be this wagging of\nthe tongue.  We were drenched with talk—our wretched age was dying of it.\nI differed from him here sincerely, only going so far as to concede, and\ngladly, that we were drenched with sound.  It was not however the mere\nspeakers who were killing us—it was the mere stammerers.  Fine talk was\nas rare as it was refreshing—the gift of the gods themselves, the one\nstarry spangle on the ragged cloak of humanity.  How many men were there\nwho rose to this privilege, of how many masters of conversation could he\nboast the acquaintance?  Dying of talk?—why we were dying of the lack of\nit!  Bad writing wasn’t talk, as many people seemed to think, and even\ngood wasn’t always to be compared to it.  From the best talk indeed the\nbest writing had something to learn.  I fancifully added that we too\nshould peradventure be gilded by the legend, should be pointed at for\nhaving listened, for having actually heard.  Gravener, who had glanced at\nhis watch and discovered it was midnight, found to all this a retort\nbeautifully characteristic of him.\n\n“There’s one little fact to be borne in mind in the presence equally of\nthe best talk and of the worst.”  He looked, in saying this, as if he\nmeant great things, and I was sure he could only mean once more that\nneither of them mattered if a man wasn’t a real gentleman.  Perhaps it\nwas what he did mean; he deprived me however of the exultation of being\nright by putting the truth in a slightly different way.  “The only thing\nthat really counts for one’s estimate of a person is his conduct.”  He\nhad his watch still in his palm, and I reproached him with unfair play in\nhaving ascertained beforehand that it was now the hour at which I always\ngave in.  My pleasantry so far failed to mollify him that he promptly\nadded that to the rule he had just enunciated there was absolutely no\nexception.\n\n“None whatever?”\n\n“None whatever.”\n\n“Trust me then to try to be good at any price!” I laughed as I went with\nhim to the door.  “I declare I will be, if I have to be horrible!”\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\n\nIF that first night was one of the liveliest, or at any rate was the\nfreshest, of my exaltations, there was another, four years later, that\nwas one of my great discomposures.  Repetition, I well knew by this time,\nwas the secret of Saltram’s power to alienate, and of course one would\nnever have seen him at his finest if one hadn’t seen him in his remorses.\nThey set in mainly at this season and were magnificent, elemental,\norchestral.  I was quite aware that one of these atmospheric disturbances\nwas now due; but none the less, in our arduous attempt to set him on his\nfeet as a lecturer, it was impossible not to feel that two failures were\na large order, as we said, for a short course of five.  This was the\nsecond time, and it was past nine o’clock; the audience, a muster\nunprecedented and really encouraging, had fortunately the attitude of\nblandness that might have been looked for in persons whom the promise of\n(if I’m not mistaken) An Analysis of Primary Ideas had drawn to the\nneighbourhood of Upper Baker Street.  There was in those days in that\nregion a petty lecture-hall to be secured on terms as moderate as the\nfunds left at our disposal by the irrepressible question of the\nmaintenance of five small Saltrams—I include the mother—and one large\none.  By the time the Saltrams, of different sizes, were all maintained\nwe had pretty well poured out the oil that might have lubricated the\nmachinery for enabling the most original of men to appear to maintain\nthem.\n\nIt was I, the other time, who had been forced into the breach, standing\nup there for an odious lamplit moment to explain to half a dozen thin\nbenches, where earnest brows were virtuously void of anything so cynical\nas a suspicion, that we couldn’t so much as put a finger on Mr. Saltram.\nThere was nothing to plead but that our scouts had been out from the\nearly hours and that we were afraid that on one of his walks abroad—he\ntook one, for meditation, whenever he was to address such a company—some\naccident had disabled or delayed him.  The meditative walks were a\nfiction, for he never, that any one could discover, prepared anything but\na magnificent prospectus; hence his circulars and programmes, of which I\npossess an almost complete collection, are the solemn ghosts of\ngenerations never born.  I put the case, as it seemed to me, at the best;\nbut I admit I had been angry, and Kent Mulville was shocked at my want of\npublic optimism.  This time therefore I left the excuses to his more\npractised patience, only relieving myself in response to a direct appeal\nfrom a young lady next whom, in the hall, I found myself sitting.  My\nposition was an accident, but if it had been calculated the reason would\nscarce have eluded an observer of the fact that no one else in the room\nhad an approach to an appearance.  Our philosopher’s “tail” was\ndeplorably limp.  This visitor was the only person who looked at her\nease, who had come a little in the spirit of adventure.  She seemed to\ncarry amusement in her handsome young head, and her presence spoke, a\nlittle mystifyingly, of a sudden extension of Saltram’s sphere of\ninfluence.  He was doing better than we hoped, and he had chosen such an\noccasion, of all occasions, to succumb to heaven knew which of his fond\ninfirmities.  The young lady produced an impression of auburn hair and\nblack velvet, and had on her other hand a companion of obscurer type,\npresumably a waiting-maid.  She herself might perhaps have been a foreign\ncountess, and before she addressed me I had beguiled our sorry interval\nby finding in her a vague recall of the opening of some novel of Madame\nSand.  It didn’t make her more fathomable to pass in a few minutes from\nthis to the certitude that she was American; it simply engendered\ndepressing reflexions as to the possible check to contributions from\nBoston.  She asked me if, as a person apparently more initiated, I would\nrecommend further waiting, and I answered that if she considered I was on\nmy honour I would privately deprecate it.  Perhaps she didn’t; at any\nrate our talk took a turn that prolonged it till she became aware we were\nleft almost alone.  I presently ascertained she knew Mrs. Saltram, and\nthis explained in a manner the miracle.  The brotherhood of the friends\nof the husband was as nothing to the brotherhood, or perhaps I should say\nthe sisterhood, of the friends of the wife.  Like the Kent Mulvilles I\nbelonged to both fraternities, and even better than they I think I had\nsounded the abyss of Mrs. Saltram’s wrongs.  She bored me to extinction,\nand I knew but too well how she had bored her husband; but there were\nthose who stood by her, the most efficient of whom were indeed the\nhandful of poor Saltram’s backers.  They did her liberal justice, whereas\nher mere patrons and partisans had nothing but hatred for our\nphilosopher.  I’m bound to say it was we, however—we of both camps, as it\nwere—who had always done most for her.\n\nI thought my young lady looked rich—I scarcely knew why; and I hoped she\nhad put her hand in her pocket.  I soon made her out, however, not at all\na fine fanatic—she was but a generous, irresponsible enquirer.  She had\ncome to England to see her aunt, and it was at her aunt’s she had met the\ndreary lady we had all so much on our mind.  I saw she’d help to pass the\ntime when she observed that it was a pity this lady wasn’t intrinsically\nmore interesting.  That was refreshing, for it was an article of faith in\nMrs. Saltram’s circle—at least among those who scorned to know her horrid\nhusband—that she was attractive on her merits.  She was in truth a most\nordinary person, as Saltram himself would have been if he hadn’t been a\nprodigy.  The question of vulgarity had no application to him, but it was\na measure his wife kept challenging you to apply.  I hasten to add that\nthe consequences of your doing so were no sufficient reason for his\nhaving left her to starve.  “He doesn’t seem to have much force of\ncharacter,” said my young lady; at which I laughed out so loud that my\ndeparting friends looked back at me over their shoulders as if I were\nmaking a joke of their discomfiture.  My joke probably cost Saltram a\nsubscription or two, but it helped me on with my interlocutress.  “She\nsays he drinks like a fish,” she sociably continued, “and yet she allows\nthat his mind’s wonderfully clear.”  It was amusing to converse with a\npretty girl who could talk of the clearness of Saltram’s mind.  I\nexpected next to hear she had been assured he was awfully clever.  I\ntried to tell her—I had it almost on my conscience—what was the proper\nway to regard him; an effort attended perhaps more than ever on this\noccasion with the usual effect of my feeling that I wasn’t after all very\nsure of it.  She had come to-night out of high curiosity—she had wanted\nto learn this proper way for herself.  She had read some of his papers\nand hadn’t understood them; but it was at home, at her aunt’s, that her\ncuriosity had been kindled—kindled mainly by his wife’s remarkable\nstories of his want of virtue.  “I suppose they ought to have kept me\naway,” my companion dropped, “and I suppose they’d have done so if I\nhadn’t somehow got an idea that he’s fascinating.  In fact Mrs. Saltram\nherself says he is.”\n\n“So you came to see where the fascination resides?  Well, you’ve seen!”\n\nMy young lady raised fine eyebrows.  “Do you mean in his bad faith?”\n\n“In the extraordinary effects of it; his possession, that is, of some\nquality or other that condemns us in advance to forgive him the\nhumiliation, as I may call it, to which he has subjected us.”\n\n“The humiliation?”\n\n“Why mine, for instance, as one of his guarantors, before you as the\npurchaser of a ticket.”\n\nShe let her charming gay eyes rest on me.  “You don’t look humiliated a\nbit, and if you did I should let you off, disappointed as I am; for the\nmysterious quality you speak of is just the quality I came to see.”\n\n“Oh, you can’t ‘see’ it!” I cried.\n\n“How then do you get at it?”\n\n“You don’t!  You mustn’t suppose he’s good-looking,” I added.\n\n“Why his wife says he’s lovely!”\n\nMy hilarity may have struck her as excessive, but I confess it broke out\nafresh.  Had she acted only in obedience to this singular plea, so\ncharacteristic, on Mrs. Saltram’s part, of what was irritating in the\nnarrowness of that lady’s point of view?  “Mrs. Saltram,” I explained,\n“undervalues him where he’s strongest, so that, to make up for it\nperhaps, she overpraises him where he’s weak.  He’s not, assuredly,\nsuperficially attractive; he’s middle-aged, fat, featureless save for his\ngreat eyes.”\n\n“Yes, his great eyes,” said my young lady attentively.  She had evidently\nheard all about his great eyes—the beaux yeux for which alone we had\nreally done it all.\n\n“They’re tragic and splendid—lights on a dangerous coast.  But he moves\nbadly and dresses worse, and altogether he’s anything but smart.”\n\nMy companion, who appeared to reflect on this, after a moment appealed.\n“Do you call him a real gentleman?”\n\nI started slightly at the question, for I had a sense of recognising it:\nGeorge Gravener, years before, that first flushed night, had put me face\nto face with it.  It had embarrassed me then, but it didn’t embarrass me\nnow, for I had lived with it and overcome it and disposed of it.  “A real\ngentleman?  Emphatically not!”\n\nMy promptitude surprised her a little, but I quickly felt how little it\nwas to Gravener I was now talking.  “Do you say that because he’s—what do\nyou call it in England?—of humble extraction?”\n\n“Not a bit.  His father was a country school-master and his mother the\nwidow of a sexton, but that has nothing to do with it.  I say it simply\nbecause I know him well.”\n\n“But isn’t it an awful drawback?”\n\n“Awful—quite awful.”\n\n“I mean isn’t it positively fatal?”\n\n“Fatal to what?  Not to his magnificent vitality.”\n\nAgain she had a meditative moment.  “And is his magnificent vitality the\ncause of his vices?”\n\n“Your questions are formidable, but I’m glad you put them.  I was\nthinking of his noble intellect.  His vices, as you say, have been much\nexaggerated: they consist mainly after all in one comprehensive defect.”\n\n“A want of will?”\n\n“A want of dignity.”\n\n“He doesn’t recognise his obligations?”\n\n“On the contrary, he recognises them with effusion, especially in public:\nhe smiles and bows and beckons across the street to them.  But when they\npass over he turns away, and he speedily loses them in the crowd.  The\nrecognition’s purely spiritual—it isn’t in the least social.  So he\nleaves all his belongings to other people to take care of.  He accepts\nfavours, loans, sacrifices—all with nothing more deterrent than an agony\nof shame.  Fortunately we’re a little faithful band, and we do what we\ncan.”  I held my tongue about the natural children, engendered, to the\nnumber of three, in the wantonness of his youth.  I only remarked that he\ndid make efforts—often tremendous ones.  “But the efforts,” I said,\n“never come to much: the only things that come to much are the\nabandonments, the surrenders.”\n\n“And how much do they come to?”\n\n“You’re right to put it as if we had a big bill to pay, but, as I’ve told\nyou before, your questions are rather terrible.  They come, these mere\nexercises of genius, to a great sum total of poetry, of philosophy, a\nmighty mass of speculation, notation, quotation.  The genius is there,\nyou see, to meet the surrender; but there’s no genius to support the\ndefence.”\n\n“But what is there, after all, at his age, to show?”\n\n“In the way of achievement recognised and reputation established?” I\nasked.  “To ‘show’ if you will, there isn’t much, since his writing,\nmostly, isn’t as fine, isn’t certainly as showy, as his talk.  Moreover\ntwo-thirds of his work are merely colossal projects and announcements.\n‘Showing’ Frank Saltram is often a poor business,” I went on: “we\nendeavoured, you’ll have observed, to show him to-night!  However, if he\nhad lectured he’d have lectured divinely.  It would just have been his\ntalk.”\n\n“And what would his talk just have been?”\n\nI was conscious of some ineffectiveness, as well perhaps as of a little\nimpatience, as I replied: “The exhibition of a splendid intellect.”  My\nyoung lady looked not quite satisfied at this, but as I wasn’t prepared\nfor another question I hastily pursued: “The sight of a great suspended\nswinging crystal—huge lucid lustrous, a block of light—flashing back\nevery impression of life and every possibility of thought!”\n\nThis gave her something to turn over till we had passed out to the dusky\nporch of the hall, in front of which the lamps of a quiet brougham were\nalmost the only thing Saltram’s treachery hadn’t extinguished.  I went\nwith her to the door of her carriage, out of which she leaned a moment\nafter she had thanked me and taken her seat.  Her smile even in the\ndarkness was pretty.  “I do want to see that crystal!”\n\n“You’ve only to come to the next lecture.”\n\n“I go abroad in a day or two with my aunt.”\n\n“Wait over till next week,” I suggested.  “It’s quite worth it.”\n\nShe became grave.  “Not unless he really comes!”  At which the brougham\nstarted off, carrying her away too fast, fortunately for my manners, to\nallow me to exclaim “Ingratitude!”\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\n\nMRS. SALTRAM made a great affair of her right to be informed where her\nhusband had been the second evening he failed to meet his audience.  She\ncame to me to ascertain, but I couldn’t satisfy her, for in spite of my\ningenuity I remained in ignorance.  It wasn’t till much later that I\nfound this had not been the case with Kent Mulville, whose hope for the\nbest never twirled the thumbs of him more placidly than when he happened\nto know the worst.  He had known it on the occasion I speak of—that is\nimmediately after.  He was impenetrable then, but ultimately confessed.\nWhat he confessed was more than I shall now venture to make public.  It\nwas of course familiar to me that Saltram was incapable of keeping the\nengagements which, after their separation, he had entered into with\nregard to his wife, a deeply wronged, justly resentful, quite\nirreproachable and insufferable person.  She often appeared at my\nchambers to talk over his lapses; for if, as she declared, she had washed\nher hands of him, she had carefully preserved the water of this ablution,\nwhich she handed about for analysis.  She had arts of her own of exciting\none’s impatience, the most infallible of which was perhaps her assumption\nthat we were kind to her because we liked her.  In reality her personal\nfall had been a sort of social rise—since I had seen the moment when, in\nour little conscientious circle, her desolation almost made her the\nfashion.  Her voice was grating and her children ugly; moreover she hated\nthe good Mulvilles, whom I more and more loved.  They were the people who\nby doing most for her husband had in the long run done most for herself;\nand the warm confidence with which he had laid his length upon them was a\npressure gentle compared with her stiffer persuadability.  I’m bound to\nsay he didn’t criticise his benefactors, though practically he got tired\nof them; she, however, had the highest standards about eleemosynary\nforms.  She offered the odd spectacle of a spirit puffed up by\ndependence, and indeed it had introduced her to some excellent society.\nShe pitied me for not knowing certain people who aided her and whom she\ndoubtless patronised in turn for their luck in not knowing me.  I dare\nsay I should have got on with her better if she had had a ray of\nimagination—if it had occasionally seemed to occur to her to regard\nSaltram’s expressions of his nature in any other manner than as separate\nsubjects of woe.  They were all flowers of his character, pearls strung\non an endless thread; but she had a stubborn little way of challenging\nthem one after the other, as if she never suspected that he had a\ncharacter, such as it was, or that deficiencies might be organic; the\nirritating effect of a mind incapable of a generalisation.  One might\ndoubtless have overdone the idea that there was a general licence for\nsuch a man; but if this had happened it would have been through one’s\nfeeling that there could be none for such a woman.\n\nI recognised her superiority when I asked her about the aunt of the\ndisappointed young lady: it sounded like a sentence from an\nEnglish-French or other phrase-book.  She triumphed in what she told me\nand she may have triumphed still more in what she withheld.  My friend of\nthe other evening, Miss Anvoy, had but lately come to England; Lady\nCoxon, the aunt, had been established here for years in consequence of\nher marriage with the late Sir Gregory of that name.  She had a house in\nthe Regent’s Park, a Bath-chair and a fernery; and above all she had\nsympathy.  Mrs. Saltram had made her acquaintance through mutual friends.\nThis vagueness caused me to feel how much I was out of it and how large\nan independent circle Mrs. Saltram had at her command.  I should have\nbeen glad to know more about the disappointed young lady, but I felt I\nshould know most by not depriving her of her advantage, as she might have\nmysterious means of depriving me of my knowledge.  For the present,\nmoreover, this experience was stayed, Lady Coxon having in fact gone\nabroad accompanied by her niece.  The niece, besides being immensely\nclever, was an heiress, Mrs. Saltram said; the only daughter and the\nlight of the eyes of some great American merchant, a man, over there, of\nendless indulgences and dollars.  She had pretty clothes and pretty\nmanners, and she had, what was prettier still, the great thing of all.\nThe great thing of all for Mrs. Saltram was always sympathy, and she\nspoke as if during the absence of these ladies she mightn’t know where to\nturn for it.  A few months later indeed, when they had come back, her\ntone perceptibly changed: she alluded to them, on my leading her up to\nit, rather as to persons in her debt for favours received.  What had\nhappened I didn’t know, but I saw it would take only a little more or a\nlittle less to make her speak of them as thankless subjects of social\ncountenance—people for whom she had vainly tried to do something.  I\nconfess I saw how it wouldn’t be in a mere week or two that I should rid\nmyself of the image of Ruth Anvoy, in whose very name, when I learnt it,\nI found something secretly to like.  I should probably neither see her\nnor hear of her again: the knight’s widow (he had been mayor of\nClockborough) would pass away and the heiress would return to her\ninheritance.  I gathered with surprise that she had not communicated to\nhis wife the story of her attempt to hear Mr..Saltram, and I founded this\nreticence on the easy supposition that Mrs. Saltram had fatigued by\noverpressure the spring of the sympathy of which she boasted.  The girl\nat any rate would forget the small adventure, be distracted, take a\nhusband; besides which she would lack occasion to repeat her experiment.\n\nWe clung to the idea of the brilliant course, delivered without an\naccident, that, as a lecturer, would still make the paying public aware\nof our great man, but the fact remained that in the case of an\ninspiration so unequal there was treachery, there was fallacy at least,\nin the very conception of a series.  In our scrutiny of ways and means we\nwere inevitably subject to the old convention of the synopsis, the\nsyllabus, partly of course not to lose the advantage of his grand free\nhand in drawing up such things; but for myself I laughed at our playbills\neven while I stickled for them.  It was indeed amusing work to be\nscrupulous for Frank Saltram, who also at moments laughed about it, so\nfar as the comfort of a sigh so unstudied as to be cheerful might pass\nfor such a sound.  He admitted with a candour all his own that he was in\ntruth only to be depended on in the Mulvilles’ drawing-room.  “Yes,” he\nsuggestively allowed, “it’s there, I think, that I’m at my best; quite\nlate, when it gets toward eleven—and if I’ve not been too much worried.”\nWe all knew what too much worry meant; it meant too enslaved for the hour\nto the superstition of sobriety.  On the Saturdays I used to bring my\nportmanteau, so as not to have to think of eleven o’clock trains.  I had\na bold theory that as regards this temple of talk and its altars of\ncushioned chintz, its pictures and its flowers, its large fireside and\nclear lamplight, we might really arrive at something if the Mulvilles\nwould but charge for admission.  Here it was, however, that they\nshamelessly broke down; as there’s a flaw in every perfection this was\nthe inexpugnable refuge of their egotism.  They declined to make their\nsaloon a market, so that Saltram’s golden words continued the sole coin\nthat rang there.  It can have happened to no man, however, to be paid a\ngreater price than such an enchanted hush as surrounded him on his\ngreatest nights.  The most profane, on these occasions, felt a presence;\nall minor eloquence grew dumb.  Adelaide Mulville, for the pride of her\nhospitality, anxiously watched the door or stealthily poked the fire.  I\nused to call it the music-room, for we had anticipated Bayreuth.  The\nvery gates of the kingdom of light seemed to open and the horizon of\nthought to flash with the beauty of a sunrise at sea.\n\nIn the consideration of ways and means, the sittings of our little board,\nwe were always conscious of the creak of Mrs. Saltram’s shoes.  She\nhovered, she interrupted, she almost presided, the state of affairs being\nmostly such as to supply her with every incentive for enquiring what was\nto be done next.  It was the pressing pursuit of this knowledge that, in\nconcatenations of omnibuses and usually in very wet weather, led her so\noften to my door.  She thought us spiritless creatures with editors and\npublishers; but she carried matters to no great effect when she\npersonally pushed into back-shops.  She wanted all moneys to be paid to\nherself: they were otherwise liable to such strange adventures.  They\ntrickled away into the desert—they were mainly at best, alas, a slender\nstream.  The editors and the publishers were the last people to take this\nremarkable thinker at the valuation that has now pretty well come to be\nestablished.  The former were half-distraught between the desire to “cut”\nhim and the difficulty of finding a crevice for their shears; and when a\nvolume on this or that portentous subject was proposed to the latter they\nsuggested alternative titles which, as reported to our friend, brought\ninto his face the noble blank melancholy that sometimes made it handsome.\nThe title of an unwritten book didn’t after all much matter, but some\nmasterpiece of Saltram’s may have died in his bosom of the shudder with\nwhich it was then convulsed.  The ideal solution, failing the fee at Kent\nMulville’s door, would have been some system of subscription to projected\ntreatises with their non-appearance provided for—provided for, I mean, by\nthe indulgence of subscribers.  The author’s real misfortune was that\nsubscribers were so wretchedly literal.  When they tastelessly enquired\nwhy publication hadn’t ensued I was tempted to ask who in the world had\never been so published.  Nature herself had brought him out in voluminous\nform, and the money was simply a deposit on borrowing the work.\n\n\n\n\nV\n\n\nI WAS doubtless often a nuisance to my friends in those years; but there\nwere sacrifices I declined to make, and I never passed the hat to George\nGravener.  I never forgot our little discussion in Ebury Street, and I\nthink it stuck in my throat to have to treat him to the avowal I had\nfound so easy to Mss Anvoy.  It had cost me nothing to confide to this\ncharming girl, but it would have cost me much to confide to the friend of\nmy youth, that the character of the “real gentleman” wasn’t an attribute\nof the man I took such pains for.  Was this because I had already\ngeneralised to the point of perceiving that women are really the\nunfastidious sex?  I knew at any rate that Gravener, already quite in\nview but still hungry and frugal, had naturally enough more ambition than\ncharity.  He had sharp aims for stray sovereigns, being in view most from\nthe tall steeple of Clockborough.  His immediate ambition was to occupy à\nlui seul the field of vision of that smokily-seeing city, and all his\nmovements and postures were calculated for the favouring angle.  The\nmovement of the hand as to the pocket had thus to alternate gracefully\nwith the posture of the hand on the heart.  He talked to Clockborough in\nshort only less beguilingly than Frank Saltram talked to his electors;\nwith the difference to our credit, however, that we had already voted and\nthat our candidate had no antagonist but himself.  He had more than once\nbeen at Wimbledon—it was Mrs. Mulville’s work not mine—and by the time\nthe claret was served had seen the god descend.  He took more pains to\nswing his censer than I had expected, but on our way back to town he\nforestalled any little triumph I might have been so artless as to express\nby the observation that such a man was—a hundred times!—a man to use and\nnever a man to be used by.  I remember that this neat remark humiliated\nme almost as much as if virtually, in the fever of broken slumbers, I\nhadn’t often made it myself.  The difference was that on Gravener’s part\na force attached to it that could never attach to it on mine.  He was\nable to use people—he had the machinery; and the irony of Saltram’s being\nmade showy at Clockborough came out to me when he said, as if he had no\nmemory of our original talk and the idea were quite fresh to him: “I hate\nhis type, you know, but I’ll be hanged if I don’t put some of those\nthings in.  I can find a place for them: we might even find a place for\nthe fellow himself.”  I myself should have had some fear—not, I need\nscarcely say, for the “things” themselves, but for some other things very\nnear them; in fine for the rest of my eloquence.\n\nLater on I could see that the oracle of Wimbledon was not in this case so\nappropriate as he would have been had the polities of the gods only\ncoincided more exactly with those of the party.  There was a distinct\nmoment when, without saying anything more definite to me, Gravener\nentertained the idea of annexing Mr. Saltram.  Such a project was\ndelusive, for the discovery of analogies between his body of doctrine and\nthat pressed from headquarters upon Clockborough—the bottling, in a word,\nof the air of those lungs for convenient public uncorking in\ncorn-exchanges—was an experiment for which no one had the leisure.  The\nonly thing would have been to carry him massively about, paid, caged,\nclipped; to turn him on for a particular occasion in a particular\nchannel.  Frank Saltram’s channel, however, was essentially not\ncalculable, and there was no knowing what disastrous floods might have\nensued.  For what there would have been to do The Empire, the great\nnewspaper, was there to look to; but it was no new misfortune that there\nwere delicate situations in which The Empire broke down.  In fine there\nwas an instinctive apprehension that a clever young journalist\ncommissioned to report on Mr. Saltram might never come back from the\nerrand.  No one knew better than George Gravener that that was a time\nwhen prompt returns counted double.  If he therefore found our friend an\nexasperating waste of orthodoxy it was because of his being, as he said,\npoor Gravener, up in the clouds, not because he was down in the dust.\nThe man would have been, just as he was, a real enough gentleman if he\ncould have helped to put in a real gentleman.  Gravener’s great objection\nto the actual member was that he was not one.\n\nLady Coxon had a fine old house, a house with “grounds,” at Clockborough,\nwhich she had let; but after she returned from abroad I learned from Mrs.\nSaltram that the lease had fallen in and that she had gone down to resume\npossession.  I could see the faded red livery, the big square shoulders,\nthe high-walled garden of this decent abode.  As the rumble of\ndissolution grew louder the suitor would have pressed his suit, and I\nfound myself hoping the politics of the late Mayor’s widow wouldn’t be\nsuch as to admonish her to ask him to dinner; perhaps indeed I went so\nfar as to pray, they would naturally form a bar to any contact.  I tried\nto focus the many-buttoned page, in the daily airing, as he perhaps even\npushed the Bath-chair over somebody’s toes.  I was destined to hear, none\nthe less, through Mrs. Saltram—who, I afterwards learned, was in\ncorrespondence with Lady Coxon’s housekeeper—that Gravener was known to\nhave spoken of the habitation I had in my eye as the pleasantest thing at\nClockborough.  On his part, I was sure, this was the voice not of envy\nbut of experience.  The vivid scene was now peopled, and I could see him\nin the old-time garden with Miss Anvoy, who would be certain, and very\njustly, to think him good-looking.  It would be too much to describe\nmyself as troubled by this play of surmise; but I occur to remember the\nrelief, singular enough, of feeling it suddenly brushed away by an\nannoyance really much greater; an annoyance the result of its happening\nto come over me about that time with a rush that I was simply ashamed of\nFrank Saltram.  There were limits after all, and my mark at last had been\nreached.\n\nI had had my disgusts, if I may allow myself to-day such an expression;\nbut this was a supreme revolt.  Certain things cleared up in my mind,\ncertain values stood out.  It was all very well to have an unfortunate\ntemperament; there was nothing so unfortunate as to have, for practical\npurposes, nothing else.  I avoided George Gravener at this moment and\nreflected that at such a time I should do so most effectually by leaving\nEngland.  I wanted to forget Frank Saltram—that was all.  I didn’t want\nto do anything in the world to him but that.  Indignation had withered on\nthe stalk, and I felt that one could pity him as much as one ought only\nby never thinking of him again.  It wasn’t for anything he had done to\nme; it was for what he had done to the Mulvilles.  Adelaide cried about\nit for a week, and her husband, profiting by the example so signally\ngiven him of the fatal effect of a want of character, left the letter,\nthe drop too much, unanswered.  The letter, an incredible one, addressed\nby Saltram to Wimbledon during a stay with the Pudneys at Ramsgate, was\nthe central feature of the incident, which, however, had many features,\neach more painful than whichever other we compared it with.  The Pudneys\nhad behaved shockingly, but that was no excuse.  Base ingratitude, gross\nindecency—one had one’s choice only of such formulas as that the more\nthey fitted the less they gave one rest.  These are dead aches now, and I\nam under no obligation, thank heaven, to be definite about the business.\nThere are things which if I had had to tell them—well, would have stopped\nme off here altogether.\n\nI went abroad for the general election, and if I don’t know how much, on\nthe Continent, I forgot, I at least know how much I missed, him.  At a\ndistance, in a foreign land, ignoring, abjuring, unlearning him, I\ndiscovered what he had done for me.  I owed him, oh unmistakeably,\ncertain noble conceptions; I had lighted my little taper at his smoky\nlamp, and lo it continued to twinkle.  But the light it gave me just\nshowed me how much more I wanted.  I was pursued of course by letters\nfrom Mrs. Saltram which I didn’t scruple not to read, though quite aware\nher embarrassments couldn’t but be now of the gravest.  I sacrificed to\npropriety by simply putting them away, and this is how, one day as my\nabsence drew to an end, my eye, while I rummaged in my desk for another\npaper, was caught by a name on a leaf that had detached itself from the\npacket.  The allusion was to Miss Anvoy, who, it appeared, was engaged to\nbe married to Mr. George Gravener; and the news was two months old.  A\ndirect question of Mrs. Saltram’s had thus remained unanswered—she had\nenquired of me in a postscript what sort of man this aspirant to such a\nhand might be.  The great other fact about him just then was that he had\nbeen triumphantly returned for Clockborough in the interest of the party\nthat had swept the country—so that I might easily have referred Mrs.\nSaltram to the journals of the day.  Yet when I at last wrote her that I\nwas coming home and would discharge my accumulated burden by seeing her,\nI but remarked in regard to her question that she must really put it to\nMiss Anvoy.\n\n\n\n\nVI\n\n\nI HAD almost avoided the general election, but some of its consequences,\non my return, had smartly to be faced.  The season, in London, began to\nbreathe again and to flap its folded wings.  Confidence, under the new\nMinistry, was understood to be reviving, and one of the symptoms, in a\nsocial body, was a recovery of appetite.  People once more fed together,\nand it happened that, one Saturday night, at somebody’s house, I fed with\nGeorge Gravener.  When the ladies left the room I moved up to where he\nsat and begged to congratulate him.  “On my election?” he asked after a\nmoment; so that I could feign, jocosely, not to have heard of that\ntriumph and to be alluding to the rumour of a victory still more\npersonal.  I dare say I coloured however, for his political success had\nmomentarily passed out of my mind.  What was present to it was that he\nwas to marry that beautiful girl; and yet his question made me conscious\nof some discomposure—I hadn’t intended to put this before everything.  He\nhimself indeed ought gracefully to have done so, and I remember thinking\nthe whole man was in this assumption that in expressing my sense of what\nhe had won I had fixed my thoughts on his “seat.”  We straightened the\nmatter out, and he was so much lighter in hand than I had lately seen him\nthat his spirits might well have been fed from a twofold source.  He was\nso good as to say that he hoped I should soon make the acquaintance of\nMiss Anvoy, who, with her aunt, was presently coming up to town.  Lady\nCoxon, in the country, had been seriously unwell, and this had delayed\ntheir arrival.  I told him I had heard the marriage would be a splendid\none; on which, brightened and humanised by his luck, he laughed and said\n“Do you mean for her?”  When I had again explained what I meant he went\non: “Oh she’s an American, but you’d scarcely know it; unless, perhaps,”\nhe added, “by her being used to more money than most girls in England,\neven the daughters of rich men.  That wouldn’t in the least do for a\nfellow like me, you know, if it wasn’t for the great liberality of her\nfather.  He really has been most kind, and everything’s quite\nsatisfactory.”  He added that his eldest brother had taken a tremendous\nfancy to her and that during a recent visit at Coldfield she had nearly\nwon over Lady Maddock.  I gathered from something he dropped later on\nthat the free-handed gentleman beyond the seas had not made a settlement,\nbut had given a handsome present and was apparently to be looked to,\nacross the water, for other favours.  People are simplified alike by\ngreat contentments and great yearnings, and, whether or no it was\nGravener’s directness that begot my own, I seem to recall that in some\nturn taken by our talk he almost imposed it on me as an act of decorum to\nask if Miss Anvoy had also by chance expectations from her aunt.  My\nenquiry drew out that Lady Coxon, who was the oddest of women, would have\nin any contingency to act under her late husband’s will, which was odder\nstill, saddling her with a mass of queer obligations complicated with\nqueer loopholes.  There were several dreary people, Coxon cousins, old\nmaids, to whom she would have more or less to minister.  Gravener\nlaughed, without saying no, when I suggested that the young lady might\ncome in through a loophole; then suddenly, as if he suspected my turning\na lantern on him, he declared quite dryly: “That’s all rot—one’s moved by\nother springs!”\n\nA fortnight later, at Lady Coxon’s own house, I understood well enough\nthe springs one was moved by.  Gravener had spoken of me there as an old\nfriend, and I received a gracious invitation to dine.  The Knight’s widow\nwas again indisposed—she had succumbed at the eleventh hour; so that I\nfound Miss Anvoy bravely playing hostess without even Gravener’s help,\nsince, to make matters worse, he had just sent up word that the House,\nthe insatiable House, with which he supposed he had contracted for easier\nterms, positively declined to release him.  I was struck with the\ncourage, the grace and gaiety of the young lady left thus to handle the\nfauna and flora of the Regent’s Park.  I did what I could to help her to\nclassify them, after I had recovered from the confusion of seeing her\nslightly disconcerted at perceiving in the guest introduced by her\nintended the gentleman with whom she had had that talk about Frank\nSaltram.  I had at this moment my first glimpse of the fact that she was\na person who could carry a responsibility; but I leave the reader to\njudge of my sense of the aggravation, for either of us, of such a burden,\nwhen I heard the servant announce Mrs. Saltram.  From what immediately\npassed between the two ladies I gathered that the latter had been sent\nfor post-haste to fill the gap created by the absence of the mistress of\nthe house.  “Good!” I remember crying, “she’ll be put by me;” and my\napprehension was promptly justified.  Mrs. Saltram taken in to dinner,\nand taken in as a consequence of an appeal to her amiability, was Mrs.\nSaltram with a vengeance.  I asked myself what Miss Anvoy meant by doing\nsuch things, but the only answer I arrived at was that Gravener was\nverily fortunate.  She hadn’t happened to tell him of her visit to Upper\nBaker Street, but she’d certainly tell him to-morrow; not indeed that\nthis would make him like any better her having had the innocence to\ninvite such a person as Mrs. Saltram on such an occasion.  It could only\nstrike me that I had never seen a young woman put such ignorance into her\ncleverness, such freedom into her modesty; this, I think, was when, after\ndinner, she said to me frankly, with almost jubilant mirth: “Oh you don’t\nadmire Mrs. Saltram?”  Why should I?  This was truly a young person\nwithout guile.  I had briefly to consider before I could reply that my\nobjection to the lady named was the objection often uttered about people\nmet at the social board—I knew all her stories.  Then as Miss Anvoy\nremained momentarily vague I added: “Those about her husband.”\n\n“Oh yes, but there are some new ones.”\n\n“None for me.  Ah novelty would be pleasant!”\n\n“Doesn’t it appear that of late he has been particularly horrid?”\n\n“His fluctuations don’t matter”, I returned, “for at night all cats are\ngrey.  You saw the shade of this one the night we waited for him\ntogether.  What will you have?  He has no dignity.”\n\nMiss Anvoy, who had been introducing with her American distinctness,\nlooked encouragingly round at some of the combinations she had risked.\n“It’s too bad I can’t see him.”\n\n“You mean Gravener won’t let you?”\n\n“I haven’t asked him.  He lets me do everything.”\n\n“But you know he knows him and wonders what some of us see in him.”\n\n“We haven’t happened to talk of him,” the girl said.\n\n“Get him to take you some day out to see the Mulvilles.”\n\n“I thought Mr. Saltram had thrown the Mulvilles over.”\n\n“Utterly.  But that won’t prevent his being planted there again, to bloom\nlike a rose, within a month or two.”\n\nMiss Anvoy thought a moment.  Then, “I should like to see them,” she said\nwith her fostering smile.\n\n“They’re tremendously worth it.  You mustn’t miss them.”\n\n“I’ll make George take me,” she went on as Mrs. Saltram came up to\ninterrupt us.  She sniffed at this unfortunate as kindly as she had\nsmiled at me and, addressing the question to her, continued: “But the\nchance of a lecture—one of the wonderful lectures?  Isn’t there another\ncourse announced?”\n\n“Another?  There are about thirty!” I exclaimed, turning away and feeling\nMrs. Saltram’s little eyes in my back.  A few days after this I heard\nthat Gravener’s marriage was near at hand—was settled for Whitsuntide;\nbut as no invitation had reached me I had my doubts, and there presently\ncame to me in fact the report of a postponement.  Something was the\nmatter; what was the matter was supposed to be that Lady Coxon was now\ncritically ill.  I had called on her after my dinner in the Regent’s\nPark, but I had neither seen her nor seen Miss Anvoy.  I forget to-day\nthe exact order in which, at this period, sundry incidents occurred and\nthe particular stage at which it suddenly struck me, making me catch my\nbreath a little, that the progression, the acceleration, was for all the\nworld that of fine drama.  This was probably rather late in the day, and\nthe exact order doesn’t signify.  What had already occurred was some\naccident determining a more patient wait.  George Gravener, whom I met\nagain, in fact told me as much, but without signs of perturbation.  Lady\nCoxon had to be constantly attended to, and there were other good reasons\nas well.  Lady Coxon had to be so constantly attended to that on the\noccasion of a second attempt in the Regent’s Park I equally failed to\nobtain a sight of her niece.  I judged it discreet in all the conditions\nnot to make a third; but this didn’t matter, for it was through Adelaide\nMulville that the side-wind of the comedy, though I was at first\nunwitting, began to reach me.  I went to Wimbledon at times because\nSaltram was there, and I went at others because he wasn’t.  The Pudneys,\nwho had taken him to Birmingham, had already got rid of him, and we had a\nhorrible consciousness of his wandering roofless, in dishonour, about the\nsmoky Midlands, almost as the injured Lear wandered on the storm-lashed\nheath.  His room, upstairs, had been lately done up (I could hear the\ncrackle of the new chintz) and the difference only made his smirches and\nbruises, his splendid tainted genius, the more tragic.  If he wasn’t\nbarefoot in the mire he was sure to be unconventionally shod.  These were\nthe things Adelaide and I, who were old enough friends to stare at each\nother in silence, talked about when we didn’t speak.  When we spoke it\nwas only about the brilliant girl George Gravener was to marry and whom\nhe had brought out the other Sunday.  I could see that this presentation\nhad been happy, for Mrs. Mulville commemorated it after her sole fashion\nof showing confidence in a new relation.  “She likes me—she likes me”:\nher native humility exulted in that measure of success.  We all knew for\nourselves how she liked those who liked her, and as regards Ruth Anvoy\nshe was more easily won over than Lady Maddock.\n\n\n\n\nVII\n\n\nONE of the consequences, for the Mulvilles, of the sacrifices they made\nfor Frank Saltram was that they had to give up their carriage.  Adelaide\ndrove gently into London in a one-horse greenish thing, an early\nVictorian landau, hired, near at hand, imaginatively, from a broken-down\njobmaster whose wife was in consumption—a vehicle that made people turn\nround all the more when her pensioner sat beside her in a soft white hat\nand a shawl, one of the dear woman’s own.  This was his position and I\ndare say his costume when on an afternoon in July she went to return Miss\nAnvoy’s visit.  The wheel of fate had now revolved, and amid silences\ndeep and exhaustive, compunctions and condonations alike unutterable,\nSaltram was reinstated.  Was it in pride or in penance that Mrs. Mulville\nhad begun immediately to drive him about?  If he was ashamed of his\ningratitude she might have been ashamed of her forgiveness; but she was\nincorrigibly capable of liking him to be conspicuous in the landau while\nshe was in shops or with her acquaintance.  However, if he was in the\npillory for twenty minutes in the Regent’s Park—I mean at Lady Coxon’s\ndoor while his companion paid her call—it wasn’t to the further\nhumiliation of any one concerned that she presently came out for him in\nperson, not even to show either of them what a fool she was that she drew\nhim in to be introduced to the bright young American.  Her account of the\nintroduction I had in its order, but before that, very late in the\nseason, under Gravener’s auspices, I met Miss Anvoy at tea at the House\nof Commons.  The member for Clockborough had gathered a group of pretty\nladies, and the Mulvilles were not of the party.  On the great terrace,\nas I strolled off with her a little, the guest of honour immediately\nexclaimed to me: “I’ve seen him, you know—I’ve seen him!”  She told me\nabout Saltram’s call.\n\n“And how did you find him?”\n\n“Oh so strange!”\n\n“You didn’t like him?”\n\n“I can’t tell till I see him again.”\n\n“You want to do that?”\n\nShe had a pause.  “Immensely.”\n\nWe went no further; I fancied she had become aware Gravener was looking\nat us.  She turned back toward the knot of the others, and I said:\n“Dislike him as much as you will—I see you’re bitten.”\n\n“Bitten?”  I thought she coloured a little.\n\n“Oh it doesn’t matter!” I laughed; “one doesn’t die of it.”\n\n“I hope I shan’t die of anything before I’ve seen more of Mrs. Mulville.”\nI rejoiced with her over plain Adelaide, whom she pronounced the\nloveliest woman she had met in England; but before we separated I\nremarked to her that it was an act of mere humanity to warn her that if\nshe should see more of Frank Saltram—which would be likely to follow on\nany increase of acquaintance with Mrs. Mulville—she might find herself\nflattening her nose against the clear hard pane of an eternal\nquestion—that of the relative, that of the opposed, importances of virtue\nand brains.  She replied that this was surely a subject on which one took\neverything for granted; whereupon I admitted that I had perhaps expressed\nmyself ill.  What I referred to was what I had referred to the night we\nmet in Upper Baker Street—the relative importance (relative to virtue) of\nother gifts.  She asked me if I called virtue a gift—a thing handed to us\nin a parcel on our first birthday; and I declared that this very enquiry\nproved to me the problem had already caught her by the skirt.  She would\nhave help however, the same help I myself had once had, in resisting its\ntendency to make one cross.\n\n“What help do you mean?”\n\n“That of the member for Clockborough.”\n\nShe stared, smiled, then returned: “Why my idea has been to help him!”\n\nShe had helped him—I had his own word for it that at Clockborough her\nbedevilment of the voters had really put him in.  She would do so\ndoubtless again and again, though I heard the very next month that this\nfine faculty had undergone a temporary eclipse.  News of the catastrophe\nfirst came to me from Mrs. Saltram, and it was afterwards confirmed at\nWimbledon: poor Miss Anvoy was in trouble—great disasters in America had\nsuddenly summoned her home.  Her father, in New York, had suffered\nreverses, lost so much money that it was really vexatious as showing how\nmuch he had had.  It was Adelaide who told me she had gone off alone at\nless than a week’s notice.\n\n“Alone?  Gravener has permitted that?”\n\n“What will you have?  The House of Commons!”\n\nI’m afraid I cursed the House of Commons: I was so much interested.  Of\ncourse he’d follow her as soon as he was free to make her his wife; only\nshe mightn’t now be able to bring him anything like the marriage-portion\nof which he had begun by having the virtual promise.  Mrs. Mulville let\nme know what was already said: she was charming, this American girl, but\nreally these American fathers—!  What was a man to do?  Mr. Saltram,\naccording to Mrs. Mulville, was of opinion that a man was never to suffer\nhis relation to money to become a spiritual relation—he was to keep it\nexclusively material.  “Moi pas comprendre!” I commented on this; in\nrejoinder to which Adelaide, with her beautiful sympathy, explained that\nshe supposed he simply meant that the thing was to use it, don’t you\nknow? but not to think too much about it.  “To take it, but not to thank\nyou for it?” I still more profanely enquired.  For a quarter of an hour\nafterwards she wouldn’t look at me, but this didn’t prevent my asking her\nwhat had been the result, that afternoon—in the Regent’s Park, of her\ntaking our friend to see Miss Anvoy.\n\n“Oh so charming!” she answered, brightening.  “He said he recognised in\nher a nature he could absolutely trust.”\n\n“Yes, but I’m speaking of the effect on herself.”\n\nMrs. Mulville had to remount the stream.  “It was everything one could\nwish.”\n\nSomething in her tone made me laugh.  “Do you mean she gave him—a dole?”\n\n“Well, since you ask me!”\n\n“Right there on the spot?”\n\nAgain poor Adelaide faltered.  “It was to me of course she gave it.”\n\nI stared; somehow I couldn’t see the scene.  “Do you mean a sum of\nmoney?”\n\n“It was very handsome.”  Now at last she met my eyes, though I could see\nit was with an effort.  “Thirty pounds.”\n\n“Straight out of her pocket?”\n\n“Out of the drawer of a table at which she had been writing.  She just\nslipped the folded notes into my hand.  He wasn’t looking; it was while\nhe was going back to the carriage.”  “Oh,” said Adelaide reassuringly, “I\ntake care of it for him!”  The dear practical soul thought my agitation,\nfor I confess I was agitated, referred to the employment of the money.\nHer disclosure made me for a moment muse violently, and I dare say that\nduring that moment I wondered if anything else in the world makes people\nso gross as unselfishness.  I uttered, I suppose, some vague synthetic\ncry, for she went on as if she had had a glimpse of my inward amaze at\nsuch passages.  “I assure you, my dear friend, he was in one of his happy\nhours.”\n\nBut I wasn’t thinking of that.  “Truly indeed these Americans!” I said.\n“With her father in the very act, as it were, of swindling her\nbetrothed!”\n\nMrs. Mulville stared.  “Oh I suppose Mr. Anvoy has scarcely gone\nbankrupt—or whatever he has done—on purpose.  Very likely they won’t be\nable to keep it up, but there it was, and it was a very beautiful\nimpulse.”\n\n“You say Saltram was very fine?”\n\n“Beyond everything.  He surprised even me.”\n\n“And I know what you’ve enjoyed.”  After a moment I added: “Had he\nperadventure caught a glimpse of the money in the table-drawer?”\n\nAt this my companion honestly flushed.  “How can you be so cruel when you\nknow how little he calculates?”\n\n“Forgive me, I do know it.  But you tell me things that act on my nerves.\nI’m sure he hadn’t caught a glimpse of anything but some splendid idea.”\n\nMrs. Mulville brightly concurred.  “And perhaps even of her beautiful\nlistening face.”\n\n“Perhaps even!  And what was it all about?”\n\n“His talk?  It was apropos of her engagement, which I had told him about:\nthe idea of marriage, the philosophy, the poetry, the sublimity of it.”\nIt was impossible wholly to restrain one’s mirth at this, and some rude\nripple that I emitted again caused my companion to admonish me.  “It\nsounds a little stale, but you know his freshness.”\n\n“Of illustration?  Indeed I do!”\n\n“And how he has always been right on that great question.”\n\n“On what great question, dear lady, hasn’t he been right?”\n\n“Of what other great men can you equally say it?—and that he has never,\nbut never, had a deflexion?” Mrs. Mulville exultantly demanded.\n\nI tried to think of some other great man, but I had to give it up.\n“Didn’t Miss Anvoy express her satisfaction in any less diffident way\nthan by her charming present?” I was reduced to asking instead.\n\n“Oh yes, she overflowed to me on the steps while he was getting into the\ncarriage.”  These words somehow brushed up a picture of Saltram’s big\nshawled back as he hoisted himself into the green landau.  “She said she\nwasn’t disappointed,” Adelaide pursued.\n\nI turned it over.  “Did he wear his shawl?”\n\n“His shawl?”  She hadn’t even noticed.\n\n“I mean yours.”\n\n“He looked very nice, and you know he’s really clean.  Miss Anvoy used\nsuch a remarkable expression—she said his mind’s like a crystal!”\n\nI pricked up my ears.  “A crystal?”\n\n“Suspended in the moral world—swinging and shining and flashing there.\nShe’s monstrously clever, you know.”\n\nI thought again.  “Monstrously!”\n\n\n\n\nVIII\n\n\nGEORGE GRAVENER didn’t follow her, for late in September, after the House\nhad risen, I met him in a railway-carriage.  He was coming up from\nScotland and I had just quitted some relations who lived near Durham.\nThe current of travel back to London wasn’t yet strong; at any rate on\nentering the compartment I found he had had it for some time to himself.\nWe fared in company, and though he had a blue-book in his lap and the\nopen jaws of his bag threatened me with the white teeth of confused\npapers, we inevitably, we even at last sociably conversed.  I saw things\nweren’t well with him, but I asked no question till something dropped by\nhimself made, as it had made on another occasion, an absence of curiosity\ninvidious.  He mentioned that he was worried about his good old friend\nLady Coxon, who, with her niece likely to be detained some time in\nAmerica, lay seriously ill at Clockborough, much on his mind and on his\nhands.\n\n“Ah Miss Anvoy’s in America?”\n\n“Her father has got into horrid straits—has lost no end of money.”\n\nI waited, after expressing due concern, but I eventually said: “I hope\nthat raises no objection to your marriage.”\n\n“None whatever; moreover it’s my trade to meet objections.  But it may\ncreate tiresome delays, of which there have been too many, from various\ncauses, already.  Lady Coxon got very bad, then she got much better.\nThen Mr. Anvoy suddenly began to totter, and now he seems quite on his\nback.  I’m afraid he’s really in for some big reverse.  Lady Coxon’s\nworse again, awfully upset by the news from America, and she sends me\nword that she _must_ have Ruth.  How can I supply her with Ruth?  I\nhaven’t got Ruth myself!”\n\n“Surely you haven’t lost her?” I returned.\n\n“She’s everything to her wretched father.  She writes me every\npost—telling me to smooth her aunt’s pillow.  I’ve other things to\nsmooth; but the old lady, save for her servants, is really alone.  She\nwon’t receive her Coxon relations—she’s angry at so much of her money\ngoing to them.  Besides, she’s hopelessly mad,” said Gravener very\nfrankly.\n\nI don’t remember whether it was this, or what it was, that made me ask if\nshe hadn’t such an appreciation of Mrs. Saltram as might render that\nactive person of some use.\n\nHe gave me a cold glance, wanting to know what had put Mrs. Saltram into\nmy head, and I replied that she was unfortunately never out of it.  I\nhappened to remember the wonderful accounts she had given me of the\nkindness Lady Coxon had shown her.  Gravener declared this to be false;\nLady Coxon, who didn’t care for her, hadn’t seen her three times.  The\nonly foundation for it was that Miss Anvoy, who used, poor girl, to chuck\nmoney about in a manner she must now regret, had for an hour seen in the\nmiserable woman—you could never know what she’d see in people—an\ninteresting pretext for the liberality with which her nature overflowed.\nBut even Miss Anvoy was now quite tired of her.  Gravener told me more\nabout the crash in New York and the annoyance it had been to him, and we\nalso glanced here and there in other directions; but by the time we got\nto Doncaster the principal thing he had let me see was that he was\nkeeping something back.  We stopped at that station, and, at the\ncarriage-door, some one made a movement to get in.  Gravener uttered a\nsound of impatience, and I felt sure that but for this I should have had\nthe secret.  Then the intruder, for some reason, spared us his company;\nwe started afresh, and my hope of a disclosure returned.  My companion\nheld his tongue, however, and I pretended to go to sleep; in fact I\nreally dozed for discouragement.  When I reopened my eyes he was looking\nat me with an injured air.  He tossed away with some vivacity the remnant\nof a cigarette and then said: “If you’re not too sleepy I want to put you\na case.”  I answered that I’d make every effort to attend, and welcomed\nthe note of interest when he went on: “As I told you a while ago, Lady\nCoxon, poor dear, is demented.”  His tone had much behind it—was full of\npromise.  I asked if her ladyship’s misfortune were a trait of her malady\nor only of her character, and he pronounced it a product of both.  The\ncase he wanted to put to me was a matter on which it concerned him to\nhave the impression—the judgement, he might also say—of another person.\n“I mean of the average intelligent man, but you see I take what I can\nget.” There would be the technical, the strictly legal view; then there\nwould be the way the question would strike a man of the world.  He had\nlighted another cigarette while he talked, and I saw he was glad to have\nit to handle when he brought out at last, with a laugh slightly\nartificial: “In fact it’s a subject on which Miss Anvoy and I are pulling\ndifferent ways.”\n\n“And you want me to decide between you?  I decide in advance for Miss\nAnvoy.”\n\n“In advance—that’s quite right.  That’s how I decided when I proposed to\nher.  But my story will interest you only so far as your mind isn’t made\nup.”  Gravener puffed his cigarette a minute and then continued: “Are you\nfamiliar with the idea of the Endowment of Research?”\n\n“Of Research?” I was at sea a moment.\n\n“I give you Lady Coxon’s phrase.  She has it on the brain.”\n\n“She wishes to endow—?”\n\n“Some earnest and ‘loyal’ seeker,” Gravener said.  “It was a sketchy\ndesign of her late husband’s, and he handed it on to her; setting apart\nin his will a sum of money of which she was to enjoy the interest for\nlife, but of which, should she eventually see her opportunity—the matter\nwas left largely to her discretion—she would best honour his memory by\ndetermining the exemplary public use.  This sum of money, no less than\nthirteen thousand pounds, was to be called The Coxon Fund; and poor Sir\nGregory evidently proposed to himself that The Coxon Fund should cover\nhis name with glory—be universally desired and admired.  He left his wife\na full declaration of his views, so far at least as that term may be\napplied to views vitiated by a vagueness really infantine.  A little\nlearning’s a dangerous thing, and a good citizen who happens to have been\nan ass is worse for a community than bad sewerage.  He’s worst of all\nwhen he’s dead, because then he can’t be stopped.  However, such as they\nwere, the poor man’s aspirations are now in his wife’s bosom, or\nfermenting rather in her foolish brain: it lies with her to carry them\nout.  But of course she must first catch her hare.”\n\n“Her earnest loyal seeker?”\n\n“The flower that blushes unseen for want of such a pecuniary independence\nas may aid the light that’s in it to shine upon the human race.  The\nindividual, in a word, who, having the rest of the machinery, the\nspiritual, the intellectual, is most hampered in his search.”\n\n“His search for what?”\n\n“For Moral Truth.  That’s what Sir Gregory calls it.”\n\nI burst out laughing.  “Delightful munificent Sir Gregory!  It’s a\ncharming idea.”\n\n“So Miss Anvoy thinks.”\n\n“Has she a candidate for the Fund?”\n\n“Not that I know of—and she’s perfectly reasonable about it.  But Lady\nCoxon has put the matter before her, and we’ve naturally had a lot of\ntalk.”\n\n“Talk that, as you’ve so interestingly intimated, has landed you in a\ndisagreement.”\n\n“She considers there’s something in it,” Gravener said.\n\n“And you consider there’s nothing?”\n\n“It seems to me a piece of solemn twaddle—which can’t fail to be attended\nwith consequences certainly grotesque and possibly immoral.  To begin\nwith, fancy constituting an endowment without establishing a tribunal—a\nbench of competent people, of judges.”\n\n“The sole tribunal is Lady Coxon?”\n\n“And any one she chooses to invite.”\n\n“But she has invited you,” I noted.\n\n“I’m not competent—I hate the thing.  Besides, she hasn’t,” my friend\nwent on.  “The real history of the matter, I take it, is that the\ninspiration was originally Lady Coxon’s own, that she infected him with\nit, and that the flattering option left her is simply his tribute to her\nbeautiful, her aboriginal enthusiasm.  She came to England forty years\nago, a thin transcendental Bostonian, and even her odd happy frumpy\nClockborough marriage never really materialised her.  She feels indeed\nthat she has become very British—as if that, as a process, as a ‘Werden,’\nas anything but an original sign of grace, were conceivable; but it’s\nprecisely what makes her cling to the notion of the ‘Fund’—cling to it as\nto a link with the ideal.”\n\n“How can she cling if she’s dying?”\n\n“Do you mean how can she act in the matter?” Gravener asked.  “That’s\nprecisely the question.  She can’t!  As she has never yet caught her\nhare, never spied out her lucky impostor—how should she, with the life\nshe has led?—her husband’s intention has come very near lapsing.  His\nidea, to do him justice, was that it _should_ lapse if exactly the right\nperson, the perfect mixture of genius and chill penury, should fail to\nturn up.  Ah the poor dear woman’s very particular—she says there must be\nno mistake.”\n\nI found all this quite thrilling—I took it in with avidity.  “And if she\ndies without doing anything, what becomes of the money?” I demanded.\n\n“It goes back to his family, if she hasn’t made some other disposition of\nit.”\n\n“She may do that then—she may divert it?”\n\n“Her hands are not tied.  She has a grand discretion.  The proof is that\nthree months ago she offered to make the proceeds over to her niece.”\n\n“For Miss Anvoy’s own use?”\n\n“For Miss Anvoy’s own use—on the occasion of her prospective marriage.\nShe was discouraged—the earnest seeker required so earnest a search.  She\nwas afraid of making a mistake; every one she could think of seemed\neither not earnest enough or not poor enough.  On the receipt of the\nfirst bad news about Mr. Anvoy’s affairs she proposed to Ruth to make the\nsacrifice for her.  As the situation in New York got worse she repeated\nher proposal.”\n\n“Which Miss Anvoy declined?”\n\n“Except as a formal trust.”\n\n“You mean except as committing herself legally to place the money?”\n\n“On the head of the deserving object, the great man frustrated,” said\nGravener.  “She only consents to act in the spirit of Sir Gregory’s\nscheme.”\n\n“And you blame her for that?” I asked with some intensity.\n\nMy tone couldn’t have been harsh, but he coloured a little and there was\na queer light in his eye.  “My dear fellow, if I ‘blamed’ the young lady\nI’m engaged to I shouldn’t immediately say it even to so old a friend as\nyou.”  I saw that some deep discomfort, some restless desire to be sided\nwith, reassuringly, approvingly mirrored, had been at the bottom of his\ndrifting so far, and I was genuinely touched by his confidence.  It was\ninconsistent with his habits; but being troubled about a woman was not,\nfor him, a habit: that itself was an inconsistency.  George Gravener\ncould stand straight enough before any other combination of forces.  It\namused me to think that the combination he had succumbed to had an\nAmerican accent, a transcendental aunt and an insolvent father; but all\nmy old loyalty to him mustered to meet this unexpected hint that I could\nhelp him.  I saw that I could from the insincere tone in which he\npursued: “I’ve criticised her of course, I’ve contended with her, and it\nhas been great fun.”  Yet it clearly couldn’t have been such great fun as\nto make it improper for me presently to ask if Miss Anvoy had nothing at\nall settled on herself.  To this he replied that she had only a trifle\nfrom her mother—a mere four hundred a year, which was exactly why it\nwould be convenient to him that she shouldn’t decline, in the face of\nthis total change in her prospects, an accession of income which would\ndistinctly help them to marry.  When I enquired if there were no other\nway in which so rich and so affectionate an aunt could cause the weight\nof her benevolence to be felt, he answered that Lady Coxon was\naffectionate indeed, but was scarcely to be called rich.  She could let\nher project of the Fund lapse for her niece’s benefit, but she couldn’t\ndo anything else.  She had been accustomed to regard her as tremendously\nprovided for, and she was up to her eyes in promises to anxious Coxons.\nShe was a woman of an inordinate conscience, and her conscience was now a\ndistress to her, hovering round her bed in irreconcilable forms of\nresentful husbands, portionless nieces and undiscoverable philosophers.\n\nWe were by this time getting into the whirr of fleeting platforms, the\nmultiplication of lights.  “I think you’ll find,” I said with a laugh,\n“that your predicament will disappear in the very fact that the\nphilosopher _is_ undiscoverable.”\n\nHe began to gather up his papers.  “Who can set a limit to the ingenuity\nof an extravagant woman?”\n\n“Yes, after all, who indeed?” I echoed as I recalled the extravagance\ncommemorated in Adelaide’s anecdote of Miss Anvoy and the thirty pounds.\n\n\n\n\nIX\n\n\nTHE thing I had been most sensible of in that talk with George Gravener\nwas the way Saltram’s name kept out of it.  It seemed to me at the time\nthat we were quite pointedly silent about him; but afterwards it appeared\nmore probable there had been on my companion’s part no conscious\navoidance.  Later on I was sure of this, and for the best of reasons—the\nsimple reason of my perceiving more completely that, for evil as well as\nfor good, he said nothing to Gravener’s imagination.  That honest man\ndidn’t fear him—he was too much disgusted with him.  No more did I,\ndoubtless, and for very much the same reason.  I treated my friend’s\nstory as an absolute confidence; but when before Christmas, by Mrs.\nSaltram, I was informed of Lady Coxon’s death without having had news of\nMiss Anvoy’s return, I found myself taking for granted we should hear no\nmore of these nuptials, in which, as obscurely unnatural, I now saw I had\nnever _too_ disconcertedly believed.  I began to ask myself how people\nwho suited each other so little could please each other so much.  The\ncharm was some material charm, some afffinity, exquisite doubtless, yet\nsuperficial some surrender to youth and beauty and passion, to force and\ngrace and fortune, happy accidents and easy contacts.  They might dote on\neach other’s persons, but how could they know each other’s souls?  How\ncould they have the same prejudices, how could they have the same\nhorizon?  Such questions, I confess, seemed quenched but not answered\nwhen, one day in February, going out to Wimbledon, I found our young lady\nin the house.  A passion that had brought her back across the wintry\nocean was as much of a passion as was needed.  No impulse equally strong\nindeed had drawn George Gravener to America; a circumstance on which,\nhowever, I reflected only long enough to remind myself that it was none\nof my business.  Ruth Anvoy was distinctly different, and I felt that the\ndifference was not simply that of her marks of mourning.  Mrs. Mulville\ntold me soon enough what it was: it was the difference between a handsome\ngirl with large expectations and a handsome girl with only four hundred a\nyear.  This explanation indeed didn’t wholly content me, not even when I\nlearned that her mourning had a double cause—learned that poor Mr. Anvoy,\ngiving way altogether, buried under the ruins of his fortune and leaving\nnext to nothing, had died a few weeks before.\n\n“So she has come out to marry George Gravener?” I commented.  “Wouldn’t\nit have been prettier of him to have saved her the trouble?”\n\n“Hasn’t the House just met?” Adelaide replied.  “And for Mr. Gravener the\nHouse—!”  Then she added: “I gather that her having come is exactly a\nsign that the marriage is a little shaky.  If it were quite all right a\nself-respecting girl like Ruth would have waited for him over there.”\n\nI noted that they were already Ruth and Adelaide, but what I said was:\n“Do you mean she’ll have had to return to _make_ it so?”\n\n“No, I mean that she must have come out for some reason independent of\nit.”  Adelaide could only surmise, however, as yet, and there was more,\nas we found, to be revealed.  Mrs. Mulville, on hearing of her arrival,\nhad brought the young lady out in the green landau for the Sunday.  The\nCoxons were in possession of the house in Regent’s Park, and Miss Anvoy\nwas in dreary lodgings.  George Gravener had been with her when Adelaide\ncalled, but had assented graciously enough to the little visit at\nWimbledon.  The carriage, with Mr. Saltram in it but not mentioned, had\nbeen sent off on some errand from which it was to return and pick the\nladies up.  Gravener had left them together, and at the end of an hour,\non the Saturday afternoon, the party of three had driven out to\nWimbledon.  This was the girl’s second glimpse of our great man, and I\nwas interested in asking Mrs. Mulville if the impression made by the\nfirst appeared to have been confirmed.  On her replying after\nconsideration, that of course with time and opportunity it couldn’t fail\nto be, but that she was disappointed, I was sufficiently struck with her\nuse of this last word to question her further.\n\n“Do you mean you’re disappointed because you judge Miss Anvoy to be?”\n\n“Yes; I hoped for a greater effect last evening.  We had two or three\npeople, but he scarcely opened his mouth.”\n\n“He’ll be all the better to-night,” I opined after a moment.  Then I\npursued: “What particular importance do you attach to the idea of her\nbeing impressed?”\n\nAdelaide turned her mild pale eyes on me as for rebuke of my levity.\n“Why the importance of her being as happy as _we_ are!”\n\nI’m afraid that at this my levity grew.  “Oh that’s a happiness almost\ntoo great to wish a person!”  I saw she hadn’t yet in her mind what I had\nin mine, and at any rate the visitor’s actual bliss was limited to a walk\nin the garden with Kent Mulville.  Later in the afternoon I also took\none, and I saw nothing of Miss Anvoy till dinner, at which we failed of\nthe company of Saltram, who had caused it to be reported that he was\nindisposed and lying down.  This made us, most of us—for there were other\nfriends present—convey to each other in silence some of the unutterable\nthings that in those years our eyes had inevitably acquired the art of\nexpressing.  If a fine little American enquirer hadn’t been there we\nwould have expressed them otherwise, and Adelaide would have pretended\nnot to hear.  I had seen her, before the very fact, abstract herself\nnobly; and I knew that more than once, to keep it from the servants,\nmanaging, dissimulating cleverly, she had helped her husband to carry him\nbodily to his room.  Just recently he had been so wise and so deep and so\nhigh that I had begun to get nervous—to wonder if by chance there were\nsomething behind it, if he were kept straight for instance by the\nknowledge that the hated Pudneys would have more to tell us if they\nchose.  He was lying low, but unfortunately it was common wisdom with us\nin this connexion that the biggest splashes took place in the quietest\npools.  We should have had a merry life indeed if all the splashes had\nsprinkled us as refreshingly as the waters we were even then to feel\nabout our ears.  Kent Mulville had been up to his room, but had come back\nwith a face that told as few tales as I had seen it succeed in telling on\nthe evening I waited in the lecture-room with Miss Anvoy.  I said to\nmyself that our friend had gone out, but it was a comfort that the\npresence of a comparative stranger deprived us of the dreary duty of\nsuggesting to each other, in respect of his errand, edifying\npossibilities in which we didn’t ourselves believe.  At ten o’clock he\ncame into the drawing-room with his waistcoat much awry but his eyes\nsending out great signals.  It was precisely with his entrance that I\nceased to be vividly conscious of him.  I saw that the crystal, as I had\ncalled it, had begun to swing, and I had need of my immediate attention\nfor Miss Anvoy.\n\nEven when I was told afterwards that he had, as we might have said\nto-day, broken the record, the manner in which that attention had been\nrewarded relieved me of a sense of loss.  I had of course a perfect\ngeneral consciousness that something great was going on: it was a little\nlike having been etherised to hear Herr Joachim play.  The old music was\nin the air; I felt the strong pulse of thought, the sink and swell, the\nflight, the poise, the plunge; but I knew something about one of the\nlisteners that nobody else knew, and Saltram’s monologue could reach me\nonly through that medium.  To this hour I’m of no use when, as a witness,\nI’m appealed to—for they still absurdly contend about it—as to whether or\nno on that historic night he was drunk; and my position is slightly\nridiculous, for I’ve never cared to tell them what it really was I was\ntaken up with.  What I got out of it is the only morsel of the total\nexperience that is quite my own.  The others were shared, but this is\nincommunicable.  I feel that now, I’m bound to say, even in thus roughly\nevoking the occasion, and it takes something from my pride of clearness.\nHowever, I shall perhaps be as clear as is absolutely needful if I remark\nthat our young lady was too much given up to her own intensity of\nobservation to be sensible of mine.  It was plainly not the question of\nher marriage that had brought her back.  I greatly enjoyed this discovery\nand was sure that had that question alone been involved she would have\nstirred no step.  In this case doubtless Gravener would, in spite of the\nHouse of Commons, have found means to rejoin her.  It afterwards made me\nuncomfortable for her that, alone in the lodging Mrs. Mulville had put\nbefore me as dreary, she should have in any degree the air of waiting for\nher fate; so that I was presently relieved at hearing of her having gone\nto stay at Coldfield.  If she was in England at all while the engagement\nstood the only proper place for her was under Lady Maddock’s wing.  Now\nthat she was unfortunate and relatively poor, perhaps her prospective\nsister-in-law would be wholly won over.\n\nThere would be much to say, if I had space, about the way her behaviour,\nas I caught gleams of it, ministered to the image that had taken birth in\nmy mind, to my private amusement, while that other night I listened to\nGeorge Gravener in the railway-carriage.  I watched her in the light of\nthis queer possibility—a formidable thing certainly to meet—and I was\naware that it coloured, extravagantly perhaps, my interpretation of her\nvery looks and tones.  At Wimbledon for instance it had appeared to me\nshe was literally afraid of Saltram, in dread of a coercion that she had\nbegun already to feel.  I had come up to town with her the next day and\nhad been convinced that, though deeply interested, she was immensely on\nher guard.  She would show as little as possible before she should be\nready to show everything.  What this final exhibition might be on the\npart of a girl perceptibly so able to think things out I found it great\nsport to forecast.  It would have been exciting to be approached by her,\nappealed to by her for advice; but I prayed to heaven I mightn’t find\nmyself in such a predicament.  If there was really a present rigour in\nthe situation of which Gravener had sketched for me the elements, she\nwould have to get out of her difficulty by herself.  It wasn’t I who had\nlaunched her and it wasn’t I who could help her.  I didn’t fail to ask\nmyself why, since I couldn’t help her, I should think so much about her.\nIt was in part my suspense that was responsible for this; I waited\nimpatiently to see whether she wouldn’t have told Mrs. Mulville a portion\nat least of what I had learned from Gravener.  But I saw Mrs. Mulville\nwas still reduced to wonder what she had come out again for if she hadn’t\ncome as a conciliatory bride.  That she had come in some other character\nwas the only thing that fitted all the appearances.  Having for family\nreasons to spend some time that spring in the west of England, I was in a\nmanner out of earshot of the great oceanic rumble—I mean of the\ncontinuous hum of Saltram’s thought—and my uneasiness tended to keep me\nquiet.  There was something I wanted so little to have to say that my\nprudence surmounted my curiosity.  I only wondered if Ruth Anvoy talked\nover the idea of The Coxon Fund with Lady Maddock, and also somewhat why\nI didn’t hear from Wimbledon.  I had a reproachful note about something\nor other from Mrs. Saltram, but it contained no mention of Lady Coxon’s\nniece, on whom her eyes had been much less fixed since the recent\nuntoward events.\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nPOOR Adelaide’s silence was fully explained later—practically explained\nwhen in June, returning to London, I was honoured by this admirable woman\nwith an early visit.  As soon as she arrived I guessed everything, and as\nsoon as she told me that darling Ruth had been in her house nearly a\nmonth I had my question ready.  “What in the name of maidenly modesty is\nshe staying in England for?”\n\n“Because she loves me so!” cried Adelaide gaily.  But she hadn’t come to\nsee me only to tell me Miss Anvoy loved her: that was quite sufficiently\nestablished, and what was much more to the point was that Mr. Gravener\nhad now raised an objection to it.  He had protested at least against her\nbeing at Wimbledon, where in the innocence of his heart he had originally\nbrought her himself; he called on her to put an end to their engagement\nin the only proper, the only happy manner.\n\n“And why in the world doesn’t she do do?” I asked.\n\nAdelaide had a pause.  “She says you know.”\n\nThen on my also hesitating she added: “A condition he makes.”\n\n“The Coxon Fund?” I panted.\n\n“He has mentioned to her his having told you about it.”\n\n“Ah but so little!  Do you mean she has accepted the trust?”\n\n“In the most splendid spirit—as a duty about which there can be no two\nopinions.”  To which my friend added: “Of course she’s thinking of Mr.\nSaltram.”\n\nI gave a quick cry at this, which, in its violence, made my visitor turn\npale.  “How very awful!”\n\n“Awful?”\n\n“Why, to have anything to do with such an idea one’s self.”\n\n“I’m sure _you_ needn’t!” and Mrs. Mulville tossed her head.\n\n“He isn’t good enough!” I went on; to which she opposed a sound almost as\ncontentious as my own had been.  This made me, with genuine immediate\nhorror, exclaim: “You haven’t influenced her, I hope!” and my emphasis\nbrought back the blood with a rush to poor Adelaide’s face.  She declared\nwhile she blushed—for I had frightened her again—that she had never\ninfluenced anybody and that the girl had only seen and heard and judged\nfor herself.  _He_ had influenced her, if I would, as he did every one\nwho had a soul: that word, as we knew, even expressed feebly the power of\nthe things he said to haunt the mind.  How could she, Adelaide, help it\nif Miss Anvoy’s mind was haunted?  I demanded with a groan what right a\npretty girl engaged to a rising M.P. had to _have_ a mind; but the only\nexplanation my bewildered friend could give me was that she was so\nclever.  She regarded Mr. Saltram naturally as a tremendous force for\ngood.  She was intelligent enough to understand him and generous enough\nto admire.\n\n“She’s many things enough, but is she, among them, rich enough?” I\ndemanded.  “Rich enough, I mean, to sacrifice such a lot of good money?”\n\n“That’s for herself to judge.  Besides, it’s not her own money; she\ndoesn’t in the least consider it so.”\n\n“And Gravener does, if not _his_ own; and that’s the whole difficulty?”\n\n“The difficulty that brought her back, yes: she had absolutely to see her\npoor aunt’s solicitor.  It’s clear that by Lady Coxon’s will she may have\nthe money, but it’s still clearer to her conscience that the original\ncondition, definite, intensely implied on her uncle’s part, is attached\nto the use of it.  She can only take one view of it.  It’s for the\nEndowment or it’s for nothing.”\n\n“The Endowment,” I permitted myself to observe, “is a conception\nsuperficially sublime, but fundamentally ridiculous.”\n\n“Are you repeating Mr. Gravener’s words?” Adelaide asked.\n\n“Possibly, though I’ve not seen him for months.  It’s simply the way it\nstrikes me too.  It’s an old wife’s tale.  Gravener made some reference\nto the legal aspect, but such an absurdly loose arrangement has _no_\nlegal aspect.”\n\n“Ruth doesn’t insist on that,” said Mrs. Mulville; “and it’s, for her,\nexactly this technical weakness that constitutes the force of the moral\nobligation.”\n\n“Are you repeating _her_ words?” I enquired.  I forget what else Adelaide\nsaid, but she said she was magnificent.  I thought of George Gravener\nconfronted with such magnificence as that, and I asked what could have\nmade two such persons ever suppose they understood each other.  Mrs.\nMulville assured me the girl loved him as such a woman could love and\nthat she suffered as such a woman could suffer.  Nevertheless she wanted\nto see _me_.  At this I sprang up with a groan.  “Oh I’m so sorry!—when?”\nSmall though her sense of humour, I think Adelaide laughed at my\nsequence.  We discussed the day, the nearest it would be convenient I\nshould come out; but before she went I asked my visitor how long she had\nbeen acquainted with these prodigies.\n\n“For several weeks, but I was pledged to secrecy.”\n\n“And that’s why you didn’t write?”\n\n“I couldn’t very well tell you she was with me without telling you that\nno time had even yet been fixed for her marriage.  And I couldn’t very\nwell tell you as much as that without telling you what I knew of the\nreason of it.  It was not till a day or two ago,” Mrs. Mulville went on,\n“that she asked me to ask you if you wouldn’t come and see her.  Then at\nlast she spoke of your knowing about the idea of the Endowment.”\n\nI turned this over.  “Why on earth does she want to see me?”\n\n“To talk with you, naturally, about Mr. Saltram.”\n\n“As a subject for the prize?”  This was hugely obvious, and I presently\nreturned: “I think I’ll sail to-morrow for Australia.”\n\n“Well then—sail!” said Mrs. Mulville, getting up.\n\nBut I frivolously, continued.  “On Thursday at five, we said?”  The\nappointment was made definite and I enquired how, all this time, the\nunconscious candidate had carried himself.\n\n“In perfection, really, by the happiest of chances: he has positively\nbeen a dear.  And then, as to what we revere him for, in the most\nwonderful form.  His very highest—pure celestial light.  You _won’t_ do\nhim an ill turn?” Adelaide pleaded at the door.\n\n“What danger can equal for him the danger to which he’s exposed from\nhimself?” I asked.  “Look out sharp, if he has lately been too prim.\nHe’ll presently take a day off, treat us to some exhibition that will\nmake an Endowment a scandal.”\n\n“A scandal?” Mrs. Mulville dolorously echoed.\n\n“Is Miss Anvoy prepared for that?”\n\nMy visitor, for a moment, screwed her parasol into my carpet.  “He grows\nbigger every day.”\n\n“So do you!” I laughed as she went off.\n\nThat girl at Wimbledon, on the Thursday afternoon, more than justified my\napprehensions.  I recognised fully now the cause of the agitation she had\nproduced in me from the first—the faint foreknowledge that there was\nsomething very stiff I should have to do for her.  I felt more than ever\ncommitted to my fate as, standing before her in the big drawing-room\nwhere they had tactfully left us to ourselves, I tried with a smile to\nstring together the pearls of lucidity which, from her chair, she\nsuccessively tossed me.  Pale and bright, in her monotonous mourning, she\nwas an image of intelligent purpose, of the passion of duty; but I asked\nmyself whether any girl had ever had so charming an instinct as that\nwhich permitted her to laugh out, as for the joy of her difficulty, into\nthe priggish old room.  This remarkable young woman could be earnest\nwithout being solemn, and at moments when I ought doubtless to have\ncursed her obstinacy I found myself watching the unstudied play of her\neyebrows or the recurrence of a singularly intense whiteness produced by\nthe parting of her lips.  These aberrations, I hasten to add, didn’t\nprevent my learning soon enough why she had wished to see me.  Her reason\nfor this was as distinct as her beauty: it was to make me explain what I\nhad meant, on the occasion of our first meeting, by Mr. Saltram’s want of\ndignity.  It wasn’t that she couldn’t imagine, but she desired it there\nfrom my lips.  What she really desired of course was to know whether\nthere was worse about him than what she had found out for herself.  She\nhadn’t been a month so much in the house with him without discovering\nthat he wasn’t a man of monumental bronze.  He was like a jelly minus its\nmould, he had to be embanked; and that was precisely the source of her\ninterest in him and the ground of her project.  She put her project\nboldly before me: there it stood in its preposterous beauty.  She was as\nwilling to take the humorous view of it as I could be: the only\ndifference was that for her the humorous view of a thing wasn’t\nnecessarily prohibitive, wasn’t paralysing.\n\nMoreover she professed that she couldn’t discuss with me the primary\nquestion—the moral obligation: that was in her own breast.  There were\nthings she couldn’t go into—injunctions, impressions she had received.\nThey were a part of the closest intimacy of her intercourse with her\naunt, they were absolutely clear to her; and on questions of delicacy,\nthe interpretation of a fidelity, of a promise, one had always in the\nlast resort to make up one’s mind for one’s self.  It was the idea of the\napplication to the particular case, such a splendid one at last, that\ntroubled her, and she admitted that it stirred very deep things.  She\ndidn’t pretend that such a responsibility was a simple matter; if it\n_had_ been she wouldn’t have attempted to saddle me with any portion of\nit.  The Mulvilles were sympathy itself, but were they absolutely candid?\nCould they indeed be, in their position—would it even have been to be\ndesired?  Yes, she had sent for me to ask no less than that of me—whether\nthere was anything dreadful kept back.  She made no allusion whatever to\nGeorge Gravener—I thought her silence the only good taste and her gaiety\nperhaps a part of the very anxiety of that discretion, the effect of a\ndetermination that people shouldn’t know from herself that her relations\nwith the man she was to marry were strained.  All the weight, however,\nthat she left me to throw was a sufficient implication of the weight _he_\nhad thrown in vain.  Oh she knew the question of character was immense,\nand that one couldn’t entertain any plan for making merit comfortable\nwithout running the gauntlet of that terrible procession of\ninterrogation-points which, like a young ladies’ school out for a walk,\nhooked their uniform noses at the tail of governess Conduct.  But were we\nabsolutely to hold that there was never, never, never an exception,\nnever, never, never an occasion for liberal acceptance, for clever\ncharity, for suspended pedantry—for letting one side, in short,\noutbalance another?  When Miss Anvoy threw off this appeal I could have\nembraced her for so delightfully emphasising her unlikeness to Mrs.\nSaltram.  “Why not have the courage of one’s forgiveness,” she asked, “as\nwell as the enthusiasm of one’s adhesion?”\n\n“Seeing how wonderfully you’ve threshed the whole thing out,” I evasively\nreplied, “gives me an extraordinary notion of the point your enthusiasm\nhas reached.”\n\nShe considered this remark an instant with her eyes on mine, and I\ndivined that it struck her I might possibly intend it as a reference to\nsome personal subjection to our fat philosopher, to some aberration of\nsensibility, some perversion of taste.  At least I couldn’t interpret\notherwise the sudden flash that came into her face.  Such a\nmanifestation, as the result of any word of mine, embarrassed me; but\nwhile I was thinking how to reassure her the flush passed away in a smile\nof exquisite good nature.  “Oh you see one forgets so wonderfully how one\ndislikes him!” she said; and if her tone simply extinguished his strange\nfigure with the brush of its compassion, it also rings in my ear to-day\nas the purest of all our praises.  But with what quick response of fine\npity such a relegation of the man himself made me privately sigh “Ah poor\nSaltram!”  She instantly, with this, took the measure of all I didn’t\nbelieve, and it enabled her to go on: “What can one do when a person has\ngiven such a lift to one’s interest in life?”\n\n“Yes, what can one do?”  If I struck her as a little vague it was because\nI was thinking of another person.  I indulged in another inarticulate\nmurmur—“Poor George Gravener!”  What had become of the lift _he_ had\ngiven that interest?  Later on I made up my mind that she was sore and\nstricken at the appearance he presented of wanting the miserable money.\nThis was the hidden reason of her alienation.  The probable sincerity, in\nspite of the illiberality, of his scruples about the particular use of it\nunder discussion didn’t efface the ugliness of his demand that they\nshould buy a good house with it.  Then, as for _his_ alienation, he\ndidn’t, pardonably enough, grasp the lift Frank Saltram had given her\ninterest in life.  If a mere spectator could ask that last question, with\nwhat rage in his heart the man himself might!  He wasn’t, like her, I was\nto see, too proud to show me why he was disappointed.\n\n\n\n\nXI\n\n\nI WAS unable this time to stay to dinner: such at any rate was the plea\non which I took leave.  I desired in truth to get away from my young\nlady, for that obviously helped me not to pretend to satisfy her.  How\n_could_ I satisfy her?  I asked myself—how could I tell her how much had\nbeen kept back?  I didn’t even know and I certainly didn’t desire to\nknow.  My own policy had ever been to learn the least about poor\nSaltram’s weaknesses—not to learn the most.  A great deal that I had in\nfact learned had been forced upon me by his wife.  There was something\neven irritating in Miss Anvoy’s crude conscientiousness, and I wondered\nwhy, after all, she couldn’t have let him alone and been content to\nentrust George Gravener with the purchase of the good house.  I was sure\nhe would have driven a bargain, got something excellent and cheap.  I\nlaughed louder even than she, I temporised, I failed her; I told her I\nmust think over her case.  I professed a horror of responsibilities and\ntwitted her with her own extravagant passion for them.  It wasn’t really\nthat I was afraid of the scandal, the moral discredit for the Fund; what\ntroubled me most was a feeling of a different order.  Of course, as the\nbeneficiary of the Fund was to enjoy a simple life-interest, as it was\nhoped that new beneficiaries would arise and come up to new standards, it\nwouldn’t be a trifle that the first of these worthies shouldn’t have been\na striking example of the domestic virtues.  The Fund would start badly,\nas it were, and the laurel would, in some respects at least, scarcely be\ngreener from the brows of the original wearer.  That idea, however, was\nat that hour, as I have hinted, not the source of solicitude it ought\nperhaps to have been, for I felt less the irregularity of Saltram’s\ngetting the money than that of this exalted young woman’s giving it up.\nI wanted her to have it for herself, and I told her so before I went\naway.  She looked graver at this than she had looked at all, saying she\nhoped such a preference wouldn’t make me dishonest.\n\nIt made me, to begin with, very restless—made me, instead of going\nstraight to the station, fidget a little about that many-coloured Common\nwhich gives Wimbledon horizons.  There was a worry for me to work off, or\nrather keep at a distance, for I declined even to admit to myself that I\nhad, in Miss Anvoy’s phrase, been saddled with it.  What could have been\nclearer indeed than the attitude of recognising perfectly what a world of\ntrouble The Coxon Fund would in future save us, and of yet liking better\nto face a continuance of that trouble than see, and in fact contribute\nto, a deviation from attainable bliss in the life of two other persons in\nwhom I was deeply interested?  Suddenly, at the end of twenty minutes,\nthere was projected across this clearness the image of a massive\nmiddle-aged man seated on a bench under a tree, with sad far-wandering\neyes and plump white hands folded on the head of a stick—a stick I\nrecognised, a stout gold-headed staff that I had given him in devoted\ndays.  I stopped short as he turned his face to me, and it happened that\nfor some reason or other I took in as I had perhaps never done before the\nbeauty of his rich blank gaze.  It was charged with experience as the sky\nis charged with light, and I felt on the instant as if we had been\noverspanned and conjoined by the great arch of a bridge or the great dome\nof a temple.  Doubtless I was rendered peculiarly sensitive to it by\nsomething in the way I had been giving him up and sinking him.  While I\nmet it I stood there smitten, and I felt myself responding to it with a\nsort of guilty grimace.  This brought back his attention in a smile which\nexpressed for me a cheerful weary patience, a bruised noble gentleness.\nI had told Miss Anvoy that he had no dignity, but what did he seem to me,\nall unbuttoned and fatigued as he waited for me to come up, if he didn’t\nseem unconcerned with small things, didn’t seem in short majestic?  There\nwas majesty in his mere unconsciousness of our little conferences and\npuzzlements over his maintenance and his reward.\n\nAfter I had sat by him a few minutes I passed my arm over his big soft\nshoulder—wherever you touched him you found equally little firmness—and\nsaid in a tone of which the suppliance fell oddly on my own ear: “Come\nback to town with me, old friend—come back and spend the evening.”  I\nwanted to hold him, I wanted to keep him, and at Waterloo, an hour later,\nI telegraphed possessively to the Mulvilles.  When he objected, as\nregards staying all night, that he had no things, I asked him if he\nhadn’t everything of mine.  I had abstained from ordering dinner, and it\nwas too late for preliminaries at a club; so we were reduced to tea and\nfried fish at my rooms—reduced also to the transcendent.  Something had\ncome up which made me want him to feel at peace with me—and which,\nprecisely, was all the dear man himself wanted on any occasion.  I had\ntoo often had to press upon him considerations irrelevant, but it gives\nme pleasure now to think that on that particular evening I didn’t even\nmention Mrs. Saltram and the children.  Late into the night we smoked and\ntalked; old shames and old rigours fell away from us; I only let him see\nthat I was conscious of what I owed him.  He was as mild as contrition\nand as copious as faith; he was never so fine as on a shy return, and\neven better at forgiving than at being forgiven.  I dare say it was a\nsmaller matter than that famous night at Wimbledon, the night of the\nproblematical sobriety and of Miss Anvoy’s initiation; but I was as much\nin it on this occasion as I had been out of it then.  At about 1.30 he\nwas sublime.\n\nHe never, in whatever situation, rose till all other risings were over,\nand his breakfasts, at Wimbledon, had always been the principal reason\nmentioned by departing cooks.  The coast was therefore clear for me to\nreceive her when, early the next morning, to my surprise, it was\nannounced to me his wife had called.  I hesitated, after she had come up,\nabout telling her Saltram was in the house, but she herself settled the\nquestion, kept me reticent by drawing forth a sealed letter which,\nlooking at me very hard in the eyes, she placed, with a pregnant absence\nof comment, in my hand.  For a single moment there glimmered before me\nthe fond hope that Mrs. Saltram had tendered me, as it were, her\nresignation and desired to embody the act in an unsparing form.  To bring\nthis about I would have feigned any humiliation; but after my eyes had\ncaught the superscription I heard myself say with a flatness that\nbetrayed a sense of something very different from relief: “Oh the\nPudneys!”  I knew their envelopes though they didn’t know mine.  They\nalways used the kind sold at post-offices with the stamp affixed, and as\nthis letter hadn’t been posted they had wasted a penny on me.  I had seen\ntheir horrid missives to the Mulvilles, but hadn’t been in direct\ncorrespondence with them.\n\n“They enclosed it to me, to be delivered.  They doubtless explain to you\nthat they hadn’t your address.”\n\nI turned the thing over without opening it.  “Why in the world should\nthey write to me?”\n\n“Because they’ve something to tell you.  The worst,” Mrs. Saltram dryly\nadded.\n\nIt was another chapter, I felt, of the history of their lamentable\nquarrel with her husband, the episode in which, vindictively,\ndisingenuously as they themselves had behaved, one had to admit that he\nhad put himself more grossly in the wrong than at any moment of his life.\nHe had begun by insulting the matchless Mulvilles for these more specious\nprotectors, and then, according to his wont at the end of a few months,\nhad dug a still deeper ditch for his aberration than the chasm left\nyawning behind.  The chasm at Wimbledon was now blessedly closed; but the\nPudneys, across their persistent gulf, kept up the nastiest fire.  I\nnever doubted they had a strong case, and I had been from the first for\nnot defending him—reasoning that if they weren’t contradicted they’d\nperhaps subside.  This was above all what I wanted, and I so far\nprevailed that I did arrest the correspondence in time to save our little\ncircle an infliction heavier than it perhaps would have borne.  I knew,\nthat is I divined, that their allegations had gone as yet only as far as\ntheir courage, conscious as they were in their own virtue of an exposed\nplace in which Saltram could have planted a blow.  It was a question with\nthem whether a man who had himself so much to cover up would dare his\nblow; so that these vessels of rancour were in a manner afraid of each\nother.  I judged that on the day the Pudneys should cease for some reason\nor other to be afraid they would treat us to some revelation more\ndisconcerting than any of its predecessors.  As I held Mrs. Saltram’s\nletter in my hand it was distinctly communicated to me that the day had\ncome—they had ceased to be afraid.  “I don’t want to know the worst,” I\npresently declared.\n\n“You’ll have to open the letter.  It also contains an enclosure.”\n\nI felt it—it was fat and uncanny.  “Wheels within wheels!” I exclaimed.\n“There’s something for me too to deliver.”\n\n“So they tell me—to Miss Anvoy.”\n\nI stared; I felt a certain thrill.  “Why don’t they send it to her\ndirectly?”\n\nMrs. Saltram hung fire.  “Because she’s staying with Mr. and Mrs.\nMulville.”\n\n“And why should that prevent?”\n\nAgain my visitor faltered, and I began to reflect on the grotesque, the\nunconscious perversity of her action.  I was the only person save George\nGravener and the Mulvilles who was aware of Sir Gregory Coxon’s and of\nMiss Anvoy’s strange bounty.  Where could there have been a more signal\nillustration of the clumsiness of human affairs than her having\ncomplacently selected this moment to fly in the face of it?  “There’s the\nchance of their seeing her letters.  They know Mr. Pudney’s hand.”\n\nStill I didn’t understand; then it flashed upon me.  “You mean they might\nintercept it?  How can you imply anything so base?” I indignantly\ndemanded.\n\n“It’s not I—it’s Mr. Pudney!” cried Mrs. Saltram with a flush.  “It’s his\nown idea.”\n\n“Then why couldn’t he send the letter to you to be delivered?”\n\nMrs. Saltram’s embarrassment increased; she gave me another hard look.\n“You must make that out for yourself.”\n\nI made it out quickly enough.  “It’s a denunciation?”\n\n“A real lady doesn’t betray her husband!” this virtuous woman exclaimed.\n\nI burst out laughing, and I fear my laugh may have had an effect of\nimpertinence.  “Especially to Miss Anvoy, who’s so easily shocked? Why do\nsuch things concern _her_?” I asked, much at a loss.\n\n“Because she’s there, exposed to all his craft.  Mr. and Mrs. Pudney have\nbeen watching this: they feel she may be taken in.”\n\n“Thank you for all the rest of us!  What difference can it make when she\nhas lost her power to contribute?”\n\nAgain Mrs. Saltram considered; then very nobly: “There are other things\nin the world than money.”  This hadn’t occurred to her so long as the\nyoung lady had any; but she now added, with a glance at my letter, that\nMr. and Mrs. Pudney doubtless explained their motives.  “It’s all in\nkindness,” she continued as she got up.\n\n“Kindness to Miss Anvoy?  You took, on the whole, another view of\nkindness before her reverses.”\n\nMy companion smiled with some acidity “Perhaps you’re no safer than the\nMulvilles!”\n\nI didn’t want her to think that, nor that she should report to the\nPudneys that they had not been happy in their agent; and I well remember\nthat this was the moment at which I began, with considerable emotion, to\npromise myself to enjoin upon Miss Anvoy never to open any letter that\nshould come to her in one of those penny envelopes.  My emotion, and I\nfear I must add my confusion, quickly deepened; I presently should have\nbeen as glad to frighten Mrs. Saltram as to think I might by some\ndiplomacy restore the Pudneys to a quieter vigilance.\n\n“It’s best you should take _my_ view of my safety,” I at any rate soon\nresponded.  When I saw she didn’t know what I meant by this I added: “You\nmay turn out to have done, in bringing me this letter, a thing you’ll\nprofoundly regret.”  My tone had a significance which, I could see, did\nmake her uneasy, and there was a moment, after I had made two or three\nmore remarks of studiously bewildering effect, at which her eyes followed\nso hungrily the little flourish of the letter with which I emphasised\nthem that I instinctively slipped Mr. Pudney’s communication into my\npocket.  She looked, in her embarrassed annoyance, capable of grabbing it\nto send it back to him.  I felt, after she had gone, as if I had almost\ngiven her my word I wouldn’t deliver the enclosure.  The passionate\nmovement, at any rate, with which, in solitude, I transferred the whole\nthing, unopened, from my pocket to a drawer which I double-locked would\nhave amounted, for an initiated observer, to some such pledge.\n\n\n\n\nXII\n\n\nMRS. SALTRAM left me drawing my breath more quickly and indeed almost in\npain—as if I had just perilously grazed the loss of something precious.\nI didn’t quite know what it was—it had a shocking resemblance to my\nhonour.  The emotion was the livelier surely in that my pulses even yet\nvibrated to the pleasure with which, the night before, I had rallied to\nthe rare analyst, the great intellectual adventurer and pathfinder.  What\nhad dropped from me like a cumbersome garment as Saltram appeared before\nme in the afternoon on the heath was the disposition to haggle over his\nvalue.  Hang it, one had to choose, one had to put that value somewhere;\nso I would put it really high and have done with it.  Mrs. Mulville drove\nin for him at a discreet hour—the earliest she could suppose him to have\ngot up; and I learned that Miss Anvoy would also have come had she not\nbeen expecting a visit from Mr. Gravener.  I was perfectly mindful that I\nwas under bonds to see this young lady, and also that I had a letter to\nhand to her; but I took my time, I waited from day to day.  I left Mrs.\nSaltram to deal as her apprehensions should prompt with the Pudneys.  I\nknew at last what I meant—I had ceased to wince at my responsibility.  I\ngave this supreme impression of Saltram time to fade if it would; but it\ndidn’t fade, and, individually, it hasn’t faded even now.  During the\nmonth that I thus invited myself to stiffen again, Adelaide Mulville,\nperplexed by my absence, wrote to me to ask why I _was_ so stiff.  At\nthat season of the year I was usually oftener “with” them.  She also\nwrote that she feared a real estrangement had set in between Mr. Gravener\nand her sweet young friend—a state of things but half satisfactory to her\nso long as the advantage resulting to Mr. Saltram failed to disengage\nitself from the merely nebulous state.  She intimated that her sweet\nyoung friend was, if anything, a trifle too reserved; she also intimated\nthat there might now be an opening for another clever young man.  There\nnever was the slightest opening, I may here parenthesise, and of course\nthe question can’t come up to-day.  These are old frustrations now.  Ruth\nAnvoy hasn’t married, I hear, and neither have I.  During the month,\ntoward the end, I wrote to George Gravener to ask if, on a special\nerrand, I might come to see him, and his answer was to knock the very\nnext day at my door.  I saw he had immediately connected my enquiry with\nthe talk we had had in the railway-carriage, and his promptitude showed\nthat the ashes of his eagerness weren’t yet cold.  I told him there was\nsomething I felt I ought in candour to let him know—I recognised the\nobligation his friendly confidence had laid on me.\n\n“You mean Miss Anvoy has talked to you?  She has told me so herself,” he\nsaid.\n\n“It wasn’t to tell you so that I wanted to see you,” I replied; “for it\nseemed to me that such a communication would rest wholly with herself.\nIf however she did speak to you of our conversation she probably told you\nI was discouraging.”\n\n“Discouraging?”\n\n“On the subject of a present application of The Coxon Fund.”\n\n“To the case of Mr. Saltram?  My dear fellow, I don’t know what you call\ndiscouraging!” Gravener cried.\n\n“Well I thought I was, and I thought she thought I was.”\n\n“I believe she did, but such a thing’s measured by the effect.  She’s not\n‘discouraged,’” he said.\n\n“That’s her own affair.  The reason I asked you to see me was that it\nappeared to me I ought to tell you frankly that—decidedly!—I can’t\nundertake to produce that effect.  In fact I don’t want to!”\n\n“It’s very good of you, damn you!” my visitor laughed, red and really\ngrave.  Then he said: “You’d like to see that scoundrel publicly\nglorified—perched on the pedestal of a great complimentary pension?”\n\nI braced myself.  “Taking one form of public recognition with another it\nseems to me on the whole I should be able to bear it.  When I see the\ncompliments that _are_ paid right and left I ask myself why this one\nshouldn’t take its course.  This therefore is what you’re entitled to\nhave looked to me to mention to you.  I’ve some evidence that perhaps\nwould be really dissuasive, but I propose to invite Mss Anvoy to remain\nin ignorance of it.”\n\n“And to invite me to do the same?”\n\n“Oh you don’t require it—you’ve evidence enough.  I speak of a sealed\nletter that I’ve been requested to deliver to her.”\n\n“And you don’t mean to?”\n\n“There’s only one consideration that would make me,” I said.\n\nGravener’s clear handsome eyes plunged into mine a minute, but evidently\nwithout fishing up a clue to this motive—a failure by which I was almost\nwounded.  “What does the letter contain?”\n\n“It’s sealed, as I tell you, and I don’t know what it contains.”\n\n“Why is it sent through you?”\n\n“Rather than you?” I wondered how to put the thing.  “The only\nexplanation I can think of is that the person sending it may have\nimagined your relations with Miss Anvoy to be at an end—may have been\ntold this is the case by Mrs. Saltram.”\n\n“My relations with Miss Anvoy are not at an end,” poor Gravener\nstammered.\n\nAgain for an instant I thought.  “The offer I propose to make you gives\nme the right to address you a question remarkably direct.  Are you still\nengaged to Miss Anvoy?”\n\n“No, I’m not,” he slowly brought out.  “But we’re perfectly good\nfriends.”\n\n“Such good friends that you’ll again become prospective husband and wife\nif the obstacle in your path be removed?”\n\n“Removed?” he anxiously repeated.\n\n“If I send Miss Anvoy the letter I speak of she may give up her idea.”\n\n“Then for God’s sake send it!”\n\n“I’ll do so if you’re ready to assure me that her sacrifice would now\npresumably bring about your marriage.”\n\n“I’d marry her the next day!” my visitor cried.\n\n“Yes, but would she marry _you_?  What I ask of you of course is nothing\nless than your word of honour as to your conviction of this.  If you give\nit me,” I said, “I’ll engage to hand her the letter before night.”\n\nGravener took up his hat; turning it mechanically round he stood looking\na moment hard at its unruffled perfection.  Then very angrily honestly\nand gallantly, “Hand it to the devil!” he broke out; with which he\nclapped the hat on his head and left me.\n\n“Will you read it or not?” I said to Ruth Anvoy, at Wimbledon, when I had\ntold her the story of Mrs. Saltram’s visit.\n\nShe debated for a time probably of the briefest, but long enough to make\nme nervous.  “Have you brought it with you?”\n\n“No indeed.  It’s at home, locked up.”\n\nThere was another great silence, and then she said “Go back and destroy\nit.”\n\nI went back, but I didn’t destroy it till after Saltram’s death, when I\nburnt it unread.  The Pudneys approached her again pressingly, but,\nprompt as they were, The Coxon Fund had already become an operative\nbenefit and a general amaze: Mr. Saltram, while we gathered about, as it\nwere, to watch the manna descend, had begun to draw the magnificent\nincome.  He drew it as he had always drawn everything, with a grand\nabstracted gesture.  Its magnificence, alas, as all the world now knows,\nquite quenched him; it was the beginning of his decline.  It was also\nnaturally a new grievance for his wife, who began to believe in him as\nsoon as he was blighted, and who at this hour accuses us of having bribed\nhim, on the whim of a meddlesome American, to renounce his glorious\noffice, to become, as she says, like everybody else.  The very day he\nfound himself able to publish he wholly ceased to produce.  This deprived\nus, as may easily be imagined, of much of our occupation, and especially\ndeprived the Mulvilles, whose want of self-support I never measured till\nthey lost their great inmate.  They’ve no one to live on now.  Adelaide’s\nmost frequent reference to their destitution is embodied in the remark\nthat dear far-away Ruth’s intentions were doubtless good.  She and Kent\nare even yet looking for another prop, but no one presents a true sphere\nof usefulness.  They complain that people are self-sufficing.  With\nSaltram the fine type of the child of adoption was scattered, the\ngrander, the elder style.  They’ve got their carriage back, but what’s an\nempty carriage?  In short I think we were all happier as well as poorer\nbefore; even including George Gravener, who by the deaths of his brother\nand his nephew has lately become Lord Maddock.  His wife, whose fortune\nclears the property, is criminally dull; he hates being in the Upper\nHouse, and hasn’t yet had high office.  But what are these accidents,\nwhich I should perhaps apologise for mentioning, in the light of the\ngreat eventual boon promised the patient by the rate at which The Coxon\nFund must be rolling up?", "answers": ["She is an American."], "length": 22692, "dataset": "narrativeqa", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "58b8a46c20c05540367b90490846c4f9808db630026b28d4"}

and she\n As many star-beams, ere their lamps could dwindle\n In the belated moon, wound skilfully;                         _150\n And with these threads a subtle veil she wove--\n A shadow for the splendour of her love.\n\n 14.\n The deep recesses of her odorous dwelling\n Were stored with magic treasures--sounds of air,\n Which had the power all spirits of compelling,                _155\n Folded in cells of crystal silence there;\n Such as we hear in youth, and think the feeling\n Will never die--yet ere we are aware,\n The feeling and the sound are fled and gone,\n And the regret they leave remains alone.                      _160\n\n 15.\n And there lay Visions swift, and sweet, and quaint,\n Each in its thin sheath, like a chrysalis,\n Some eager to burst forth, some weak and faint\n With the soft burthen of intensest bliss.\n It was its work to bear to many a saint                       _165\n Whose heart adores the shrine which holiest is,\n Even Love's:--and others white, green, gray, and black,\n And of all shapes--and each was at her beck.\n\n 16.\n And odours in a kind of aviary\n Of ever-blooming Eden-trees she kept,                         _170\n Clipped in a floating net, a love-sick Fairy\n Had woven from dew-beams while the moon yet slept;\n As bats at the wired window of a dairy,\n They beat their vans; and each was an adept,\n When loosed and missioned, making wings of winds,             _175\n To stir sweet thoughts or sad, in destined minds.\n\n 17.\n And liquors clear and sweet, whose healthful might\n Could medicine the sick soul to happy sleep,\n And change eternal death into a night\n Of glorious dreams--or if eyes needs must weep,               _180\n Could make their tears all wonder and delight,\n She in her crystal vials did closely keep:\n If men could drink of those clear vials, 'tis said\n The living were not envied of the dead.\n\n 18.\n Her cave was stored with scrolls of strange device,           _185\n The works of some Saturnian Archimage,\n Which taught the expiations at whose price\n Men from the Gods might win that happy age\n Too lightly lost, redeeming native vice;\n And which might quench the Earth-consuming rage               _190\n Of gold and blood--till men should live and move\n Harmonious as the sacred stars above;\n\n 19.\n And how all things that seem untameable,\n Not to be checked and not to be confined,\n Obey the spells of Wisdom's wizard skill;                     _195\n Time, earth, and fire--the ocean and the wind,\n And all their shapes--and man's imperial will;\n And other scrolls whose writings did unbind\n The inmost lore of Love--let the profane\n Tremble to ask what secrets they contain.                     _200\n\n 20.\n And wondrous works of substances unknown,\n To which the enchantment of her father's power\n Had changed those ragged blocks of savage stone,\n Were heaped in the recesses of her bower;\n Carved lamps and chalices, and vials which shone              _205\n In their own golden beams--each like a flower,\n Out of whose depth a fire-fly shakes his light\n Under a cypress in a starless night.\n\n 21.\n At first she lived alone in this wild home,\n And her own thoughts were each a minister,                    _210\n Clothing themselves, or with the ocean foam,\n Or with the wind, or with the speed of fire,\n To work whatever purposes might come\n Into her mind; such power her mighty Sire\n Had girt them with, whether to fly or run,                    _215\n Through all the regions which he shines upon.\n\n 22.\n The Ocean-nymphs and Hamadryades,\n Oreads and Naiads, with long weedy locks,\n Offered to do her bidding through the seas,\n Under the earth, and in the hollow rocks,                     _220\n And far beneath the matted roots of trees,\n And in the gnarled heart of stubborn oaks,\n So they might live for ever in the light\n Of her sweet presence--each a satellite.\n\n 23.\n 'This may not be,' the wizard maid replied;                   _225\n 'The fountains where the Naiades bedew\n Their shining hair, at length are drained and dried;\n The solid oaks forget their strength, and strew\n Their latest leaf upon the mountains wide;\n The boundless ocean like a drop of dew                        _230\n Will be consumed--the stubborn centre must\n Be scattered, like a cloud of summer dust.\n\n 24.\n 'And ye with them will perish, one by one;--\n If I must sigh to think that this shall be,\n If I must weep when the surviving Sun                         _235\n Shall smile on your decay--oh, ask not me\n To love you till your little race is run;\n I cannot die as ye must--over me\n Your leaves shall glance--the streams in which ye dwell\n Shall be my paths henceforth, and so--farewell!'--            _240\n\n 25.\n She spoke and wept:--the dark and azure well\n Sparkled beneath the shower of her bright tears,\n And every little circlet where they fell\n Flung to the cavern-roof inconstant spheres\n And intertangled lines of light:--a knell                     _245\n Of sobbing voices came upon her ears\n From those departing Forms, o'er the serene\n Of the white streams and of the forest green.\n\n 26.\n All day the wizard lady sate aloof,\n Spelling out scrolls of dread antiquity,                      _250\n Under the cavern's fountain-lighted roof;\n Or broidering the pictured poesy\n Of some high tale upon her growing woof,\n Which the sweet splendour of her smiles could dye\n In hues outshining heaven--and ever she                       _255\n Added some grace to the wrought poesy.\n\n 27.\n While on her hearth lay blazing many a piece\n Of sandal wood, rare gums, and cinnamon;\n Men scarcely know how beautiful fire is--\n Each flame of it is as a precious stone                       _260\n Dissolved in ever-moving light, and this\n Belongs to each and all who gaze upon.\n The Witch beheld it not, for in her hand\n She held a woof that dimmed the burning brand.\n\n 28.\n This lady never slept, but lay in trance                      _265\n All night within the fountain--as in sleep.\n Its emerald crags glowed in her beauty's glance;\n Through the green splendour of the water deep\n She saw the constellations reel and dance\n Like fire-flies--and withal did ever keep                     _270\n The tenour of her contemplations calm,\n With open eyes, closed feet, and folded palm.\n\n 29.\n And when the whirlwinds and the clouds descended\n From the white pinnacles of that cold hill,\n She passed at dewfall to a space extended,                    _275\n Where in a lawn of flowering asphodel\n Amid a wood of pines and cedars blended,\n There yawned an inextinguishable well\n Of crimson fire--full even to the brim,\n And overflowing all the margin trim.                          _280\n\n 30.\n Within the which she lay when the fierce war\n Of wintry winds shook that innocuous liquor\n In many a mimic moon and bearded star\n O'er woods and lawns;--the serpent heard it flicker\n In sleep, and dreaming still, he crept afar--                 _285\n And when the windless snow descended thicker\n Than autumn leaves, she watched it as it came\n Melt on the surface of the level flame.\n\n 31.\n She had a boat, which some say Vulcan wrought\n For Venus, as the chariot of her star;                        _290\n But it was found too feeble to be fraught\n With all the ardours in that sphere which are,\n And so she sold it, and Apollo bought\n And gave it to this daughter: from a car\n Changed to the fairest and the lightest boat                  _295\n Which ever upon mortal stream did float.\n\n 32.\n And others say, that, when but three hours old,\n The first-born Love out of his cradle lept,\n And clove dun Chaos with his wings of gold,\n And like a horticultural adept,                               _300\n Stole a strange seed, and wrapped it up in mould,\n And sowed it in his mother's star, and kept\n Watering it all the summer with sweet dew,\n And with his wings fanning it as it grew.\n\n 33.\n The plant grew strong and green, the snowy flower             _305\n Fell, and the long and gourd-like fruit began\n To turn the light and dew by inward power\n To its own substance; woven tracery ran\n Of light firm texture, ribbed and branching, o'er\n The solid rind, like a leaf's veined fan--                    _310\n Of which Love scooped this boat--and with soft motion\n Piloted it round the circumfluous ocean.\n\n 34.\n This boat she moored upon her fount, and lit\n A living spirit within all its frame,\n Breathing the soul of swiftness into it.                      _315\n Couched on the fountain like a panther tame,\n One of the twain at Evan's feet that sit--\n Or as on Vesta's sceptre a swift flame--\n Or on blind Homer's heart a winged thought,--\n In joyous expectation lay the boat.                           _320\n\n 35.\n Then by strange art she kneaded fire and snow\n Together, tempering the repugnant mass\n With liquid love--all things together grow\n Through which the harmony of love can pass;\n And a fair Shape out of her hands did flow--                  _325\n A living Image, which did far surpass\n In beauty that bright shape of vital stone\n Which drew the heart out of Pygmalion.\n\n 36.\n A sexless thing it was, and in its growth\n It seemed to have developed no defect                         _330\n Of either sex, yet all the grace of both,--\n In gentleness and strength its limbs were decked;\n The bosom swelled lightly with its full youth,\n The countenance was such as might select\n Some artist that his skill should never die,                  _335\n Imaging forth such perfect purity.\n\n 37.\n From its smooth shoulders hung two rapid wings,\n Fit to have borne it to the seventh sphere,\n Tipped with the speed of liquid lightenings,\n Dyed in the ardours of the atmosphere:                        _340\n She led her creature to the boiling springs\n Where the light boat was moored, and said: 'Sit here!'\n And pointed to the prow, and took her seat\n Beside the rudder, with opposing feet.\n\n 38.\n And down the streams which clove those mountains vast,        _345\n Around their inland islets, and amid\n The panther-peopled forests whose shade cast\n Darkness and odours, and a pleasure hid\n In melancholy gloom, the pinnace passed;\n By many a star-surrounded pyramid                             _350\n Of icy crag cleaving the purple sky,\n And caverns yawning round unfathomably.\n\n 39.\n The silver noon into that winding dell,\n With slanted gleam athwart the forest tops,\n Tempered like golden evening, feebly fell;                    _355\n A green and glowing light, like that which drops\n From folded lilies in which glow-worms dwell,\n When Earth over her face Night's mantle wraps;\n Between the severed mountains lay on high,\n Over the stream, a narrow rift of sky.                        _360\n\n 40.\n And ever as she went, the Image lay\n With folded wings and unawakened eyes;\n And o'er its gentle countenance did play\n The busy dreams, as thick as summer flies,\n Chasing the rapid smiles that would not stay,                 _365\n And drinking the warm tears, and the sweet sighs\n Inhaling, which, with busy murmur vain,\n They had aroused from that full heart and brain.\n\n 41.\n And ever down the prone vale, like a cloud\n Upon a stream of wind, the pinnace went:                      _370\n Now lingering on the pools, in which abode\n The calm and darkness of the deep content\n In which they paused; now o'er the shallow road\n Of white and dancing waters, all besprent\n With sand and polished pebbles:--mortal boat                  _375\n In such a shallow rapid could not float.\n\n 42.\n And down the earthquaking cataracts which shiver\n Their snow-like waters into golden air,\n Or under chasms unfathomable ever\n Sepulchre them, till in their rage they tear                  _380\n A subterranean portal for the river,\n It fled--the circling sunbows did upbear\n Its fall down the hoar precipice of spray,\n Lighting it far upon its lampless way.\n\n 43.\n And when the wizard lady would ascend                         _385\n The labyrinths of some many-winding vale,\n Which to the inmost mountain upward tend--\n She called 'Hermaphroditus!'--and the pale\n And heavy hue which slumber could extend\n Over its lips and eyes, as on the gale                        _390\n A rapid shadow from a slope of grass,\n Into the darkness of the stream did pass.\n\n 44.\n And it unfurled its heaven-coloured pinions,\n With stars of fire spotting the stream below;\n And from above into the Sun's dominions                       _395\n Flinging a glory, like the golden glow\n In which Spring clothes her emerald-winged minions,\n All interwoven with fine feathery snow\n And moonlight splendour of intensest rime,\n With which frost paints the pines in winter time.             _400\n\n 45.\n And then it winnowed the Elysian air\n Which ever hung about that lady bright,\n With its aethereal vans--and speeding there,\n Like a star up the torrent of the night,\n Or a swift eagle in the morning glare                         _405\n Breasting the whirlwind with impetuous flight,\n The pinnace, oared by those enchanted wings,\n Clove the fierce streams towards their upper springs.\n\n 46.\n The water flashed, like sunlight by the prow\n Of a noon-wandering meteor flung to Heaven;                   _410\n The still air seemed as if its waves did flow\n In tempest down the mountains; loosely driven\n The lady's radiant hair streamed to and fro:\n Beneath, the billows having vainly striven\n Indignant and impetuous, roared to feel                       _415\n The swift and steady motion of the keel.\n\n 47.\n Or, when the weary moon was in the wane,\n Or in the noon of interlunar night,\n The lady-witch in visions could not chain\n Her spirit; but sailed forth under the light                  _420\n Of shooting stars, and bade extend amain\n Its storm-outspeeding wings, the Hermaphrodite;\n She to the Austral waters took her way,\n Beyond the fabulous Thamondocana,--\n\n 48.\n Where, like a meadow which no scythe has shaven,              _425\n Which rain could never bend, or whirl-blast shake,\n With the Antarctic constellations paven,\n Canopus and his crew, lay the Austral lake--\n There she would build herself a windless haven\n Out of the clouds whose moving turrets make                   _430\n The bastions of the storm, when through the sky\n The spirits of the tempest thundered by:\n\n 49.\n A haven beneath whose translucent floor\n The tremulous stars sparkled unfathomably,\n And around which the solid vapours hoar,                      _435\n Based on the level waters, to the sky\n Lifted their dreadful crags, and like a shore\n Of wintry mountains, inaccessibly\n Hemmed in with rifts and precipices gray,\n And hanging crags, many a cove and bay.                       _440\n\n 50.\n And whilst the outer lake beneath the lash\n Of the wind's scourge, foamed like a wounded thing,\n And the incessant hail with stony clash\n Ploughed up the waters, and the flagging wing\n Of the roused cormorant in the lightning flash                _445\n Looked like the wreck of some wind-wandering\n Fragment of inky thunder-smoke--this haven\n Was as a gem to copy Heaven engraven,--\n\n 51.\n On which that lady played her many pranks,\n Circling the image of a shooting star,                        _450\n Even as a tiger on Hydaspes' banks\n Outspeeds the antelopes which speediest are,\n In her light boat; and many quips and cranks\n She played upon the water, till the car\n Of the late moon, like a sick matron wan,                     _455\n To journey from the misty east began.\n\n 52.\n And then she called out of the hollow turrets\n Of those high clouds, white, golden and vermilion,\n The armies of her ministering spirits--\n In mighty legions, million after million,                     _460\n They came, each troop emblazoning its merits\n On meteor flags; and many a proud pavilion\n Of the intertexture of the atmosphere\n They pitched upon the plain of the calm mere.\n\n 53.\n They framed the imperial tent of their great Queen            _465\n Of woven exhalations, underlaid\n With lambent lightning-fire, as may be seen\n A dome of thin and open ivory inlaid\n With crimson silk--cressets from the serene\n Hung there, and on the water for her tread                    _470\n A tapestry of fleece-like mist was strewn,\n Dyed in the beams of the ascending moon.\n\n 54.\n And on a throne o'erlaid with starlight, caught\n Upon those wandering isles of aery dew,\n Which highest shoals of mountain shipwreck not,               _475\n She sate, and heard all that had happened new\n Between the earth and moon, since they had brought\n The last intelligence--and now she grew\n Pale as that moon, lost in the watery night--\n And now she wept, and now she laughed outright.               _480\n\n 55.\n These were tame pleasures; she would often climb\n The steepest ladder of the crudded rack\n Up to some beaked cape of cloud sublime,\n And like Arion on the dolphin's back\n Ride singing through the shoreless air;--oft-time             _485\n Following the serpent lightning's winding track,\n She ran upon the platforms of the wind,\n And laughed to hear the fire-balls roar behind.\n\n 56.\n And sometimes to those streams of upper air\n Which whirl the earth in its diurnal round,                   _490\n She would ascend, and win the spirits there\n To let her join their chorus. Mortals found\n That on those days the sky was calm and fair,\n And mystic snatches of harmonious sound\n Wandered upon the earth where'er she passed,                  _495\n And happy thoughts of hope, too sweet to last.\n\n 57.\n But her choice sport was, in the hours of sleep,\n To glide adown old Nilus, where he threads\n Egypt and Aethiopia, from the steep\n Of utmost Axume, until he spreads,                            _500\n Like a calm flock of silver-fleeced sheep,\n His waters on the plain: and crested heads\n Of cities and proud temples gleam amid,\n And many a vapour-belted pyramid.\n\n 58.\n By Moeris and the Mareotid lakes,                             _505\n Strewn with faint blooms like bridal chamber floors,\n Where naked boys bridling tame water-snakes,\n Or charioteering ghastly alligators,\n Had left on the sweet waters mighty wakes\n Of those huge forms--within the brazen doors                  _510\n Of the great Labyrinth slept both boy and beast,\n Tired with the pomp of their Osirian feast.\n\n 59.\n And where within the surface of the river\n The shadows of the massy temples lie,\n And never are erased--but tremble ever                        _515\n Like things which every cloud can doom to die,\n Through lotus-paven canals, and wheresoever\n The works of man pierced that serenest sky\n With tombs, and towers, and fanes, 'twas her delight\n To wander in the shadow of the night.                         _520\n\n 60.\n With motion like the spirit of that wind\n Whose soft step deepens slumber, her light feet\n Passed through the peopled haunts of humankind.\n Scattering sweet visions from her presence sweet,\n Through fane, and palace-court, and labyrinth mined           _525\n With many a dark and subterranean street\n Under the Nile, through chambers high and deep\n She passed, observing mortals in their sleep.\n\n 61.\n A pleasure sweet doubtless it was to see\n Mortals subdued in all the shapes of sleep.                   _530\n Here lay two sister twins in infancy;\n There, a lone youth who in his dreams did weep;\n Within, two lovers linked innocently\n In their loose locks which over both did creep\n Like ivy from one stem;--and there lay calm                   _535\n Old age with snow-bright hair and folded palm.\n\n 62.\n But other troubled forms of sleep she saw,\n Not to be mirrored in a holy song--\n Distortions foul of supernatural awe,\n And pale imaginings of visioned wrong;                        _540\n And all the code of Custom's lawless law\n Written upon the brows of old and young:\n 'This,' said the wizard maiden, 'is the strife\n Which stirs the liquid surface of man's life.'\n\n 63.\n And little did the sight disturb her soul.--                  _545\n We, the weak mariners of that wide lake\n Where'er its shores extend or billows roll,\n Our course unpiloted and starless make\n O'er its wild surface to an unknown goal:--\n But she in the calm depths her way could take,                _550\n Where in bright bowers immortal forms abide\n Beneath the weltering of the restless tide.\n\n 64.\n And she saw princes couched under the glow\n Of sunlike gems; and round each temple-court\n In dormitories ranged, row after row,                         _555\n She saw the priests asleep--all of one sort--\n For all were educated to be so.--\n The peasants in their huts, and in the port\n The sailors she saw cradled on the waves,\n And the dead lulled within their dreamless graves.            _560\n\n 65.\n And all the forms in which those spirits lay\n Were to her sight like the diaphanous\n Veils, in which those sweet ladies oft array\n Their delicate limbs, who would conceal from us\n Only their scorn of all concealment: they                     _565\n Move in the light of their own beauty thus.\n But these and all now lay with sleep upon them,\n And little thought a Witch was looking on them.\n\n 66.\n She, all those human figures breathing there,\n Beheld as living spirits--to her eyes                         _570\n The naked beauty of the soul lay bare,\n And often through a rude and worn disguise\n She saw the inner form most bright and fair--\n And then she had a charm of strange device,\n Which, murmured on mute lips with tender tone,                _575\n Could make that spirit mingle with her own.\n\n 67.\n Alas! Aurora, what wouldst thou have given\n For such a charm when Tithon became gray?\n Or how much, Venus, of thy silver heaven\n Wouldst thou have yielded, ere Proserpina                     _580\n Had half (oh! why not all?) the debt forgiven\n Which dear Adonis had been doomed to pay,\n To any witch who would have taught you it?\n The Heliad doth not know its value yet.\n\n 68.\n 'Tis said in after times her spirit free                      _585\n Knew what love was, and felt itself alone--\n But holy Dian could not chaster be\n Before she stooped to kiss Endymion,\n Than now this lady--like a sexless bee\n Tasting all blossoms, and confined to none,                   _590\n Among those mortal forms, the wizard-maiden\n Passed with an eye serene and heart unladen.\n\n 69.\n To those she saw most beautiful, she gave\n Strange panacea in a crystal bowl:--\n They drank in their deep sleep of that sweet wave,            _595\n And lived thenceforward as if some control,\n Mightier than life, were in them; and the grave\n Of such, when death oppressed the weary soul,\n Was as a green and overarching bower\n Lit by the gems of many a starry flower.                      _600\n\n 70.\n For on the night when they were buried, she\n Restored the embalmers' ruining, and shook\n The light out of the funeral lamps, to be\n A mimic day within that deathy nook;\n And she unwound the woven imagery                             _605\n Of second childhood's swaddling bands, and took\n The coffin, its last cradle, from its niche,\n And threw it with contempt into a ditch.\n\n 71.\n And there the body lay, age after age.\n Mute, breathing, beating, warm, and undecaying,               _610\n Like one asleep in a green hermitage,\n With gentle smiles about its eyelids playing,\n And living in its dreams beyond the rage\n Of death or life; while they were still arraying\n In liveries ever new, the rapid, blind                        _615\n And fleeting generations of mankind.\n\n 72.\n And she would write strange dreams upon the brain\n Of those who were less beautiful, and make\n All harsh and crooked purposes more vain\n Than in the desert is the serpent's wake                      _620\n Which the sand covers--all his evil gain\n The miser in such dreams would rise and shake\n Into a beggar's lap;--the lying scribe\n Would his own lies betray without a bribe.\n\n 73.\n The priests would write an explanation full,                  _625\n Translating hieroglyphics into Greek,\n How the God Apis really was a bull,\n And nothing more; and bid the herald stick\n The same against the temple doors, and pull\n The old cant down; they licensed all to speak                 _630\n Whate'er they thought of hawks, and cats, and geese,\n By pastoral letters to each diocese.\n\n 74.\n The king would dress an ape up in his crown\n And robes, and seat him on his glorious seat,\n And on the right hand of the sunlike throne                   _635\n Would place a gaudy mock-bird to repeat\n The chatterings of the monkey.--Every one\n Of the prone courtiers crawled to kiss the feet\n Of their great Emperor, when the morning came,\n And kissed--alas, how many kiss the same!                     _640\n\n 75.\n The soldiers dreamed that they were blacksmiths, and\n Walked out of quarters in somnambulism;\n Round the red anvils you might see them stand\n Like Cyclopses in Vulcan's sooty abysm,\n Beating their swords to ploughshares;--in a band              _645\n The gaolers sent those of the liberal schism\n Free through the streets of Memphis, much, I wis,\n To the annoyance of king Amasis.\n\n 76.\n And timid lovers who had been so coy,\n They hardly knew whether they loved or not,                   _650\n Would rise out of their rest, and take sweet joy,\n To the fulfilment of their inmost thought;\n And when next day the maiden and the boy\n Met one another, both, like sinners caught,\n Blushed at the thing which each believed was done             _655\n Only in fancy--till the tenth moon shone;\n\n 77.\n And then the Witch would let them take no ill:\n Of many thousand schemes which lovers find,\n The Witch found one,--and so they took their fill\n Of happiness in marriage warm and kind.                       _660\n Friends who, by practice of some envious skill,\n Were torn apart--a wide wound, mind from mind!--\n She did unite again with visions clear\n Of deep affection and of truth sincere.\n\n 80.\n These were the pranks she played among the cities             _665\n Of mortal men, and what she did to Sprites\n And Gods, entangling them in her sweet ditties\n To do her will, and show their subtle sleights,\n I will declare another time; for it is\n A tale more fit for the weird winter nights                   _670\n Than for these garish summer days, when we\n Scarcely believe much more than we can see.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Witch of Atlas, by Percy Bysshe Shelley", "answers": ["The scribe."], "length": 5403, "dataset": "narrativeqa", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "c89fd516348b68f96538948b052cb10d5b6f21bc441f5a55"}

It is a story\n    which will make the heart of many readers leap with joy._\n\n    _We have rarely printed a story in this magazine that for scientific\n    interest, as well as suspense, could hold its own with this\n    particular story. We prophesy that this story will become more\n    valuable as the years go by. It certainly holds a number of\n    interesting prophecies, of which no doubt, many will come true. For\n    wealth of science, it will be hard to beat for some time to come. It\n    is one of those rare stories that will bear reading and re-reading\n    many times._\n\n    _This story has impressed us so favorably, that we hope the author\n    may be induced to write a sequel to it soon._\n\n\n\n\nForeword\n\n\nElsewhere I have set down, for whatever interest they have in this, the\n25th Century, my personal recollections of the 20th Century.\n\nNow it occurs to me that my memoirs of the 25th Century may have an\nequal interest 500 years from now--particularly in view of that unique\nperspective from which I have seen the 25th Century, entering it as I\ndid, in one leap across a gap of 492 years.\n\nThis statement requires elucidation. There are still many in the world\nwho are not familiar with my unique experience. Five centuries from now\nthere may be many more, especially if civilization is fated to endure\nany worse convulsions than those which have occurred between 1975 A.D.\nand the present time.\n\nI should state therefore, that I, Anthony Rogers, am, so far as I know,\nthe only man alive whose normal span of eighty-one years of life has\nbeen spread over a period of 573 years. To be precise, I lived the first\ntwenty-nine years of my life between 1898 and 1927; the other fifty-two\nsince 2419. The gap between these two, a period of nearly five hundred\nyears, I spent in a state of suspended animation, free from the ravages\nof katabolic processes, and without any apparent effect on my physical\nor mental faculties.\n\nWhen I began my long sleep, man had just begun his real conquest of the\nair in a sudden series of transoceanic flights in airplanes driven by\ninternal combustion motors. He had barely begun to speculate on the\npossibilities of harnessing sub-atomic forces, and had made no further\npractical penetration into the field of ethereal pulsations than the\nprimitive radio and television of that day. The United States of America\nwas the most powerful nation in the world, its political, financial,\nindustrial and scientific influence being supreme; and in the arts also\nit was rapidly climbing into leadership.\n\nI awoke to find the America I knew a total wreck--to find Americans a\nhunted race in their own land, hiding in the dense forests that covered\nthe shattered and leveled ruins of their once magnificent cities,\ndesperately preserving, and struggling to develop in their secret\nretreats, the remnants of their culture and science--and the undying\nflame of their sturdy independence.\n\nWorld domination was in the hands of Mongolians and the center of world\npower lay in inland China, with Americans one of the few races of\nmankind unsubdued--and it must be admitted in fairness to the truth, not\nworth the trouble of subduing in the eyes of the Han Airlords who ruled\nNorth America as titular tributaries of the Most Magnificent.\n\nFor they needed not the forests in which the Americans lived, nor the\nresources of the vast territories these forests covered. With the\nperfection to which they had reduced the synthetic production of\nnecessities and luxuries, their remarkable development of scientific\nprocesses and mechanical accomplishment of work, they had no economic\nneed for the forests, and no economic desire for the enslaved labor of\nan unruly race.\n\nThey had all they needed for their magnificently luxurious and degraded\nscheme of civilization, within the walls of the fifteen cities of\nsparkling glass they had flung skyward on the sites of ancient American\ncenters, into the bowels of the earth underneath them, and with\nrelatively small surrounding areas of agriculture.\n\nComplete domination of the air rendered communication between these\ncenters a matter of ease and safety. Occasional destructive raids on the\nwaste lands were considered all that was necessary to keep the \"wild\"\nAmericans on the run within the shelter of their forests, and prevent\ntheir becoming a menace to the Han civilization.\n\nBut nearly three hundred years of easily maintained security, the last\ncentury of which had been nearly sterile in scientific, social and\neconomic progress, had softened and devitalized the Hans.\n\nIt had likewise developed, beneath the protecting foliage of the forest,\nthe growth of a vigorous new American civilization, remarkable in the\nmobility and flexibility of its organization, in its conquest of almost\ninsuperable obstacles, in the development and guarding of its industrial\nand scientific resources, all in anticipation of that \"Day of Hope\" to\nwhich it had been looking forward for generations, when it would be\nstrong enough to burst from the green chrysalis of the forests, soar\ninto the upper air lanes and destroy the yellow incubus.\n\nAt the time I awoke, the \"Day of Hope\" was almost at hand. I shall not\nattempt to set forth a detailed history of the Second War of\nIndependence, for that has been recorded already by better historians\nthan I am. Instead I shall confine myself largely to the part I was\nfortunate enough to play in this struggle and in the events leading up\nto it.\n\n[Illustration: Seen upon the ultroscope viewplate, the battle looked as\nthough it were being fought in daylight, perhaps on a cloudy day, while\nthe explosions of the rockets appeared as flashes of extra brilliance.]\n\nIt all resulted from my interest in radioactive gases. During the latter\npart of 1927 my company, the American Radioactive Gas Corporation, had\nbeen keeping me busy investigating reports of unusual phenomena observed\nin certain abandoned coal mines near the Wyoming Valley, in\nPennsylvania.\n\nWith two assistants and a complete equipment of scientific instruments,\nI began the exploration of a deserted working in a mountainous district,\nwhere several weeks before, a number of mining engineers had reported\ntraces of carnotite[1] and what they believed to be radioactive gases.\nTheir report was not without foundation, it was apparent from the\noutset, for in our examination of the upper levels of the mine, our\ninstruments indicated a vigorous radioactivity.\n\n    [1] A hydrovanadate of uranium, and other metals; used as a source\n    of radium compounds.\n\nOn the morning of December 15th, we descended to one of the lowest\nlevels. To our surprise, we found no water there. Obviously it had\ndrained off through some break in the strata. We noticed too that the\nrock in the side walls of the shaft was soft, evidently due to the\nradioactivity, and pieces crumbled under foot rather easily. We made our\nway cautiously down the shaft, when suddenly the rotted timbers above us\ngave way.\n\nI jumped ahead, barely escaping the avalanche of coal and soft rock, but\nmy companions, who were several paces behind me, were buried under it,\nand undoubtedly met instant death.\n\nI was trapped. Return was impossible. With my electric torch I explored\nthe shaft to its end, but could find no other way out. The air became\nincreasingly difficult to breathe, probably from the rapid accumulation\nof the radioactive gas. In a little while my senses reeled and I lost\nconsciousness.\n\nWhen I awoke, there was a cool and refreshing circulation of air in the\nshaft. I had no thought that I had been unconscious more than a few\nhours, although it seems that the radioactive gas had kept me in a state\nof suspended animation for something like 500 years. My awakening, I\nfigured out later, had been due to some shifting of the strata which\nreopened the shaft and cleared the atmosphere in the working. This must\nhave been the case, for I was able to struggle back up the shaft over a\npile of debris, and stagger up the long incline to the mouth of the\nmine, where an entirely different world, overgrown with a vast forest\nand no visible sign of human habitation, met my eyes.\n\nI shall pass over the days of mental agony that followed in my attempt\nto grasp the meaning of it all. There were times when I felt that I was\non the verge of insanity. I roamed the unfamiliar forest like a lost\nsoul. Had it not been for the necessity of improvising traps and crude\nclubs with which to slay my food, I believe I should have gone mad.\n\nSuffice it to say, however, that I survived this psychic crisis. I shall\nbegin my narrative proper with my first contact with Americans of the\nyear 2419 A.D.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nFloating Men\n\n\nMy first glimpse of a human being of the 25th Century was obtained\nthrough a portion of woodland where the trees were thinly scattered,\nwith a dense forest beyond.\n\nI had been wandering along aimlessly, and hopelessly, musing over my\nstrange fate, when I noticed a figure that cautiously backed out of the\ndense growth across the glade. I was about to call out joyfully, but\nthere was something furtive about the figure that prevented me. The\nboy's attention (for it seemed to be a lad of fifteen or sixteen) was\ncentered tensely on the heavy growth of trees from which he had just\nemerged.\n\nHe was clad in rather tight-fitting garments entirely of green, and wore\na helmet-like cap of the same color. High around his waist he wore a\nbroad, thick belt, which bulked up in the back across the shoulders,\ninto something of the proportions of a knapsack.\n\nAs I was taking in these details, there came a vivid flash and heavy\ndetonation, like that of a hand grenade, not far to the left of him. He\nthrew up an arm and staggered a bit in a queer, gliding way; then he\nrecovered himself and slipped cautiously away from the place of the\nexplosion, crouching slightly, and still facing the denser part of the\nforest. Every few steps he would raise his arm, and point into the\nforest with something he held in his hand. Wherever he pointed there was\na terrific explosion, deeper in among the trees. It came to me then that\nhe was shooting with some form of pistol, though there was neither flash\nnor detonation from the muzzle of the weapon itself.\n\nAfter firing several times, he seemed to come to a sudden resolution,\nand turning in my general direction, leaped--to my amazement sailing\nthrough the air between the sparsely scattered trees in such a jump as I\nhad never in my life seen before. That leap must have carried him a full\nfifty feet, although at the height of his arc, he was not more than ten\nor twelve feet from the ground.\n\nWhen he alighted, his foot caught in a projecting root, and he sprawled\ngently forward. I say \"gently\" for he did not crash down as I expected\nhim to do. The only thing I could compare it with was a slow-motion\ncinema, although I had never seen one in which horizontal motions were\nregistered at normal speed and only the vertical movements were slowed\ndown.\n\nDue to my surprise, I suppose my brain did not function with its normal\nquickness, for I gazed at the prone figure for several seconds before I\nsaw the blood that oozed out from under the tight green cap. Regaining\nmy power of action, I dragged him out of sight back of the big tree. For\na few moments I busied myself in an attempt to staunch the flow of\nblood. The wound was not a deep one. My companion was more dazed than\nhurt. But what of the pursuers?\n\nI took the weapon from his grasp and examined it hurriedly. It was not\nunlike the automatic pistol to which I was accustomed, except that it\napparently fired with a button instead of a trigger. I inserted several\nfresh rounds of ammunition into its magazine from my companion's belt,\nas rapidly as I could, for I soon heard, near us, the suppressed\nconversation of his pursuers.\n\nThere followed a series of explosions round about us, but none very\nclose. They evidently had not spotted our hiding place, and were firing\nat random.\n\nI waited tensely, balancing the gun in my hand, to accustom myself to\nits weight and probable throw.\n\nThen I saw a movement in the green foliage of a tree not far away, and\nthe head and face of a man appeared. Like my companion, he was clad\nentirely in green, which made his figure difficult to distinguish. But\nhis face could be seen clearly. It was an evil face, and had murder in\nit.\n\nThat decided me. I raised the gun and fired. My aim was bad, for there\nwas no kick in the gun, as I had expected, and I hit the trunk of the\ntree several feet below him. It blew him from his perch like a crumpled\nbit of paper, and he _floated_ down to the ground, like some limp, dead\nthing, gently lowered by an invisible hand. The tree, its trunk blown\napart by the explosion, crashed down.\n\nThere followed another series of explosions around us. These guns we\nwere using made no sound in the firing, and my opponents were evidently\nas much at sea as to my position as I was to theirs. So I made no\nattempt to reply to their fire, contenting myself with keeping a sharp\nlookout in their general direction. And patience had its reward.\n\nVery soon I saw a cautious movement in the top of another tree. Exposing\nmyself as little as possible, I aimed carefully at the tree trunk and\nfired again. A shriek followed the explosion. I heard the tree crash\ndown; then a groan.\n\nThere was silence for a while. Then I heard a faint sound of boughs\nswishing. I shot three times in its direction, pressing the button as\nrapidly as I could. Branches crashed down where my shells had exploded,\nbut there was no body.\n\nThen I saw one of them. He was starting one of those amazing leaps from\nthe bough of one tree to another, about forty feet away.\n\nI threw up my gun impulsively and fired. By now I had gotten the feel of\nthe weapon, and my aim was good. I hit him. The \"bullet\" must have\npenetrated his body and exploded. For one moment I saw him flying\nthrough the air. Then the explosion, and he had vanished. He never\nfinished his leap. It was annihilation.\n\nHow many more of them there were I don't know. But this must have been\ntoo much for them. They used a final round of shells on us, all of which\nexploded harmlessly, and shortly after I heard them swishing and\ncrashing away from us through the tree tops. Not one of them descended\nto earth.\n\nNow I had time to give some attention to my companion. She was, I found,\na girl, and not a boy. Despite her bulky appearance, due to the peculiar\nbelt strapped around her body high up under the arms, she was very\nslender, and very pretty.\n\nThere was a stream not far away, from which I brought water and bathed\nher face and wound.\n\nApparently the mystery of these long leaps, the monkey-like ability to\njump from bough to bough, and of the bodies that floated gently down\ninstead of falling, lay in the belt. The thing was some sort of\nanti-gravity belt that almost balanced the weight of the wearer, thereby\ntremendously multiplying the propulsive power of the leg muscles, and\nthe lifting power of the arms.\n\nWhen the girl came to, she regarded me as curiously as I did her, and\npromptly began to quiz me. Her accent and intonation puzzled me a lot,\nbut nevertheless we were able to understand each other fairly well,\nexcept for certain words and phrases. I explained what had happened\nwhile she lay unconscious, and she thanked me simply for saving her\nlife.\n\n\"You are a strange exchange,\" she said, eying my clothing quizzically.\nEvidently she found it mirth provoking by contrast with her own neatly\nefficient garb. \"Don't you understand what I mean by 'exchange?' I mean\nah--let me see--a stranger, somebody from some other gang. What gang do\nyou belong to?\" (She pronounced it \"gan,\" with only a suspicion of a\nnasal sound.)\n\nI laughed. \"I'm not a gangster,\" I said. But she evidently did not\nunderstand this word. \"I don't belong to any gang,\" I explained, \"and\nnever did. Does everybody belong to a gang nowadays?\"\n\n\"Naturally,\" she said, frowning. \"If you don't belong to a gang, where\nand how do you live? Why have you not found and joined a gang? How do\nyou eat? Where do you get your clothing?\"\n\n\"I've been eating wild game for the past two weeks,\" I explained, \"and\nthis clothing I--er--ah--.\" I paused, wondering how I could explain that\nit must be many hundred years old.\n\nIn the end I saw I would have to tell my story as well as I could,\npiecing it together with my assumptions as to what had happened. She\nlistened patiently; incredulously at first, but with more confidence as\nI went on. When I had finished, she sat thinking for a long time.\n\n\"That's hard to believe,\" she said, \"but I believe it.\" She looked me\nover with frank interest.\n\n\"Were you married when you slipped into unconsciousness down in that\nmine?\" she asked me suddenly. I assured her I had never married. \"Well,\nthat simplifies matters,\" she continued. \"You see, if you were\ntechnically classed as a family man, I could take you back only as an\ninvited exchange and I, being unmarried, and no relation of yours,\ncouldn't do the inviting.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nThe Forest Gangs\n\n\nShe gave me a brief outline of the very peculiar social and economic\nsystem under which her people lived. At least it seemed very peculiar\nfrom my 20th Century viewpoint.\n\nI learned with amazement that exactly 492 years had passed over my head\nas I lay unconscious in the mine.\n\nWilma, for that was her name, did not profess to be a historian, and so\ncould give me only a sketchy outline of the wars that had been fought,\nand the manner in which such radical changes had come about. It seemed\nthat another war had followed the First World War, in which nearly all\nthe European nations had banded together to break the financial and\nindustrial power of America. They succeeded in their purpose, though\nthey were beaten, for the war was a terrific one, and left America, like\nthemselves, gasping, bleeding and disorganized, with only the hollow\nshell of a victory.\n\nThis opportunity had been seized by the Russian Soviets, who had made a\ncoalition with the Chinese, to sweep over all Europe and reduce it to a\nstate of chaos.\n\nAmerica, industrially geared to world production and the world trade,\ncollapsed economically, and there ensued a long period of stagnation and\ndesperate attempts at economic reconstruction. But it was impossible to\nstave off war with the Mongolians, who by now had subjugated the\nRussians, and were aiming at a world empire.\n\nIn about 2109, it seems, the conflict was finally precipitated. The\nMongolians, with overwhelming fleets of great airships, and a science\nthat far outstripped that of crippled America, swept in over the Pacific\nand Atlantic Coasts, and down from Canada, annihilating American\naircraft, armies and cities with their terrific _disintegrator_ rays.\nThese rays were projected from a machine not unlike a searchlight in\nappearance, the reflector of which, however, was not material substance,\nbut a complicated balance of interacting electronic forces. This\nresulted in a terribly destructive beam. Under its influence, material\nsubstance melted into \"nothingness\"; i. e., into electronic vibrations.\nIt destroyed all then known substances, from air to the most dense\nmetals and stone.\n\nThey settled down to the establishment of what became known as the Han\ndynasty in America, as a sort of province in their World Empire.\n\nThose were terrible days for the Americans. They were hunted like wild\nbeasts. Only those survived who finally found refuge in mountains,\ncanyons and forests. Government was at an end among them. Anarchy\nprevailed for several generations. Most would have been eager to submit\nto the Hans, even if it meant slavery. But the Hans did not want them,\nfor they themselves had marvelous machinery and scientific process by\nwhich all difficult labor was accomplished.\n\nUltimately they stopped their active search for, and annihilation of,\nthe widely scattered groups of now savage Americans. So long as they\nremained hidden in their forests, and did not venture near the great\ncities the Hans had built, little attention was paid to them.\n\nThen began the building of the new American civilization. Families and\nindividuals gathered together in clans or \"gangs\" for mutual protection.\nFor nearly a century they lived a nomadic and primitive life, moving\nfrom place to place, in desperate fear of the casual and occasional Han\nair raids, and the terrible disintegrator ray. As the frequency of these\nraids decreased, they began to stay permanently in given localities,\norganizing upon lines which in many respects were similar to those of\nthe military households of the Norman feudal barons, except that instead\nof gathering together in castles, their defense tactics necessitated a\ncertain scattering of living quarters for families and individuals. They\nlived virtually in the open air, in the forests, in green tents,\nresorting to camouflage tactics that would conceal their presence from\nair observers. They dug underground factories and laboratories, that\nthey might better be shielded from the electrical detectors of the\nHans. They tapped the radio communication lines of the Hans, with crude\ninstruments at first; better ones later on. They bent every effort\ntoward the redevelopment of science. For many generations they labored\nas unseen, unknown scholars of the Hans, picking up their knowledge\npiecemeal, as fast as they were able to.\n\nDuring the earlier part of this period, there were many deadly wars\nfought between the various gangs, and occasional courageous but\nchildishly futile attacks upon the Hans, followed by terribly punitive\nraids.\n\nBut as knowledge progressed, the sense of American brotherhood\nredeveloped. Reciprocal arrangements were made among the gangs over\nconstantly increasing areas. Trade developed to a certain extent, as\nbetween one gang and another. But the interchange of knowledge became\nmore important than that of goods, as skill in the handling of synthetic\nprocesses developed.\n\nWithin the gang, an economy was developed that was a compromise between\nindividual liberty and a military socialism. The right of private\nproperty was limited practically to personal possessions, but private\nprivileges were many, and sacredly regarded. Stimulation to achievement\nlay chiefly in the winning of various kinds of leadership and\nprerogatives, and only in a very limited degree in the hope of owning\nanything that might be classified as \"wealth,\" and nothing that might be\nclassified as \"resources.\" Resources of every description, for military\nsafety and efficiency, belonged as a matter of public interest to the\ncommunity as a whole.\n\nIn the meantime, through these many generations, the Hans had developed\na luxury economy, and with it the perfection of gilded vice and\ndegradation. The Americans were regarded as \"wild men of the woods.\" And\nsince they neither needed nor wanted the woods or the wild men, they\ntreated them as beasts, and were conscious of no human brotherhood with\nthem. As time went on, and synthetic processes of producing foods and\nmaterials were further developed, less and less ground was needed by the\nHans for the purposes of agriculture, and finally, even the working of\nmines was abandoned when it became cheaper to build up metal from\nelectronic vibrations than to dig them out of the ground.\n\nThe Han race, devitalized by its vices and luxuries, with machinery and\nscientific processes to satisfy its every want, with virtually no\nnecessity of labor, began to assume a defensive attitude toward the\nAmericans.\n\nAnd quite naturally, the Americans regarded the Hans with a deep, grim\nhatred. Conscious of individual superiority as men, knowing that\nlatterly they were outstripping the Hans in science and civilization,\nthey longed desperately for the day when they should be powerful enough\nto rise and annihilate the Yellow Blight that lay over the continent.\n\nAt the time of my awakening, the gangs were rather loosely organized,\nbut were considering the establishment of a special military force,\nwhose special business it would be to harry the Hans and bring down\ntheir air ships whenever possible without causing general alarm among\nthe Mongolians. This force was destined to become the nucleus of the\nnational force, when the Day of Retribution arrived. But that, however,\ndid not happen for ten years, and is another story.\n\n[Illustration: On the left of the illustration is a Han girl, and on the\nright is an American girl, who, like all of her race, is equipped with\nan inertron belt and a rocket gun.]\n\nWilma told me she was a member of the Wyoming Gang, which claimed the\nentire Wyoming Valley as its territory, under the leadership of Boss\nHart. Her mother and father were dead, and she was unmarried, so she was\nnot a \"family member.\" She lived in a little group of tents known as\nCamp 17, under a woman Camp Boss, with seven other girls.\n\nHer duties alternated between military or police scouting and factory\nwork. For the two-week period which would end the next day, she had been\non \"air patrol.\" This did not mean, as I first imagined, that she was\nflying, but rather that she was on the lookout for Han ships over this\noutlying section of the Wyoming territory, and had spent most of her\ntime perched in the tree tops scanning the skies. Had she seen one she\nwould have fired a \"drop flare\" several miles off to one side, which\nwould ignite when it was floating vertically toward the earth, so that\nthe direction or point from which it had been fired might not be guessed\nby the airship and bring a blasting play of the disintegrator ray in her\nvicinity. Other members of the air patrol would send up rockets on\nseeing hers, until finally a scout equipped with an ultrophone, which,\nunlike the ancient radio, operated on the ultronic ethereal vibrations,\nwould pass the warning simultaneously to the headquarters of the Wyoming\nGang and other communities within a radius of several hundred miles, not\nto mention the few American rocket ships that might be in the air, and\nwhich instantly would duck to cover either through forest clearings or\nby flattening down to earth in green fields where their coloring would\nprobably protect them from observation. The favorite American method of\npropulsion was known as \"_rocketing_.\" The _rocket_ is what I would\ndescribe, from my 20th Century comprehension of the matter, as an\nextremely powerful gas blast, atomically produced through the\nstimulation of chemical action. Scientists of today regard it as a\nchildishly simple reaction, but by that very virtue, most economical and\nefficient.\n\nBut tomorrow, she explained, she would go back to work in the cloth\nplant, where she would take charge of one of the synthetic processes by\nwhich those wonderful substitutes for woven fabrics of wool, cotton and\nsilk are produced. At the end of another two weeks, she would be back on\nmilitary duty again, perhaps at the same work, or maybe as a \"contact\nguard,\" on duty where the territory of the Wyomings merged with that of\nthe Delawares, or the \"Susquannas\" (Susquehannas) or one of the half\ndozen other \"gangs\" in that section of the country which I knew as\nPennsylvania and New York States.\n\nWilma cleared up for me the mystery of those flying leaps which she and\nher assailants had made, and explained in the following manner, how the\ninertron belt balances weight:\n\n\"_Jumpers_\" were in common use at the time I \"awoke,\" though they were\ncostly, for at that time _inertron_ had not been produced in very great\nquantity. They were very useful in the forest. They were belts,\nstrapped high under the arms, containing an amount of inertron adjusted\nto the wearer's weight and purposes. In effect they made a man weigh as\nlittle as he desired; two pounds if he liked.\n\n\"_Floaters_\" are a later development of \"_jumpers_\"--rocket motors\nencased in _inertron_ blocks and strapped to the back in such a way that\nthe wearer floats, when drifting, facing slightly downward. With his\nmotor in operation, he moves like a diver, headforemost, controlling his\ndirection by twisting his body and by movements of his outstretched arms\nand hands. Ballast weights locked in the front of the belt adjust weight\nand lift. Some men prefer a few ounces of weight in floating, using a\nslight motor thrust to overcome this. Others prefer a buoyance balance\nof a few ounces. The inadvertent dropping of weight is not a serious\nmatter. The motor thrust always can be used to descend. But as an extra\nprecaution, in case the motor should fail, for any reason, there are\nbuilt into every belt a number of detachable sections, one or more of\nwhich can be discarded to balance off any loss in weight.\n\n\"But who were your assailants,\" I asked, \"and why were you attacked?\"\n\nHer assailants, she told me, were members of an outlaw gang, referred to\nas \"Bad Bloods,\" a group which for several generations had been under\nthe domination of conscienceless leaders who tried to advance the\ninterests of their clan by tactics which their neighbors had come to\nregard as unfair, and who in consequence had been virtually boycotted.\nTheir purpose had been to slay her near the Delaware frontier, making it\nappear that the crime had been committed by Delaware scouts and thus\nembroil the Delawares and Wyomings in acts of reprisal against each\nother, or at least cause suspicions.\n\nFortunately they had not succeeded in surprising her, and she had been\nsuccessful in dodging them for some two hours before the shooting began,\nat the moment when I arrived on the scene.\n\n\"But we must not stay here talking,\" Wilma concluded. \"I have to take\nyou in, and besides I must report this attack right away. I think we had\nbetter slip over to the other side of the mountain. Whoever is on that\npost will have a phone, and I can make a direct report. But you'll have\nto have a belt. Mine alone won't help much against our combined weights,\nand there's little to be gained by jumping heavy. It's almost as bad as\nwalking.\"\n\nAfter a little search, we found one of the men I had killed, who had\nfloated down among the trees some distance away and whose belt was not\nbadly damaged. In detaching it from his body, it nearly got away from me\nand shot up in the air. Wilma caught it, however, and though it\nreinforced the lift of her own belt so that she had to hook her knee\naround a branch to hold herself down, she saved it. I climbed the tree\nand, with my weight added to hers, we floated down easily.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nLife in the 25th Century\n\n\nWe were delayed in starting for quite a while since I had to acquire a\nfew crude ideas about the technique of using these belts. I had been\nsitting down, for instance, with the belt strapped about me, enjoying an\nease similar to that of a comfortable armchair; when I stood up with a\nnatural exertion of muscular effort, I shot ten feet into the air, with\na wild instinctive thrashing of arms and legs that amused Wilma greatly.\n\nBut after some practice, I began to get the trick of gauging muscular\neffort to a minimum of vertical and a maximum of horizontal. The correct\nform, I found, was in a measure comparable to that of skating. I found,\nalso, that in forest work particularly the arms and hands could be used\nto great advantage in swinging along from branch to branch, so\nprolonging leaps almost indefinitely at times.\n\nIn going up the side of the mountain, I found that my 20th Century\nmuscles did have an advantage, in spite of lack of skill with the belt,\nand since the slopes were very sharp, and most of our leaps were upward,\nI could have distanced Wilma easily. But when we crossed the ridge and\ndescended, she outstripped me with her superior technique. Choosing the\nsteepest slopes, she would crouch in the top of a tree, and propel\nherself outward, literally diving until, with the loss of horizontal\nmomentum, she would assume a more upright position and float downward.\nIn this manner she would sometimes cover as much as a quarter of a mile\nin a single leap, while I leaped and scrambled clumsily behind,\nthoroughly enjoying the novel sensation.\n\nHalf way down the mountain, we saw another green-clad figure leap out\nabove the tree tops toward us. The three of us perched on an outcropping\nof rock from which a view for many miles around could be had, while\nWilma hastily explained her adventure and my presence to her fellow\nguard; whose name was Alan. I learned later that this was the modern\nform of Helen.\n\n\"You want to report by phone then, don't you?\" Alan took a compact\npacket about six inches square from a holster attached to her belt and\nhanded it to Wilma.\n\nSo far as I could see, it had no special receiver for the ear. Wilma\nmerely threw back a lid, as though she were opening a book, and began to\ntalk. The voice that came back from the machine was as audible as her\nown.\n\nShe was queried closely as to the attack upon her, and at considerable\nlength as to myself, and I could tell from the tone of that voice that\nits owner was not prepared to take me at my face value as readily as\nWilma had. For that matter, neither was the other girl. I could realize\nit from the suspicious glances she threw my way, when she thought my\nattention was elsewhere, and the manner in which her hand hovered\nconstantly near her gun holster.\n\nWilma was ordered to bring me in at once, and informed that another\nscout would take her place on the other side of the mountain. So she\nclosed down the lid of the phone and handed it back to Alan, who seemed\nrelieved to see us departing over the tree tops in the direction of the\ncamps.\n\nWe had covered perhaps ten miles, in what still seemed to me a\nsurprisingly easy fashion, when Wilma explained, that from here on we\nwould have to keep to the ground. We were nearing the camps, she said,\nand there was always the possibility that some small Han scoutship,\ninvisible high in the sky, might catch sight of us through a\nprojectoscope and thus find the general location of the camps.\n\nWilma took me to the Scout office, which proved to be a small building\nof irregular shape, conforming to the trees around it, and substantially\nconstructed of green sheet-like material.\n\nI was received by the assistant Scout Boss, who reported my arrival at\nonce to the historical office, and to officials he called the Psycho\nBoss and the History Boss, who came in a few minutes later. The attitude\nof all three men was at first polite but skeptical, and Wilma's ardent\nadvocacy seemed to amuse them secretly.\n\nFor the next two hours I talked, explained and answered questions. I had\nto explain, in detail, the manner of my life in the 20th Century and my\nunderstanding of customs, habits, business, science and the history of\nthat period, and about developments in the centuries that had elapsed.\nHad I been in a classroom, I would have come through the examination\nwith a very poor mark, for I was unable to give any answer to fully half\nof their questions. But before long I realized that the majority of\nthese questions were designed as traps. Objects, of whose purpose I knew\nnothing, were casually handed to me, and I was watched keenly as I\nhandled them.\n\nIn the end I could see both amazement and belief begin to show in the\nfaces of my inquisitors, and at last the Historical and Psycho Bosses\nagreed openly that they could find no flaw in my story or reactions, and\nthat unbelievable as it seemed, my story must be accepted as genuine.\n\nThey took me at once to Big Boss Hart. He was a portly man with a \"poker\nface.\" He would probably have been the successful politician even in the\n20th Century.\n\nThey gave him a brief outline of my story and a report of their\nexamination of me. He made no comment other than to nod his acceptance\nof it. Then he turned to me.\n\n\"How does it feel?\" he asked. \"Do we look funny to you?\"\n\n\"A bit strange,\" I admitted. \"But I'm beginning to lose that dazed\nfeeling, though I can see I have an awful lot to learn.\"\n\n\"Maybe we can learn some things from you, too,\" he said. \"So you fought\nin the First World War. Do you know, we have very little left in the way\nof records of the details of that war, that is, the precise conditions\nunder which it was fought, and the tactics employed. We forgot many\nthings during the Han terror, and--well, I think you might have a lot of\nideas worth thinking over for our raid masters. By the way, now that\nyou're here, and can't go back to your own century, so to speak, what do\nyou want to do? You're welcome to become one of us. Or perhaps you'd\njust like to visit with us for a while, and then look around among the\nother gangs. Maybe you'd like some of the others better. Don't make up\nyour mind now. We'll put you down as an exchange for a while. Let's see.\nYou and Bill Hearn ought to get along well together. He's Camp Boss of\nNumber 34 when he isn't acting as Raid Boss or Scout Boss. There's a\nvacancy in his camp. Stay with him and think things over as long as you\nwant to. As soon as you make up your mind to anything, let me know.\"\n\nWe all shook hands, for that was one custom that had not died out in\nfive hundred years, and I set out with Bill Hearn.\n\nBill, like all the others, was clad in green. He was a big man. That is,\nhe was about my own height, five feet eleven. This was considerably\nabove the average now, for the race had lost something in stature, it\nseemed, through the vicissitudes of five centuries. Most of the women\nwere a bit below five feet, and the men only a trifle above this height.\n\nFor a period of two weeks Bill was to confine himself to camp duties, so\nI had a good chance to familiarize myself with the community life. It\nwas not easy. There were so many marvels to absorb. I never ceased to\nwonder at the strange combination of rustic social life and feverish\nindustrial activity. At least, it was strange to me. For in my\nexperience, industrial development meant crowded cities, tenements,\npaved streets, profusion of vehicles, noise, hurrying men and women with\nstrained or dull faces, vast structures and ornate public works.\n\nHere, however, was rustic simplicity, apparently isolated families and\ngroups, living in the heart of the forest, with a quarter of a mile or\nmore between households, a total absence of crowds, no means of\nconveyance other than the belts called jumpers, almost constantly worn\nby everybody, and an occasional rocket ship, used only for longer\njourneys, and underground plants or factories that were to my mind more\nlike laboratories and engine rooms; many of them were excavations as\ndeep as mines, with well finished, lighted and comfortable interiors.\nThese people were adepts at camouflage against air observation. Not only\nwould their activity have been unsuspected by an airship passing over\nthe center of the community, but even by an enemy who might happen to\ndrop through the screen of the upper branches to the floor of the\nforest. The camps, or household structures, were all irregular in shape\nand of colors that blended with the great trees among which they were\nhidden.\n\nThere were 724 dwellings or \"camps\" among the Wyomings, located within\nan area of about fifteen square miles. The total population was 8,688,\nevery man, woman and child, whether member or \"exchange,\" being listed.\n\nThe plants were widely scattered through the territory also. Nowhere was\nanything like congestion permitted. So far as possible, families and\nindividuals were assigned to living quarters, not too far from the\nplants or offices in which their work lay.\n\nAll able-bodied men and women alternated in two-week periods between\nmilitary and industrial service, except those who were needed for\nhousehold work. Since working conditions in the plants and offices were\nideal, and everybody thus had plenty of healthy outdoor activity in\naddition, the population was sturdy and active. Laziness was regarded as\nnearly the greatest of social offenses. Hard work and general merit were\nvariously rewarded with extra privileges, advancement to positions of\nauthority, and with various items of personal equipment for convenience\nand luxury.\n\nIn leisure moments, I got great enjoyment from sitting outside the\ndwelling in which I was quartered with Bill Hearn and ten other men,\nwatching the occasional passers-by, as with leisurely, but swift\nmovements, they swung up and down the forest trail, rising from the\nground in long almost-horizontal leaps, occasionally swinging from one\nconvenient branch overhead to another before \"sliding\" back to the\nground farther on. Normal traveling pace, where these trails were\nstraight enough, was about twenty miles an hour. Such things as\nautomobiles and railroad trains (the memory of them not more than a\nmonth old in my mind) seemed inexpressibly silly and futile compared\nwith such convenience as these belts or jumpers offered.\n\nBill suggested that I wander around for several days, from plant to\nplant, to observe and study what I could. The entire community had been\napprised of my coming, my rating as an \"exchange\" reaching every\nbuilding and post in the community, by means of ultronic broadcast.\nEverywhere I was welcomed in an interested and helpful spirit.\n\nI visited the plants where ultronic vibrations were isolated from the\nether and through slow processes built up into sub-electronic,\nelectronic and atomic forms into the two great synthetic elements,\nultron and inertron. I learned something, superficially at least, of the\nprocesses of combined chemical and mechanical action through which were\nproduced the various forms of synthetic cloth. I watched the manufacture\nof the machines which were used at locations of construction to produce\nthe various forms of building materials. But I was particularly\ninterested in the munitions plants and the rocket-ship shops.\n\nUltron is a solid of great molecular density and moderate elasticity,\nwhich has the property of being 100 percent conductive to those\npulsations known as light, electricity and heat. Since it is completely\npermeable to light vibrations, it is therefore _absolutely invisible and\nnon-reflective_. Its magnetic response is almost, but not quite, 100\npercent also. It is therefore very heavy under normal conditions but\nextremely responsive to the _repellor_ or anti-gravity rays, such as the\nHans use as \"_legs_\" for their airships.\n\nInertron is the second great triumph of American research and\nexperimentation with ultronic forces. It was developed just a few years\nbefore my awakening in the abandoned mine. It is a synthetic element,\nbuilt up, through a complicated heterodyning of ultronic pulsations,\nfrom \"infra-balanced\" sub-ionic forms. It is completely inert to both\nelectric and magnetic forces in all the orders above the _ultronic_;\nthat is to say, the _sub-electronic_, the _electronic_, the _atomic_ and\nthe _molecular_. In consequence it has a number of amazing and\nvaluable properties. One of these is _the total lack of weight_. Another\nis a total lack of heat. It has no molecular vibration whatever. It\nreflects 100 percent of the heat and light impinging upon it. It does\nnot feel cold to the touch, of course, since it will not absorb the heat\nof the hand. It is a solid, very dense in molecular structure despite\nits lack of weight, of great strength and considerable elasticity. It is\na perfect shield against the disintegrator rays.\n\n[Illustration: Setting his rocket gun for a long-distance shot.]\n\nRocket guns are very simple contrivances so far as the mechanism of\nlaunching the bullet is concerned. They are simple light tubes, closed\nat the rear end, with a trigger-actuated pin for piercing the thin skin\nat the base of the cartridge. This piercing of the skin starts the\nchemical and atomic reaction. The entire cartridge leaves the tube under\nits own power, at a very easy initial velocity, just enough to insure\naccuracy of aim; so the tube does not have to be of heavy construction.\nThe bullet increases in velocity as it goes. It may be solid or\nexplosive. It may explode on contact or on time, or a combination of\nthese two.\n\nBill and I talked mostly of weapons, military tactics and strategy.\nStrangely enough he had no idea whatever of the possibilities of the\nbarrage, though the tremendous effect of a \"curtain of fire\" with such\nhigh-explosive projectiles as these modern rocket guns used was obvious\nto me. But the barrage idea, it seemed, has been lost track of\ncompletely in the air wars that followed the First World War, and in the\npeculiar guerilla tactics developed by Americans in the later period of\noperations from the ground against Han airships, and in the gang wars\nwhich, until a few generations ago I learned, had been almost\ncontinuous.\n\n\"I wonder,\" said Bill one day, \"if we couldn't work up some form of\nbarrage to spring on the Bad Bloods. The Big Boss told me today that\nhe's been in communication with the other gangs, and all are agreed that\nthe Bad Bloods might as well be wiped out for good. That attempt on\nWilma Deering's life and their evident desire to make trouble among the\ngangs, has stirred up every community east of the Alleghenies. The Boss\nsays that none of the others will object if we go after them. So I\nimagine that before long we will. Now show me again how you worked that\nbusiness in the Argonne forest. The conditions ought to be pretty much\nthe same.\"\n\nI went over it with him in detail, and gradually we worked out a\nmodified plan that would be better adapted to our more powerful weapons,\nand the use of jumpers.\n\n\"It will be easy,\" Bill exulted. \"I'll slide down and talk it over with\nthe Boss tomorrow.\"\n\nDuring the first two weeks of my stay with the Wyomings, Wilma Deering\nand I saw a great deal of each other. I naturally felt a little closer\nfriendship for her, in view of the fact that she was the first human\nbeing I saw after waking from my long sleep; her appreciation of my\nsaving her life, though I could not have done otherwise than I did in\nthat matter, and most of all my own appreciation of the fact that she\nhad not found it as difficult as the others to believe my story,\noperated in the same direction. I could easily imagine my story must\nhave sounded incredible.\n\nIt was natural enough too, that she should feel an unusual interest in\nme. In the first place, I was her personal discovery. In the second, she\nwas a girl of studious and reflective turn of mind. She never got tired\nof my stories and descriptions of the 20th Century.\n\nThe others of the community, however, seemed to find our friendship a\nbit amusing. It seemed that Wilma had a reputation for being cold toward\nthe opposite sex, and so others, not being able to appreciate some of\nher fine qualities as I did, misinterpreted her attitude, much to their\nown delight. Wilma and I, however, ignored this as much as we could.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nA Han Air Raid\n\n\nThere was a girl in Wilma's camp named Gerdi Mann, with whom Bill Hearn\nwas desperately in love, and the four of us used to go around a lot\ntogether. Gerdi was a distinct type. Whereas Wilma had the usual dark\nbrown hair and hazel eyes that marked nearly every member of the\ncommunity, Gerdi had red hair, blue eyes and very fair skin. She has\nbeen dead many years now, but I remember her vividly because she was a\nthrowback in physical appearance to a certain 20th Century type which I\nhave found very rare among modern Americans; also because the four of us\nwere engaged one day in a discussion of this very point, when I obtained\nmy first experience of a Han air raid.\n\nWe were sitting high on the side of a hill overlooking the valley that\nteemed with human activity, invisible beneath its blanket of foliage.\n\nThe other three, who knew of the Irish but vaguely and indefinitely, as\na race on the other side of the globe, which, like ourselves, had\nsucceeded in maintaining a precarious and fugitive existence in\nrebellion against the Mongolian domination of the earth, were listening\nwith interest to my theory that Gerdi's ancestors of several hundred\nyears ago must have been Irish. I explained that Gerdi was an Irish\ntype, evidently a throwback, and that her surname might well have been\nMcMann, or McMahan, and still more anciently \"mac Mathghamhain.\" They\nwere interested too in my surmise that \"Gerdi\" was the same name as that\nwhich had been \"Gerty\" or \"Gertrude\" in the 20th Century.\n\nIn the middle of our discussion, we were startled by an alarm rocket\nthat burst high in the air, far to the north, spreading a pall of red\nsmoke that drifted like a cloud. It was followed by others at scattered\npoints in the northern sky.\n\n\"A Han raid!\" Bill exclaimed in amazement. \"The first in seven years!\"\n\n\"Maybe it's just one of their ships off its course,\" I ventured.\n\n\"No,\" said Wilma in some agitation. \"That would be green rockets. Red\nmeans only one thing, Tony. They're sweeping the countryside with their\ndis beams. Can you see anything, Bill?\"\n\n\"We had better get under cover,\" Gerdi said nervously. \"The four of us\nare bunched here in the open. For all we know they may be twelve miles\nup, out of sight, yet looking at us with a projecto'.\"\n\nBill had been sweeping the horizon hastily with his glass, but\napparently saw nothing.\n\n\"We had better scatter, at that,\" he said finally. \"It's orders, you\nknow. See!\" He pointed to the valley.\n\nHere and there a tiny human figure shot for a moment above the foliage\nof the treetops.\n\n\"That's bad,\" Wilma commented, as she counted the jumpers. \"No less than\nfifteen people visible, and all clearly radiating from a central point.\nDo they want to give away our location?\"\n\nThe standard orders covering air raids were that the population was to\nscatter individually. There should be no grouping, or even pairing, in\nview of the destructiveness of the disintegrator rays. Experience of\ngenerations had proved that if this were done, and everybody remained\nhidden beneath the tree screens, the Hans would have to sweep mile after\nmile of territory, foot by foot, to catch more than a small percentage\nof the community.\n\nGerdi, however, refused to leave Bill, and Wilma developed an equal\nobstinacy against quitting my side. I was inexperienced at this sort of\nthing, she explained, quite ignoring the fact that she was too; she was\nonly thirteen or fourteen years old at the time of the last air raid.\n\nHowever, since I could not argue her out of it, we leaped together about\na quarter of a mile to the right, while Bill and Gerdi disappeared down\nthe hillside among the trees.\n\nWilma and I both wanted a point of vantage from which we might overlook\nthe valley and the sky to the north, and we found it near the top of the\nridge, where, protected from visibility by thick branches, we could look\nout between the tree trunks, and get a good view of the valley.\n\nNo more rockets went up. Except for a few of those warning red clouds,\ndrifting lazily in a blue sky, there was no visible indication of man's\npast or present existence anywhere in the sky or on the ground.\n\nThen Wilma gripped my arm and pointed. I saw it; away off in the\ndistance; looking like a phantom dirigible airship, in its coat of\nlow-visibility paint, a bare spectre.\n\n\"Seven thousand feet up,\" Wilma whispered, crouching close to me.\n\"Watch.\"\n\nThe ship was about the same shape as the great dirigibles of the 20th\nCentury that I had seen, but without the suspended control car, engines,\npropellors, rudders or elevating planes. As it loomed rapidly nearer, I\nsaw that it was wider and somewhat flatter than I had supposed.\n\nNow I could see the repellor rays that held the ship aloft, like\nsearchlight beams faintly visible in the bright daylight (and still\nfaintly visible to the human eye at night). Actually, I had been\ninformed by my instructors, there were two rays; the visible one\ngenerated by the ship's apparatus, and directed toward the ground as a\nbeam of \"carrier\" impulses; and the true repellor ray, the complement of\nthe other in one sense, induced by the action of the \"carrier\" and\nreacting in a concentrating upward direction from the mass of the earth,\nbecoming successively electronic, atomic and finally molecular, in its\nnature, according to various ratios of distance between earth mass and\n\"carrier\" source, until, in the last analysis, the ship itself actually\nis supported on an upward rushing column of air, much like a ball\ncontinuously supported on a fountain jet.\n\nThe raider neared with incredible speed. Its rays were both slanted\nastern at a sharp angle, so that it slid forward with tremendous\nmomentum.\n\nThe ship was operating two disintegrator rays, though only in a casual,\nintermittent fashion. But whenever they flashed downward with blinding\nbrilliancy, forest, rocks and ground melted instantaneously into\nnothing, where they played upon them.\n\nWhen later I inspected the scars left by these rays I found them some\nfive feet deep and thirty feet wide, the exposed surfaces being\nlava-like in texture, but of a pale, iridescent, greenish hue.\n\nNo systematic use of the rays was made by the ship, however, until it\nreached a point over the center of the valley--the center of the\ncommunity's activities. There it came to a sudden stop by shooting its\nrepellor beams sharply forward and easing them back gradually to the\nvertical, holding the ship floating and motionless. Then the work of\ndestruction began systematically.\n\nBack and forth traveled the destroying rays, ploughing parallel furrows\nfrom hillside to hillside. We gasped in dismay, Wilma and I, as time\nafter time we saw it plough through sections where we knew camps or\nplants were located.\n\n\"This is awful,\" she moaned, a terrified question in her eyes. \"How\ncould they know the location so exactly, Tony? Did you see? They were\nnever in doubt. They stalled at a predetermined spot--and--and it was\nexactly the right spot.\"\n\nWe did not talk of what might happen if the rays were turned in our\ndirection. We both knew. We would simply disintegrate in a split second\ninto mere scattered electronic vibrations. Strangely enough, it was this\nself-reliant girl of the 25th Century, who clung to me, a relatively\nprimitive man of the 20th, less familiar than she with the thought of\nthis terrifying possibility, for moral support.\n\nWe knew that many of our companions must have been whisked into absolute\nnon-existence before our eyes in these few moments. The whole thing\nparalyzed us into mental and physical immobility for I do not know how\nlong.\n\nIt couldn't have been long, however, for the rays had not ploughed more\nthan thirty of their twenty-foot furrows or so across the valley, when I\nregained control of myself, and brought Wilma to herself by shaking her\nroughly.\n\n\"How far will this rocket gun shoot, Wilma?\" I demanded, drawing my\npistol.\n\n\"It depends on your rocket, Tony. It will take even the longest range\nrocket, but you could shoot more accurately from a longer tube. But why?\nYou couldn't penetrate the shell of that ship with rocket force, even if\nyou could reach it.\"\n\nI fumbled clumsily with my rocket pouch, for I was excited. I had an\nidea I wanted to try; a \"hunch\" I called it, forgetting that Wilma could\nnot understand my ancient slang. But finally, with her help, I selected\nthe longest range explosive rocket in my pouch, and fitted it to my\npistol.\n\n\"It won't carry seven thousand feet, Tony,\" Wilma objected. But I took\naim carefully. It was another thought that I had in my mind. The\nsupporting repellor ray, I had been told, became molecular in character\nat what was called a logarithmic level of five (below that it was a\npurely electronic \"flow\" or pulsation between the source of the\n\"carrier\" and the average mass of the earth). Below that level if I\ncould project my explosive bullet into this stream where it began to\ncarry material substance upward, might it not rise with the air column,\ngathering speed and hitting the ship with enough impact to carry it\nthrough the shell? It was worth trying anyhow. Wilma became greatly\nexcited, too, when she grasped the nature of my inspiration.\n\nFeverishly I looked around for some formation of branches against which\nI could rest the pistol, for I had to aim most carefully. At last I\nfound one. Patiently I sighted on the hulk of the ship far above us,\naiming at the far side of it, at such an angle as would, so far as I\ncould estimate, bring my bullet path through the forward repellor beam.\nAt last the sights wavered across the point I sought and I pressed the\nbutton gently.\n\nFor a moment we gazed breathlessly.\n\nSuddenly the ship swung bow down, as on a pivot, and swayed like a\npendulum. Wilma screamed in her excitement.\n\n\"Oh, Tony, you hit it! You hit it! Do it again; bring it down!\"\n\nWe had only one more rocket of extreme range between us, and we dropped\nit three times in our excitement in inserting it in my gun. Then,\nforcing myself to be calm by sheer will power, while Wilma stuffed her\nlittle fist into her mouth to keep from shrieking, I sighted carefully\nagain and fired. In a flash, Wilma had grasped the hope that this\ndiscovery of mine might lead to the end of the Han domination.\n\nThe elapsed time of the rocket's invisible flight seemed an age.\n\nThen we saw the ship falling. It seemed to plunge lazily, but actually\nit fell with terrific acceleration, turning end over end, its\ndisintegrator rays, out of control, describing vast, wild arcs, and once\ncutting a gash through the forest less than two hundred feet from where\nwe stood.\n\nThe crash with which the heavy craft hit the ground reverberated from\nthe hills--the momentum of eighteen or twenty thousand tons, in a sheer\ndrop of seven thousand feet. A mangled mass of metal, it buried itself\nin the ground, with poetic justice, in the middle of the smoking,\nsemi-molten field of destruction it had been so deliberately ploughing.\n\nThe silence, the vacuity of the landscape, was oppressive, as the last\nechoes died away.\n\nThen far down the hillside, a single figure leaped exultantly above the\nfoliage screen. And in the distance another, and another.\n\nIn a moment the sky was punctured by signal rockets. One after another\nthe little red puffs became drifting clouds.\n\n\"Scatter! Scatter!\" Wilma exclaimed. \"In half an hour there'll be an\nentire Han fleet here from Nu-yok, and another from Bah-flo. They'll get\nthis instantly on their recordographs and location finders. They'll\nblast the whole valley and the country for miles beyond. Come, Tony.\nThere's no time for the gang to rally. See the signals. We've got to\njump. Oh, I'm so proud of you!\"\n\nOver the ridge we went, in long leaps toward the east, the country of\nthe Delawares.\n\nFrom time to time signal rockets puffed in the sky. Most of them were\nthe \"red warnings,\" the \"scatter\" signals. But from certain of the\nothers, which Wilma identified as Wyoming rockets, she gathered that\nwhoever was in command (we did not know whether the Boss was alive or\nnot) was ordering an ultimate rally toward the south, and so we changed\nour course.\n\nIt was a great pity, I thought, that the clan had not been equipped\nthroughout its membership with ultrophones, but Wilma explained to me,\nthat not enough of these had been built for distribution as yet,\nalthough general distribution had been contemplated within a couple of\nmonths.\n\nWe traveled far before nightfall overtook us, trying only to put as much\ndistance as possible between ourselves and the valley.\n\nWhen gathering dusk made jumping too dangerous, we sought a comfortable\nspot beneath the trees, and consumed part of our emergency rations. It\nwas the first time I had tasted the stuff--a highly nutritive synthetic\nsubstance called \"concentro,\" which was, however, a bit bitter and\nunpalatable. But as only a mouthful or so was needed, it did not matter.\n\nNeither of us had a cloak, but we were both thoroughly tired and happy,\nso we curled up together for warmth. I remember Wilma making some sleepy\nremark about our mating, as she cuddled up, as though the matter were\nall settled, and my surprise at my own instant acceptance of the idea,\nfor I had not consciously thought of her that way before. But we both\nfell asleep at once.\n\nIn the morning we found little time for love making. The practical\nproblem facing us was too great. Wilma felt that the Wyoming plan must\nbe to rally in the Susquanna territory, but she had her doubts about the\nwisdom of this plan. In my elation at my success in bringing down the\nHan ship, and my newly found interest in my charming companion, who was,\nfrom my viewpoint of another century, at once more highly civilized and\nyet more primitive than myself, I had forgotten the ominous fact that\nthe Han ship I had destroyed must have known the exact location of the\nWyoming Works.\n\nThis meant, to Wilma's logical mind, either that the Hans had perfected\nnew instruments as yet unknown to us, or that somewhere, among the\nWyomings or some other nearby gang, there were traitors so degraded as\nto commit that unthinkable act of trafficking in information with the\nHans. In either contingency, she argued, other Han raids would follow,\nand since the Susquannas had a highly developed organization and more\nthan usually productive plants, the next raid might be expected to\nstrike them.\n\nBut at any rate it was clearly our business to get in touch with the\nother fugitives as quickly as possible, so in spite of muscles that were\nsore from the excessive leaping of the day before, we continued on our\nway.\n\nWe traveled for only a couple of hours when we saw a multi-colored\nrocket in the sky, some ten miles ahead of us.\n\n\"Bear to the left, Tony,\" Wilma said, \"and listen for the whistle.\"\n\n\"Why?\" I asked.\n\n\"Haven't they given you the rocket code yet?\" she replied. \"That's what\nthe green, followed by yellow and purple means; to concentrate five\nmiles east of the rocket position. You know the rocket position itself\nmight draw a play of disintegrator beams.\"\n\nIt did not take us long to reach the neighborhood of the indicated\nrallying, though we were now traveling beneath the trees, with but an\noccasional leap to a top branch to see if any more rocket smoke was\nfloating above. And soon we heard a distant whistle.\n\nWe found about half the Gang already there, in a spot where the trees\nmet high above a little stream. The Big Boss and Raid Bosses were busy\nreorganizing the remnants.\n\nWe reported to Boss Hart at once. He was silent, but interested, when he\nheard our story.\n\n\"You two stick close to me,\" he said, adding grimly, \"I'm going back to\nthe valley at once with a hundred picked men, and I'll need you.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nSetting the Trap\n\n\nInside of fifteen minutes we were on our way. A certain amount of\ncaution was sacrificed for the sake of speed, and the men leaped away\neither across the forest top, or over open spaces of ground, but\nconcentration was forbidden. The Big Boss named the spot on the hillside\nas the rallying point.\n\n\"We'll have to take a chance on being seen, so long as we don't group,\"\nhe declared, \"at least until within five miles of the rallying spot.\nFrom then on I want every man to disappear from sight and to travel\nunder cover. And keep your ultrophones open, and tuned on\nten-four-seven-six.\"\n\nWilma and I had received our battle equipment from the Gear boss. It\nconsisted of a long-gun, a hand-gun, with a special case of ammunition\nconstructed of inertron, which made the load weigh but a few ounces, and\na short sword. This gear we strapped over each other's shoulders, on top\nof our jumping belts. In addition, we each received an ultrophone, and a\nlight inertron blanket rolled into a cylinder about six inches long by\ntwo or three in diameter. This fabric was exceedingly thin and light,\nbut it had considerable warmth, because of the mixture of inertron in\nits composition.\n\n[Illustration: The Han raider neared with incredible speed. Its rays\nwere both slanted astern at a sharp angle, so that it slid forward with\ntremendous momentum.... Whenever the disintegrator rays flashed downward\nwith blinding brilliancy, forest, rocks and ground melted\ninstantaneously into nothing, where they played upon them.]\n\n\"This looks like business,\" Wilma remarked to me with sparkling eyes.\n(And I might mention a curious thing here. The word \"business\" had\nsurvived from the 20th Century American vocabulary, but not with any\nmeaning of \"industry\" or \"trade,\" for such things being purely community\nactivities were spoken of as \"work\" and \"clearing.\" Business simply\nmeant fighting, and that was all.)\n\n\"Did you bring all this equipment from the valley?\" I asked the Gear\nBoss.\n\n\"No,\" he said. \"There was no time to gather anything. All this stuff we\ncleared from the Susquannas a few hours ago. I was with the Boss on the\nway down, and he had me jump on ahead and arrange it. But you two had\nbetter be moving. He's beckoning you now.\"\n\nHart was about to call us on our phones when we looked up. As soon as we\ndid so, he leaped away, waving us to follow closely.\n\nHe was a powerful man, and he darted ahead in long, swift, low leaps up\nthe banks of the stream, which followed a fairly straight course at this\npoint. By extending ourselves, however, Wilma and I were able to catch\nup to him.\n\nAs we gradually synchronized our leaps with his, he outlined to us,\nbetween the grunts that accompanied each leap, his plan of action.\n\n\"We have to start the big business--unh--sooner or later,\" he said.\n\"And if--unh--the Hans have found any way of locating our\npositions--unh--it's time to start now, although the Council of\nBosses--unh--had intended waiting a few years until enough rocket ships\nhave been--unh--built. But no matter what the sacrifice--unh--we can't\nafford to let them get us on the run--unh--. We'll set a trap for the\nyellow devils in the--unh--valley if they come back for their\nwreckage--unh--and if they don't, we'll go rocketing for some of their\nliners--unh--on the Nu-yok, Clee-lan, Si-ka-ga course. We can\nuse--unh--that idea of yours of shooting up the repellor--unh--beams.\nWant you to give us a demonstration.\"\n\nWith further admonition to follow him closely, he increased his pace,\nand Wilma and I were taxed to our utmost to keep up with him. It was\nonly in ascending the slopes that my tougher muscles overbalanced his\ngreater skill, and I was able to set the pace for him, as I had for\nWilma.\n\nWe slept in greater comfort that night, under our inertron blankets, and\nwere off with the dawn, leaping cautiously to the top of the ridge\noverlooking the valley which Wilma and I had left.\n\nThe Boss scanned the sky with his ultroscope, patiently taking some\nfifteen minutes to the task, and then swung his phone into use, calling\nthe roll and giving the men their instructions.\n\nHis first order was for us all to slip our ear and chest discs into\npermanent position.\n\nThese ultrophones were quite different from the one used by Wilma's\ncompanion scout the day I saved her from the vicious attack of the\nbandit Gang. That one was contained entirely in a small pocket case.\nThese, with which we were now equipped, consisted of a pair of ear\ndiscs, each a separate and self-contained receiving set. They slipped\ninto little pockets over our ears in the fabric helmets we wore, and\nshut out virtually all extraneous sounds. The chest discs were likewise\nself-contained sending sets, strapped to the chest a few inches below\nthe neck and actuated by the vibrations from the vocal cords through the\nbody tissues. The total range of these sets was about eighteen miles.\nReception was remarkably clear, quite free from the static that so\nmarked the 20th Century radios, and of a strength in direct proportion\nto the distance of the speaker.\n\nThe Boss' set was triple powered, so that his orders would cut in on any\nlocal conversations, which were indulged in, however, with great\nrestraint, and only for the purpose of maintaining contacts.\n\nI marveled at the efficiency of this modern method of battle\ncommunication in contrast to the clumsy signaling devices of more\nancient times; and also at other military contrasts in which the 20th\nand 25th Century methods were the reverse of each other in efficiency.\nThese modern Americans, for instance, knew little of hand to hand\nfighting, and nothing, naturally, of trench warfare. Of barrages they\nwere quite ignorant, although they possessed weapons of terrific power.\nAnd until my recent flash of inspiration, no one among them, apparently,\nhad ever thought of the scheme of shooting a rocket into a repellor beam\nand letting the beam itself hurl it upward into the most vital part of\nthe Han ship.\n\nHart patiently placed his men, first giving his instructions to the\ncampmasters, and then remaining silent, while they placed the\nindividuals.\n\nIn the end, the hundred men were ringed about the valley, on the\nhillsides and tops, each in a position from which he had a good view of\nthe wreckage of the Han ship. But not a man had come in view, so far as\nI could see, in the whole process.\n\nThe Boss explained to me that it was his idea that he, Wilma and I\nshould investigate the wreck. If Han ships should appear in the sky, we\nwould leap for the hillsides.\n\nI suggested to him to have the men set up their long-guns trained on an\nimaginary circle surrounding the wreck. He busied himself with this\nafter the three of us leaped down to the Han ship, serving as a target\nhimself, while he called on the men individually to aim their pieces and\nlock them in position.\n\nIn the meantime Wilma and I climbed into the wreckage, but did not find\nmuch. Practically all of the instruments and machinery had been twisted\nout of all recognizable shape, or utterly destroyed by the ship's\ndisintegrator rays which apparently had continued to operate in the\nmidst of its warped remains for some moments after the crash.\n\nIt was unpleasant work searching the mangled bodies of the crew. But it\nhad to be done. The Han clothing, I observed, was quite different from\nthat of the Americans, and in many respects more like the garb to which\nI had been accustomed in the earlier part of my life. It was made of\nsynthetic fabrics like silks, loose and comfortable trousers of knee\nlength, and sleeveless shirts.\n\nNo protection, except that against drafts, was needed, Wilma explained\nto me, for the Han cities were entirely enclosed, with splendid\narrangements for ventilation and heating. These arrangements of course\nwere equally adequate in their airships. The Hans, indeed, had quite a\ndistaste for unshaded daylight, since their lighting apparatus diffused\na controlled amount of violet rays, making the unmodified sunlight\nunnecessary for health, and undesirable for comfort. Since the Hans did\nnot have the secret of inertron, none of them wore anti-gravity belts.\nYet in spite of the fact that they had to bear their own full weights at\nall times, they were physically far inferior to the Americans, for they\nlived lives of degenerative physical inertia, having machinery of every\ndescription for the performance of all labor, and convenient conveyances\nfor any movement of more than a few steps.\n\nEven from the twisted wreckage of this ship I could see that seats,\nchairs and couches played an extremely important part in their scheme of\nexistence.\n\nBut none of the bodies were overweight. They seemed to have been the\nbodies of men in good health, but muscularly much underdeveloped. Wilma\nexplained to me that they had mastered the science of gland control, and\nof course dietetics, to the point where men and women among them not\nuncommonly reached the age of a hundred years with arteries and general\nhealth in splendid condition.\n\nI did not have time to study the ship and its contents as carefully as I\nwould have liked, however. Time pressed, and it was our business to\ndiscover some clue to the deadly accuracy with which the ship had\nspotted the Wyoming Works.\n\nThe Boss had hardly finished his arrangements for the ring barrage, when\none of the scouts on an eminence to the north, announced the approach of\nseven Han ships, spread out in a great semi-circle.\n\nHart leaped for the hillside, calling to us to do likewise, but Wilma\nand I had raised the flaps of our helmets and switched off our\n\"speakers\" for conversation between ourselves, and by the time we\ndiscovered what had happened, the ships were clearly visible, so fast\nwere they approaching.\n\n\"Jump!\" we heard the Boss order, \"Deering to the north. Rogers to the\neast.\"\n\nBut Wilma looked at me meaningly and pointed to where the twisted plates\nof the ship, projecting from the ground, offered a shelter.\n\n\"Too late, Boss,\" she said. \"They'd see us. Besides I think there's\nsomething here we ought to look at. It's probably their magnetic graph.\"\n\n\"You're signing your death warrant,\" Hart warned.\n\n\"We'll risk it,\" said Wilma and I together.\n\n\"Good for you,\" replied the Boss. \"Take command then, Rogers, for the\npresent. Do you all know his voice, boys?\"\n\nA chorus of assent rang in our ears, and I began to do some fast\nthinking as the girl and I ducked into the twisted mass of metal.\n\n\"Wilma, hunt for that record,\" I said, knowing that by the simple\nprocess of talking I could keep the entire command continuously informed\nas to the situation. \"On the hillsides, keep your guns trained on the\ncircles and stand by. On the hilltops, how many of you are there? Speak\nin rotation from Bald Knob around to the east, north, west.\"\n\nIn turn the men called their names. There were twenty of them.\n\nI assigned them by name to cover the various Han ships, numbering the\nlatter from left to right.\n\n\"Train your rockets on their repellor rays about three-quarters of the\nway up, between ships and ground. Aim is more important than elevation.\nFollow those rays with your aim continuously. Shoot when I tell you, not\nbefore. Deering has the record. The Hans probably have not seen us, or\nat least think there are but two of us in the valley, since they're\nsettling without opening up disintegrators. Any opinions?\"\n\nMy ear discs remained silent.\n\n\"Deering and I remain here until they land and debark. Stand by and keep\nalert.\"\n\nRapidly and easily the largest of the Han ships settled to the earth.\nThree scouted sharply to the south, rising to a higher level. The others\nfloated motionless about a thousand feet above.\n\nPeeping through a small fissure between two plates, I saw the vast hulk\nof the ship come to rest full on the line of our prospective ring\nbarrage. A door clanged open a couple of feet from the ground, and one\nby one the crew emerged.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nThe \"Wyoming Massacre\"\n\n\n\"They're coming out of the ship.\" I spoke quietly, with my hand over\nmy mouth, for fear they might hear me. \"One--two--three--four,\nfive--six--seven--eight--nine. That seems to be all. Who knows how\nmany men a ship like that is likely to carry?\"\n\n\"About ten, if there are no passengers,\" replied one of my men, probably\none of those on the hillside.\n\n\"How are they armed?\" I asked.\n\n\"Just knives,\" came the reply. \"They never permit hand-rays on the\nships. Afraid of accidents. Have a ruling against it.\"\n\n\"Leave them to us then,\" I said, for I had a hastily formed plan in my\nmind. \"You, on the hillsides, take the ships above. Abandon the ring\ntarget. Divide up in training on those repellor rays. You, on the\nhilltops, all train on the repellors of the ships to the south. Shoot at\nthe word, but not before.\n\n\"Wilma, crawl over to your left where you can make a straight leap for\nthe door in that ship. These men are all walking around the wreck in a\nbunch. When they're on the far side, I'll give the word and you leap\nthrough that door in one bound. I'll follow. Maybe we won't be seen.\nWe'll overpower the guard inside, but don't shoot. We may escape being\nseen by both this crew and ships above. They can't see over this wreck.\"\n\nIt was so easy that it seemed too good to be true. The Hans who had\nemerged from the ship walked round the wreckage lazily, talking in\nguttural tones, keenly interested in the wreck, but quite unsuspicious.\n\nAt last they were on the far side. In a moment they would be picking\ntheir way into the wreck.\n\n\"Wilma, leap!\" I almost whispered the order.\n\nThe distance between Wilma's hiding place and the door in the side of\nthe Han ship was not more than fifteen feet. She was already crouched\nwith her feet braced against a metal beam. Taking the lift of that\nwonderful inertron belt into her calculation, she dove headforemost,\nlike a green projectile, through the door. I followed in a split second,\nmore clumsily, but no less speedily, bruising my shoulder painfully, as\nI ricocheted from the edge of the opening and brought up sliding against\nthe unconscious girl; for she evidently had hit her head against the\npartition within the ship into which she had crashed.\n\nWe had made some noise within the ship. Shuffling footsteps were\napproaching down a well lit gangway.\n\n\"Any signs we have been observed?\" I asked my men on the hillsides.\n\n\"Not yet,\" I heard the Boss reply. \"Ships overhead still standing. No\nbeams have been broken out. Men on ground absorbed in wreck. Most of\nthem have crawled into it out of sight.\"\n\n\"Good,\" I said quickly. \"Deering hit her head. Knocked out. One or more\nmembers of the crew approaching. We're not discovered yet. I'll take\ncare of them. Stand a bit longer, but be ready.\"\n\nI think my last words must have been heard by the man who was\napproaching, for he stopped suddenly.\n\nI crouched at the far side of the compartment, motionless. I would not\ndraw my sword if there were only one of them. He would be a weakling, I\nfigured, and I should easily overcome him with my bare hands.\n\nApparently reassured at the absence of any further sound, a man came\naround a sort of bulkhead--and I leaped.\n\nI swung my legs up in front of me as I did so, catching him full in the\nstomach and knocked him cold.\n\nI ran forward along the keel gangway, searching for the control room. I\nfound it well up in the nose of the ship. And it was deserted. What\ncould I do to jam the controls of the ships that would not register on\nthe recording instruments of the other ships? I gazed at the mass of\ncontrols. Levers and wheels galore. In the center of the compartment, on\na massively braced universal joint mounting, was what I took for the\nrepellor generator. A dial on it glowed and a faint hum came from within\nits shielding metallic case. But I had no time to study it.\n\nAbove all else, I was afraid that some automatic telephone apparatus\nexisted in the room, through which I might be heard on the other ships.\nThe risk of trying to jam the controls was too great. I abandoned the\nidea and withdrew softly. I would have to take a chance that there was\nno other member of the crew aboard.\n\nI ran back to the entrance compartment. Wilma still lay where she had\nslumped down. I heard the voices of the Hans approaching. It was time to\nact. The next few seconds would tell whether the ships in the air would\ntry or be able to melt us into nothingness. I spoke.\n\n\"Are you boys all ready?\" I asked, creeping to a position opposite the\ndoor and drawing my hand-gun.\n\nAgain there was a chorus of assent.\n\n\"Then on the count of three, shoot up those repellor rays--all of\nthem--and for God's sake, don't miss.\" And I counted.\n\nI think my \"three\" was a bit weak. I know it took all the courage I had\nto utter it.\n\nFor an agonizing instant nothing happened, except that the landing party\nfrom the ship strolled into my range of vision.\n\nThen startled, they turned their eyes upward. For an instant they stood\nfrozen with horror at whatever they saw.\n\nOne hurled his knife at me. It grazed my cheek. Then a couple of them\nmade a break for the doorway. The rest followed. But I fired pointblank\nwith my hand-gun, pressing the button as fast as I could and aiming at\ntheir feet to make sure my explosive rockets would make contact and do\ntheir work.\n\nThe detonations of my rockets were deafening. The spot on which the Hans\nstood flashed into a blinding glare. Then there was nothing there except\ntheir torn and mutilated corpses. They had been fairly bunched, and I\ngot them all.\n\nI ran to the door, expecting any instant to be hurled into infinity by\nthe sweep of a disintegrator ray.\n\nSome eighth of a mile away I saw one of the ships crash to earth. A\ndisintegrator ray came into my line of vision, wavered uncertainly for a\nmoment and then began to sweep directly toward the ship in which I\nstood. But it never reached it. Suddenly, like a light switched off, it\nshot to one side, and a moment later another vast hulk crashed to earth.\nI looked out, then stepped out on the ground.\n\nThe only Han ships in the sky were two of the scouts to the south which\nwere hanging perpendicularly, and sagging slowly down. The others must\nhave crashed down while I was deafened by the sound of the explosion of\nmy own rockets.\n\nSomebody hit the other repellor ray of one of the two remaining ships\nand it fell out of sight beyond a hilltop. The other, farther away,\ndrifted down diagonally, its disintegrator ray playing viciously over\nthe ground below it.\n\nI shouted with exultation and relief.\n\n\"Take back the command, Boss!\" I yelled.\n\nHis commands, sending out jumpers in pursuit of the descending ship,\nrang in my ears, but I paid no attention to them. I leaped back into the\ncompartment of the Han ship and knelt beside my Wilma. Her padded helmet\nhad absorbed much of the blow, I thought; otherwise, her skull might\nhave been fractured.\n\n\"Oh, my head!\" she groaned, coming to as I lifted her gently in my arms\nand strode out in the open with her. \"We must have won, dearest, did\nwe?\"\n\n\"We most certainly did,\" I reassured her. \"All but one crashed and that\none is drifting down toward the south; we've captured this one we're in\nintact. There was only one member of the crew aboard when we dove in.\"\n\n[Illustration: As the American leaped, he swung his legs up in front of\nhim, catching the Han full in the stomach.]\n\nLess than an hour afterward the Big Boss ordered the outfit to tune in\nultrophones on three-twenty-three to pick up a translated broadcast of\nthe Han intelligence office in Nu-yok from the Susquanna station. It\nwas in the form of a public warning and news item, and read as follows:\n\n\"This is Public Intelligence Office, Nu-yok, broadcasting warning to\nnavigators of private ships, and news of public interest. The squadron\nof seven ships, which left Nu-yok this morning to investigate the recent\ndestruction of the GK-984 in the Wyoming Valley, has been destroyed by a\nseries of mysterious explosions similar to those which wrecked the\nGK-984.\n\n\"The phones, viewplates, and all other signaling devices of five of the\nseven ships ceased operating suddenly at approximately the same moment,\nabout seven-four-nine.\" (According to the Han system of reckoning time,\nseven and forty-nine one hundredths after midnight.) \"After violent\ndisturbances the location finders went out of operation. Electroactivity\nregisters applied to the territory of the Wyoming Valley remain dead.\n\n\"The Intelligence Office has no indication of the kind of disaster which\novertook the squadron except certain evidences of explosive phenomena\nsimilar to those in the case of the GK-984, which recently went dead\nwhile beaming the valley in a systematic effort to wipe out the works\nand camps of the tribesmen. The Office considers, as obvious, the\ndeduction that the tribesmen have developed a new, and as yet\nundetermined, technique of attack on airships, and has recommended to\nthe Heaven-Born that immediate and unlimited authority be given the\nNavigation Intelligence Division to make an investigation of this\ntechnique and develop a defense against it.\n\n\"In the meantime it urges that private navigators avoid this territory\nin particular, and in general hold as closely as possible to the\nofficial inter-city routes, which now are being patrolled by the entire\nforce of the Military Office, which is beaming the routes generously to\na width of ten miles. The Military Office reports that it is at present\nconsidering no retaliatory raids against the tribesmen. With the\nNavigation Intelligence Division, it holds that unless further evidence\nof the nature of the disaster is developed in the near future, the\npublic interest will be better served, and at smaller cost of life, by a\nscientific research than by attempts at retaliation, which may bring\ndestruction on all ships engaging therein. So unless further evidence\nactually is developed, or the Heaven-Born orders to the contrary, the\nMilitary will hold to a defensive policy.\n\n\"Unofficial intimations from Lo-Tan are to the effect that the\nHeaven-Council has the matter under consideration.\n\n\"The Navigation Intelligence Office permits the broadcast of the\nfollowing condensation of its detailed observations:\n\n\"The squadron proceeded to a position above the Wyoming Valley where\nthe wreck of the GK-984 was known to be, from the record of its location\nfinder before it went dead recently. There the bottom projectoscope\nrelays of all ships registered the wreck of the GK-984. Teleprojectoscope\nviews of the wreck and the bowl of the valley showed no evidence of the\npresence of tribesmen. Neither ship registers nor base registers showed\nany indication of electroactivity except from the squadron itself. On\norders from the Base Squadron Commander, the LD-248, LK-745 and LG-25\nscouted southward at 3,000 feet. The GK-43, GK-981 and GK-220 stood\nabove at 2,500 feet, and the GK-18 landed to permit personal inspection\nof the wreck by the science committee. The party debarked, leaving one\nman on board in the control cabin. He set all projectoscopes at\nuniversal focus except RB-3,\" (this meant the third projectoscope from\nthe bow of the ship, on the right-hand side of the lower deck) \"with\nwhich he followed the landing group as it walked around the wreck.\n\n\"The first abnormal phenomenon recorded by any of the instruments at\nBase was that relayed automatically from projectoscope RB-4 of the\nGK-18, which as the party disappeared from view in back of the wreck,\nrecorded two green missiles of roughly cylindrical shape, projected from\nthe wreckage into the landing compartment of the ship. At such close\nrange these were not clearly defined, owing to the universal focus at\nwhich the projectoscope was set. The Base Captain of GK-18 at once\nordered the man in the control room to investigate, and saw him leave\nthe control room in compliance with this order. An instant later\nconfused sounds reached the control-room electrophone, such as might be\nmade by a man falling heavily, and footsteps reapproached the control\nroom, a figure entering and leaving the control room hurriedly. The Base\nCaptain now believes, and the stills of the photorecord support his\nbelief, that this was not the crew member who had been left in the\ncontrol room. Before the Base Captain could speak to him he left the\nroom, nor was any response given to the attention signal the Captain\nflashed throughout the ship.\n\n\"At this point projectoscope RB-3 of the ship now out of focus control,\ndimly showed the landing party walking back toward the ship. RB-4 showed\nit more clearly. Then on both these instruments, a number of blinding\nexplosives in rapid succession were seen and the electrophone relays\nregistered terrific concussions; the ship's electronic apparatus and\nprojectoscopes apparatus went dead.\n\n\"Reports of the other ships' Base Observers and Executives, backed by\nthe photorecords, show the explosions as taking place in the midst of\nthe landing party as it returned, evidently unsuspicious, to the ship.\nThen in rapid succession they indicate that terrific explosions occurred\ninside and outside the three ships standing above close to their rep-ray\ngenerators, and all signals from these ships thereupon went dead.\n\n\"Of the three ships scouting to the south, the LD-248 suffered an\nidentical fate, at the same moment. Its records add little to the\nknowledge of the disaster. But with the LK-745 and the LG-25 it was\ndifferent.\n\n\"The relay instruments of the LK-745 indicated the destruction by an\nexplosion of the rear rep-ray generator, and that the ship hung stern\ndown for a short space, swinging like a pendulum. The forward viewplates\nand indicators did not cease functioning, but their records are chaotic,\nexcept for one projectoscope still, which shows the bowl of the valley,\nand the GK-981 falling, but no visible evidence of tribesmen. The\ncontrol-room viewplate is also a chaotic record of the ship's crew\ntumbling and falling to the rear wall. Then the forward rep-ray\ngenerator exploded, and all signals went dead.\n\n\"The fate of the LG-25 was somewhat similar, except that this ship hung\nnose down, and drifted on the wind southward as it slowly descended out\nof control.\n\n\"As its control room was shattered, verbal report from its Action\nCaptain was precluded. The record of the interior rear viewplate shows\nmembers of the crew climbing toward the rear rep-ray generator in an\nattempt to establish manual control of it, and increase the lift. The\nprojectoscope relays, swinging in wide arcs, recorded little of value\nexcept at the ends of their swings. One of these, from a machine which\nhappened to be set in telescopic focus, shows several views of great\nvalue in picturing the falls of the other ships, and all of the rear\nprojectoscope records enable the reconstruction in detail of the\npendulum and torsional movements of the ship, and its sag toward the\nearth. But none of the views showing the forest below contain any\nindication of tribesmen's presence. A final explosion put this ship out\nof commission at a height of 1,000 feet, and at a point four miles S. by\nE. of the center of the valley.\"\n\nThe message ended with a repetition of the warning to other airmen to\navoid the valley.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nIncredible Treason\n\n\nAfter receiving this report, and reassurances of support from the Big\nBosses of the neighboring Gangs, Hart determined to reestablish the\nWyoming Valley community.\n\nA careful survey of the territory showed that it was only the northern\nsections and slopes that had been \"beamed\" by the first Han ship.\n\nThe synthetic-fabrics plant had been partially wiped out, though the\nlower levels underground had not been reached by the dis ray. The forest\nscreen above it, however, had been annihilated, and it was determined to\nabandon it, after removing all usable machinery and evidences of the\nprocesses that might be of interest to the Han scientists, should they\nreturn to the valley in the future.\n\nThe ammunition plant, and the rocket-ship plant, which had just been\nabout to start operation at the time of the raid, were intact, as were\nthe other important plants.\n\nHart brought the Camboss up from the Susquanna Works, and laid out new\ncamp locations, scattering them farther to the south, and avoiding\nground which had been seared by the Han beams and the immediate\nlocations of the Han wrecks.\n\nDuring this period, a sharp check was kept upon Han messages, for the\nphone plant had been one of the first to be put in operation, and when\nit became evident that the Hans did not intend any immediate reprisals,\nthe entire membership of the community was summoned back, and normal\nlife was resumed.\n\nWilma and I had been married the day after the destruction of the ships,\nand spent this intervening period in a delightful honeymoon, camping\nhigh in the mountains. On our return, we had a camp of our own, of\ncourse. We were assigned to location 1017. And as might be expected, we\nhad a great deal of banter over which one of us was Camp Boss. The title\nstood after my name on the Big Boss' records, and those of the Big\nCamboss, of course, but Wilma airily held that this meant nothing at\nall--and generally succeeded in making me admit it whenever she chose.\n\nI found myself a full-fledged member of the Gang now, for I had elected\nto search no farther for a permanent alliance, much as I would have\nliked to familiarize myself with this 25th Century life in other\nsections of the country. The Wyomings had a high morale, and had\nprospered under the rule of Big Boss Hart for many years. But many of\nthe gangs, I found, were badly organized, lacked strong hands in\nauthority, and were rife with intrigue. On the whole, I thought I would\nbe wise to stay with a group which had already proved its friendliness,\nand in which I seemed to have prospects of advancement. Under these\nmodern social and economic conditions, the kind of individual freedom to\nwhich I had been accustomed in the 20th Century was impossible. I would\nhave been as much of a nonentity in every phase of human relationship by\nattempting to avoid alliances, as any man of the 20th Century would have\nbeen politically, who aligned himself with no political party.\n\nThis entire modern life, it appeared to me, judging from my ancient\nviewpoint, was organized along what I called \"political\" lines. And in\nthis connection, it amused me to notice how universal had become the use\nof the word \"boss.\" The leader, the person in charge or authority over\nanything, was a \"boss.\" There was as little formality in his relations\nwith his followers as there was in the case of the 20th Century\npolitical boss, and the same high respect paid him by his followers as\nwell as the same high consideration by him of their interests. He was\njust as much of an autocrat, and just as much dependent upon the general\npopularity of his actions for the ability to maintain his autocracy.\n\nThe sub-boss who could not command the loyalty of his followers was as\nquickly deposed, either by them or by his superiors, as the ancient ward\nleader of the 20th Century who lost control of his votes.\n\nAs society was organized in the 20th Century, I do not believe the\nsystem could have worked in anything but politics. I tremble to think\nwhat would have happened, had the attempt been made to handle the A. E.\nF. this way during the First World War, instead of by that rigid\nmilitary discipline and complete assumption of the individual as a mere\nstandardized cog in the machine.\n\nBut owing to the centuries of desperate suffering the people had endured\nat the hands of the Hans, there developed a spirit of self-sacrifice and\nconsideration for the common good that made the scheme applicable and\nefficient in all forms of human co-operation.\n\nI have a little heresy about all this, however. My associates regard the\nthought with as much horror as many worthy people of the 20th Century\nfelt in regard to any heretical suggestion that the original outline of\ngovernment as laid down in the First Constitution did not apply as well\nto 20th Century conditions as to those of the early 19th.\n\nIn later years, I felt that there was a certain softening of moral fiber\namong the people, since the Hans had been finally destroyed with all\ntheir works; and Americans have developed a new luxury economy. I have\nseen signs of the reawakening of greed, of selfishness. The eternal\ncycle seems to be at work. I fear that slowly, though surely, private\nwealth is reappearing, codes of inflexibility are developing; they will\nbe followed by corruption, degradation; and in the end some cataclysmic\nevent will end this era and usher in a new one.\n\nAll this, however, is wandering afar from my story, which concerns our\nearly battles against the Hans, and not our more modern problems of\nself-control.\n\nOur victory over the seven Han ships had set the country ablaze. The\nsecret had been carefully communicated to the other gangs, and the\ncountry was agog from one end to the other. There was feverish activity\nin the ammunition plants, and the hunting of stray Han ships became an\nenthusiastic sport. The results were disastrous to our hereditary\nenemies.\n\nFrom the Pacific Coast came the report of a great transpacific liner of\n75,000 tons \"lift\" being brought to earth from a position of\ninvisibility above the clouds. A dozen Sacramentos had caught the hazy\noutlines of its rep rays approaching them, head-on, in the twilight,\nlike ghostly pillars reaching into the sky. They had fired rockets into\nit with ease, whereas they would have had difficulty in hitting it if it\nhad been moving at right angles to their position. They got one rep ray.\nThe other was not strong enough to hold it up. It floated to earth, nose\ndown, and since it was unarmed and unarmored, they had no difficulty in\nshooting it to pieces and massacring its crew and passengers. It seemed\nbarbarous to me. But then I did not have centuries of bitter persecution\nin my blood.\n\nFrom the Jersey Beaches we received news of the destruction of a\nNu-yok-A-lan-a liner. The Sand-snipers, practically invisible in their\nsand-colored clothing, and half buried along the beaches, lay in wait\nfor days, risking the play of dis beams along the route, and finally\nregistering four hits within a week. The Hans discontinued their service\nalong this route, and as evidence that they were badly shaken by our\nsuccess, sent no raiders down the Beaches.\n\nIt was a few weeks later that Big Boss Hart sent for me.\n\n\"Tony,\" he said, \"There are two things I want to talk to you about. One\nof them will become public property in a few days, I think. We aren't\ngoing to get any more Han ships by shooting up their repellor rays\nunless we use much larger rockets. They are wise to us now. They're\nputting armor of great thickness in the hulls of their ships below the\nrep-ray machines. Near Bah-flo this morning a party of Eries shot one\nwithout success. The explosions staggered her, but did not penetrate. As\nnear as we can gather from their reports, their laboratories have\ndeveloped a new alloy of great tensile strength and elasticity which\nnevertheless lets the rep rays through like a sieve. Our reports\nindicate that the Eries' rockets bounced off harmlessly. Most of the\nparty was wiped out as the dis rays went into action on them.\n\n\"This is going to mean real business for all of the gangs before long.\nThe Big Bosses have just held a national ultrophone council. It was\ndecided that America must organize on a national basis. The first move\nis to develop sectional organization by Zones. I have been made\nSuperboss of the Mid-Atlantic Zone.\n\n\"We're in for it now. The Hans are sure to launch reprisal expeditions.\nIf we're to save the race we must keep them away from our camps and\nplants. I'm thinking of developing a permanent field force, along the\nlines of the regular armies of the 20th Century you told me about. Its\nbusiness will be twofold: to carry the warfare as much as possible to\nthe Hans, and to serve as a decoy, to keep their attention from our\nplants. I'm going to need your help in this.\n\n\"The other thing I wanted to talk to you about is this: Amazing and\nimpossible as it seems, there is a group, or perhaps an entire gang,\nsomewhere among us, that is betraying us to the Hans. It may be the Bad\nBloods, or it may be one of those gangs who live near one of the Han\ncities. You know, a hundred and fifteen or twenty years ago there were\ncertain of these people's ancestors who actually degraded themselves by\nmating with the Hans, sometimes even serving them as slaves, in the days\nbefore they brought all their service machinery to perfection.\n\n\"There is such a gang, called the Nagras, up near Bah-flo, and another\nin Mid-Jersey that men call the Pineys. But I hardly suspect the Pineys.\nThere is little intelligence among them. They wouldn't have the\ninformation to give the Hans, nor would they be capable of imparting it.\nThey're absolute savages.\"\n\n\"Just what evidence is there that anybody has been clearing information\nto the Hans?\" I asked.\n\n\"Well,\" he replied, \"first of all there was that raid upon us. That\nfirst Han ship knew the location of our plants exactly. You remember it\nfloated directly into position above the valley and began a systematic\nbeaming. Then, the Hans quite obviously have learned that we are picking\nup their electrophone waves, for they've gone back to their old, but\nextremely accurate, system of directional control. But we've been\ngetting them for the past week by installing automatic re-broadcast\nunits along the scar paths. This is what the Americans called those\nstrips of country directly under the regular ship routes of the Hans,\nwho as a matter of precaution frequently blasted them with their dis\nbeams to prevent the growth of foliage which might give shelter to the\nAmericans. But they've been beaming those paths so hard, it looks as\nthough they even had information of this strategy. And in addition,\nthey've been using code. Finally, we've picked up three of their\nmessages in which they discuss, with some nervousness, the existence of\nour 'mysterious' ultrophone.\"\n\n\"But they still have no knowledge of the nature and control of ultronic\nactivity?\" I asked.\n\n\"No,\" said the Big Boss thoughtfully, \"they don't seem to have a bit of\ninformation about it.\"\n\n\"Then it's quite clear,\" I ventured, \"that whoever is 'clearing' us to\nthem is doing it piecemeal. It sounds like a bit of occasional barter,\nrather than an out-and-out alliance. They're holding back as much\ninformation as possible for future bartering, perhaps.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Hart said, \"and it isn't information the Hans are giving in\nreturn, but some form of goods, or privilege. The trick would be to\nlocate the goods. I guess I'll have to make a personal trip around among\nthe Big Bosses.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nThe Han City\n\n\nThis conversation set me thinking. All of the Han electrophone\ninter-communication had been an open record to the Americans for a good\nmany years, and the Hans were just finding it out. For centuries they\nhad not regarded us as any sort of a menace. Unquestionably it had never\noccurred to them to secrete their own records. Somewhere in Nu-yok or\nBah-flo, or possibly in Lo-Tan itself, the record of this traitorous\ntransaction would be more or less openly filed. If we could only get at\nit! I wondered if a raid might not be possible.\n\nBill Hearn and I talked it over with our Han-affairs Boss and his\nexperts. There ensued several days of research, in which the Han records\nof the entire decade were scanned and analyzed. In the end they picked\nout a mass of detail, and fitted it together into a very definite\npicture of the great central filing office of the Hans in Nu-yok, where\nthe entire mass of official records was kept, constantly available for\ninstant projectoscoping to any of the city's offices, and of the system\nby which the information was filed.\n\nThe attempt began to look feasible, though Hart instantly turned the\nidea down when I first presented it to him. It was unthinkable, he said.\nSheer suicide. But in the end I persuaded him.\n\n\"I will need,\" I said, \"Blash, who is thoroughly familiar with the Han\nlibrary system; Bert Gaunt, who for years has specialized on their\nmilitary offices; Bill Barker, the ray specialist, and the best swooper\npilot we have.\" _Swoopers_ are one-man and two-man ships, developed by\nthe Americans, with skeleton backbones of inertron (during the war\npainted green for invisibility against the green forests below) and\n\"bellies\" of clear ultron.\n\n\"That will be Mort Gibbons,\" said Hart. \"We've only got three swoopers\nleft, Tony, but I'll risk one of them if you and the others will\nvoluntarily risk your existences. But mind, I won't urge or order one of\nyou to go. I'll spread the word to every Plant Boss at once to give you\nanything and everything you need in the way of equipment.\"\n\nWhen I told Wilma of the plan, I expected her to raise violent and\ntearful objections, but she didn't. She was made of far sterner stuff\nthan the women of the 20th Century. Not that she couldn't weep as\ncopiously or be just as whimsical on occasion; but she wouldn't weep for\nthe same reasons.\n\nShe just gave me an unfathomable look, in which there seemed to be a bit\nof pride, and asked eagerly for the details. I confess I was somewhat\ndisappointed that she could so courageously risk my loss, even though I\nwas amazed at her fortitude. But later I was to learn how little I knew\nher then.\n\nWe were ready to slide off at dawn the next morning. I had kissed Wilma\ngood-bye at our camp, and after a final conference over our plans, we\nboarded our craft and gently glided away over the tree tops on a course,\nwhich, after crossing three routes of the Han ships, would take us out\nover the Atlantic, off the Jersey coast, whence we would come up on\nNu-yok from the ocean.\n\nTwice we had to nose down and lie motionless on the ground near a route\nwhile Han ships passed. Those were tense moments. Had the green back of\nour ship been observed, we would have been disintegrated in a second.\nBut it wasn't.\n\nOnce over the water, however, we climbed in a great spiral, ten miles in\ndiameter, until our altimeter registered ten miles. Here Gibbons shut\noff his rocket motor, and we floated, far above the level of the\nAtlantic liners, whose course was well to the north of us anyhow, and\nwaited for nightfall.\n\nThen Gibbons turned from his control long enough to grin at me.\n\n\"I have a surprise for you, Tony,\" he said, throwing back the lid of\nwhat I had supposed was a big supply case. And with a sigh of relief,\nWilma stepped out of the case.\n\n\"If you 'go into zero' (a common expression of the day for being\nannihilated by the disintegrator ray), you don't think I'm going to let\nyou go alone, do you, Tony? I couldn't believe my ears last night when\nyou spoke of going without me, until I realized that you are still five\nhundred years behind the times in lots of ways. Don't you know, dear\nheart, that you offered me the greatest insult a husband could give a\nwife? You didn't, of course.\"\n\nThe others, it seemed, had all been in on the secret, and now they would\nhave kidded me unmercifully, except that Wilma's eyes blazed\ndangerously.\n\nAt nightfall, we maneuvered to a position directly above the city. This\ntook some time and calculation on the part of Bill Barker, who explained\nto me that he had to determine our point by ultronic bearings. The\nslightest resort to an electronic instrument, he feared, might be\ndetected by our enemies' locators. In fact, we did not dare bring our\nswooper any lower than five miles for fear that its capacity might be\nreflected in their instruments.\n\nFinally, however, he succeeded in locating above the central tower of\nthe city.\n\n\"If my calculations are as much as ten feet off,\" he remarked with\nconfidence, \"I'll eat the tower. Now the rest is up to you, Mort. See\nwhat you can do to hold her steady. No--here, watch this indicator--the\nred beam, not the green one. See--if you keep it exactly centered on the\nneedle, you're O.K. The width of the beam represents seventeen feet. The\ntower platform is fifty feet square, so we've got a good margin to work\non.\"\n\nFor several moments we watched as Gibbons bent over his levers,\nconstantly adjusting them with deft touches of his fingers. After a bit\nof wavering, the beam remained centered on the needle.\n\n\"Now,\" I said, \"let's drop.\"\n\nI opened the trap and looked down, but quickly shut it again when I felt\nthe air rushing out of the ship into the rarefied atmosphere in a\ntorrent. Gibbons literally yelled a protest from his instrument board.\n\n\"I forgot,\" I mumbled. \"Silly of me. Of course, we'll have to drop out\nof compartment.\"\n\nThe compartment, to which I referred, was similar to those in some of\nthe 20th Century submarines. We all entered it. There was barely room\nfor us to stand, shoulder to shoulder. With some struggles, we got into\nour special air helmets and adjusted the pressure. At our signal,\nGibbons exhausted the air in the compartment, pumping it into the body\nof the ship, and as the little signal light flashed, Wilma threw open\nthe hatch.\n\nSetting the ultron-wire reel, I climbed through, and began to slide down\ngently.\n\nWe all had our belts on, of course, adjusted to a weight balance of but\na few ounces. And the five-mile reel of ultron wire that was to be our\nguide, was of gossamer fineness, though, anyway, I believe it would have\nlifted the full weight of the five of us, so strong and tough was this\ninvisible metal. As an extra precaution, since the wire was of the\npurest metal, and therefore totally invisible, even in daylight, we all\nhad our belts hooked on small rings that slid down the wire.\n\nI went down with the end of the wire. Wilma followed a few feet above\nme, then Barker, Gaunt and Blash. Gibbons, of course, stayed behind to\nhold the ship in position and control the paying out of the line. We all\nhad our ultrophones in place inside our air helmets, and so could\nconverse with one another and with Gibbons. But at Wilma's suggestion,\nalthough we would have liked to let the Big Boss listen in, we kept them\nadjusted to short-range work, for fear that those who had been clearing\nwith the Hans, and against whom we were on a raid for evidence, might\nalso pick up our conversation. We had no fear that the Hans would hear\nus. In fact, we had the added advantage that, even after we landed, we\ncould converse freely without danger of their hearing our voices through\nour air helmets.\n\nFor a while I could see nothing below but utter darkness. Then I\nrealized, from the feel of the air as much as from anything, that we\nwere sinking through a cloud layer. We passed through two more cloud\nlayers before anything was visible to us.\n\nThen there came under my gaze, about two miles below, one of the most\nbeautiful sights I have ever seen; the soft, yet brilliant, radiance of\nthe great Han city of Nu-yok. Every foot of its structural members\nseemed to glow with a wonderful incandescence, tower piled up on tower,\nand all built on the vast base-mass of the city, which, so I had been\ntold, sheered upward from the surface of the rivers to a height of 728\nlevels.\n\nThe city, I noticed with some surprise, did not cover anything like the\nsame area as the New York of the 20th Century. It occupied, as a matter\nof fact, only the lower half of Manhattan Island, with one section\nstraddling the East River, and spreading out sufficiently over what once\nhad been Brooklyn, to provide berths for the great liners and other air\ncraft.\n\nStraight beneath my feet was a tiny dark patch. It seemed the only spot\nin the entire city that was not aflame with radiance. This was the\ncentral tower, in the top floors of which were housed the vast library\nof record files and the main projectoscope plant.\n\n\"You can shoot the wire now,\" I ultrophoned Gibbons, and let go the\nlittle weighted knob. It dropped like a plummet, and we followed with\nconsiderable speed, but braking our descent with gloved hands\nsufficiently to see whether the knob, on which a faint light glowed as a\nsignal for ourselves, might be observed by any Han guard or night\nprowler. Apparently it was not, and we again shot down with accelerated\nspeed.\n\nWe landed on the roof of the tower without any mishap, and fortunately\nfor our plan, in darkness. Since there was nothing above it on which it\nwould have been worth while to shed illumination, or from which there\nwas any need to observe it, the Hans had neglected to light the tower\nroof, or indeed to occupy it at all. This was the reason we had selected\nit as our landing place.\n\nAs soon as Gibbons had our word, he extinguished the knob light, and the\nknob, as well as the wire, became totally invisible. At our ultrophoned\nword, he would light it again.\n\n\"No gun play now,\" I warned. \"Swords only, and then only if absolutely\nnecessary.\"\n\nClosely bunched, and treading as lightly as only inertron-belted people\ncould, we made our way cautiously through a door and down an inclined\nplane to the floor below, where Gaunt and Blash assured us the military\noffices were located.\n\nTwice Barker cautioned us to stop as we were about to pass in front of\nmirror-like \"windows\" in the passage wall, and flattening ourselves to\nthe floor, we crawled past them.\n\n\"Projectoscopes,\" he said. \"Probably on automatic record only, at this\ntime of night. Still, we don't want to leave any records for them to\nstudy after we're gone.\"\n\n\"Were you ever here before?\" I asked.\n\n\"No,\" he replied, \"but I haven't been studying their electrophone\ncommunications for seven years without being able to recognize these\nmachines when I run across them.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nThe Fight in the Tower\n\n\nSo far we had not laid eyes on a Han. The tower seemed deserted. Blash\nand Gaunt, however, assured me that there would be at least one man on\n\"duty\" in the military offices, though he would probably be asleep, and\ntwo or three in the library proper and the projectoscope plant.\n\n\"We've got to put them out of commission,\" I said. \"Did you bring the\n'dope' cans, Wilma?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she said, \"two for each. Here,\" and she distributed them.\n\nWe were now two levels below the roof, and at the point where we were to\nseparate.\n\nI did not want to let Wilma out of my sight, but it was necessary.\n\nAccording to our plan, Barker was to make his way to the projectoscope\nplant, Blash and I to the library, and Wilma and Gaunt to the military\noffice.\n\nBlash and I traversed a long corridor, and paused at the great arched\ndoorway of the library. Cautiously we peered in. Seated at three great\nswitchboards were library operatives. Occasionally one of them would\nreach lazily for a lever, or sleepily push a button, as little numbered\nlights winked on and off. They were answering calls for electrograph and\nviewplate records on all sorts of subjects from all sections of the\ncity.\n\nI apprised my companions of the situation.\n\n\"Better wait a bit,\" Blash added. \"The calls will lessen shortly.\"\n\nWilma reported an officer in the military office sound asleep.\n\n\"Give him the can, then,\" I said.\n\nBarker was to do nothing more than keep watch in the projectoscope\nplant, and a few moments later he reported himself well concealed, with\na splendid view of the floor.\n\n\"I think we can take a chance now,\" Blash said to me, and at my nod, he\nopened the lid of his dope can. Of course, the fumes did not affect us,\nthrough our helmets. They were absolutely without odor or visibility,\nand in a few seconds the librarians were unconscious. We stepped into\nthe room.\n\nThere ensued considerable cautious observation and experiment on the\npart of Gaunt, working from the military office, and Blash in the\nlibrary; while Wilma and I, with drawn swords and sharply attuned\nmicrophones, stood guard, and occasionally patrolled nearby corridors.\n\n\"I hear something approaching,\" Wilma said after a bit, with excitement\nin her voice. \"It's a soft, gliding sound.\"\n\n\"That's an elevator somewhere,\" Barker cut in from the projectoscope\nfloor. \"Can you locate it? I can't hear it.\"\n\n\"It's to the east of me,\" she replied.\n\n\"And to my west,\" said I, faintly catching it. \"It's between us, Wilma,\nand nearer you than me. Be careful. Have you got any information yet,\nBlash and Gaunt?\"\n\n\"Getting it now,\" one of them replied. \"Give us two minutes more.\"\n\n\"Keep at it then,\" I said. \"We'll guard.\"\n\nThe soft, gliding sound ceased.\n\n\"I think it's very close to me,\" Wilma almost whispered. \"Come closer,\nTony. I have a feeling something is going to happen. I've never known my\nnerves to get taut like this without reason.\"\n\nIn some alarm, I launched myself down the corridor in a great leap\ntoward the intersection whence I knew I could see her.\n\nIn the middle of my leap my ultrophone registered her gasp of alarm. The\nnext instant I glided to a stop at the intersection to see Wilma backing\ntoward the door of the military office, her sword red with blood, and an\ninert form on the corridor floor. Two other Hans were circling to either\nside of her with wicked-looking knives, while a third evidently a high\nofficer, judging by the resplendence of his garb tugged desperately to\nget an electrophone instrument out of a bulky pocket. If he ever gave\nthe alarm, there was no telling what might happen to us.\n\nI was at least seventy feet away, but I crouched low and sprang with\nevery bit of strength in my legs. It would be more correct to say that I\ndived, for I reached the fellow head on, with no attempt to draw my legs\nbeneath me.\n\nSome instinct must have warned him, for he turned suddenly as I hurtled\nclose to him. But by this time I had sunk close to the floor, and had\nstiffened myself rigidly, lest a dragging knee or foot might just\nprevent my reaching him. I brought my blade upward and over. It was a\nvicious slash that laid him open, bisecting him from groin to chin, and\nhis dead body toppled down on me, as I slid to a tangled stop.\n\nThe other two startled, turned. Wilma leaped at one and struck him down\nwith a side slash. I looked up at this instant, and the dazed fear on\nhis face at the length of her leap registered vividly. The Hans knew\nnothing of our inertron belts, it seemed, and these leaps and dives of\nours filled them with terror.\n\nAs I rose to my feet, a gory mess, Wilma, with a poise and speed which I\nfound time to admire even in this crisis, again leaped. This time she\ndove head first as I had done and, with a beautifully executed thrust,\nran the last Han through the throat.\n\nUncertainly, she scrambled to her feet, staggered queerly, and then sank\ngently prone on the corridor. She had fainted.\n\nAt this juncture, Blash and Gaunt reported with elation that they had\nthe record we wanted.\n\n\"Back to the roof, everybody!\" I ordered, as I picked Wilma up in my\narms. With her inertron belt, she felt as light as a feather.\n\nGaunt joined me at once from the military office, and at the\nintersection of the corridor, we came upon Blash waiting for us. Barker,\nhowever, was not in evidence.\n\n\"Where are you, Barker?\" I called.\n\n\"Go ahead,\" he replied. \"I'll be with you on the roof at once.\"\n\nWe came out in the open without any further mishap, and I instructed\nGibbons in the ship to light the knob on the end of the ultron wire. It\nflashed dully a few feet away from us. Just how he had maneuvered the\nship to keep our end of the line in position, without its swinging in a\ntremendous arc, I have never been able to understand. Had not the night\nbeen an unusually still one, he could not have checked the initial\npendulum-like movements. As it was, there was considerable air current\nat certain of the levels, and in different directions too. But Gibbons\nwas an expert of rare ability and sensitivity in the handling of a\nrocket ship, and he managed, with the aid of his delicate instruments,\nto sense the drifts almost before they affected the fine ultron wire,\nand to neutralize them with little shifts in the position of the ship.\n\nBlash and Gaunt fastened their rings to the wire, and I hooked my own\nand Wilma's on, too. But on looking around, I found Barker was still\nmissing.\n\n\"Barker, come!\" I called. \"We're waiting.\"\n\n\"Coming!\" he replied, and indeed, at that instant, his figure appeared\nup the ramp. He chuckled as he fastened his ring to the wire, and said\nsomething about a little surprise he had left for the Hans.\n\n\"Don't reel in the wire more than a few hundred feet,\" I instructed\nGibbons. \"It will take too long to wind it in. We'll float up, and when\nwe're aboard, we can drop it.\"\n\nIn order to float up, we had to dispense with a pound or two of weight\napiece. We hurled our swords from us, and kicked off our shoes as\nGibbons reeled up the line a bit, and then letting go of the wire, began\nto hum upward on our rings with increasing velocity.\n\nThe rush of air brought Wilma to, and I hastily explained to her that we\nhad been successful. Receding far below us now, I could see our dully\nshining knob swinging to and fro in an ever widening arc, as it crossed\nand recrossed the black square of the tower roof. As an extra\nprecaution, I ordered Gibbons to shut off the light, and to show one\nfrom the belly of the ship, for so great was our speed now, that I began\nto fear we would have difficulty in checking ourselves. We were\nliterally falling upward, and with terrific acceleration.\n\nFortunately, we had several minutes in which to solve this difficulty,\nwhich none of us, strangely enough, had foreseen. It was Gibbons who\nfound the answer.\n\n\"You'll be all right if all of you grab the wire tight when I give the\nword,\" he said. \"First I'll start reeling it in at full speed. You won't\nget much of a jar, and then I'll decrease its speed again gradually, and\nits weight will hold you back. Are you ready? One--two--three!\"\n\nWe all grabbed tightly with our gloved hands as he gave the word. We\nmust have been rising a good bit faster than he figured, however, for it\nwrenched our arms considerably, and the maneuver set up a sickening\npendulum motion.\n\nFor a while all we could do was swing there in an arc that may have been\na quarter of a mile across, about three and a half miles above the city,\nand still more than a mile from our ship.\n\nGibbons skilfully took up the slack as our momentum pulled up the line.\nThen at last we had ourselves under control again, and continued our\nupward journey, checking our speed somewhat with our gloves.\n\nThere was not one of us who did not breathe a big sigh of relief when we\nscrambled through the hatch safely into the ship again, cast off the\nultron line and slammed the trap shut.\n\nLittle realizing that we had a still more terrible experience to go\nthrough, we discussed the information Blash and Gaunt had between them\nextracted from the Han records, and the advisability of ultrophoning\nHart at once.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nThe Walls of Hell\n\n\nThe traitors were, it seemed, a degenerate gang of Americans, located a\nfew miles north of Nu-yok on the wooded banks of the Hudson, the\nSinsings. They had exchanged scraps of information to the Hans in return\nfor several old repellor-ray machines, and the privilege of tuning in on\nthe Han electronic power broadcast for their operation, provided their\nships agreed to subject themselves to the orders of the Han traffic\noffice, while aloft.\n\nThe rest wanted to ultrophone their news at once, since there was always\ndanger that we might never get back to the gang with it.\n\nI objected, however. The Sinsings would be likely to pick up our\nmessage. Even if we used the directional projector, they might have\nscouts out to the west and south in the big inter-gang stretches of\ncountry. They would flee to Nu-yok and escape the punishment they\nmerited. It seemed to be vitally important that they should not, for the\nsake of example to other weak groups among the American gangs, as well\nas to prevent a crisis in which they might clear more vital information\nto the enemy.\n\n\"Out to sea again,\" I ordered Gibbons. \"They'll be less likely to look\nfor us in that direction.\"\n\n\"Easy, Boss, easy,\" he replied. \"Wait until we get up a mile or two\nmore. They must have discovered evidences of our raid by now, and their\ndis-ray wall may go in operation any moment.\"\n\nEven as he spoke, the ship lurched downward and to one side.\n\n\"There it is!\" he shouted. \"Hang on, everybody. We're going to nose\nstraight up!\" And he flipped the rocket-motor control wide open.\n\nLooking through one of the rear ports, I could see a nebulous, luminous\nring, and on all sides the atmosphere took on a faint iridescence.\n\nWe were almost over the destructive range of the disintegrator-ray wall,\na hollow cylinder of annihilation shooting upward from a solid ring of\ngenerators surrounding the city. It was the main defense system of the\nHans, which had never been used except in periodic tests. They may or\nmay not have suspected that an American rocket ship was within the\ncylinder; probably they had turned on their generators more as a\nprecaution to prevent any reaching a position above the city.\n\nBut even at our present great height, we were in great danger. It was a\nquestion how much we might have been harmed by the rays themselves, for\ntheir effective range was not much more than seven or eight miles. The\ngreater danger lay in the terrific downward rush of air within the\ncylinder to replace that which was being burned into nothingness by the\ncontinual play of the disintegrators. The air fell into the cylinder\nwith the force of a gale. It would be rushing toward the wall from the\noutside with terrific force also, but, naturally, the effect was\nintensified on the interior.\n\nOur ship vibrated and trembled. We had only one chance of escape--to\nfight our way well above the current. To drift down with it meant\nultimately, and inevitably, to be sucked into the destruction wall at\nsome lower level.\n\nBut very gradually and jerkily our upward movement, as shown on the\nindicators, began to increase, and after an hour of desperate struggle\nwe were free of the maelstrom and into the rarefied upper levels. The\nterror beneath us was now invisible through several layers of cloud\nformations.\n\nGibbons brought the ship back to an even keel, and drove her eastward\ninto one of the most brilliantly gorgeous sunrises I have ever seen.\n\nWe described a great circle to the south and west, in a long easy dive,\nfor he had cut out his rocket motors to save them as much as possible.\nWe had drawn terrifically on their fuel reserves in our battle with the\nelements. For the moment, the atmosphere below cleared, and we could see\nthe Jersey coast far beneath, like a great map.\n\n\"We're not through yet,\" remarked Gibbons suddenly, pointing at his\nperiscope, and adjusting it to telescopic focus. \"A Han ship, and a\n'drop ship' at that--and he's seen us. If he whips that beam of his on\nus, we're done.\"\n\nI gazed, fascinated, at the viewplate. What I saw was a cigar-shaped\nship not dissimilar to our own in design, and from the proportional size\nof its ports, of about the same size as our swoopers. We learned later\nthat they carried crews, for the most part of not more than three or\nfour men. They had streamline hulls and tails that embodied\nuniversal-jointed double fish-tail rudders. In operation they rose to\ngreat heights on their powerful repellor rays, then gathered speed\neither by a straight nose dive, or an inclined dive in which they\nsometimes used the repellor ray slanted at a sharp angle. He was already\nabove us, though several miles to the north. He could, of course, try to\nget on our tail and \"spear\" us with his beam as he dropped at us from a\ngreat height.\n\nSuddenly his beam blazed forth in a blinding flash, whipping downward\nslowly to our right. He went through a peculiar corkscrew-like\nevolution, evidently maneuvering to bring his beam to bear on us with a\nspiral motion.\n\nGibbons instantly sent our ship into a series of evolutions that must\nhave looked like those of a frightened hen. Alternately, he used the\nforward and the reverse rocket blasts, and in varying degree. We\nfluttered, we shot suddenly to right and left, and dropped like a\nplummet in uncertain movements. But all the time the Han scout dropped\ntoward us, determinedly whipping the air around us with his beam. Once\nit sliced across beneath us, not more than a hundred feet, and we\ndropped with a jar into the pocket formed by the destruction of the air.\n\nHe had dropped to within a mile of us, and was coming with the speed of\na projectile, when the end came. Gibbons always swore it was sheer luck.\nMaybe it was, but I like pilots who are lucky that way.\n\nIn the midst of a dizzy, fluttering maneuver of our own, with the Han\nship enlarging to our gaze with terrifying rapidity, and its beam slowly\nslicing toward us in what looked like certain destruction within the\nsecond, I saw Gibbons' fingers flick at the lever of his rocket gun and\na split second later the Han ship flew apart like a clay pigeon.\n\nWe staggered, and fluttered crazily for several moments while Gibbons\nstruggled to bring our ship into balance, and a section of about four\nsquare feet in the side of the ship near the stern slowly crumbled like\nrusted metal. His beam actually had touched us, but our explosive rocket\nhad got him a thousandth of a second sooner.\n\nPart of our rudder had been annihilated, and our motor damaged. But we\nwere able to swoop gently back across Jersey, fortunately crossing the\nship lanes without sighting any more Han craft, and finally settling to\nrest in the little glade beneath the trees, near Hart's camp.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nThe New Boss\n\n\nWe had ultrophoned our arrival and the Big Boss himself, surrounded by\nthe Council, was on hand to welcome us and learn our news. In turn we\nwere informed that during the night a band of raiding Bad Bloods,\ndisguised under the insignia of the Altoonas, a gang some distance to\nthe west of us, had destroyed several of our camps before our people had\nrallied and driven them off. Their purpose, evidently, had been to\nembroil us with the Altoonas, but fortunately, one of our exchanges\nrecognized the Bad Blood leader, who had been slain.\n\nThe Big Boss had mobilized the full raiding force of the Gang, and was\non the point of heading an expedition for the extermination of the Bad\nBloods.\n\nI looked around the grim circle of the sub-bosses, and realized the fate\nof America, at this moment, lay in their hands. Their temper demanded\nthe immediate expenditure of our full effort in revenging ourselves for\nthis raid. But the strategic exigencies, to my mind, quite clearly\ndemanded the instant and absolute extermination of the Sinsings. It\nmight be only a matter of hours, for all we knew, before these degraded\npeople would barter clues to the American ultronic secrets to the Hans.\n\n\"How large a force have we?\" I asked Hart.\n\n\"Every man and maid who can be spared,\" he replied. \"That gives us seven\nhundred married and unmarried men, and three hundred girls, more than\nthe entire Bad Blood Gang. Every one is equipped with belts,\nultrophones, rocket guns and swords, and all fighting mad.\"\n\nI meditated how I might put the matter to these determined men, and was\nvaguely conscious that they were awaiting my words.\n\nFinally I began to speak. I do not remember to this day just what I\nsaid. I talked calmly, with due regard for their passion, but with deep\nconviction. I went over the information we had collected, point by\npoint, building my case logically, and painting a lurid picture of the\ndanger impending in that half-alliance between the Sinsings and the Hans\nof Nu-yok. I became impassioned, culminating, I believe, with a vow to\nproceed single-handed against the hereditary enemies of our race, \"if\nthe Wyomings were blindly set on placing a gang feud ahead of honor and\nduty and the hopes of all America.\"\n\nAs I concluded, a great calm came over me, as of one detached. I had\nfelt much the same way during several crises in the First World War. I\ngazed from face to face, striving to read their expressions, and in a\nmood to make good my threat without any further heroics, if the decision\nwas against me.\n\nBut it was Hart who sensed the temper of the Council more quickly than I\ndid, and looked beyond it into the future.\n\nHe arose from the tree trunk on which he had been sitting.\n\n\"That settles it,\" he said, looking around the ring. \"I have felt this\nthing coming on for some time now. I'm sure the Council agrees with me\nthat there is among us a man more capable than I, to boss the Wyoming\nGang, despite his handicap of having had all too short a time in which\nto familiarize himself with our modern ways and facilities. Whatever I\ncan do to support his effective leadership, at any cost, I pledge myself\nto do.\"\n\nAs he concluded, he advanced to where I stood, and taking from his head\nthe green-crested helmet that constituted his badge of office, to my\nsurprise he placed it in my mechanically extended hand.\n\nThe roar of approval that went up from the Council members left me\ndazed. Somebody ultrophoned the news to the rest of the Gang, and even\nthough the earflaps of my helmet were turned up, I could hear the cheers\nwith which my invisible followers greeted me, from near and distant\nhillsides, camps and plants.\n\nMy first move was to make sure that the Phone Boss, in communicating\nthis news to the members of the Gang, had not re-broadcast my talk nor\nmentioned my plan of shifting the attack from the Bad Bloods to the\nSinsings. I was relieved by his assurance that he had not, for it would\nhave wrecked the whole plan. Everything depended upon our ability to\nsurprise the Sinsings.\n\nSo I pledged the Council and my companions to secrecy, and allowed it to\nbe believed that we were about to take to the air and the trees against\nthe Bad Bloods.\n\nThat outfit must have been badly scared, the way they were \"burning\" the\nether with ultrophone alibis and propaganda for the benefit of the more\ndistant gangs. It was their old game, and the only method by which they\nhad avoided extermination long ago from their immediate neighbors--these\nappeals to the spirit of American brotherhood, addressed to gangs too\nfar away to have had the sort of experience with them that had fallen to\nour lot.\n\nI chuckled. Here was another good reason for the shift in my plans. Were\nwe actually to undertake the exterminations of the Bad Bloods at once,\nit would have been a hard job to convince some of the gangs that we had\nnot been precipitate and unjustified. Jealousies and prejudices existed.\nThere were gangs which would give the benefit of the doubt to the Bad\nBloods, rather than to ourselves, and the issue was now hopelessly\nbeclouded with the clever lies that were being broadcast in an unceasing\nstream.\n\nBut the extermination of the Sinsings would be another thing. In the\nfirst place, there would be no warning of our action until it was all\nover, I hoped. In the second place, we would have indisputable proof, in\nthe form of their rep-ray ships and other paraphernalia, of their\ntraffic with the Hans; and the state of American prejudice, at the time\nof which I write held trafficking with the Hans a far more heinous thing\nthan even a vicious gang feud.\n\nI called an executive session of the Council at once. I wanted to\ninventory our military resources.\n\nI created a new office on the spot, that of \"Control Boss,\" and\nappointed Ned Garlin to the post, turning over his former responsibility\nas Plants Boss to his assistant. I needed someone, I felt, to tie in the\nrecords of the various functional activities of the campaign, and take\nover from me the task of keeping the records of them up to the minute.\n\nI received reports from the bosses of the ultrophone unit, and those of\nfood, transportation, fighting gear, chemistry, electronic activity and\nelectrophone intelligence, ultroscopes, air patrol and contact guard.\n\nMy ideas for the campaign, of course, were somewhat tinged with my 20th\nCentury experience, and I found myself faced with the task of working\nout a staff organization that was a composite of the best and most\neasily applied principles of business and military efficiency, as I knew\nthem from the viewpoint of immediate practicality.\n\nWhat I wanted was an organization that would be specialized,\nfunctionally, not as that indicated above, but from the angles of:\nintelligence as to the Sinsings' activities; intelligence as to Han\nactivities; perfection of communication with my own units; co-operation\nof field command; and perfect mobilization of emergency supplies and\nresources.\n\nIt took several hours of hard work with the Council to map out the plan.\nFirst we assigned functional experts and equipment to each \"Division\" in\naccordance with its needs. Then these in turn were reassigned by the new\nDivision Bosses to the Field Commands as needed, or as Independent or\nHeadquarters Units. The two intelligence divisions were named the White\nand the Yellow, indicating that one specialized on the American enemy\nand the other on the Mongolians.\n\nThe division in charge of our own communications, the assignment of\nultrophone frequencies and strengths, and the maintenance of operators\nand equipment, I called \"Communications.\"\n\nI named Bill Hearn to the post of Field Boss, in charge of the main or\nundetached fighting units, and to the Resources Division, I assigned all\nresponsibility for what few aircraft we had; and all transportation and\nsupply problems, I assigned to \"Resources.\" The functional bosses stayed\nwith this division.\n\nWe finally completed our organization with the assignment of liaison\nrepresentatives among the various divisions as needed.\n\nThus I had a \"Headquarters Staff\" composed of the Division Bosses who\nreported directly to Ned Garlin as Control Boss, or to Wilma as my\npersonal assistant. And each of the Division Bosses had a small staff of\nhis own.\n\nIn the final summing up of our personnel and resources, I found we had\nroughly a thousand \"troops,\" of whom some three hundred and fifty were,\nin what I called the Service Divisions, the rest being in Bill Hearn's\nField Division. This latter number, however, was cut down somewhat by\nthe assignment of numerous small units to detached service. Altogether,\nthe actual available fighting force, I figured, would number about five\nhundred, by the time we actually went into action.\n\nWe had only six small swoopers, but I had an ingenious plan in my mind,\nas the result of our little raid on Nu-yok, that would make this\nsufficient, since the reserves of inertron blocks were larger than I\nexpected to find them. The Resources Division, by packing its supply\ncases a bit tight, or by slipping in extra blocks of inertron, was able\nto reduce each to a weight of a few ounces. These easily could be\nfloated and towed by the swoopers in any quantity. Hitched to ultron\nlines, it would be a virtual impossibility for them to break loose.\n\nThe entire personnel, of course, was supplied with jumpers, and if each\nman and girl was careful to adjust balances properly, the entire number\ncould also be towed along through the air, grasping wires of ultron,\nswinging below the swoopers, or stringing out behind them.\n\nThere would be nothing tiring about this, because the strain would be no\ngreater than that of carrying a one or two pound weight in the hand,\nexcept for air friction at high speeds. But to make doubly sure that we\nshould lose none of our personnel, I gave strict orders that the belts\nand tow lines should be equipped with rings and hooks.\n\nSo great was the efficiency of the fundamental organization and\ndiscipline of the Gang, that we got under way at nightfall.\n\nOne by one the swoopers eased into the air, each followed by its long\ntrain or \"kite-tail\" of humanity and supply cases hanging lightly from\nits tow line. For convenience, the tow lines were made of an alloy of\nultron which, unlike the metal itself, is visible.\n\nAt first these \"tails\" hung downward, but as the ships swung into\nformation and headed eastward toward the Bad Blood territory, gathering\nspeed, they began to string out behind. And swinging low from each ship\non heavily weighted lines, ultroscope, ultrophone, and straight-vision\nobservers keenly scanned the countryside, while intelligence men in the\nswoopers above bent over their instrument boards and viewplates.\n\nLeaving Control Boss Ned Garlin temporarily in charge of affairs, Wilma\nand I dropped a weighted line from our ship, and slid down about half\nway to the under lookouts, that is to say, about a thousand feet. The\nsensation of floating swiftly through the air like this, in the absolute\nsecurity of one's confidence in the inertron belt, was one of\nnever-ending delight to me.\n\nWe reascended into the swooper as the expedition approached the\nterritory of the Bad Bloods, and directed the preparations for the\nbombardment. It was part of my plan to appear to carry out the attack as\noriginally planned.\n\nAbout fifteen miles from their camps our ships came to a halt and\nmaintained their positions for a while with the idling blasts of their\nrocket motors, to give the ultroscope operators a chance to make a\nthorough examination of the territory below us, for it was very\nimportant that this next step in our program should be carried out with\nall secrecy.\n\nAt length they reported the ground below us entirely clear of any\nappearance of human occupation, and a gun unit of long-range specialists\nwas lowered with a dozen rocket guns, equipped with special automatic\ndevices that the Resources Division had developed at my request, a few\nhours before our departure. These were aiming and timing devices. After\ncalculating the range, elevation and rocket charges carefully, the guns\nwere left, concealed in a ravine, and the men were hauled up into the\nship again. At the predetermined hour, those unmanned rocket guns would\nbegin automatically to bombard the Bad Bloods' hillsides, shifting their\naim and elevation slightly with each shot, as did many of our artillery\npieces in the First World War.\n\nIn the meantime, we turned south about twenty miles, and grounded,\nwaiting for the bombardment to begin before we attempted to sneak across\nthe Han ship lane. I was relying for security on the distraction that\nthe bombardment might furnish the Han observers.\n\nIt was tense work waiting, but the affair went through as planned, our\nsquadron drifting across the route high enough to enable the ships'\ntails of troops and supply cases to clear the ground.\n\nIn crossing the second ship route, out along the Beaches of Jersey, we\nwere not so successful in escaping observation. A Han ship came speeding\nalong at a very low elevation. We caught it on our electronic location\nand direction finders, and also located it with our ultroscopes, but it\ncame so fast and so low that I thought it best to remain where we had\ngrounded the second time, and lie quiet, rather than get under way and\ncross in front of it.\n\nThe point was this. While the Hans had no such devices as our\nultroscopes, with which we could see in the dark (within certain\nlimitations of course), and their electronic instruments would be\nvirtually useless in uncovering our presence, since all but natural\nelectronic activities were carefully eliminated from our apparatus,\nexcept electrophone receivers (which are not easily spotted), the Hans\ndid have some very highly sensitive sound devices which operated with\ngreat efficiency in calm weather, so far as sounds emanating from the\nair were concerned. But the \"ground roar\" greatly confused their use of\nthese instruments in the location of specific sounds floating up from\nthe surface of the earth.\n\nThis ship must have caught some slight noise of ours, however, in its\nsensitive instruments, for we heard its electronic devices go into play,\nand picked up the routine report of the noise to its Base Ship\nCommander. But from the nature of the conversation, I judged they had\nnot identified it, and were, in fact, more curious about the detonations\nthey were picking up now from the Bad Blood lands some sixty miles or so\nto the west.\n\nImmediately after this ship had shot by, we took the air again, and\nfollowing much the same route that I had taken the previous night,\nclimbed in a long semi-circle out over the ocean, swung toward the north\nand finally the west. We set our course, however, for the Sinsings' land\nnorth of Nu-yok, instead of for the city itself.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nThe Finger of Doom\n\n\nAs we crossed the Hudson River, a few miles north of the city, we\ndropped several units of the Yellow Intelligence Division, with full\ninstrumental equipment. Their apparatus cases were nicely balanced at\nonly a few ounces weight each, and the men used their chute capes to\nease their drops.\n\nWe recrossed the river a little distance above and began dropping White\nIntelligence units and a few long and short range gun units. Then we\nheld our position until we began to get reports. Gradually we ringed the\nterritory of the Sinsings, our observation units working busily and\npatiently at their locators and scopes, both aloft and aground, until\nGarlin finally turned to me with the remark:\n\n\"The map circle is complete now, Boss. We've got clear locations all the\nway around them.\"\n\n\"Let me see it,\" I replied, and studied the illuminated viewplate map,\nwith its little overlapping circles of light that indicated spots proved\nclear of the enemy by ultroscopic observation.\n\nI nodded to Bill Hearn. \"Go ahead now, Hearn,\" I said, \"and place your\nbarrage men.\"\n\nHe spoke into his ultrophone, and three of the ships began to glide in a\nwide ring around the enemy territory. Every few seconds, at the word\nfrom his Unit Boss, a gunner would drop off the wire, and slipping the\nclasp of his chute cape, drift down into the darkness below.\n\nBill formed two lines, parallel to and facing the river, and enclosing\nthe entire territory of the enemy between them. Above and below,\nstraddling the river, were two defensive lines. These latter were merely\nto hold their positions. The others were to close in toward each other,\npushing a high-explosive barrage five miles ahead of them. When the two\nbarrages met, both lines were to switch to short-vision-range barrage\nand continue to close in on any of the enemy who might have drifted\nthrough the previous curtain of fire.\n\nIn the meantime Bill kept his reserves, a picked corps of a hundred men\n(the same that had accompanied Hart and myself in our fight with the Han\nsquadron) in the air, divided about equally among the \"kite-tails\" of\nfour ships.\n\nA final roll call, by units, companies, divisions and functions,\nestablished the fact that all our forces were in position. No Han\nactivity was reported, and no Han broadcasts indicated any suspicion of\nour expedition. Nor was there any indication that the Sinsings had any\nknowledge of the fate in store for them. The idling of rep-ray\ngenerators was reported from the center of their camp, obviously those\nof the ships the Hans had given them--the price of their treason to\ntheir race.\n\nAgain I gave the word, and Hearn passed on the order to his\nsubordinates.\n\nFar below us, and several miles to the right and left, the two barrage\nlines made their appearance. From the great height to which we had\nrisen, they appeared like lines of brilliant, winking lights, and the\ndetonations were muffled by the distances into a sort of rumbling,\ndistant thunder. Hearn and his assistants were very busy: measuring,\ncalculating, and snapping out ultrophone orders to unit commanders that\nresulted in the straightening of lines and the closing of gaps in the\nbarrage.\n\nThe White Division Boss reported the utmost confusion in the Sinsing\norganization. They were, as might be expected, an inefficient, loosely\ndisciplined gang, and repeated broadcasts for help to neighboring gangs.\nIgnoring the fact that the Mongolians had not used explosives for many\ngenerations, they nevertheless jumped at the conclusion that they were\nbeing raided by the Hans. Their frantic broadcasts persisted in this\nthought, despite the nervous electrophonic inquiries of the Hans\nthemselves, to whom the sound of the battle was evidently audible, and\nwho were trying to locate the trouble.\n\nAt this point, the swooper I had sent south toward the city went into\naction as a diversion, to keep the Hans at home. Its \"kite-tail\" loaded\nwith long-range gunners, using the most highly explosive rockets we had,\nhung invisible in the darkness of the sky and bombarded the city from a\ndistance of about five miles. With an entire city to shoot at, and the\nobject of creating as much commotion therein as possible, regardless of\nactual damage, the gunners had no difficulty in hitting the mark. I\ncould see the glow of the city and the stabbing flashes of exploding\nrockets. In the end, the Hans, uncertain as to what was going on, fell\nback on a defensive policy, and shot their \"hell cylinder,\" or wall of\nupturned disintegrator rays into operation. That, of course, ended our\nbombardment of them. The rays were a perfect defense, disintegrating our\nrockets as they were reached.\n\nIf they had not sent out ships before turning on the rays, and if they\nhad none within sufficient radius already in the air, all would be well.\n\nI queried Garlin on this, but he assured me Yellow Intelligence reported\nno indications of Han ships nearer than 800 miles. This would probably\ngive us a free hand for a while, since most of their instruments\nrecorded only imperfectly or not at all, through the death wall.\n\nRequisitioning one of the viewplates of the headquarters ship, and the\nservices of an expert operator, I instructed him to focus on our lines\nbelow. I wanted a close-up of the men in action.\n\nHe began to manipulate his controls and chaotic shadows moved rapidly\nacross the plate, fading in and out of focus, until he reached an\nadjustment that gave me a picture of the forest floor, apparently 100\nfeet wide, with the intervening branches and foliage of the trees\nappearing like shadows that melted into reality a few feet above the\nground.\n\nI watched one man setting up his long-gun with skillful speed. His lips\npursed slightly as though he were whistling, as he adjusted the tall\ntripod on which the long tube was balanced. Swiftly he twirled the knobs\ncontrolling the aim and elevation of his piece. Then, lifting a belt of\nammunition from the big box, which itself looked heavy enough to break\ndown the spindly tripod, he inserted the end of it in the lock of his\ntube and touched the proper combination of buttons.\n\nThen he stepped aside, and occupied himself with peering carefully\nthrough the trees ahead. Not even a tremor shook the tube, but I knew\nthat at intervals of something less than a second, it was discharging\nsmall projectiles which, traveling under their own continuously reduced\npower, were arching into the air, to fall precisely five miles ahead and\nexplode with the force of eight-inch shells, such as we used in the\nFirst World War.\n\nAnother gunner, fifty feet to the right of him, waved a hand and called\nout something to him. Then, picking up his own tube and tripod, he\ngauged the distance between the trees ahead of him, and the height of\ntheir lowest branches, and bending forward a bit, flexed his muscles and\nleaped lightly, some twenty-five feet. Another leap took him another\ntwenty feet or so, where he began to set up his piece.\n\nI ordered my observer then to switch to the barrage itself. He got a\nclose focus on it, but this showed little except a continuous series of\nblinding flashes, which, from the viewplate, lit up the entire interior\nof the ship. An eight-hundred-foot focus proved better. I had thought\nthat some of our French and American artillery of the 20th Century had\nachieved the ultimate in mathematical precision of fire, but I had never\nseen anything to equal the accuracy of that line of terrific explosions\nas it moved steadily forward, mowing down trees as a scythe cuts grass\n(or used to 500 years ago), literally churning up the earth and the\nsplintered, blasted remains of the forest giants, to a depth of from ten\nto twenty feet.\n\nBy now the two curtains of fire were nearing each other, lines of\nvibrant, shimmering, continuous, brilliant destruction, inevitably\nsqueezing the panic-stricken Sinsings between them.\n\nEven as I watched, a group of them, who had been making a futile effort\nto get their three rep-ray machines into the air, abandoned their\nefforts, and rushed forth into the milling mob.\n\nI queried the Control Boss sharply on the futility of this attempt of\ntheirs, and learned that the Hans, apparently in doubt as to what was\ngoing on, had continued to \"play safe,\" and broken off their power\nbroadcast, after ordering all their own ships east of the Alleghenies to\nthe ground, for fear these ships they had traded to the Sinsings might\nbe used against them.\n\nAgain I turned to my viewplate, which was still focussed on the central\nsection of the Sinsing works. The confusion of the traitors was entirely\nthat of fear, for our barrage had not yet reached them.\n\nSome of them set up their long-guns and fired at random over the barrage\nline, then gave it up. They realized that they had no target to shoot\nat, no way of knowing whether our gunners were a few hundred feet or\nseveral miles beyond it.\n\nTheir ultrophone men, of whom they did not have many, stood around in\ntense attitudes, their helmet phones strapped around their ears,\nnervously fingering the tuning controls at their belts. Unquestionably\nthey must have located some of our frequencies, and overheard many of\nour reports and orders. But they were confused and disorganized. If they\nhad an Ultrophone Boss they evidently were not reporting to him in an\norganized way.\n\nThey were beginning to draw back now before our advancing fire. With\nintermittent desperation, they began to shoot over our barrage again,\nand the explosions of their rockets flashed at widely scattered points\nbeyond. A few took distance \"pot shots.\"\n\nOddly enough it was our own forces that suffered the first casualties in\nthe battle. Some of these distance shots by chance registered hits,\nwhile our men were under strict orders not to exceed their barrage\ndistances.\n\nSeen upon the ultroscope viewplate, the battle looked as though it were\nbeing fought in daylight, perhaps on a cloudy day, while the explosions\nof the rockets appeared as flashes of extra brilliance.\n\nThe two barrage lines were not more than five hundred feet apart when\nthe Sinsings resorted to tactics we had not foreseen. We noticed first\nthat they began to lighten themselves by throwing away extra equipment.\nA few of them in their excitement threw away too much, and shot suddenly\ninto the air. Then a scattering few floated up gently, followed by\nincreasing numbers, while still others, preserving a weight balance,\njumped toward the closing barrages and leaped high, hoping to clear\nthem. Some succeeded. We saw others blown about like leaves in a\nwindstorm, to crumple and drift slowly down, or else to fall into the\nbarrage, their belts blown from their bodies.\n\nHowever, it was not part of our plan to allow a single one of them to\nescape and find his way to the Hans. I quickly passed the word to Bill\nHearn to have the alternate men in his line raise their barrages and\nheard him bark out a mathematical formula to the Unit Bosses.\n\nWe backed off our ships as the explosions climbed into the air in\nstagger formation until they reached a height of three miles. I don't\nbelieve any of the Sinsings who tried to float away to freedom\nsucceeded.\n\nBut we did know later, that a few who leaped the barrage got away and\nultimately reached Nu-yok.\n\nIt was those who managed to jump the barrage who gave us the most\ntrouble. With half of our long-guns turned aloft, I foresaw we would not\nhave enough to establish successive ground barrages and so ordered the\nbarrage back two miles, from which positions our \"curtains\" began to\nclose in again, this time, however, gauged to explode, not on contact,\nbut thirty feet in the air. This left little chance for the Sinsings to\nleap either over or under it.\n\nGradually, the two barrages approached each other until they finally\nmet, and in the grey dawn the battle ended.\n\nOur own casualties amounted to forty-seven men in the ground forces,\neighteen of whom had been slain in hand to hand fighting with the few of\nthe enemy who managed to reach our lines, and sixty-two in the crew and\n\"kite-tail\" force of swooper No. 4, which had been located by one of\nthe enemy's ultroscopes and brought down with long-gun fire.\n\nSince nearly every member of the Sinsing Gang had, so far as we knew,\nbeen killed, we considered the raid a great success.\n\nIt had, however, a far greater significance than this. To all of us who\ntook part in the expedition, the effectiveness of our barrage tactics\ndefinitely established a confidence in our ability to overcome the Hans.\n\nAs I pointed out to Wilma:\n\n\"It has been my belief all along, dear, that the American explosive\nrocket is a far more efficient weapon than the disintegrator ray of the\nHans, once we can train all our gangs to use it systematically and in\nco-ordinated fashion. As a weapon in the hands of a single individual,\nshooting at a mark in direct line of vision, the rocket-gun is inferior\nin destructive power to the dis ray, except as its range may be a little\ngreater. The trouble is that to date it has been used only as we used\nour rifles and shot guns in the 20th Century. The possibilities of its\nuse as artillery, in laying barrages that advance along the ground, or\nclimb into the air, are tremendous.\n\n\"The dis ray inevitably reveals its source of emanation. The rocket gun\ndoes not. The dis ray can reach its target only in a straight line. The\nrocket may be made to travel in an arc, over intervening obstacles, to\nan unseen target.\n\n\"Nor must we forget that our ultronists now are promising us a perfect\nshield against the dis ray in inertron.\"\n\n\"I tremble though, Tony dear, when I think of the horrors that are ahead\nof us. The Hans are clever. They will develop defenses against our new\ntactics. And they are sure to mass against us not only the full force of\ntheir power in America, but the united forces of the World Empire. They\nare a cowardly race in one sense, but clever as the very Devils in Hell,\nand inheritors of a calm, ruthless, vicious persistency.\"\n\n\"Nevertheless,\" I prophesied, \"the Finger of Doom points squarely at\nthem today, and unless you and I are killed in the struggle, we shall\nlive to see America blast the Yellow Blight from the face of the Earth.\"\n\n\nTHE END.\n\n\n\n\nTranscriber's Note:\n\n    This etext was produced from _Amazing Stories_ August 1928.\n    Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\n    copyright on this publication was renewed.

It was as I feared: he was not there.  But everybody\nelse was.  Many writers whom I had quite forgotten, or remembered but\nfaintly, lived again for me, they and their work, in Mr. Holbrook\nJackson's pages.  The book was as thorough as it was brilliantly\nwritten.  And thus the omission found by me was an all the deadlier\nrecord of poor Soames's failure to impress himself on his decade.\n\nI dare say I am the only person who noticed the omission.  Soames had\nfailed so piteously as all that!  Nor is there a counterpoise in the\nthought that if he had had some measure of success he might have\npassed, like those others, out of my mind, to return only at the\nhistorian's beck.  It is true that had his gifts, such as they were,\nbeen acknowledged in his lifetime, he would never have made the bargain\nI saw him make--that strange bargain whose results have kept him always\nin the foreground of my memory.  But it is from those very results that\nthe full piteousness of him glares out.\n\nNot my compassion, however, impels me to write of him.  For his sake,\npoor fellow, I should be inclined to keep my pen out of the ink.  It is\nill to deride the dead.  And how can I write about Enoch Soames without\nmaking him ridiculous?  Or, rather, how am I to hush up the horrid fact\nthat he WAS ridiculous?  I shall not be able to do that.  Yet, sooner\nor later, write about him I must.  You will see in due course that I\nhave no option.  And I may as well get the thing done now.\n\nIn the summer term of '93 a bolt from the blue flashed down on Oxford.\nIt drove deep; it hurtlingly embedded itself in the soil.  Dons and\nundergraduates stood around, rather pale, discussing nothing but it.\nWhence came it, this meteorite?  From Paris.  Its name?  Will\nRothenstein. Its aim?  To do a series of twenty-four portraits in\nlithograph.  These were to be published from the Bodley Head, London.\nThe matter was urgent. Already the warden of A, and the master of B,\nand the Regius Professor of C had meekly \"sat.\"  Dignified and\ndoddering old men who had never consented to sit to any one could not\nwithstand this dynamic little stranger.  He did not sue; he invited: he\ndid not invite; he commanded.  He was twenty-one years old.  He wore\nspectacles that flashed more than any other pair ever seen.  He was a\nwit.  He was brimful of ideas.  He knew Whistler.  He knew Daudet and\nthe Goncourts.  He knew every one in Paris.  He knew them all by heart.\nHe was Paris in Oxford.  It was whispered that, so soon as he had\npolished off his selection of dons, he was going to include a few\nundergraduates.  It was a proud day for me when I--I was included.  I\nliked Rothenstein not less than I feared him; and there arose between\nus a friendship that has grown ever warmer, and been more and more\nvalued by me, with every passing year.\n\nAt the end of term he settled in, or, rather, meteoritically into,\nLondon.  It was to him I owed my first knowledge of that\nforever-enchanting little world-in-itself, Chelsea, and my first\nacquaintance with Walter Sickert and other August elders who dwelt\nthere.  It was Rothenstein that took me to see, in Cambridge Street,\nPimlico, a young man whose drawings were already famous among the\nfew--Aubrey Beardsley by name.  With Rothenstein I paid my first visit\nto the Bodley Head.  By him I was inducted into another haunt of\nintellect and daring, the domino-room of the Cafe Royal.\n\nThere, on that October evening--there, in that exuberant vista of\ngilding and crimson velvet set amidst all those opposing mirrors and\nupholding caryatids, with fumes of tobacco ever rising to the painted\nand pagan ceiling, and with the hum of presumably cynical conversation\nbroken into so sharply now and again by the clatter of dominoes\nshuffled on marble tables, I drew a deep breath and, \"This indeed,\"\nsaid I to myself, \"is life!\"  (Forgive me that theory.  Remember the\nwaging of even the South African War was not yet.)\n\nIt was the hour before dinner.  We drank vermuth.  Those who knew\nRothenstein were pointing him out to those who knew him only by name.\nMen were constantly coming in through the swing-doors and wandering\nslowly up and down in search of vacant tables or of tables occupied by\nfriends.  One of these rovers interested me because I was sure he\nwanted to catch Rothenstein's eye.  He had twice passed our table, with\na hesitating look; but Rothenstein, in the thick of a disquisition on\nPuvis de Chavannes, had not seen him.  He was a stooping, shambling\nperson, rather tall, very pale, with longish and brownish hair.  He had\na thin, vague beard, or, rather, he had a chin on which a large number\nof hairs weakly curled and clustered to cover its retreat.  He was an\nodd-looking person; but in the nineties odd apparitions were more\nfrequent, I think, than they are now.  The young writers of that\nera--and I was sure this man was a writer--strove earnestly to be\ndistinct in aspect.  This man had striven unsuccessfully.  He wore a\nsoft black hat of clerical kind, but of Bohemian intention, and a gray\nwaterproof cape which, perhaps because it was waterproof, failed to be\nromantic.  I decided that \"dim\" was the mot juste for him.  I had\nalready essayed to write, and was immensely keen on the mot juste, that\nHoly Grail of the period.\n\nThe dim man was now again approaching our table, and this time he made\nup his mind to pause in front of it.\n\n\"You don't remember me,\" he said in a toneless voice.\n\nRothenstein brightly focused him.\n\n\"Yes, I do,\" he replied after a moment, with pride rather than\neffusion--pride in a retentive memory.  \"Edwin Soames.\"\n\n\"Enoch Soames,\" said Enoch.\n\n\"Enoch Soames,\" repeated Rothenstein in a tone implying that it was\nenough to have hit on the surname.  \"We met in Paris a few times when\nyou were living there.  We met at the Cafe Groche.\"\n\n\"And I came to your studio once.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes; I was sorry I was out.\"\n\n\"But you were in.  You showed me some of your paintings, you know.  I\nhear you're in Chelsea now.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nI almost wondered that Mr. Soames did not, after this monosyllable,\npass along.  He stood patiently there, rather like a dumb animal,\nrather like a donkey looking over a gate.  A sad figure, his.  It\noccurred to me that \"hungry\" was perhaps the mot juste for him;\nbut--hungry for what?  He looked as if he had little appetite for\nanything.  I was sorry for him; and Rothenstein, though he had not\ninvited him to Chelsea, did ask him to sit down and have something to\ndrink.\n\nSeated, he was more self-assertive.  He flung back the wings of his\ncape with a gesture which, had not those wings been waterproof, might\nhave seemed to hurl defiance at things in general.  And he ordered an\nabsinthe.  \"Je me tiens toujours fidele,\" he told Rothenstein, \"a la\nsorciere glauque.\"\n\n\"It is bad for you,\" said Rothenstein, dryly.\n\n\"Nothing is bad for one,\" answered Soames.  \"Dans ce monde il n'y a ni\nbien ni mal.\"\n\n\"Nothing good and nothing bad?  How do you mean?\"\n\n\"I explained it all in the preface to 'Negations.'\"\n\n\"'Negations'?\"\n\n\"Yes, I gave you a copy of it.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, of course.  But, did you explain, for instance, that there\nwas no such thing as bad or good grammar?\"\n\n\"N-no,\" said Soames.  \"Of course in art there is the good and the evil.\nBut in life--no.\"  He was rolling a cigarette.  He had weak, white\nhands, not well washed, and with finger-tips much stained with\nnicotine.  \"In life there are illusions of good and evil, but\"--his\nvoice trailed away to a murmur in which the words \"vieux jeu\" and\n\"rococo\" were faintly audible.  I think he felt he was not doing\nhimself justice, and feared that Rothenstein was going to point out\nfallacies.  Anyhow, he cleared his throat and said, \"Parlons d'autre\nchose.\"\n\nIt occurs to you that he was a fool?  It didn't to me.  I was young,\nand had not the clarity of judgment that Rothenstein already had.\nSoames was quite five or six years older than either of us.  Also--he\nhad written a book.  It was wonderful to have written a book.\n\nIf Rothenstein had not been there, I should have revered Soames.  Even\nas it was, I respected him.  And I was very near indeed to reverence\nwhen he said he had another book coming out soon.  I asked if I might\nask what kind of book it was to be.\n\n\"My poems,\" he answered.  Rothenstein asked if this was to be the title\nof the book.  The poet meditated on this suggestion, but said he rather\nthought of giving the book no title at all.  \"If a book is good in\nitself--\" he murmured, and waved his cigarette.\n\nRothenstein objected that absence of title might be bad for the sale of\na book.\n\n\"If,\" he urged, \"I went into a bookseller's and said simply, 'Have you\ngot?' or, 'Have you a copy of?' how would they know what I wanted?\"\n\n\"Oh, of course I should have my name on the cover,\" Soames answered\nearnestly.  \"And I rather want,\" he added, looking hard at Rothenstein,\n\"to have a drawing of myself as frontispiece.\"  Rothenstein admitted\nthat this was a capital idea, and mentioned that he was going into the\ncountry and would be there for some time.  He then looked at his watch,\nexclaimed at the hour, paid the waiter, and went away with me to\ndinner.  Soames remained at his post of fidelity to the glaucous witch.\n\n\"Why were you so determined not to draw him?\" I asked.\n\n\"Draw him?  Him?  How can one draw a man who doesn't exist?\"\n\n\"He is dim,\" I admitted.  But my mot juste fell flat.  Rothenstein\nrepeated that Soames was non-existent.\n\nStill, Soames had written a book.  I asked if Rothenstein had read\n\"Negations.\"  He said he had looked into it, \"but,\" he added crisply,\n\"I don't profess to know anything about writing.\"  A reservation very\ncharacteristic of the period!  Painters would not then allow that any\none outside their own order had a right to any opinion about painting.\nThis law (graven on the tablets brought down by Whistler from the\nsummit of Fuji-yama) imposed certain limitations.  If other arts than\npainting were not utterly unintelligible to all but the men who\npracticed them, the law tottered--the Monroe Doctrine, as it were, did\nnot hold good.  Therefore no painter would offer an opinion of a book\nwithout warning you at any rate that his opinion was worthless.  No one\nis a better judge of literature than Rothenstein; but it wouldn't have\ndone to tell him so in those days, and I knew that I must form an\nunaided judgment of \"Negations.\"\n\nNot to buy a book of which I had met the author face to face would have\nbeen for me in those days an impossible act of self-denial.  When I\nreturned to Oxford for the Christmas term I had duly secured\n\"Negations.\"  I used to keep it lying carelessly on the table in my\nroom, and whenever a friend took it up and asked what it was about, I\nwould say: \"Oh, it's rather a remarkable book.  It's by a man whom I\nknow.\" Just \"what it was about\" I never was able to say.  Head or tail\nwas just what I hadn't made of that slim, green volume.  I found in the\npreface no clue to the labyrinth of contents, and in that labyrinth\nnothing to explain the preface.\n\n\n  Lean near to life.  Lean very near--\n  nearer.\n\n  Life is web and therein nor warp nor\n  woof is, but web only.\n\n  It is for this I am Catholick in church\n  and in thought, yet do let swift Mood weave\n  there what the shuttle of Mood wills.\n\n\nThese were the opening phrases of the preface, but those which followed\nwere less easy to understand.  Then came \"Stark: A Conte,\" about a\nmidinette who, so far as I could gather, murdered, or was about to\nmurder, a mannequin.  It was rather like a story by Catulle Mendes in\nwhich the translator had either skipped or cut out every alternate\nsentence.  Next, a dialogue between Pan and St. Ursula, lacking, I\nrather thought, in \"snap.\" Next, some aphorisms (entitled \"Aphorismata\"\n[spelled in Greek]).  Throughout, in fact, there was a great variety of\nform, and the forms had evidently been wrought with much care.  It was\nrather the substance that eluded me.  Was there, I wondered, any\nsubstance at all?  It did now occur to me: suppose Enoch Soames was a\nfool!  Up cropped a rival hypothesis: suppose _I_ was!  I inclined to\ngive Soames the benefit of the doubt.  I had read \"L'Apres-midi d'un\nfaune\" without extracting a glimmer of meaning; yet Mallarme, of\ncourse, was a master.  How was I to know that Soames wasn't another?\nThere was a sort of music in his prose, not indeed, arresting, but\nperhaps, I thought, haunting, and laden, perhaps, with meanings as deep\nas Mallarme's own.  I awaited his poems with an open mind.\n\nAnd I looked forward to them with positive impatience after I had had a\nsecond meeting with him.  This was on an evening in January.  Going\ninto the aforesaid domino-room, I had passed a table at which sat a\npale man with an open book before him.  He had looked from his book to\nme, and I looked back over my shoulder with a vague sense that I ought\nto have recognized him.  I returned to pay my respects.  After\nexchanging a few words, I said with a glance to the open book, \"I see I\nam interrupting you,\" and was about to pass on, but, \"I prefer,\" Soames\nreplied in his toneless voice, \"to be interrupted,\" and I obeyed his\ngesture that I should sit down.\n\nI asked him if he often read here.\n\n\"Yes; things of this kind I read here,\" he answered, indicating the\ntitle of his book--\"The Poems of Shelley.\"\n\n\"Anything that you really\"--and I was going to say \"admire?\"  But I\ncautiously left my sentence unfinished, and was glad that I had done\nso, for he said with unwonted emphasis, \"Anything second-rate.\"\n\nI had read little of Shelley, but, \"Of course,\" I murmured, \"he's very\nuneven.\"\n\n\"I should have thought evenness was just what was wrong with him.  A\ndeadly evenness.  That's why I read him here.  The noise of this place\nbreaks the rhythm.  He's tolerable here.\"  Soames took up the book and\nglanced through the pages.  He laughed.  Soames's laugh was a short,\nsingle, and mirthless sound from the throat, unaccompanied by any\nmovement of the face or brightening of the eyes.  \"What a period!\" he\nuttered, laying the book down.  And, \"What a country!\" he added.\n\nI asked rather nervously if he didn't think Keats had more or less held\nhis own against the drawbacks of time and place.  He admitted that\nthere were \"passages in Keats,\" but did not specify them.  Of \"the\nolder men,\" as he called them, he seemed to like only Milton.\n\"Milton,\" he said, \"wasn't sentimental.\"  Also, \"Milton had a dark\ninsight.\"  And again, \"I can always read Milton in the reading-room.\"\n\n\"The reading-room?\"\n\n\"Of the British Museum.  I go there every day.\"\n\n\"You do?  I've only been there once.  I'm afraid I found it rather a\ndepressing place.  It--it seemed to sap one's vitality.\"\n\n\"It does.  That's why I go there.  The lower one's vitality, the more\nsensitive one is to great art.  I live near the museum.  I have rooms\nin Dyott Street.\"\n\n\"And you go round to the reading-room to read Milton?\"\n\n\"Usually Milton.\"  He looked at me.  \"It was Milton,\" he\ncertificatively added, \"who converted me to diabolism.\"\n\n\"Diabolism?  Oh, yes?  Really?\" said I, with that vague discomfort and\nthat intense desire to be polite which one feels when a man speaks of\nhis own religion.  \"You--worship the devil?\"\n\nSoames shook his head.\n\n\"It's not exactly worship,\" he qualified, sipping his absinthe.  \"It's\nmore a matter of trusting and encouraging.\"\n\n\"I see, yes.  I had rather gathered from the preface to 'Negations'\nthat you were a--a Catholic.\"\n\n\"Je l'etais a cette epoque.  In fact, I still am.  I am a Catholic\ndiabolist.\"\n\nBut this profession he made in an almost cursory tone.  I could see\nthat what was upmost in his mind was the fact that I had read\n\"Negations.\"  His pale eyes had for the first time gleamed.  I felt as\none who is about to be examined viva voce on the very subject in which\nhe is shakiest.  I hastily asked him how soon his poems were to be\npublished.\n\n\"Next week,\" he told me.\n\n\"And are they to be published without a title?\"\n\n\"No.  I found a title at last.  But I sha'n't tell you what it is,\" as\nthough I had been so impertinent as to inquire.  \"I am not sure that it\nwholly satisfies me.  But it is the best I can find.  It suggests\nsomething of the quality of the poems--strange growths, natural and\nwild, yet exquisite,\" he added, \"and many-hued, and full of poisons.\"\n\nI asked him what he thought of Baudelaire.  He uttered the snort that\nwas his laugh, and, \"Baudelaire,\" he said, \"was a bourgeois malgre\nlui.\"  France had had only one poet--Villon; \"and two thirds of Villon\nwere sheer journalism.\"  Verlaine was \"an epicier malgre lui.\"\nAltogether, rather to my surprise, he rated French literature lower\nthan English.  There were \"passages\" in Villiers de l'Isle-Adam.  But,\n\"I,\" he summed up, \"owe nothing to France.\"  He nodded at me.  \"You'll\nsee,\" he predicted.\n\nI did not, when the time came, quite see that.  I thought the author of\n\"Fungoids\" did, unconsciously of course, owe something to the young\nParisian decadents or to the young English ones who owed something to\nTHEM.  I still think so.  The little book, bought by me in Oxford, lies\nbefore me as I write.  Its pale-gray buckram cover and silver lettering\nhave not worn well.  Nor have its contents.  Through these, with a\nmelancholy interest, I have again been looking.  They are not much.\nBut at the time of their publication I had a vague suspicion that they\nMIGHT be.  I suppose it is my capacity for faith, not poor Soames's\nwork, that is weaker than it once was.\n\n\n  TO A YOUNG WOMAN\n\n  THOU ART, WHO HAST NOT BEEN!\n\n  Pale tunes irresolute\n\n  And traceries of old sounds\n\n  Blown from a rotted flute\n  Mingle with noise of cymbals rouged with rust,\n  Nor not strange forms and epicene\n\n  Lie bleeding in the dust,\n\n  Being wounded with wounds.\n\n  For this it is\n  That in thy counterpart\n\n  Of age-long mockeries\n  THOU HAST NOT BEEN NOR ART!\n\n\nThere seemed to me a certain inconsistency as between the first and\nlast lines of this.  I tried, with bent brows, to resolve the discord.\nBut I did not take my failure as wholly incompatible with a meaning in\nSoames's mind.  Might it not rather indicate the depth of his meaning?\nAs for the craftsmanship, \"rouged with rust\" seemed to me a fine\nstroke, and \"nor not\" instead of \"and\" had a curious felicity.  I\nwondered who the \"young woman\" was and what she had made of it all.  I\nsadly  suspect that Soames could not have made more of it than she.\nYet even now, if one doesn't try to make any sense at all of the poem,\nand reads it just for the sound, there is a certain grace of cadence.\nSoames was an artist, in so far as he was anything, poor fellow!\n\nIt seemed to me, when first I read \"Fungoids,\" that, oddly enough, the\ndiabolistic side of him was the best.  Diabolism seemed to be a\ncheerful, even a wholesome influence in his life.\n\n\n     NOCTURNE\n\n  Round and round the shutter'd Square\n  I strolled with the Devil's arm in mine.\n  No sound but the scrape of his hoofs was there\n  And the ring of his laughter and mine.\n    We had drunk black wine.\n\n  I scream'd, \"I will race you, Master!\"\n  \"What matter,\" he shriek'd, \"to-night\n  Which of us runs the faster?\n  There is nothing to fear to-night\n    In the foul moon's light!\"\n\n  Then I look'd him in the eyes\n  And I laugh'd full shrill at the lie he told\n  And the gnawing fear he would fain disguise.\n  It was true, what I'd time and again been told:\n    He was old--old.\n\n\nThere was, I felt, quite a swing about that first stanza--a joyous and\nrollicking note of comradeship.  The second was slightly hysterical,\nperhaps.  But I liked the third, it was so bracingly unorthodox, even\naccording to the tenets of Soames's peculiar sect in the faith.  Not\nmuch \"trusting and encouraging\" here!  Soames triumphantly exposing the\ndevil as a liar, and laughing \"full shrill,\" cut a quite heartening\nfigure, I thought, then!  Now, in the light of what befell, none of his\nother poems depresses me so much as \"Nocturne.\"\n\nI looked out for what the metropolitan reviewers would have to say.\nThey seemed to fall into two classes: those who had little to say and\nthose who had nothing.  The second class was the larger, and the words\nof the first were cold; insomuch that\n\n  Strikes a note of modernity. . . .  These tripping numbers.--\"The\n  Preston Telegraph.\"\n\nwas the only lure offered in advertisements by Soames's publisher.  I\nhad hoped that when next I met the poet I could congratulate him on\nhaving made a stir, for I fancied he was not so sure of his intrinsic\ngreatness as he seemed.  I was but able to say, rather coarsely, when\nnext I did see him, that I hoped \"Fungoids\" was \"selling splendidly.\"\nHe looked at me across his glass of absinthe and asked if I had bought\na copy.  His publisher had told him that three had been sold.  I\nlaughed, as at a jest.\n\n\"You don't suppose I CARE, do you?\" he said, with something like a\nsnarl.  I disclaimed the notion.  He added that he was not a tradesman.\nI said mildly that I wasn't, either, and murmured that an artist who\ngave truly new and great things to the world had always to wait long\nfor recognition.  He said he cared not a sou for recognition.  I agreed\nthat the act of creation was its own reward.\n\nHis moroseness might have alienated me if I had regarded myself as a\nnobody.  But ah! hadn't both John Lane and Aubrey Beardsley suggested\nthat I should write an essay for the great new venture that was\nafoot--\"The Yellow Book\"?  And hadn't Henry Harland, as editor,\naccepted my essay?  And wasn't it to be in the very first number?  At\nOxford I was still in statu pupillari.  In London I regarded myself as\nvery much indeed a graduate now--one whom no Soames could ruffle.\nPartly to show off, partly in sheer good-will, I told Soames he ought\nto contribute to \"The Yellow Book.\"  He uttered from the throat a sound\nof scorn for that publication.\n\nNevertheless, I did, a day or two later, tentatively ask Harland if he\nknew anything of the work of a man called Enoch Soames.  Harland paused\nin the midst of his characteristic stride around the room, threw up his\nhands toward the ceiling, and groaned aloud: he had often met \"that\nabsurd creature\" in Paris, and this very morning had received some\npoems in manuscript from him.\n\n\"Has he NO talent?\" I asked.\n\n\"He has an income.  He's all right.\"  Harland was the most joyous of\nmen and most generous of critics, and he hated to talk of anything\nabout which he couldn't be enthusiastic.  So I dropped the subject of\nSoames. The news that Soames had an income did take the edge off\nsolicitude.  I learned afterward that he was the son of an unsuccessful\nand deceased bookseller in Preston, but had inherited an annuity of\nthree hundred pounds from a married aunt, and had no surviving\nrelatives of any kind. Materially, then, he was \"all right.\"  But there\nwas still a spiritual pathos about him, sharpened for me now by the\npossibility that even the praises of \"The Preston Telegraph\" might not\nhave been forthcoming had he not been the son of a Preston man He had a\nsort of weak doggedness which I could not but admire.  Neither he nor\nhis work received the slightest encouragement; but he persisted in\nbehaving as a personage: always he kept his dingy little flag flying.\nWherever congregated the jeunes feroces of the arts, in whatever Soho\nrestaurant they had just discovered, in whatever music-hall they were\nmost frequently, there was Soames in the midst of them, or, rather, on\nthe fringe of them, a dim, but inevitable, figure.  He never sought to\npropitiate his fellow-writers, never bated a jot of his arrogance about\nhis own work or of his contempt for theirs.  To the painters he was\nrespectful, even humble; but for the poets and prosaists of \"The Yellow\nBook\" and later of \"The Savoy\" he had never a word but of scorn.  He\nwasn't resented.  It didn't occur to anybody that he or his Catholic\ndiabolism mattered.  When, in the autumn of '96, he brought out (at his\nown expense, this time) a third book, his last book, nobody said a word\nfor or against it.  I meant, but forgot, to buy it.  I never saw it,\nand am ashamed to say I don't even remember what it was called.  But I\ndid, at the time of its publication, say to Rothenstein that I thought\npoor old Soames was really a rather tragic figure, and that I believed\nhe would literally die for want of recognition.  Rothenstein scoffed.\nHe said I was trying to get credit for a kind heart which I didn't\npossess; and perhaps this was so.  But at the private view of the New\nEnglish Art Club, a few weeks later, I beheld a pastel portrait of\n\"Enoch Soames, Esq.\"  It was very like him, and very like Rothenstein\nto have done it.  Soames was standing near it, in his soft hat and his\nwaterproof cape, all through the afternoon.  Anybody who knew him would\nhave recognized the portrait at a glance, but nobody who didn't know\nhim would have recognized the portrait from its bystander: it \"existed\"\nso much more than he; it was bound to.  Also, it had not that\nexpression of faint happiness which on that day was discernible, yes,\nin Soames's countenance.  Fame had breathed on him.  Twice again in the\ncourse of the month I went to the New English, and on both occasions\nSoames himself was on view there.  Looking back, I regard the close of\nthat exhibition as having been virtually the close of his career.  He\nhad felt the breath of Fame against his cheek--so late, for such a\nlittle while; and at its withdrawal he gave in, gave up, gave out.  He,\nwho had never looked strong or well, looked ghastly now--a shadow of\nthe shade he had once been.  He still frequented the domino-room, but\nhaving lost all wish to excite curiosity, he no longer read books\nthere.  \"You read only at the museum now?\" I asked, with attempted\ncheerfulness.  He said he never went there now.  \"No absinthe there,\"\nhe muttered.  It was the sort of thing that in old days he would have\nsaid for effect; but it carried conviction now.  Absinthe, erst but a\npoint in the \"personality\" he had striven so hard to build up, was\nsolace and necessity now.  He no longer called it \"la sorciere\nglauque.\"   He had shed away all his French phrases.  He had become a\nplain, unvarnished Preston man.\n\nFailure, if it be a plain, unvarnished, complete failure, and even\nthough it be a squalid failure, has always a certain dignity.  I\navoided Soames because he made me feel rather vulgar.  John Lane had\npublished, by this time, two little books of mine, and they had had a\npleasant little success of esteem.  I was a--slight, but\ndefinite--\"personality.\"  Frank Harris had engaged me to kick up my\nheels in \"The Saturday Review,\" Alfred Harmsworth was letting me do\nlikewise in \"The Daily Mail.\"  I was just what Soames wasn't.  And he\nshamed my gloss.  Had I known that he really and firmly believed in the\ngreatness of what he as an artist had achieved, I might not have\nshunned him.  No man who hasn't lost his vanity can be held to have\naltogether failed.  Soames's dignity was an illusion of mine.  One day,\nin the first week of June, 1897, that illusion went.  But on the\nevening of that day Soames went, too.\n\nI had been out most of the morning and, as it was too late to reach\nhome in time for luncheon, I sought the Vingtieme.  This little\nplace--Restaurant du Vingtieme Siecle, to give it its full title--had\nbeen discovered in '96 by the poets and prosaists, but had now been\nmore or less abandoned in favor of some later find.  I don't think it\nlived long enough to justify its name; but at that time there it still\nwas, in Greek Street, a few doors from Soho Square, and almost opposite\nto that house where, in the first years of the century, a little girl,\nand with her a boy named De Quincey, made nightly encampment in\ndarkness and hunger among dust and rats and old legal parchments.  The\nVingtieme was but a small whitewashed room, leading out into the street\nat one end and into a kitchen at the other.  The proprietor and cook\nwas a Frenchman, known to us as Monsieur Vingtieme; the waiters were\nhis two daughters, Rose and Berthe; and the food, according to faith,\nwas good.  The tables were so narrow and were set so close together\nthat there was space for twelve of them, six jutting from each wall.\n\nOnly the two nearest to the door, as I went in, were occupied.  On one\nside sat a tall, flashy, rather Mephistophelian man whom I had seen\nfrom time to time in the domino-room and elsewhere.  On the other side\nsat Soames.  They made a queer contrast in that sunlit room, Soames\nsitting haggard in that hat and cape, which nowhere at any season had I\nseen him doff, and this other, this keenly vital man, at sight of whom\nI more than ever wondered whether he were a diamond merchant, a\nconjurer, or the head of a private detective agency.  I was sure Soames\ndidn't want my company; but I asked, as it would have seemed brutal not\nto, whether I might join him, and took the chair opposite to his.  He\nwas smoking a cigarette, with an untasted salmi of something on his\nplate and a half-empty bottle of Sauterne before him, and he was quite\nsilent.  I said that the preparations for the Jubilee made London\nimpossible.  (I rather liked them, really.) I professed a wish to go\nright away till the whole thing was over.  In vain did I attune myself\nto his gloom.  He seemed not to hear me or even to see me.  I felt that\nhis behavior made me ridiculous in the eyes of the other man.  The\ngangway between the two rows of tables at the Vingtieme was hardly more\nthan two feet wide (Rose and Berthe, in their ministrations, had always\nto edge past each other, quarreling in whispers as they did so), and\nany one at the table abreast of yours was virtually at yours.  I\nthought our neighbor was amused at my failure to interest Soames, and\nso, as I could not explain to him that my insistence was merely\ncharitable, I became silent.  Without turning my head, I had him well\nwithin my range of vision.  I hoped I looked less vulgar than he in\ncontrast with Soames.  I was sure he was not an Englishman, but what\nWAS his nationality?  Though his jet-black hair was en brosse, I did\nnot think he was French.  To Berthe, who waited on him, he spoke French\nfluently, but with a hardly native idiom and accent.  I gathered that\nthis was his first visit to the Vingtieme; but Berthe was offhand in\nher manner to him: he had not made a good impression.  His eyes were\nhandsome, but, like the Vingtieme's tables, too narrow and set too\nclose together.  His nose was predatory, and the points of his\nmustache, waxed up behind his nostrils, gave a fixity to his smile.\nDecidedly, he was sinister.  And my sense of discomfort in his presence\nwas intensified by the scarlet waistcoat which tightly, and so\nunseasonably in June, sheathed his ample chest.  This waistcoat wasn't\nwrong merely because of the heat, either.  It was somehow all wrong in\nitself.  It wouldn't have done on Christmas morning.  It would have\nstruck a jarring note at the first night of \"Hernani.\"  I was trying to\naccount for its wrongness when Soames suddenly and strangely broke\nsilence.  \"A hundred years hence!\" he murmured, as in a trance.\n\n\"We shall not be here,\" I briskly, but fatuously, added.\n\n\"We shall not be here.  No,\" he droned, \"but the museum will still be\njust where it is.  And the reading-room just where it is.  And people\nwill be able to go and read there.\"  He inhaled sharply, and a spasm as\nof actual pain contorted his features.\n\nI wondered what train of thought poor Soames had been following.  He\ndid not enlighten me when he said, after a long pause, \"You think I\nhaven't minded.\"\n\n\"Minded what, Soames?\"\n\n\"Neglect.  Failure.\"\n\n\"FAILURE?\" I said heartily.  \"Failure?\" I repeated vaguely.\n\"Neglect--yes, perhaps; but that's quite another matter.  Of course you\nhaven't been--appreciated.  But what, then?  Any artist who--who\ngives--\"  What I wanted to say was, \"Any artist who gives truly new and\ngreat things to the world has always to wait long for recognition\"; but\nthe flattery would not out: in the face of his misery--a misery so\ngenuine and so unmasked--my lips would not say the words.\n\nAnd then he said them for me.  I flushed.  \"That's what you were going\nto say, isn't it?\" he asked.\n\n\"How did you know?\"\n\n\"It's what you said to me three years ago, when 'Fungoids' was\npublished.\"  I flushed the more.  I need not have flushed at all.\n\"It's the only important thing I ever heard you say,\" he continued.\n\"And I've never forgotten it.  It's a true thing.  It's a horrible\ntruth.  But--d'you remember what I answered?  I said, 'I don't care a\nsou for recognition.' And you believed me.  You've gone on believing\nI'm above that sort of thing.  You're shallow.  What should YOU know of\nthe feelings of a man like me?  You imagine that a great artist's faith\nin himself and in the verdict of posterity is enough to keep him happy.\nYou've never guessed at the bitterness and loneliness, the\"--his voice\nbroke; but presently he resumed, speaking with a force that I had never\nknown in him.  \"Posterity!  What use is it to ME?  A dead man doesn't\nknow that people are visiting his grave, visiting his birthplace,\nputting up tablets to him, unveiling statues of him.  A dead man can't\nread the books that are written about him.  A hundred years hence!\nThink of it!  If I could come back to life THEN--just for a few\nhours--and go to the reading-room and READ!  Or, better still, if I\ncould be projected now, at this moment, into that future, into that\nreading-room, just for this one afternoon!  I'd sell myself body and\nsoul to the devil for that!  Think of the pages and pages in the\ncatalogue: 'Soames, Enoch' endlessly--endless editions, commentaries,\nprolegomena, biographies\"--  But here he was interrupted by a sudden\nloud crack of the chair at the next table.  Our neighbor had half risen\nfrom his place.  He was leaning toward us, apologetically intrusive.\n\n\"Excuse--permit me,\" he said softly.  \"I have been unable not to hear.\nMight I take a liberty?  In this little restaurant-sans-facon--might I,\nas the phrase is, cut in?\"\n\nI could but signify our acquiescence.  Berthe had appeared at the\nkitchen door, thinking the stranger wanted his bill.  He waved her away\nwith his cigar, and in another moment had seated himself beside me,\ncommanding a full view of Soames.\n\n\"Though not an Englishman,\" he explained, \"I know my London well, Mr.\nSoames.  Your name and fame--Mr. Beerbohm's, too--very known to me.\nYour point is, who am _I_?\"  He glanced quickly over his shoulder, and\nin a lowered voice said, \"I am the devil.\"\n\nI couldn't help it; I laughed.  I tried not to, I knew there was\nnothing to laugh at, my rudeness shamed me; but--I laughed with\nincreasing volume.  The devil's quiet dignity, the surprise and disgust\nof his raised eyebrows, did but the more dissolve me.  I rocked to and\nfro; I lay back aching; I behaved deplorably.\n\n\"I am a gentleman, and,\" he said with intense emphasis, \"I thought I\nwas in the company of GENTLEMEN.\"\n\n\"Don't!\" I gasped faintly.  \"Oh, don't!\"\n\n\"Curious, nicht wahr?\" I heard him say to Soames.  \"There is a type of\nperson to whom the very mention of my name is--oh, so awfully--funny!\nIn your theaters the dullest comedien needs only to say 'The devil!'\nand right away they give him 'the loud laugh what speaks the vacant\nmind.'  Is it not so?\"\n\nI had now just breath enough to offer my apologies.  He accepted them,\nbut coldly, and re-addressed himself to Soames.\n\n\"I am a man of business,\" he said, \"and always I would put things\nthrough 'right now,' as they say in the States.  You are a poet.  Les\naffaires--you detest them.  So be it.  But with me you will deal, eh?\nWhat you have said just now gives me furiously to hope.\"\n\nSoames had not moved except to light a fresh cigarette.  He sat\ncrouched forward, with his elbows squared on the table, and his head\njust above the level of his hands, staring up at the devil.\n\n\"Go on,\" he nodded.  I had no remnant of laughter in me now.\n\n\"It will be the more pleasant, our little deal,\" the devil went on,\n\"because you are--I mistake not?--a diabolist.\"\n\n\"A Catholic diabolist,\" said Soames.\n\nThe devil accepted the reservation genially.\n\n\"You wish,\" he resumed, \"to visit now--this afternoon as-ever-is--the\nreading-room of the British Museum, yes?  But of a hundred years hence,\nyes?  Parfaitement.  Time--an illusion.  Past and future--they are as\never present as the present, or at any rate only what you call 'just\nround the corner.'  I switch you on to any date.  I project you--pouf!\nYou wish to be in the reading-room just as it will be on the afternoon\nof June 3, 1997?  You wish to find yourself standing in that room, just\npast the swing-doors, this very minute, yes?  And to stay there till\nclosing-time?  Am I right?\"\n\nSoames nodded.\n\nThe devil looked at his watch.  \"Ten past two,\" he said.  \"Closing-time\nin summer same then as now--seven o'clock.  That will give you almost\nfive hours.  At seven o'clock--pouf!--you find yourself again here,\nsitting at this table.  I am dining to-night dans le monde--dans le\nhiglif.  That concludes my present visit to your great city.  I come\nand fetch you here, Mr. Soames, on my way home.\"\n\n\"Home?\" I echoed.\n\n\"Be it never so humble!\" said the devil, lightly.\n\n\"All right,\" said Soames.\n\n\"Soames!\" I entreated.  But my friend moved not a muscle.\n\nThe devil had made as though to stretch forth his hand across the\ntable, but he paused in his gesture.\n\n\"A hundred years hence, as now,\" he smiled, \"no smoking allowed in the\nreading-room.  You would better therefore--\"\n\nSoames removed the cigarette from his mouth and dropped it into his\nglass of Sauterne.\n\n\"Soames!\" again I cried.  \"Can't you\"--but the devil had now stretched\nforth his hand across the table.  He brought it slowly down on the\ntable-cloth.  Soames's chair was empty.  His cigarette floated sodden\nin his wine-glass.  There was no other trace of him.\n\nFor a few moments the devil let his hand rest where it lay, gazing at\nme out of the corners of his eyes, vulgarly triumphant.\n\nA shudder shook me.  With an effort I controlled myself and rose from\nmy chair.  \"Very clever,\" I said condescendingly.  \"But--'The Time\nMachine' is a delightful book, don't you think?  So entirely original!\"\n\n\"You are pleased to sneer,\" said the devil, who had also risen, \"but it\nis one thing to write about an impossible machine; it is a quite other\nthing to be a supernatural power.\"  All the same, I had scored.\n\nBerthe had come forth at the sound of our rising.  I explained to her\nthat Mr. Soames had been called away, and that both he and I would be\ndining here.  It was not until I was out in the open air that I began\nto feel giddy.  I have but the haziest recollection of what I did,\nwhere I wandered, in the glaring sunshine of that endless afternoon.  I\nremember the sound of carpenters' hammers all along Piccadilly and the\nbare chaotic look of the half-erected \"stands.\"  Was it in the Green\nPark or in Kensington Gardens or WHERE was it that I sat on a chair\nbeneath a tree, trying to read an evening paper?  There was a phrase in\nthe leading article that went on repeating itself in my fagged mind:\n\"Little is hidden from this August Lady full of the garnered wisdom of\nsixty years of Sovereignty.\"  I remember wildly conceiving a letter (to\nreach Windsor by an express messenger told to await answer): \"Madam:\nWell knowing that your Majesty is full of the garnered wisdom of sixty\nyears of Sovereignty, I venture to ask your advice in the following\ndelicate matter.  Mr. Enoch Soames, whose poems you may or may not\nknow--\" Was there NO way of helping him, saving him?  A bargain was a\nbargain, and I was the last man to aid or abet any one in wriggling out\nof a reasonable obligation.  I wouldn't have lifted a little finger to\nsave Faust. But poor Soames!  Doomed to pay without respite an eternal\nprice for nothing but a fruitless search and a bitter disillusioning.\n\nOdd and uncanny it seemed to me that he, Soames, in the flesh, in the\nwaterproof cape, was at this moment living in the last decade of the\nnext century, poring over books not yet written, and seeing and seen by\nmen not yet born.  Uncannier and odder still that to-night and evermore\nhe would be in hell.  Assuredly, truth was stranger than fiction.\n\nEndless that afternoon was.  Almost I wished I had gone with Soames,\nnot, indeed, to stay in the reading-room, but to sally forth for a\nbrisk sight-seeing walk around a new London.  I wandered restlessly out\nof the park I had sat in.  Vainly I tried to imagine myself an ardent\ntourist from the eighteenth century.  Intolerable was the strain of the\nslow-passing and empty minutes.  Long before seven o'clock I was back\nat the Vingtieme.\n\nI sat there just where I had sat for luncheon.  Air came in listlessly\nthrough the open door behind me.  Now and again Rose or Berthe appeared\nfor a moment.  I had told them I would not order any dinner till Mr.\nSoames came.  A hurdy-gurdy began to play, abruptly drowning the noise\nof a quarrel between some Frenchmen farther up the street.  Whenever\nthe tune was changed I heard the quarrel still raging.  I had bought\nanother evening paper on my way.  I unfolded it.  My eyes gazed ever\naway from it to the clock over the kitchen door.\n\nFive minutes now to the hour!  I remembered that clocks in restaurants\nare kept five minutes fast.  I concentrated my eyes on the paper.  I\nvowed I would not look away from it again.  I held it upright, at its\nfull width, close to my face, so that I had no view of anything but it.\nRather a tremulous sheet?  Only because of the draft, I told myself.\n\nMy arms gradually became stiff; they ached; but I could not drop\nthem--now.  I had a suspicion, I had a certainty.  Well, what, then?\nWhat else had I come for?  Yet I held tight that barrier of newspaper.\nOnly the sound of Berthe's brisk footstep from the kitchen enabled me,\nforced me, to drop it, and to utter:\n\n\"What shall we have to eat, Soames?\"\n\n\"Il est souffrant, ce pauvre Monsieur Soames?\" asked Berthe.\n\n\"He's only--tired.\"  I asked her to get some wine--Burgundy--and\nwhatever food might be ready.  Soames sat crouched forward against the\ntable exactly as when last I had seen him.  It was as though he had\nnever moved--he who had moved so unimaginably far.  Once or twice in\nthe afternoon it had for an instant occurred to me that perhaps his\njourney was not to be fruitless, that perhaps we had all been wrong in\nour estimate of the works of Enoch Soames.  That we had been horribly\nright was horribly clear from the look of him.  But, \"Don't be\ndiscouraged,\" I falteringly said.  \"Perhaps it's only that you--didn't\nleave enough time.  Two, three centuries hence, perhaps--\"\n\n\"Yes,\" his voice came; \"I've thought of that.\"\n\n\"And now--now for the more immediate future!  Where are you going to\nhide?  How would it be if you caught the Paris express from Charing\nCross?  Almost an hour to spare.  Don't go on to Paris.  Stop at\nCalais.  Live in Calais.  He'd never think of looking for you in\nCalais.\"\n\n\"It's like my luck,\" he said, \"to spend my last hours on earth with an\nass.\"  But I was not offended.  \"And a treacherous ass,\" he strangely\nadded, tossing across to me a crumpled bit of paper which he had been\nholding in his hand.  I glanced at the writing on it--some sort of\ngibberish, apparently.  I laid it impatiently aside.\n\n\"Come, Soames, pull yourself together!  This isn't a mere matter of\nlife or death.  It's a question of eternal torment, mind you!  You\ndon't mean to say you're going to wait limply here till the devil comes\nto fetch you.\"\n\n\"I can't do anything else.  I've no choice.\"\n\n\"Come!  This is 'trusting and encouraging' with a vengeance!  This is\ndiabolism run mad!\"  I filled his glass with wine.  \"Surely, now that\nyou've SEEN the brute--\"\n\n\"It's no good abusing him.\"\n\n\"You must admit there's nothing Miltonic about him, Soames.\"\n\n\"I don't say he's not rather different from what I expected.\"\n\n\"He's a vulgarian, he's a swell mobs-man, he's the sort of man who\nhangs about the corridors of trains going to the Riviera and steals\nladies' jewel-cases.  Imagine eternal torment presided over by HIM!\"\n\n\"You don't suppose I look forward to it, do you?\"\n\n\"Then why not slip quietly out of the way?\"\n\nAgain and again I filled his glass, and always, mechanically, he\nemptied it; but the wine kindled no spark of enterprise in him.  He did\nnot eat, and I myself ate hardly at all.  I did not in my heart believe\nthat any dash for freedom could save him.  The chase would be swift,\nthe capture certain.  But better anything than this passive, meek,\nmiserable waiting.  I told Soames that for the honor of the human race\nhe ought to make some show of resistance.  He asked what the human race\nhad ever done for him.  \"Besides,\" he said, \"can't you understand that\nI'm in his power? You saw him touch me, didn't you?  There's an end of\nit.  I've no will.  I'm sealed.\"\n\nI made a gesture of despair.  He went on repeating the word \"sealed.\"\nI began to realize that the wine had clouded his brain.  No wonder!\nFoodless he had gone into futurity, foodless he still was.  I urged him\nto eat, at any rate, some bread.  It was maddening to think that he,\nwho had so much to tell, might tell nothing.  \"How was it all,\" I\nasked, \"yonder?  Come, tell me your adventures!\"\n\n\"They'd make first-rate 'copy,' wouldn't they?\"\n\n\"I'm awfully sorry for you, Soames, and I make all possible allowances;\nbut what earthly right have you to insinuate that I should make 'copy,'\nas you call it, out of you?\"\n\nThe poor fellow pressed his hands to his forehead.\n\n\"I don't know,\" he said.  \"I had some reason, I know.  I'll try to\nremember.  He sat plunged in thought.\n\n\"That's right.  Try to remember everything.  Eat a little more bread.\nWhat did the reading-room look like?\"\n\n\"Much as usual,\" he at length muttered.\n\n\"Many people there?\"\n\n\"Usual sort of number.\"\n\n\"What did they look like?\"\n\nSoames tried to visualize them.\n\n\"They all,\" he presently remembered, \"looked very like one another.\"\n\nMy mind took a fearsome leap.\n\n\"All dressed in sanitary woolen?\"\n\n\"Yes, I think so.  Grayish-yellowish stuff.\"\n\n\"A sort of uniform?\"  He nodded.  \"With a number on it perhaps--a\nnumber on a large disk of metal strapped round the left arm?  D. K. F.\n78,910--that sort of thing?\"  It was even so.  \"And all of them, men\nand women alike, looking very well cared for?  Very Utopian, and\nsmelling rather strongly of carbolic, and all of them quite hairless?\"\nI was right every time.  Soames was only not sure whether the men and\nwomen were hairless or shorn.  \"I hadn't time to look at them very\nclosely,\" he explained.\n\n\"No, of course not.  But--\"\n\n\"They stared at ME, I can tell you.  I attracted a great deal of\nattention.\"  At last he had done that!  \"I think I rather scared them.\nThey moved away whenever I came near.  They followed me about, at a\ndistance, wherever I went.  The men at the round desk in the middle\nseemed to have a sort of panic whenever I went to make inquiries.\"\n\n\"What did you do when you arrived?\"\n\nWell, he had gone straight to the catalogue, of course,--to the S\nvolumes,--and had stood long before SN-SOF, unable to take this volume\nout of the shelf because his heart was beating so.  At first, he said,\nhe wasn't disappointed; he only thought there was some new arrangement.\nHe went to the middle desk and asked where the catalogue of\ntwentieth-century books was kept.  He gathered that there was still\nonly one catalogue.  Again he looked up his name, stared at the three\nlittle pasted slips he had known so well.  Then he went and sat down\nfor a long time.\n\n\"And then,\" he droned, \"I looked up the 'Dictionary of National\nBiography,' and some encyclopedias.  I went back to the middle desk and\nasked what was the best modern book on late nineteenth-century\nliterature.  They told me Mr. T. K. Nupton's book was considered the\nbest.  I looked it up in the catalogue and filled in a form for it.  It\nwas brought to me.  My name wasn't in the index, but--yes!\" he said\nwith a sudden change of tone, \"that's what I'd forgotten.  Where's that\nbit of paper?  Give it me back.\"\n\nI, too, had forgotten that cryptic screed.  I found it fallen on the\nfloor, and handed it to him.\n\nHe smoothed it out, nodding and smiling at me disagreeably.\n\n\"I found myself glancing through Nupton's book,\" he resumed.  \"Not very\neasy reading.  Some sort of phonetic spelling.  All the modern books I\nsaw were phonetic.\"\n\n\"Then I don't want to hear any more, Soames, please.\"\n\n\"The proper names seemed all to be spelt in the old way.  But for that\nI mightn't have noticed my own name.\"\n\n\"Your own name?  Really?  Soames, I'm VERY glad.\"\n\n\"And yours.\"\n\n\"No!\"\n\n\"I thought I should find you waiting here to-night, so I took the\ntrouble to copy out the passage.  Read it.\"\n\nI snatched the paper.  Soames's handwriting was characteristically dim.\nIt and the noisome spelling and my excitement made me all the slower to\ngrasp what T. K. Nupton was driving at.\n\nThe document lies before me at this moment.  Strange that the words I\nhere copy out for you were copied out for me by poor Soames just\neighty-two years hence!\n\nFrom page 234 of \"Inglish Littracher 1890-1900\" bi T. K. Nupton,\npublishd bi th Stait, 1992.\n\nFr egzarmpl, a riter ov th time, naimed Max Beerbohm, hoo woz stil\nalive in th twentith senchri, rote a stauri in wich e pautraid an\nimmajnari karrakter kauld \"Enoch Soames\"--a thurd-rait poit hoo beleevz\nimself a grate jeneus an maix a bargin with th Devvl in auder ter no\nwot posterriti thinx ov im!

Thank hevvn we hav no Enoch\nSoameses amung us to-dai!\n\n\nI found that by murmuring the words aloud (a device which I commend to\nmy reader) I was able to master them little by little.  The clearer\nthey became, the greater was my bewilderment, my distress and horror.\nThe whole thing was a nightmare.  Afar, the great grisly background of\nwhat was in store for the poor dear art of letters; here, at the table,\nfixing on me a gaze that made me hot all over, the poor fellow\nwhom--whom evidently--but no: whatever down-grade my character might\ntake in coming years, I should never be such a brute as to--\n\nAgain I examined the screed.  \"Immajnari.\"  But here Soames was, no\nmore imaginary, alas! than I.  And \"labud\"--what on earth was that?\n(To this day I have never made out that word.) \"It's all\nvery--baffling,\" I at length stammered.\n\nSoames said nothing, but cruelly did not cease to look at me.\n\n\"Are you sure,\" I temporized, \"quite sure you copied the thing out\ncorrectly?\"\n\n\"Quite.\"\n\n\"Well, then, it's this wretched Nupton who must have made--must be\ngoing to make--some idiotic mistake.  Look here Soames, you know me\nbetter than to suppose that I--  After all, the name Max Beerbohm is\nnot at all an uncommon one, and there must be several Enoch Soameses\nrunning around, or, rather, Enoch Soames is a name that might occur to\nany one writing a story.  And I don't write stories; I'm an essayist,\nan observer, a recorder.  I admit that it's an extraordinary\ncoincidence.  But you must see--\"\n\n\"I see the whole thing,\" said Soames, quietly.  And he added, with a\ntouch of his old manner, but with more dignity than I had ever known in\nhim, \"Parlons d'autre chose.\"\n\nI accepted that suggestion very promptly.  I returned straight to the\nmore immediate future.  I spent most of the long evening in renewed\nappeals to Soames to come away and seek refuge somewhere.  I remember\nsaying at last that if indeed I was destined to write about him, the\nsupposed \"stauri\" had better have at least a happy ending.  Soames\nrepeated those last three words in a tone of intense scorn.\n\n\"In life and in art,\" he said, \"all that matters is an INEVITABLE\nending.\"\n\n\"But,\" I urged more hopefully than I felt, \"an ending that can be\navoided ISN'T inevitable.\"\n\n\"You aren't an artist,\" he rasped.  \"And you're so hopelessly not an\nartist that, so far from being able to imagine a thing and make it seem\ntrue, you're going to make even a true thing seem as if you'd made it\nup.  You're a miserable bungler.  And it's like my luck.\"\n\nI protested that the miserable bungler was not I, was not going to be\nI, but T. K. Nupton; and we had a rather heated argument, in the thick\nof which it suddenly seemed to me that Soames saw he was in the wrong:\nhe had quite physically cowered.  But I wondered why--and now I guessed\nwith a cold throb just why--he stared so past me.  The bringer of that\n\"inevitable ending\" filled the doorway.\n\nI managed to turn in my chair and to say, not without a semblance of\nlightness, \"Aha, come in!\"  Dread was indeed rather blunted in me by\nhis looking so absurdly like a villain in a melodrama.  The sheen of\nhis tilted hat and of his shirt-front, the repeated twists he was\ngiving to his mustache, and most of all the magnificence of his sneer,\ngave token that he was there only to be foiled.\n\nHe was at our table in a stride.  \"I am sorry,\" he sneered witheringly,\n\"to break up your pleasant party, but--\"\n\n\"You don't; you complete it,\" I assured him.  \"Mr. Soames and I want to\nhave a little talk with you.  Won't you sit?  Mr. Soames got nothing,\nfrankly nothing, by his journey this afternoon.  We don't wish to say\nthat the whole thing was a swindle, a common swindle.  On the contrary,\nwe believe you meant well.  But of course the bargain, such as it was,\nis off.\"\n\nThe devil gave no verbal answer.  He merely looked at Soames and\npointed with rigid forefinger to the door.  Soames was wretchedly\nrising from his chair when, with a desperate, quick gesture, I swept\ntogether two dinner-knives that were on the table, and laid their\nblades across each other.  The devil stepped sharp back against the\ntable behind him, averting his face and shuddering.\n\n\"You are not superstitious!\" he hissed.\n\n\"Not at all,\" I smiled.\n\n\"Soames,\" he said as to an underling, but without turning his face,\n\"put those knives straight!\"\n\nWith an inhibitive gesture to my friend, \"Mr. Soames,\" I said\nemphatically to the devil, \"is a Catholic diabolist\"; but my poor\nfriend did the devil's bidding, not mine; and now, with his master's\neyes again fixed on him, he arose, he shuffled past me.  I tried to\nspeak.  It was he that spoke.  \"Try,\" was the prayer he threw back at\nme as the devil pushed him roughly out through the door--\"TRY to make\nthem know that I did exist!\"\n\nIn another instant I, too, was through that door.  I stood staring all\nways, up the street, across it, down it.  There was moonlight and\nlamplight, but there was not Soames nor that other.\n\nDazed, I stood there.  Dazed, I turned back at length into the little\nroom, and I suppose I paid Berthe or Rose for my dinner and luncheon\nand for Soames's; I hope so, for I never went to the Vingtieme again.\nEver since that night I have avoided Greek Street altogether.  And for\nyears I did not set foot even in Soho Square, because on that same\nnight it was there that I paced and loitered, long and long, with some\nsuch dull sense of hope as a man has in not straying far from the place\nwhere he has lost something.  \"Round and round the shutter'd\nSquare\"--that line came back to me on my lonely beat, and with it the\nwhole stanza, ringing in my brain and bearing in on me how tragically\ndifferent from the happy scene imagined by him was the poet's actual\nexperience of that prince in whom of all princes we should put not our\ntrust!\n\nBut strange how the mind of an essayist, be it never so stricken, roves\nand ranges!  I remember pausing before a wide door-step and wondering\nif perchance it was on this very one that the young De Quincey lay ill\nand faint while poor Ann flew as fast as her feet would carry her to\nOxford Street, the \"stony-hearted stepmother\" of them both, and came\nback bearing that \"glass of port wine and spices\" but for which he\nmight, so he thought, actually have died.  Was this the very door-step\nthat the old De Quincey used to revisit in homage?  I pondered Ann's\nfate, the cause of her sudden vanishing from the ken of her boy friend;\nand presently I blamed myself for letting the past override the\npresent.  Poor vanished Soames!\n\nAnd for myself, too, I began to be troubled.  What had I better do?\nWould there be a hue and cry--\"Mysterious Disappearance of an Author,\"\nand all that?  He had last been seen lunching and dining in my company.\nHadn't I better get a hansom and drive straight to Scotland Yard?  They\nwould think I was a lunatic.  After all, I reassured myself, London was\na very large place, and one very dim figure might easily drop out of it\nunobserved, now especially, in the blinding glare of the near Jubilee.\nBetter say nothing at all, I thought.\n\nAND I was right.  Soames's disappearance made no stir at all.  He was\nutterly forgotten before any one, so far as I am aware, noticed that he\nwas no longer hanging around.  Now and again some poet or prosaist may\nhave said to another, \"What has become of that man Soames?\" but I never\nheard any such question asked.  As for his landlady in Dyott Street, no\ndoubt he had paid her weekly, and what possessions he may have had in\nhis rooms were enough to save her from fretting.  The solicitor through\nwhom he was paid his annuity may be presumed to have made inquiries,\nbut no echo of these resounded.  There was something rather ghastly to\nme in the general unconsciousness that Soames had existed, and more\nthan once I caught myself wondering whether Nupton, that babe unborn,\nwere going to be right in thinking him a figment of my brain.\n\nIn that extract from Nupton's repulsive book there is one point which\nperhaps puzzles you.  How is it that the author, though I have here\nmentioned him by name and have quoted the exact words he is going to\nwrite, is not going to grasp the obvious corollary that I have invented\nnothing?  The answer can be only this: Nupton will not have read the\nlater passages of this memoir.  Such lack of thoroughness is a serious\nfault in any one who undertakes to do scholar's work.  And I hope these\nwords will meet the eye of some contemporary rival to Nupton and be the\nundoing of Nupton.\n\nI like to think that some time between 1992 and 1997 somebody will have\nlooked up this memoir, and will have forced on the world his inevitable\nand startling conclusions.  And I have reason for believing that this\nwill be so.  You realize that the reading-room into which Soames was\nprojected by the devil was in all respects precisely as it will be on\nthe afternoon of June 3, 1997.  You realize, therefore, that on that\nafternoon, when it comes round, there the selfsame crowd will be, and\nthere Soames will be, punctually, he and they doing precisely what they\ndid before.  Recall now Soames's account of the sensation he made.  You\nmay say that the mere difference of his costume was enough to make him\nsensational in that uniformed crowd.  You wouldn't say so if you had\never seen him, and I assure you that in no period would Soames be\nanything but dim.  The fact that people are going to stare at him and\nfollow him around and seem afraid of him, can be explained only on the\nhypothesis that they will somehow have been prepared for his ghostly\nvisitation. They will have been awfully waiting to see whether he\nreally would come.  And when he does come the effect will of course\nbe--awful.\n\nAn authentic, guaranteed, proved ghost, but; only a ghost, alas!  Only\nthat.  In his first visit Soames was a creature of flesh and blood,\nwhereas the creatures among whom he was projected were but ghosts, I\ntake it--solid, palpable, vocal, but unconscious and automatic ghosts,\nin a building that was itself an illusion.  Next time that building and\nthose creatures will be real.  It is of Soames that there will be but\nthe semblance.  I wish I could think him destined to revisit the world\nactually, physically, consciously.  I wish he had this one brief\nescape, this one small treat, to look forward to.  I never forget him\nfor long.  He is where he is and forever.  The more rigid moralists\namong you may say he has only himself to blame.  For my part, I think\nhe has been very hardly used. It is well that vanity should be\nchastened; and Enoch Soames's vanity was, I admit, above the average,\nand called for special treatment.  But there was no need for\nvindictiveness.  You say he contracted to pay the price he is paying.\nYes; but I maintain that he was induced to do so by fraud.  Well\ninformed in all things, the devil must have known that my friend would\ngain nothing by his visit to futurity.  The whole thing was a very\nshabby trick.  The more I think of it, the more detestable the devil\nseems to me.\n\nOf him I have caught sight several times, here and there, since that\nday at the Vingtieme.  Only once, however, have I seen him at close\nquarters.  This was a couple of years ago, in Paris.  I was walking one\nafternoon along the rue d'Antin, and I saw him advancing from the\nopposite direction, overdressed as ever, and swinging an ebony cane and\naltogether behaving as though the whole pavement belonged to him.  At\nthought of Enoch Soames and the myriads of other sufferers eternally in\nthis brute's dominion, a great cold wrath filled me, and I drew myself\nup to my full height.  But--well, one is so used to nodding and smiling\nin the street to anybody whom one knows that the action becomes almost\nindependent of oneself; to prevent it requires a very sharp effort and\ngreat presence of mind.  I was miserably aware, as I passed the devil,\nthat I nodded and smiled to him.  And my shame was the deeper and\nhotter because he, if you please, stared straight at me with the utmost\nhaughtiness.\n\nTo be cut, deliberately cut, by HIM!  I was, I still am, furious at\nhaving had that happen to me.\n\n\n\n[Transcriber's Note: I have closed contractions in the text; e.g.,\n\"does n't\" has become \"doesn't\" etc.]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Enoch Soames, by Max Beerbohm", "answers": ["ones that are vague"], "length": 11201, "dataset": "narrativeqa", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "b097807317fd6df3e69b46d4332b558f2d6c7f1f893770a6"}

But each one has its proper hour in a conversation--you know\nthe pretty jest recorded by Chamfort, and said to the Duc de Fronsac:\n'Between your sally and the present moment lie ten bottles of\nchampagne.'\"\n\n\"But it is two in the morning, and the story of Rosina has prepared us,\"\nsaid the mistress of the house.\n\n\"Tell us, Monsieur Bianchon!\" was the cry on every side.\n\nThe obliging doctor bowed, and silence reigned.\n\n\"At about a hundred paces from Vendome, on the banks of the Loir,\" said\nhe, \"stands an old brown house, crowned with very high roofs, and so\ncompletely isolated that there is nothing near it, not even a fetid\ntannery or a squalid tavern, such as are commonly seen outside small\ntowns. In front of this house is a garden down to the river, where the\nbox shrubs, formerly clipped close to edge the walks, now straggle\nat their own will. A few willows, rooted in the stream, have grown\nup quickly like an enclosing fence, and half hide the house. The\nwild plants we call weeds have clothed the bank with their beautiful\nluxuriance. The fruit-trees, neglected for these ten years past,\nno longer bear a crop, and their suckers have formed a thicket. The\nespaliers are like a copse. The paths, once graveled, are overgrown with\npurslane; but, to be accurate there is no trace of a path.\n\n\"Looking down from the hilltop, to which cling the ruins of the old\ncastle of the Dukes of Vendome, the only spot whence the eye can\nsee into this enclosure, we think that at a time, difficult now to\ndetermine, this spot of earth must have been the joy of some country\ngentleman devoted to roses and tulips, in a word, to horticulture, but\nabove all a lover of choice fruit. An arbor is visible, or rather\nthe wreck of an arbor, and under it a table still stands not entirely\ndestroyed by time. At the aspect of this garden that is no more, the\nnegative joys of the peaceful life of the provinces may be divined as we\ndivine the history of a worthy tradesman when we read the epitaph on his\ntomb. To complete the mournful and tender impressions which seize the\nsoul, on one of the walls there is a sundial graced with this homely\nChristian motto, '_Ultimam cogita_.'\n\n\"The roof of this house is dreadfully dilapidated; the outside shutters\nare always closed; the balconies are hung with swallows' nests; the\ndoors are for ever shut. Straggling grasses have outlined the flagstones\nof the steps with green; the ironwork is rusty. Moon and sun, winter,\nsummer, and snow have eaten into the wood, warped the boards, peeled\noff the paint. The dreary silence is broken only by birds and cats,\npolecats, rats, and mice, free to scamper round, and fight, and eat each\nother. An invisible hand has written over it all: 'Mystery.'\n\n\"If, prompted by curiosity, you go to look at this house from the\nstreet, you will see a large gate, with a round-arched top; the children\nhave made many holes in it. I learned later that this door had been\nblocked for ten years. Through these irregular breaches you will see\nthat the side towards the courtyard is in perfect harmony with the side\ntowards the garden. The same ruin prevails. Tufts of weeds outline\nthe paving-stones; the walls are scored by enormous cracks, and the\nblackened coping is laced with a thousand festoons of pellitory. The\nstone steps are disjointed; the bell-cord is rotten; the gutter-spouts\nbroken. What fire from heaven could have fallen there? By what decree\nhas salt been sown on this dwelling? Has God been mocked here? Or was\nFrance betrayed? These are the questions we ask ourselves. Reptiles\ncrawl over it, but give no reply. This empty and deserted house is a\nvast enigma of which the answer is known to none.\n\n\"It was formerly a little domain, held in fief, and is known as La\nGrande Breteche. During my stay at Vendome, where Despleins had left me\nin charge of a rich patient, the sight of this strange dwelling became\none of my keenest pleasures. Was it not far better than a ruin? Certain\nmemories of indisputable authenticity attach themselves to a ruin; but\nthis house, still standing, though being slowly destroyed by an avenging\nhand, contained a secret, an unrevealed thought. At the very least,\nit testified to a caprice. More than once in the evening I boarded the\nhedge, run wild, which surrounded the enclosure. I braved scratches, I\ngot into this ownerless garden, this plot which was no longer public or\nprivate; I lingered there for hours gazing at the disorder. I would not,\nas the price of the story to which this strange scene no doubt was due,\nhave asked a single question of any gossiping native. On that spot I\nwove delightful romances, and abandoned myself to little debauches of\nmelancholy which enchanted me. If I had known the reason--perhaps quite\ncommonplace--of this neglect, I should have lost the unwritten poetry\nwhich intoxicated me. To me this refuge represented the most various\nphases of human life, shadowed by misfortune; sometimes the peace of the\ngraveyard without the dead, who speak in the language of epitaphs; one\nday I saw in it the home of lepers; another, the house of the Atridae;\nbut, above all, I found there provincial life, with its contemplative\nideas, its hour-glass existence. I often wept there, I never laughed.\n\n\"More than once I felt involuntary terrors as I heard overhead the dull\nhum of the wings of some hurrying wood-pigeon. The earth is dank; you\nmust be on the watch for lizards, vipers, and frogs, wandering about\nwith the wild freedom of nature; above all, you must have no fear\nof cold, for in a few moments you feel an icy cloak settle on your\nshoulders, like the Commendatore's hand on Don Giovanni's neck.\n\n\"One evening I felt a shudder; the wind had turned an old rusty\nweathercock, and the creaking sounded like a cry from the house, at\nthe very moment when I was finishing a gloomy drama to account for\nthis monumental embodiment of woe. I returned to my inn, lost in gloomy\nthoughts. When I had supped, the hostess came into my room with an air\nof mystery, and said, 'Monsieur, here is Monsieur Regnault.'\n\n\"'Who is Monsieur Regnault?'\n\n\"'What, sir, do you not know Monsieur Regnault?--Well, that's odd,' said\nshe, leaving the room.\n\n\"On a sudden I saw a man appear, tall, slim, dressed in black, hat\nin hand, who came in like a ram ready to butt his opponent, showing a\nreceding forehead, a small pointed head, and a colorless face of the hue\nof a glass of dirty water. You would have taken him for an usher. The\nstranger wore an old coat, much worn at the seams; but he had a diamond\nin his shirt frill, and gold rings in his ears.\n\n\"'Monsieur,' said I, 'whom have I the honor of addressing?'--He took a\nchair, placed himself in front of my fire, put his hat on my table,\nand answered while he rubbed his hands: 'Dear me, it is very\ncold.--Monsieur, I am Monsieur Regnault.'\n\n\"I was encouraging myself by saying to myself, '_Il bondo cani!_ Seek!'\n\n\"'I am,' he went on, 'notary at Vendome.'\n\n\"'I am delighted to hear it, monsieur,' I exclaimed. 'But I am not in a\nposition to make a will for reasons best known to myself.'\n\n\"'One moment!' said he, holding up his hand as though to gain silence.\n'Allow me, monsieur, allow me! I am informed that you sometimes go to\nwalk in the garden of la Grande Breteche.'\n\n\"'Yes, monsieur.'\n\n\"'One moment!' said he, repeating his gesture. 'That constitutes a\nmisdemeanor. Monsieur, as executor under the will of the late Comtesse\nde Merret, I come in her name to beg you to discontinue the practice.\nOne moment! I am not a Turk, and do not wish to make a crime of it. And\nbesides, you are free to be ignorant of the circumstances which\ncompel me to leave the finest mansion in Vendome to fall into ruin.\nNevertheless, monsieur, you must be a man of education, and you should\nknow that the laws forbid, under heavy penalties, any trespass on\nenclosed property. A hedge is the same as a wall. But, the state in\nwhich the place is left may be an excuse for your curiosity. For my\npart, I should be quite content to make you free to come and go in the\nhouse; but being bound to respect the will of the testatrix, I have\nthe honor, monsieur, to beg that you will go into the garden no more.\nI myself, monsieur, since the will was read, have never set foot in the\nhouse, which, as I had the honor of informing you, is part of the estate\nof the late Madame de Merret. We have done nothing there but verify the\nnumber of doors and windows to assess the taxes I have to pay annually\nout of the funds left for that purpose by the late Madame de Merret. Ah!\nmy dear sir, her will made a great commotion in the town.'\n\n\"The good man paused to blow his nose. I respected his volubility,\nperfectly understanding that the administration of Madame de Merret's\nestate had been the most important event of his life, his reputation,\nhis glory, his Restoration. As I was forced to bid farewell to my\nbeautiful reveries and romances, I was to reject learning the truth on\nofficial authority.\n\n\"'Monsieur,' said I, 'would it be indiscreet if I were to ask you the\nreasons for such eccentricity?'\n\n\"At these words an expression, which revealed all the pleasure which\nmen feel who are accustomed to ride a hobby, overspread the lawyer's\ncountenance. He pulled up the collar of his shirt with an air, took out\nhis snuffbox, opened it, and offered me a pinch; on my refusing, he took\na large one. He was happy! A man who has no hobby does not know all\nthe good to be got out of life. A hobby is the happy medium between a\npassion and a monomania. At this moment I understood the whole bearing\nof Sterne's charming passion, and had a perfect idea of the delight with\nwhich my uncle Toby, encouraged by Trim, bestrode his hobby-horse.\n\n\"'Monsieur,' said Monsieur Regnault, 'I was head-clerk in Monsieur\nRoguin's office, in Paris. A first-rate house, which you may have heard\nmentioned? No! An unfortunate bankruptcy made it famous.--Not having\nmoney enough to purchase a practice in Paris at the price to which they\nwere run up in 1816, I came here and bought my predecessor's business.\nI had relations in Vendome; among others, a wealthy aunt, who allowed\nme to marry her daughter.--Monsieur,' he went on after a little pause,\n'three months after being licensed by the Keeper of the Seals, one\nevening, as I was going to bed--it was before my marriage--I was sent\nfor by Madame la Comtesse de Merret, to her Chateau of Merret. Her maid,\na good girl, who is now a servant in this inn, was waiting at my door\nwith the Countess' own carriage. Ah! one moment! I ought to tell you\nthat Monsieur le Comte de Merret had gone to Paris to die two months\nbefore I came here. He came to a miserable end, flinging himself into\nevery kind of dissipation. You understand?\n\n\"'On the day when he left, Madame la Comtesse had quitted la Grand\nBreteche, having dismantled it. Some people even say that she had\nburnt all the furniture, the hangings--in short, all the chattels and\nfurniture whatever used in furnishing the premises now let by the\nsaid M.--(Dear, what am I saying? I beg your pardon, I thought I was\ndictating a lease.)--In short, that she burnt everything in the meadow\nat Merret. Have you been to Merret, monsieur?--No,' said he, answering\nhimself, 'Ah, it is a very fine place.'\n\n\"'For about three months previously,' he went on, with a jerk of his\nhead, 'the Count and Countess had lived in a very eccentric way; they\nadmitted no visitors; Madame lived on the ground-floor, and Monsieur on\nthe first floor. When the Countess was left alone, she was never seen\nexcepting at church. Subsequently, at home, at the chateau, she refused\nto see the friends, whether gentlemen or ladies, who went to call on\nher. She was already very much altered when she left la Grande Breteche\nto go to Merret. That dear lady--I say dear lady, for it was she who\ngave me this diamond, but indeed I saw her but once--that kind lady was\nvery ill; she had, no doubt, given up all hope, for she died without\nchoosing to send for a doctor; indeed, many of our ladies fancied she\nwas not quite right in her head. Well, sir, my curiosity was strangely\nexcited by hearing that Madame de Merret had need of my services. Nor\nwas I the only person who took an interest in the affair. That very\nnight, though it was already late, all the town knew that I was going to\nMerret.\n\n\"'The waiting-woman replied but vaguely to the questions I asked her on\nthe way; nevertheless, she told me that her mistress had received the\nSacrament in the course of the day at the hands of the Cure of Merret,\nand seemed unlikely to live through the night. It was about eleven when\nI reached the chateau. I went up the great staircase. After crossing\nsome large, lofty, dark rooms, diabolically cold and damp, I reached the\nstate bedroom where the Countess lay. From the rumors that were current\nconcerning this lady (monsieur, I should never end if I were to repeat\nall the tales that were told about her), I had imagined her a coquette.\nImagine, then, that I had great difficulty in seeing her in the great\nbed where she was lying. To be sure, to light this enormous room, with\nold-fashioned heavy cornices, and so thick with dust that merely to see\nit was enough to make you sneeze, she had only an old Argand lamp. Ah!\nbut you have not been to Merret. Well, the bed is one of those old world\nbeds, with a high tester hung with flowered chintz. A small table stood\nby the bed, on which I saw an \"Imitation of Christ,\" which, by the\nway, I bought for my wife, as well as the lamp. There were also a deep\narmchair for her confidential maid, and two small chairs. There was no\nfire. That was all the furniture, not enough to fill ten lines in an\ninventory.\n\n\"'My dear sir, if you had seen, as I then saw, that vast room, papered\nand hung with brown, you would have felt yourself transported into a\nscene of a romance. It was icy, nay more, funereal,' and he lifted his\nhand with a theatrical gesture and paused.\n\n\"'By dint of seeking, as I approached the bed, at last I saw Madame de\nMerret, under the glimmer of the lamp, which fell on the pillows.\nHer face was as yellow as wax, and as narrow as two folded hands. The\nCountess had a lace cap showing her abundant hair, but as white as linen\nthread. She was sitting up in bed, and seemed to keep upright with\ngreat difficulty. Her large black eyes, dimmed by fever, no doubt,\nand half-dead already, hardly moved under the bony arch of her\neyebrows.--There,' he added, pointing to his own brow. 'Her forehead was\nclammy; her fleshless hands were like bones covered with soft skin;\nthe veins and muscles were perfectly visible. She must have been very\nhandsome; but at this moment I was startled into an indescribable\nemotion at the sight. Never, said those who wrapped her in her shroud,\nhad any living creature been so emaciated and lived. In short, it was\nawful to behold! Sickness so consumed that woman, that she was no more\nthan a phantom. Her lips, which were pale violet, seemed to me not to\nmove when she spoke to me.\n\n\"'Though my profession has familiarized me with such spectacles, by\ncalling me not infrequently to the bedside of the dying to record their\nlast wishes, I confess that families in tears and the agonies I have\nseen were as nothing in comparison with this lonely and silent woman in\nher vast chateau. I heard not the least sound, I did not perceive the\nmovement which the sufferer's breathing ought to have given to the\nsheets that covered her, and I stood motionless, absorbed in looking at\nher in a sort of stupor. In fancy I am there still. At last her large\neyes moved; she tried to raise her right hand, but it fell back on the\nbed, and she uttered these words, which came like a breath, for her\nvoice was no longer a voice: \"I have waited for you with the greatest\nimpatience.\" A bright flush rose to her cheeks. It was a great effort to\nher to speak.\n\n\"'\"Madame,\" I began. She signed to me to be silent. At that moment\nthe old housekeeper rose and said in my ear, \"Do not speak; Madame la\nComtesse is not in a state to bear the slightest noise, and what you say\nmight agitate her.\"\n\n\"'I sat down. A few instants after, Madame de Merret collected all her\nremaining strength to move her right hand, and slipped it, not without\ninfinite difficulty, under the bolster; she then paused a moment. With\na last effort she withdrew her hand; and when she brought out a sealed\npaper, drops of perspiration rolled from her brow. \"I place my will in\nyour hands--Oh! God! Oh!\" and that was all. She clutched a crucifix that\nlay on the bed, lifted it hastily to her lips, and died.\n\n\"'The expression of her eyes still makes me shudder as I think of it.\nShe must have suffered much! There was joy in her last glance, and it\nremained stamped on her dead eyes.\n\n\"'I brought away the will, and when it was opened I found that Madame de\nMerret had appointed me her executor. She left the whole of her property\nto the hospital at Vendome excepting a few legacies. But these were her\ninstructions as relating to la Grande Breteche: She ordered me to leave\nthe place, for fifty years counting from the day of her death, in the\nstate in which it might be at the time of her death, forbidding any one,\nwhoever he might be, to enter the apartments, prohibiting any repairs\nwhatever, and even settling a salary to pay watchmen if it were needful\nto secure the absolute fulfilment of her intentions. At the expiration\nof that term, if the will of the testatrix has been duly carried out,\nthe house is to become the property of my heirs, for, as you know, a\nnotary cannot take a bequest. Otherwise la Grande Breteche reverts to\nthe heirs-at-law, but on condition of fulfilling certain conditions\nset forth in a codicil to the will, which is not to be opened till\nthe expiration of the said term of fifty years. The will has not been\ndisputed, so----' And without finishing his sentence, the lanky notary\nlooked at me with an air of triumph; I made him quite happy by offering\nhim my congratulations.\n\n\"'Monsieur,' I said in conclusion, 'you have so vividly impressed\nme that I fancy I see the dying woman whiter than her sheets; her\nglittering eyes frighten me; I shall dream of her to-night.--But you\nmust have formed some idea as to the instructions contained in that\nextraordinary will.'\n\n\"'Monsieur,' said he, with comical reticence, 'I never allow myself\nto criticise the conduct of a person who honors me with the gift of a\ndiamond.'\n\n\"However, I soon loosened the tongue of the discreet notary of Vendome,\nwho communicated to me, not without long digressions, the opinions of\nthe deep politicians of both sexes whose judgments are law in Vendome.\nBut these opinions were so contradictory, so diffuse, that I was\nnear falling asleep in spite of the interest I felt in this authentic\nhistory. The notary's ponderous voice and monotonous accent, accustomed\nno doubt to listen to himself and to make himself listened to by his\nclients or fellow-townsmen, were too much for my curiosity. Happily, he\nsoon went away.\n\n\"'Ah, ha, monsieur,' said he on the stairs, 'a good many persons would\nbe glad to live five-and-forty years longer; but--one moment!' and he\nlaid the first finger of his right hand to his nostril with a cunning\nlook, as much as to say, 'Mark my words!--To last as long as that--as\nlong as that,' said he, 'you must not be past sixty now.'\n\n\"I closed my door, having been roused from my apathy by this last\nspeech, which the notary thought very funny; then I sat down in my\narmchair, with my feet on the fire-dogs. I had lost myself in a romance\n_a la_ Radcliffe, constructed on the juridical base given me by Monsieur\nRegnault, when the door, opened by a woman's cautious hand, turned on\nthe hinges. I saw my landlady come in, a buxom, florid dame, always\ngood-humored, who had missed her calling in life. She was a Fleming, who\nought to have seen the light in a picture by Teniers.\n\n\"'Well, monsieur,' said she, 'Monsieur Regnault has no doubt been giving\nyou his history of la Grande Breteche?'\n\n\"'Yes, Madame Lepas.'\n\n\"'And what did he tell you?'\n\n\"I repeated in a few words the creepy and sinister story of Madame de\nMerret. At each sentence my hostess put her head forward, looking at\nme with an innkeeper's keen scrutiny, a happy compromise between the\ninstinct of a police constable, the astuteness of a spy, and the cunning\nof a dealer.\n\n\"'My good Madame Lepas,' said I as I ended, 'you seem to know more about\nit. Heh? If not, why have you come up to me?'\n\n\"'On my word, as an honest woman----'\n\n\"'Do not swear; your eyes are big with a secret. You knew Monsieur de\nMerret; what sort of man was he?'\n\n\"'Monsieur de Merret--well, you see he was a man you never could see\nthe top of, he was so tall! A very good gentleman, from Picardy, and who\nhad, as we say, his head close to his cap. He paid for everything down,\nso as never to have difficulties with any one. He was hot-tempered, you\nsee! All our ladies liked him very much.'\n\n\"'Because he was hot-tempered?' I asked her.\n\n\"'Well, may be,' said she; 'and you may suppose, sir, that a man had to\nhave something to show for a figurehead before he could marry Madame de\nMerret, who, without any reflection on others, was the handsomest and\nrichest heiress in our parts. She had about twenty thousand francs\na year. All the town was at the wedding; the bride was pretty and\nsweet-looking, quite a gem of a woman. Oh, they were a handsome couple\nin their day!'\n\n\"'And were they happy together?'\n\n\"'Hm, hm! so-so--so far as can be guessed, for, as you may suppose, we\nof the common sort were not hail-fellow-well-met with them.--Madame de\nMerret was a kind woman and very pleasant, who had no doubt sometimes to\nput up with her husband's tantrums. But though he was rather haughty, we\nwere fond of him. After all, it was his place to behave so. When a man\nis a born nobleman, you see----'\n\n\"'Still, there must have been some catastrophe for Monsieur and Madame\nde Merret to part so violently?'\n\n\"'I did not say there was any catastrophe, sir. I know nothing about\nit.'\n\n\"'Indeed. Well, now, I am sure you know everything.'\n\n\"'Well, sir, I will tell you the whole story.--When I saw Monsieur\nRegnault go up to see you, it struck me that he would speak to you about\nMadame de Merret as having to do with la Grande Breteche. That put it\ninto my head to ask your advice, sir, seeming to me that you are a\nman of good judgment and incapable of playing a poor woman like me\nfalse--for I never did any one a wrong, and yet I am tormented by my\nconscience. Up to now I have never dared to say a word to the people of\nthese parts; they are all chatter-mags, with tongues like knives. And\nnever till now, sir, have I had any traveler here who stayed so long in\nthe inn as you have, and to whom I could tell the history of the fifteen\nthousand francs----'\n\n\"'My dear Madame Lepas, if there is anything in your story of a nature\nto compromise me,' I said, interrupting the flow of her words, 'I would\nnot hear it for all the world.'\n\n\"'You need have no fears,' said she; 'you will see.'\n\n\"Her eagerness made me suspect that I was not the only person to whom\nmy worthy landlady had communicated the secret of which I was to be the\nsole possessor, but I listened.\n\n\"'Monsieur,' said she, 'when the Emperor sent the Spaniards here,\nprisoners of war and others, I was required to lodge at the charge\nof the Government a young Spaniard sent to Vendome on parole.\nNotwithstanding his parole, he had to show himself every day to the\nsub-prefect. He was a Spanish grandee--neither more nor less. He had\na name in _os_ and _dia_, something like Bagos de Feredia. I wrote his\nname down in my books, and you may see it if you like. Ah! he was a\nhandsome young fellow for a Spaniard, who are all ugly they say. He was\nnot more than five feet two or three in height, but so well made; and he\nhad little hands that he kept so beautifully! Ah! you should have\nseen them. He had as many brushes for his hands as a woman has for her\ntoilet. He had thick, black hair, a flame in his eye, a somewhat coppery\ncomplexion, but which I admired all the same. He wore the finest linen\nI have ever seen, though I have had princesses to lodge here, and, among\nothers, General Bertrand, the Duc and Duchesse d'Abrantes, Monsieur\nDescazes, and the King of Spain. He did not eat much, but he had such\npolite and amiable ways that it was impossible to owe him a grudge for\nthat. Oh! I was very fond of him, though he did not say four words to me\nin a day, and it was impossible to have the least bit of talk with him;\nif he was spoken to, he did not answer; it is a way, a mania they all\nhave, it would seem.\n\n\"'He read his breviary like a priest, and went to mass and all the\nservices quite regularly. And where did he post himself?--we found this\nout later.--Within two yards of Madame de Merret's chapel. As he took\nthat place the very first time he entered the church, no one imagined\nthat there was any purpose in it. Besides, he never raised his nose\nabove his book, poor young man! And then, monsieur, of an evening he\nwent for a walk on the hill among the ruins of the old castle. It was\nhis only amusement, poor man; it reminded him of his native land. They\nsay that Spain is all hills!\n\n\"'One evening, a few days after he was sent here, he was out very late.\nI was rather uneasy when he did not come in till just on the stroke of\nmidnight; but we all got used to his whims; he took the key of the door,\nand we never sat up for him. He lived in a house belonging to us in the\nRue des Casernes. Well, then, one of our stable-boys told us one evening\nthat, going down to wash the horses in the river, he fancied he had seen\nthe Spanish Grandee swimming some little way off, just like a fish. When\nhe came in, I told him to be careful of the weeds, and he seemed put out\nat having been seen in the water.\n\n\"'At last, monsieur, one day, or rather one morning, we did not find\nhim in his room; he had not come back. By hunting through his things, I\nfound a written paper in the drawer of his table, with fifty pieces of\nSpanish gold of the kind they call doubloons, worth about five thousand\nfrancs; and in a little sealed box ten thousand francs worth of\ndiamonds. The paper said that in case he should not return, he left us\nthis money and these diamonds in trust to found masses to thank God for\nhis escape and for his salvation.\n\n\"'At that time I still had my husband, who ran off in search of him.\nAnd this is the queer part of the story: he brought back the Spaniard's\nclothes, which he had found under a big stone on a sort of breakwater\nalong the river bank, nearly opposite la Grande Breteche. My husband\nwent so early that no one saw him. After reading the letter, he burnt\nthe clothes, and, in obedience to Count Feredia's wish, we announced\nthat he had escaped.\n\n\"'The sub-prefect set all the constabulary at his heels; but, pshaw! he\nwas never caught. Lepas believed that the Spaniard had drowned himself.\nI, sir, have never thought so; I believe, on the contrary, that he had\nsomething to do with the business about Madame de Merret, seeing that\nRosalie told me that the crucifix her mistress was so fond of that she\nhad it buried with her, was made of ebony and silver; now in the early\ndays of his stay here, Monsieur Feredia had one of ebony and silver\nwhich I never saw later.--And now, monsieur, do not you say that I need\nhave no remorse about the Spaniard's fifteen thousand francs? Are they\nnot really and truly mine?'\n\n\"'Certainly.--But have you never tried to question Rosalie?' said I.\n\n\"'Oh, to be sure I have, sir. But what is to be done? That girl is like\na wall. She knows something, but it is impossible to make her talk.'\n\n\"After chatting with me for a few minutes, my hostess left me a prey\nto vague and sinister thoughts, to romantic curiosity, and a religious\ndread, not unlike the deep emotion which comes upon us when we go into a\ndark church at night and discern a feeble light glimmering under a lofty\nvault--a dim figure glides across--the sweep of a gown or of a priest's\ncassock is audible--and we shiver! La Grande Breteche, with its rank\ngrasses, its shuttered windows, its rusty iron-work, its locked doors,\nits deserted rooms, suddenly rose before me in fantastic vividness. I\ntried to get into the mysterious dwelling to search out the heart of\nthis solemn story, this drama which had killed three persons.\n\n\"Rosalie became in my eyes the most interesting being in Vendome. As\nI studied her, I detected signs of an inmost thought, in spite of the\nblooming health that glowed in her dimpled face. There was in her soul\nsome element of ruth or of hope; her manner suggested a secret, like\nthe expression of devout souls who pray in excess, or of a girl who has\nkilled her child and for ever hears its last cry. Nevertheless, she was\nsimple and clumsy in her ways; her vacant smile had nothing criminal\nin it, and you would have pronounced her innocent only from seeing the\nlarge red and blue checked kerchief that covered her stalwart bust,\ntucked into the tight-laced bodice of a lilac- and white-striped gown.\n'No,' said I to myself, 'I will not quit Vendome without knowing the\nwhole history of la Grande Breteche. To achieve this end, I will make\nlove to Rosalie if it proves necessary.'\n\n\"'Rosalie!' said I one evening.\n\n\"'Your servant, sir?'\n\n\"'You are not married?' She started a little.\n\n\"'Oh! there is no lack of men if ever I take a fancy to be miserable!'\nshe replied, laughing. She got over her agitation at once; for every\nwoman, from the highest lady to the inn-servant inclusive, has a native\npresence of mind.\n\n\"'Yes; you are fresh and good-looking enough never to lack lovers! But\ntell me, Rosalie, why did you become an inn-servant on leaving Madame de\nMerret? Did she not leave you some little annuity?'\n\n\"'Oh yes, sir. But my place here is the best in all the town of\nVendome.'\n\n\"This reply was such an one as judges and attorneys call evasive.\nRosalie, as it seemed to me, held in this romantic affair the place of\nthe middle square of the chess-board: she was at the very centre of the\ninterest and of the truth; she appeared to me to be tied into the knot\nof it. It was not a case for ordinary love-making; this girl contained\nthe last chapter of a romance, and from that moment all my attentions\nwere devoted to Rosalie. By dint of studying the girl, I observed in\nher, as in every woman whom we make our ruling thought, a variety of\ngood qualities; she was clean and neat; she was handsome, I need not\nsay; she soon was possessed of every charm that desire can lend to a\nwoman in whatever rank of life. A fortnight after the notary's visit,\none evening, or rather one morning, in the small hours, I said to\nRosalie:\n\n\"'Come, tell me all you know about Madame de Merret.'\n\n\"'Oh!' she said, 'I will tell you; but keep the secret carefully.'\n\n\"'All right, my child; I will keep all your secrets with a thief's\nhonor, which is the most loyal known.'\n\n\"'If it is all the same to you,' said she, 'I would rather it should be\nwith your own.'\n\n\"Thereupon she set her head-kerchief straight, and settled herself to\ntell the tale; for there is no doubt a particular attitude of confidence\nand security is necessary to the telling of a narrative. The best tales\nare told at a certain hour--just as we are all here at table. No one\never told a story well standing up, or fasting.\n\n\"If I were to reproduce exactly Rosalie's diffuse eloquence, a whole\nvolume would scarcely contain it. Now, as the event of which she gave me\na confused account stands exactly midway between the notary's gossip and\nthat of Madame Lepas, as precisely as the middle term of a rule-of-three\nsum stands between the first and third, I have only to relate it in as\nfew words as may be. I shall therefore be brief.\n\n\"The room at la Grande Breteche in which Madame de Merret slept was on\nthe ground floor; a little cupboard in the wall, about four feet deep,\nserved her to hang her dresses in. Three months before the evening of\nwhich I have to relate the events, Madame de Merret had been seriously\nailing, so much so that her husband had left her to herself, and had his\nown bedroom on the first floor. By one of those accidents which it is\nimpossible to foresee, he came in that evening two hours later than\nusual from the club, where he went to read the papers and talk politics\nwith the residents in the neighborhood. His wife supposed him to have\ncome in, to be in bed and asleep. But the invasion of France had been\nthe subject of a very animated discussion; the game of billiards had\nwaxed vehement; he had lost forty francs, an enormous sum at Vendome,\nwhere everybody is thrifty, and where social habits are restrained\nwithin the bounds of a simplicity worthy of all praise, and the\nfoundation perhaps of a form of true happiness which no Parisian would\ncare for.\n\n\"For some time past Monsieur de Merret had been satisfied to ask Rosalie\nwhether his wife was in bed; on the girl's replying always in the\naffirmative, he at once went to his own room, with the good faith that\ncomes of habit and confidence. But this evening, on coming in, he took\nit into his head to go to see Madame de Merret, to tell her of his\nill-luck, and perhaps to find consolation. During dinner he had observed\nthat his wife was very becomingly dressed; he reflected as he came\nhome from the club that his wife was certainly much better, that\nconvalescence had improved her beauty, discovering it, as husbands\ndiscover everything, a little too late. Instead of calling Rosalie,\nwho was in the kitchen at the moment watching the cook and the coachman\nplaying a puzzling hand at cards, Monsieur de Merret made his way to his\nwife's room by the light of his lantern, which he set down at the lowest\nstep of the stairs. His step, easy to recognize, rang under the vaulted\npassage.\n\n\"At the instant when the gentleman turned the key to enter his wife's\nroom, he fancied he heard the door shut of the closet of which I have\nspoken; but when he went in, Madame de Merret was alone, standing in\nfront of the fireplace. The unsuspecting husband fancied that Rosalie\nwas in the cupboard; nevertheless, a doubt, ringing in his ears like a\npeal of bells, put him on his guard; he looked at his wife, and read in\nher eyes an indescribably anxious and haunted expression.\n\n\"'You are very late,' said she.--Her voice, usually so clear and sweet,\nstruck him as being slightly husky.\n\n\"Monsieur de Merret made no reply, for at this moment Rosalie came in.\nThis was like a thunder-clap. He walked up and down the room, going from\none window to another at a regular pace, his arms folded.\n\n\"'Have you had bad news, or are you ill?' his wife asked him timidly,\nwhile Rosalie helped her to undress. He made no reply.\n\n\"'You can go, Rosalie,' said Madame de Merret to her maid; 'I can put in\nmy curl-papers myself.'--She scented disaster at the mere aspect of her\nhusband's face, and wished to be alone with him. As soon as Rosalie\nwas gone, or supposed to be gone, for she lingered a few minutes in the\npassage, Monsieur de Merret came and stood facing his wife, and said\ncoldly, 'Madame, there is some one in your cupboard!' She looked at her\nhusband calmly, and replied quite simply, 'No, monsieur.'\n\n\"This 'No' wrung Monsieur de Merret's heart; he did not believe it; and\nyet his wife had never appeared purer or more saintly than she seemed\nto be at this moment. He rose to go and open the closet door. Madame de\nMerret took his hand, stopped him, looked at him sadly, and said in a\nvoice of strange emotion, 'Remember, if you should find no one there,\neverything must be at an end between you and me.'\n\n\"The extraordinary dignity of his wife's attitude filled him with deep\nesteem for her, and inspired him with one of those resolves which need\nonly a grander stage to become immortal.\n\n\"'No, Josephine,' he said, 'I will not open it. In either event we\nshould be parted for ever. Listen; I know all the purity of your soul, I\nknow you lead a saintly life, and would not commit a deadly sin to save\nyour life.'--At these words Madame de Merret looked at her husband with\na haggard stare.--'See, here is your crucifix,' he went on. 'Swear to\nme before God that there is no one in there; I will believe you--I will\nnever open that door.'\n\n\"Madame de Merret took up the crucifix and said, 'I swear it.'\n\n\"'Louder,' said her husband; 'and repeat: \"I swear before God that there\nis nobody in that closet.\"' She repeated the words without flinching.\n\n\"'That will do,' said Monsieur de Merret coldly. After a moment's\nsilence: 'You have there a fine piece of work which I never saw before,'\nsaid he, examining the crucifix of ebony and silver, very artistically\nwrought.\n\n\"'I found it at Duvivier's; last year when that troop of Spanish\nprisoners came through Vendome, he bought it of a Spanish monk.'\n\n\"'Indeed,' said Monsieur de Merret, hanging the crucifix on its nail;\nand he rang the bell.\n\n\"He had to wait for Rosalie. Monsieur de Merret went forward quickly\nto meet her, led her into the bay of the window that looked on to the\ngarden, and said to her in an undertone:\n\n\"'I know that Gorenflot wants to marry you, that poverty alone prevents\nyour setting up house, and that you told him you would not be his wife\ntill he found means to become a master mason.--Well, go and fetch him;\ntell him to come here with his trowel and tools. Contrive to wake no one\nin his house but himself. His reward will be beyond your wishes. Above\nall, go out without saying a word--or else!' and he frowned.\n\n\"Rosalie was going, and he called her back. 'Here, take my latch-key,'\nsaid he.\n\n\"'Jean!' Monsieur de Merret called in a voice of thunder down the\npassage. Jean, who was both coachman and confidential servant, left his\ncards and came.\n\n\"'Go to bed, all of you,' said his master, beckoning him to come close;\nand the gentleman added in a whisper, 'When they are all asleep--mind,\n_asleep_--you understand?--come down and tell me.'\n\n\"Monsieur de Merret, who had never lost sight of his wife while giving\nhis orders, quietly came back to her at the fireside, and began to tell\nher the details of the game of billiards and the discussion at the club.\nWhen Rosalie returned she found Monsieur and Madame de Merret conversing\namiably.\n\n\"Not long before this Monsieur de Merret had had new ceilings made to\nall the reception-rooms on the ground floor. Plaster is very scarce at\nVendome; the price is enhanced by the cost of carriage; the gentleman\nhad therefore had a considerable quantity delivered to him, knowing\nthat he could always find purchasers for what might be left. It was this\ncircumstance which suggested the plan he carried out.\n\n\"'Gorenflot is here, sir,' said Rosalie in a whisper.\n\n\"'Tell him to come in,' said her master aloud.\n\n\"Madame de Merret turned paler when she saw the mason.\n\n\"'Gorenflot,' said her husband, 'go and fetch some bricks from the\ncoach-house; bring enough to wall up the door of this cupboard; you can\nuse the plaster that is left for cement.' Then, dragging Rosalie and the\nworkman close to him--'Listen, Gorenflot,' said he, in a low voice,\n'you are to sleep here to-night; but to-morrow morning you shall have a\npassport to take you abroad to a place I will tell you of. I will give\nyou six thousand francs for your journey. You must live in that town for\nten years; if you find you do not like it, you may settle in another,\nbut it must be in the same country. Go through Paris and wait there till\nI join you. I will there give you an agreement for six thousand francs\nmore, to be paid to you on your return, provided you have carried out\nthe conditions of the bargain. For that price you are to keep perfect\nsilence as to what you have to do this night. To you, Rosalie, I will\nsecure ten thousand francs, which will not be paid to you till your\nwedding day, and on condition of your marrying Gorenflot; but, to get\nmarried, you must hold your tongue. If not, no wedding gift!'\n\n\"'Rosalie,' said Madame de Merret, 'come and brush my hair.'\n\n\"Her husband quietly walked up and down the room, keeping an eye on the\ndoor, on the mason, and on his wife, but without any insulting display\nof suspicion. Gorenflot could not help making some noise. Madame de\nMerret seized a moment when he was unloading some bricks, and when her\nhusband was at the other end of the room to say to Rosalie: 'My dear\nchild, I will give you a thousand francs a year if only you will tell\nGorenflot to leave a crack at the bottom.' Then she added aloud quite\ncoolly: 'You had better help him.'\n\n\"Monsieur and Madame de Merret were silent all the time while Gorenflot\nwas walling up the door. This silence was intentional on the husband's\npart; he did not wish to give his wife the opportunity of saying\nanything with a double meaning. On Madame de Merret's side it was pride\nor prudence. When the wall was half built up the cunning mason took\nadvantage of his master's back being turned to break one of the two\npanes in the top of the door with a blow of his pick. By this Madame de\nMerret understood that Rosalie had spoken to Gorenflot. They all three\nthen saw the face of a dark, gloomy-looking man, with black hair and\nflaming eyes.\n\n\"Before her husband turned round again the poor woman had nodded to the\nstranger, to whom the signal was meant to convey, 'Hope.'\n\n\"At four o'clock, as the day was dawning, for it was the month of\nSeptember, the work was done. The mason was placed in charge of Jean,\nand Monsieur de Merret slept in his wife's room.\n\n\"Next morning when he got up he said with apparent carelessness, 'Oh,\nby the way, I must go to the Maire for the passport.' He put on his hat,\ntook two or three steps towards the door, paused, and took the crucifix.\nHis wife was trembling with joy.\n\n\"'He will go to Duvivier's,' thought she.\n\n\"As soon as he had left, Madame de Merret rang for Rosalie, and then in\na terrible voice she cried: 'The pick! Bring the pick! and set to work.\nI saw how Gorenflot did it yesterday; we shall have time to make a gap\nand build it up again.'\n\n\"In an instant Rosalie had brought her mistress a sort of cleaver; she,\nwith a vehemence of which no words can give an idea, set to work to\ndemolish the wall. She had already got out a few bricks, when, turning\nto deal a stronger blow than before, she saw behind her Monsieur de\nMerret. She fainted away.\n\n\"'Lay madame on her bed,' said he coldly.\n\n\"Foreseeing what would certainly happen in his absence, he had laid\nthis trap for his wife; he had merely written to the Maire and sent for\nDuvivier. The jeweler arrived just as the disorder in the room had been\nrepaired.\n\n\"'Duvivier,' asked Monsieur de Merret, 'did not you buy some crucifixes\nof the Spaniards who passed through the town?'\n\n\"'No, monsieur.'\n\n\"'Very good; thank you,' said he, flashing a tiger's glare at his wife.\n'Jean,' he added, turning to his confidential valet, 'you can serve my\nmeals here in Madame de Merret's room. She is ill, and I shall not leave\nher till she recovers.'\n\n\"The cruel man remained in his wife's room for twenty days. During\nthe earlier time, when there was some little noise in the closet,\nand Josephine wanted to intercede for the dying man, he said, without\nallowing her to utter a word, 'You swore on the Cross that there was no\none there.'\"\n\n\nAfter this story all the ladies rose from table, and thus the spell\nunder which Bianchon had held them was broken. But there were some among\nthem who had almost shivered at the last words.\n\n\n\n\nADDENDUM\n\nThe following personage appears in other stories of the Human Comedy.\n\n     Bianchon, Horace\n       Father Goriot\n       The Atheist's Mass\n       Cesar Birotteau\n       The Commission in Lunacy\n       Lost Illusions\n       A Distinguished Provincial at Paris\n       A Bachelor's Establishment\n       The Secrets of a Princess\n       The Government Clerks\n       Pierrette\n       A Study of Woman\n       Scenes from a Courtesan's Life\n       Honorine\n       The Seamy Side of History\n       The Magic Skin\n       A Second Home\n       A Prince of Bohemia\n       Letters of Two Brides\n       The Muse of the Department\n       The Imaginary Mistress\n       The Middle Classes\n       Cousin Betty\n       The Country Parson\n\n     In addition, M.

Since\n1830, the true Salon no longer exists. The Louvre has again been taken\nby assault,--this time by a populace of artists who have maintained\nthemselves in it.\n\nIn other days, when the Salon presented only the choicest works of art,\nit conferred the highest honor on the creations there exhibited. Among\nthe two hundred selected paintings, the public could still choose: a\ncrown was awarded to the masterpiece by hands unseen. Eager, impassioned\ndiscussions arose about some picture. The abuse showered on Delacroix,\non Ingres, contributed no less to their fame than the praises and\nfanaticism of their adherents. To-day, neither the crowd nor the\ncriticism grows impassioned about the products of that bazaar. Forced to\nmake the selection for itself, which in former days the examining\njury made for it, the attention of the public is soon wearied and the\nexhibition closes. Before the year 1817 the pictures admitted never went\nbeyond the first two columns of the long gallery of the old masters; but\nin that year, to the great astonishment of the public, they filled the\nwhole space. Historical, high-art, genre paintings, easel pictures,\nlandscapes, flowers, animals, and water-colors,--these eight specialties\ncould surely not offer more than twenty pictures in one year worthy of\nthe eyes of the public, which, indeed, cannot give its attention to a\ngreater number of such works. The more the number of artists increases,\nthe more careful and exacting the jury of admission ought to be.\n\nThe true character of the Salon was lost as soon as it spread along\nthe galleries. The Salon should have remained within fixed limits of\ninflexible proportions, where each distinct specialty could show its\nmasterpieces only. An experience of ten years has shown the excellence\nof the former institution. Now, instead of a tournament, we have a mob;\ninstead of a noble exhibition, we have a tumultuous bazaar; instead of\na choice selection we have a chaotic mass. What is the result? A great\nartist is swamped. Decamps' \"Turkish Cafe,\" \"Children at a Fountain,\"\n\"Joseph,\" and \"The Torture,\" would have redounded far more to his credit\nif the four pictures had been exhibited in the great Salon with the\nhundred good pictures of that year, than his twenty pictures could,\namong three thousand others, jumbled together in six galleries.\n\nBy some strange contradiction, ever since the doors are open to every\none there has been much talk of unknown and unrecognized genius. When,\ntwelve years earlier, Ingres' \"Courtesan,\" and that of Sigalon, the\n\"Medusa\" of Gericault, the \"Massacre of Scio\" by Delacroix, the \"Baptism\nof Henri IV.\" by Eugene Deveria, admitted by celebrated artists accused\nof jealousy, showed the world, in spite of the denials of criticism,\nthat young and vigorous palettes existed, no such complaint was made.\nNow, when the veriest dauber of canvas can send in his work, the whole\ntalk is of genius neglected! Where judgment no longer exists, there is\nno longer anything judged. But whatever artists may be doing now, they\nwill come back in time to the examination and selection which presents\ntheir works to the admiration of the crowd for whom they work. Without\nselection by the Academy there will be no Salon, and without the Salon\nart may perish.\n\nEver since the catalogue has grown into a book, many names have appeared\nin it which still remain in their native obscurity, in spite of the ten\nor a dozen pictures attached to them. Among these names perhaps the most\nunknown to fame is that of an artist named Pierre Grassou, coming from\nFougeres, and called simply \"Fougeres\" among his brother-artists, who,\nat the present moment holds a place, as the saying is, \"in the sun,\" and\nwho suggested the rather bitter reflections by which this sketch of\nhis life is introduced,--reflections that are applicable to many other\nindividuals of the tribe of artists.\n\nIn 1832, Fougeres lived in the rue de Navarin, on the fourth floor of\none of those tall, narrow houses which resemble the obelisk of Luxor,\nand possess an alley, a dark little stairway with dangerous turnings,\nthree windows only on each floor, and, within the building, a courtyard,\nor, to speak more correctly, a square pit or well. Above the three or\nfour rooms occupied by Grassou of Fougeres was his studio, looking over\nto Montmartre. This studio was painted in brick-color, for a background;\nthe floor was tinted brown and well frotted; each chair was furnished\nwith a bit of carpet bound round the edges; the sofa, simple enough, was\nclean as that in the bedroom of some worthy bourgeoise. All these things\ndenoted the tidy ways of a small mind and the thrift of a poor man. A\nbureau was there, in which to put away the studio implements, a table\nfor breakfast, a sideboard, a secretary; in short, all the articles\nnecessary to a painter, neatly arranged and very clean. The stove\nparticipated in this Dutch cleanliness, which was all the more visible\nbecause the pure and little changing light from the north flooded with\nits cold clear beams the vast apartment. Fougeres, being merely a genre\npainter, does not need the immense machinery and outfit which ruin\nhistorical painters; he has never recognized within himself sufficient\nfaculty to attempt high-art, and he therefore clings to easel painting.\n\nAt the beginning of the month of December of that year, a season at\nwhich the bourgeois of Paris conceive, periodically, the burlesque idea\nof perpetuating their forms and figures already too bulky in themselves,\nPierre Grassou, who had risen early, prepared his palette, and lighted\nhis stove, was eating a roll steeped in milk, and waiting till the frost\non his windows had melted sufficiently to let the full light in. The\nweather was fine and dry. At this moment the artist, who ate his bread\nwith that patient, resigned air that tells so much, heard and recognized\nthe step of a man who had upon his life the influence such men have\non the lives of nearly all artists,--the step of Elie Magus, a\npicture-dealer, a usurer in canvas. The next moment Elie Magus entered\nand found the painter in the act of beginning his work in the tidy\nstudio.\n\n\"How are you, old rascal?\" said the painter.\n\nFougeres had the cross of the Legion of honor, and Elie Magus bought his\npictures at two and three hundred francs apiece, so he gave himself the\nairs of a fine artist.\n\n\"Business is very bad,\" replied Elie. \"You artists have such\npretensions! You talk of two hundred francs when you haven't put six\nsous' worth of color on a canvas. However, you are a good fellow, I'll\nsay that. You are steady; and I've come to put a good bit of business in\nyour way.\"\n\n\"Timeo Danaos et dona ferentes,\" said Fougeres. \"Do you know Latin?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Well, it means that the Greeks never proposed a good bit of business\nto the Trojans without getting their fair share of it. In the olden time\nthey used to say, 'Take my horse.' Now we say, 'Take my bear.' Well,\nwhat do you want, Ulysses-Lagingeole-Elie Magus?\"\n\nThese words will give an idea of the mildness and wit with which\nFougeres employed what painters call studio fun.\n\n\"Well, I don't deny that you are to paint me two pictures for nothing.\"\n\n\"Oh! oh!\"\n\n\"I'll leave you to do it, or not; I don't ask it. But you're an honest\nman.\"\n\n\"Come, out with it!\"\n\n\"Well, I'm prepared to bring you a father, mother, and only daughter.\"\n\n\"All for me?\"\n\n\"Yes--they want their portraits taken. These bourgeois--they are crazy\nabout art--have never dared to enter a studio. The girl has a 'dot' of a\nhundred thousand francs. You can paint all three,--perhaps they'll turn\nout family portraits.\"\n\nAnd with that the old Dutch log of wood who passed for a man and who was\ncalled Elie Magus, interrupted himself to laugh an uncanny laugh which\nfrightened the painter. He fancied he heard Mephistopheles talking\nmarriage.\n\n\"Portraits bring five hundred francs apiece,\" went on Elie; \"so you can\nvery well afford to paint me three pictures.\"\n\n\"True for you!\" cried Fougeres, gleefully.\n\n\"And if you marry the girl, you won't forget me.\"\n\n\"Marry! I?\" cried Pierre Grassou,--\"I, who have a habit of sleeping\nalone; and get up at cock-crow, and all my life arranged--\"\n\n\"One hundred thousand francs,\" said Magus, \"and a quiet girl, full of\ngolden tones, as you call 'em, like a Titian.\"\n\n\"What class of people are they?\"\n\n\"Retired merchants; just now in love with art; have a country-house at\nVille d'Avray, and ten or twelve thousand francs a year.\"\n\n\"What business did they do?\"\n\n\"Bottles.\"\n\n\"Now don't say that word; it makes me think of corks and sets my teeth\non edge.\"\n\n\"Am I to bring them?\"\n\n\"Three portraits--I could put them in the Salon; I might go in for\nportrait-painting. Well, yes!\"\n\nOld Elie descended the staircase to go in search of the Vervelle family.\nTo know to what extend this proposition would act upon the painter, and\nwhat effect would be produced upon him by the Sieur and Dame Vervelle,\nadorned by their only daughter, it is necessary to cast an eye on the\nanterior life of Pierre Grassou of Fougeres.\n\nWhen a pupil, Fougeres had studied drawing with Servin, who was\nthought a great draughtsman in academic circles. After that he went to\nSchinner's, to learn the secrets of the powerful and magnificent color\nwhich distinguishes that master. Master and scholars were all discreet;\nat any rate Pierre discovered none of their secrets. From there he went\nto Sommervieux' atelier, to acquire that portion of the art of painting\nwhich is called composition, but composition was shy and distant to him.\nThen he tried to snatch from Decamps and Granet the mystery of their\ninterior effects. The two masters were not robbed. Finally Fougeres\nended his education with Duval-Lecamus. During these studied and\nthese different transformations Fougeres' habits and ways of life were\ntranquil and moral to a degree that furnished matter of jesting to the\nvarious ateliers where he sojourned; but everywhere he disarmed his\ncomrades by his modesty and by the patience and gentleness of a lamblike\nnature. The masters, however, had no sympathy for the good lad; masters\nprefer bright fellows, eccentric spirits, droll or fiery, or else gloomy\nand deeply reflective, which argue future talent. Everything about\nPierre Grassou smacked of mediocrity. His nickname \"Fougeres\" (that\nof the painter in the play of \"The Eglantine\") was the source of much\nteasing; but, by force of circumstances, he accepted the name of the\ntown in which he had first seen light.\n\nGrassou of Fougeres resembled his name. Plump and of medium height, he\nhad a dull complexion, brown eyes, black hair, a turned-up nose, rather\nwide mouth, and long ears. His gentle, passive, and resigned air gave a\ncertain relief to these leading features of a physiognomy that was full\nof health, but wanting in action. This young man, born to be a virtuous\nbourgeois, having left his native place and come to Paris to be clerk\nwith a color-merchant (formerly of Mayenne and a distant connection of\nthe Orgemonts) made himself a painter simply by the fact of an obstinacy\nwhich constitutes the Breton character. What he suffered, the manner in\nwhich he lived during those years of study, God only knows. He suffered\nas much as great men suffer when they are hounded by poverty and hunted\nlike wild beasts by the pack of commonplace minds and by troops of\nvanities athirst for vengeance.\n\nAs soon as he thought himself able to fly on his own wings, Fougeres\ntook a studio in the upper part of the rue des Martyrs, where he began\nto delve his way. He made his first appearance in 1819. The first\npicture he presented to the jury of the Exhibition at the Louvre\nrepresented a village wedding rather laboriously copied from Greuze's\npicture. It was rejected. When Fougeres heard of the fatal decision,\nhe did not fall into one of those fits of epileptic self-love to which\nstrong natures give themselves up, and which sometimes end in challenges\nsent to the director or the secretary of the Museum, or even by threats\nof assassination. Fougeres quietly fetched his canvas, wrapped it in\na handkerchief, and brought it home, vowing in his heart that he would\nstill make himself a great painter. He placed his picture on the easel,\nand went to one of his former masters, a man of immense talent,--to\nSchinner, a kind and patient artist, whose triumph at that year's Salon\nwas complete. Fougeres asked him to come and criticise the rejected\nwork. The great painter left everything and went at once. When poor\nFougeres had placed the work before him Schinner, after a glance,\npressed Fougeres' hand.\n\n\"You are a fine fellow,\" he said; \"you've a heart of gold, and I must\nnot deceive you. Listen; you are fulfilling all the promises you made in\nthe studios. When you find such things as that at the tip of your brush,\nmy good Fougeres, you had better leave colors with Brullon, and not take\nthe canvas of others. Go home early, put on your cotton night-cap, and\nbe in bed by nine o'clock. The next morning early go to some government\noffice, ask for a place, and give up art.\"\n\n\"My dear friend,\" said Fougeres, \"my picture is already condemned; it is\nnot a verdict that I want of you, but the cause of that verdict.\"\n\n\"Well--you paint gray and sombre; you see nature being a crape veil;\nyour drawing is heavy, pasty; your composition is a medley of Greuze,\nwho only redeemed his defects by the qualities which you lack.\"\n\nWhile detailing these faults of the picture Schinner saw on Fougeres'\nface so deep an expression of sadness that he carried him off to dinner\nand tried to console him. The next morning at seven o'clock Fougeres was\nat his easel working over the rejected picture; he warmed the colors; he\nmade the corrections suggested by Schinner, he touched up his figures.\nThen, disgusted with such patching, he carried the picture to Elie\nMagus. Elie Magus, a sort of Dutch-Flemish-Belgian, had three reasons\nfor being what he became,--rich and avaricious. Coming last from\nBordeaux, he was just starting in Paris, selling old pictures and living\non the boulevard Bonne-Nouvelle. Fougeres, who relied on his palette\nto go to the baker's, bravely ate bread and nuts, or bread and milk, or\nbread and cherries, or bread and cheese, according to the seasons. Elie\nMagus, to whom Pierre offered his first picture, eyed it for some time\nand then gave him fifteen francs.\n\n\"With fifteen francs a year coming in, and a thousand francs for\nexpenses,\" said Fougeres, smiling, \"a man will go fast and far.\"\n\nElie Magus made a gesture; he bit his thumbs, thinking that he might\nhave had that picture for five francs.\n\nFor several days Pierre walked down from the rue des Martyrs and\nstationed himself at the corner of the boulevard opposite to Elie's\nshop, whence his eye could rest upon his picture, which did not obtain\nany notice from the eyes of the passers along the street. At the end of\na week the picture disappeared; Fougeres walked slowly up and approached\nthe dealer's shop in a lounging manner. The Jew was at his door.\n\n\"Well, I see you have sold my picture.\"\n\n\"No, here it is,\" said Magus; \"I've framed it, to show it to some one\nwho fancies he knows about painting.\"\n\nFougeres had not the heart to return to the boulevard. He set about\nanother picture, and spent two months upon it,--eating mouse's meals and\nworking like a galley-slave.\n\nOne evening he went to the boulevard, his feet leading him fatefully to\nthe dealer's shop. His picture was not to be seen.\n\n\"I've sold your picture,\" said Elie Magus, seeing him.\n\n\"For how much?\"\n\n\"I got back what I gave and a small interest. Make me some Flemish\ninteriors, a lesson of anatomy, landscapes, and such like, and I'll buy\nthem of you,\" said Elie.\n\nFougeres would fain have taken old Magus in his arms; he regarded him as\na father. He went home with joy in his heart; the great painter Schinner\nwas mistaken after all! In that immense city of Paris there were some\nhearts that beat in unison with Pierre's; his talent was understood and\nappreciated. The poor fellow of twenty-seven had the innocence of a lad\nof sixteen. Another man, one of those distrustful, surly artists, would\nhave noticed the diabolical look on Elie's face and seen the twitching\nof the hairs of his beard, the irony of his moustache, and the movement\nof his shoulders which betrayed the satisfaction of Walter Scott's Jew\nin swindling a Christian.\n\nFougeres marched along the boulevard in a state of joy which gave to his\nhonest face an expression of pride. He was like a schoolboy protecting\na woman. He met Joseph Bridau, one of his comrades, and one of those\neccentric geniuses destined to fame and sorrow. Joseph Bridau, who had,\nto use his own expression, a few sous in his pocket, took Fougeres to\nthe Opera. But Fougeres didn't see the ballet, didn't hear the music; he\nwas imagining pictures, he was painting. He left Joseph in the middle\nof the evening, and ran home to make sketches by lamp-light. He invented\nthirty pictures, all reminiscence, and felt himself a man of genius. The\nnext day he bought colors, and canvases of various dimensions; he piled\nup bread and cheese on his table, he filled a water-pot with water,\nhe laid in a provision of wood for his stove; then, to use a studio\nexpression, he dug at his pictures. He hired several models and Magus\nlent him stuffs.\n\nAfter two months' seclusion the Breton had finished four pictures. Again\nhe asked counsel of Schinner, this time adding Bridau to the invitation.\nThe two painters saw in three of these pictures a servile imitation\nof Dutch landscapes and interiors by Metzu, in the fourth a copy of\nRembrandt's \"Lesson of Anatomy.\"\n\n\"Still imitating!\" said Schinner. \"Ah! Fougeres can't manage to be\noriginal.\"\n\n\"You ought to do something else than painting,\" said Bridau.\n\n\"What?\" asked Fougeres.\n\n\"Fling yourself into literature.\"\n\nFougeres lowered his head like a sheep when it rains. Then he asked and\nobtained certain useful advice, and retouched his pictures before taking\nthem to Elie Magus. Elie paid him twenty-five francs apiece. At that\nprice of course Fougeres earned nothing; neither did he lose, thanks to\nhis sober living. He made a few excursions to the boulevard to see what\nbecame of his pictures, and there he underwent a singular hallucination.\nHis neat, clean paintings, hard as tin and shiny as porcelain, were\ncovered with a sort of mist; they looked like old daubs. Magus was out,\nand Pierre could obtain no information on this phenomenon. He fancied\nsomething was wrong with his eyes.\n\nThe painter went back to his studio and made more pictures. After seven\nyears of continued toil Fougeres managed to compose and execute quite\npassable work. He did as well as any artist of the second class.\nElie bought and sold all the paintings of the poor Breton, who earned\nlaboriously about two thousand francs a year while he spent but twelve\nhundred.\n\nAt the Exhibition of 1829, Leon de Lora, Schinner, and Bridau, who all\nthree occupied a great position and were, in fact, at the head of the\nart movement, were filled with pity for the perseverance and the poverty\nof their old friend; and they caused to be admitted into the grand salon\nof the Exhibition, a picture by Fougeres. This picture, powerful in\ninterest but derived from Vigneron as to sentiment and from Dubufe's\nfirst manner as to execution, represented a young man in prison, whose\nhair was being cut around the nape of the neck. On one side was\na priest, on the other two women, one old, one young, in tears. A\nsheriff's clerk was reading aloud a document. On a wretched table was a\nmeal, untouched. The light came in through the bars of a window near\nthe ceiling. It was a picture fit to make the bourgeois shudder, and\nthe bourgeois shuddered. Fougeres had simply been inspired by the\nmasterpiece of Gerard Douw; he had turned the group of the \"Dropsical\nWoman\" toward the window, instead of presenting it full front. The\ncondemned man was substituted for the dying woman--same pallor, same\nglance, same appeal to God. Instead of the Dutch doctor, he had painted\nthe cold, official figure of the sheriff's clerk attired in black; but\nhe had added an old woman to the young one of Gerard Douw. The cruelly\nsimple and good-humored face of the executioner completed and dominated\nthe group. This plagiarism, very cleverly disguised, was not discovered.\nThe catalogue contained the following:--\n\n     510. Grassou de Fougeres (Pierre), rue de Navarin, 2.\n     Death-toilet of a Chouan, condemned to execution in 1809.\n\nThough wholly second-rate, the picture had immense success, for it\nrecalled the affair of the \"chauffeurs,\" of Mortagne. A crowd collected\nevery day before the now fashionable canvas; even Charles X. paused to\nlook at it. \"Madame,\" being told of the patient life of the poor Breton,\nbecame enthusiastic over him. The Duc d'Orleans asked the price of\nthe picture. The clergy told Madame la Dauphine that the subject was\nsuggestive of good thoughts; and there was, in truth, a most satisfying\nreligious tone about it. Monseigneur the Dauphin admired the dust on\nthe stone-floor,--a huge blunder, by the way, for Fougeres had painted\ngreenish tones suggestive of mildew along the base of the walls.\n\"Madame\" finally bought the picture for a thousand francs, and the\nDauphin ordered another like it. Charles X. gave the cross of the Legion\nof honor to this son of a peasant who had fought for the royal cause\nin 1799. (Joseph Bridau, the great painter, was not yet decorated.) The\nminister of the Interior ordered two church pictures of Fougeres.\n\nThis Salon of 1829 was to Pierre Grassou his whole fortune, fame,\nfuture, and life. Be original, invent, and you die by inches; copy,\nimitate, and you'll live. After this discovery of a gold mine, Grassou\nde Fougeres obtained his benefit of the fatal principle to which society\nowes the wretched mediocrities to whom are intrusted in these days the\nelection of leaders in all social classes; who proceed, naturally, to\nelect themselves and who wage a bitter war against all true talent. The\nprinciple of election applied indiscriminately is false, and France will\nsome day abandon it.\n\nNevertheless the modesty, simplicity, and genuine surprise of the good\nand gentle Fougeres silenced all envy and all recriminations. Besides,\nhe had on his side all of his clan who had succeeded, and all who\nexpected to succeed. Some persons, touched by the persistent energy of a\nman whom nothing had discouraged, talked of Domenichino and said:--\n\n\"Perseverance in the arts should be rewarded. Grassou hasn't stolen his\nsuccesses; he has delved for ten years, the poor dear man!\"\n\nThat exclamation of \"poor dear man!\" counted for half in the support\nand the congratulations which the painter received. Pity sets up\nmediocrities as envy pulls down great talents, and in equal numbers.\nThe newspapers, it is true, did not spare criticism, but the chevalier\nFougeres digested them as he had digested the counsel of his friends,\nwith angelic patience.\n\nPossessing, by this time, fifteen thousand francs, laboriously earned,\nhe furnished an apartment and studio in the rue de Navarin, and painted\nthe picture ordered by Monseigneur the Dauphin, also the two church\npictures, and delivered them at the time agreed on, with a punctuality\nthat was very discomforting to the exchequer of the ministry, accustomed\nto a different course of action. But--admire the good fortune of men who\nare methodical--if Grassou, belated with his work, had been caught by\nthe revolution of July he would not have got his money.\n\nBy the time he was thirty-seven Fougeres had manufactured for Elie Magus\nsome two hundred pictures, all of them utterly unknown, by the help of\nwhich he had attained to that satisfying manner, that point of execution\nbefore which the true artist shrugs his shoulders and the bourgeoisie\nworships. Fougeres was dear to friends for rectitude of ideas, for\nsteadiness of sentiment, absolute kindliness, and great loyalty; though\nthey had no esteem for his palette, they loved the man who held it.\n\n\"What a misfortune it is that Fougeres has the vice of painting!\" said\nhis comrades.\n\nBut for all this, Grassou gave excellent counsel, like those\nfeuilletonists incapable of writing a book who know very well where a\nbook is wanting. There was this difference, however, between literary\ncritics and Fougeres; he was eminently sensitive to beauties; he felt\nthem, he acknowledged them, and his advice was instinct with a spirit\nof justice that made the justness of his remarks acceptable. After\nthe revolution of July, Fougeres sent about ten pictures a year to the\nSalon, of which the jury admitted four or five. He lived with the most\nrigid economy, his household being managed solely by an old charwoman.\nFor all amusement he visited his friends, he went to see works of art,\nhe allowed himself a few little trips about France, and he planned to go\nto Switzerland in search of inspiration. This detestable artist was an\nexcellent citizen; he mounted guard duly, went to reviews, and paid his\nrent and provision-bills with bourgeois punctuality.\n\nHaving lived all his life in toil and poverty, he had never had the time\nto love. Poor and a bachelor, until now he did not desire to complicate\nhis simple life. Incapable of devising any means of increasing his\nlittle fortune, he carried, every three months, to his notary, Cardot,\nhis quarterly earnings and economies. When the notary had received\nabout three thousand francs he invested them in some first mortgage, the\ninterest of which he drew himself and added to the quarterly payments\nmade to him by Fougeres. The painter was awaiting the fortunate moment\nwhen his property thus laid by would give him the imposing income of two\nthousand francs, to allow himself the otium cum dignitate of the\nartist and paint pictures; but oh! what pictures! true pictures! each a\nfinished picture! chouette, Koxnoff, chocnosoff! His future, his dreams\nof happiness, the superlative of his hopes--do you know what it was?\nTo enter the Institute and obtain the grade of officer of the Legion\nof honor; to side down beside Schinner and Leon de Lora, to reach the\nAcademy before Bridau, to wear a rosette in his buttonhole! What a\ndream! It is only commonplace men who think of everything.\n\nHearing the sound of several steps on the staircase, Fougeres rubbed up\nhis hair, buttoned his jacket of bottle-green velveteen, and was not a\nlittle amazed to see, entering his doorway, a simpleton face vulgarly\ncalled in studio slang a \"melon.\" This fruit surmounted a pumpkin,\nclothed in blue cloth adorned with a bunch of tintinnabulating baubles.\nThe melon puffed like a walrus; the pumpkin advanced on turnips,\nimproperly called legs. A true painter would have turned the little\nbottle-vendor off at once, assuring him that he didn't paint vegetables.\nThis painter looked at his client without a smile, for Monsieur Vervelle\nwore a three-thousand-franc diamond in the bosom of his shirt.\n\nFougeres glanced at Magus and said: \"There's fat in it!\" using a slang\nterm then much in vogue in the studios.\n\nHearing those words Monsieur Vervelle frowned. The worthy bourgeois drew\nafter him another complication of vegetables in the persons of his wife\nand daughter. The wife had a fine veneer of mahogany on her face, and\nin figure she resembled a cocoa-nut, surmounted by a head and tied in\naround the waist. She pivoted on her legs, which were tap-rooted,\nand her gown was yellow with black stripes. She proudly exhibited\nunutterable mittens on a puffy pair of hands; the plumes of a\nfirst-class funeral floated on an over-flowing bonnet; laces adorned\nher shoulders, as round behind as they were before; consequently, the\nspherical form of the cocoa-nut was perfect. Her feet, of a kind that\npainters call abatis, rose above the varnished leather of the shoes in a\nswelling that was some inches high. How the feet were ever got into the\nshoes, no one knows.\n\nFollowing these vegetable parents was a young asparagus, who presented\na tiny head with smoothly banded hair of the yellow-carroty tone that a\nRoman adores, long, stringy arms, a fairly white skin with reddish spots\nupon it, large innocent eyes, and white lashes, scarcely any brows, a\nleghorn bonnet bound with white satin and adorned with two honest bows\nof the same satin, hands virtuously red, and the feet of her mother. The\nfaces of these three beings wore, as they looked round the studio, an\nair of happiness which bespoke in them a respectable enthusiasm for Art.\n\n\"So it is you, monsieur, who are going to take our likenesses?\" said the\nfather, assuming a jaunty air.\n\n\"Yes, monsieur,\" replied Grassou.\n\n\"Vervelle, he has the cross!\" whispered the wife to the husband while\nthe painter's back was turned.\n\n\"Should I be likely to have our portraits painted by an artist who\nwasn't decorated?\" returned the former bottle-dealer.\n\nElie Magus here bowed to the Vervelle family and went away. Grassou\naccompanied him to the landing.\n\n\"There's no one but you who would fish up such whales.\"\n\n\"One hundred thousand francs of 'dot'!\"\n\n\"Yes, but what a family!\"\n\n\"Three hundred thousand francs of expectations, a house in the rue\nBoucherat, and a country-house at Ville d'Avray!\"\n\n\"Bottles and corks! bottles and corks!\" said the painter; \"they set my\nteeth on edge.\"\n\n\"Safe from want for the rest of your days,\" said Elie Magus as he\ndeparted.\n\nThat idea entered the head of Pierre Grassou as the daylight had burst\ninto his garret that morning.\n\nWhile he posed the father of the young person, he thought the\nbottle-dealer had a good countenance, and he admired the face full\nof violent tones. The mother and daughter hovered about the easel,\nmarvelling at all his preparations; they evidently thought him a\ndemigod. This visible admiration pleased Fougeres. The golden calf threw\nupon the family its fantastic reflections.\n\n\"You must earn lots of money; but of course you don't spend it as you\nget it,\" said the mother.\n\n\"No, madame,\" replied the painter; \"I don't spend it; I have not the\nmeans to amuse myself. My notary invests my money; he knows what I have;\nas soon as I have taken him the money I never think of it again.\"\n\n\"I've always been told,\" cried old Vervelle, \"that artists were baskets\nwith holes in them.\"\n\n\"Who is your notary--if it is not indiscreet to ask?\" said Madame\nVervelle.\n\n\"A good fellow, all round,\" replied Grassou. \"His name is Cardot.\"\n\n\"Well, well! if that isn't a joke!\" exclaimed Vervelle. \"Cardot is our\nnotary too.\"\n\n\"Take care! don't move,\" said the painter.\n\n\"Do pray hold still, Antenor,\" said the wife. \"If you move about you'll\nmake monsieur miss; you should just see him working, and then you'd\nunderstand.\"\n\n\"Oh! why didn't you have me taught the arts?\" said Mademoiselle Vervelle\nto her parents.\n\n\"Virginie,\" said her mother, \"a young person ought not to learn certain\nthings. When you are married--well, till then, keep quiet.\"\n\nDuring this first sitting the Vervelle family became almost intimate\nwith the worthy artist. They were to come again two days later. As they\nwent away the father told Virginie to walk in front; but in spite of\nthis separation, she overheard the following words, which naturally\nawakened her curiosity.\n\n\"Decorated--thirty-seven years old--an artist who gets orders--puts his\nmoney with our notary. We'll consult Cardot. Hein! Madame de Fougeres!\nnot a bad name--doesn't look like a bad man either! One might prefer a\nmerchant; but before a merchant retires from business one can never know\nwhat one's daughter may come to; whereas an economical artist--and then\nyou know we love Art--Well, we'll see!\"\n\nWhile the Vervelle family discussed Pierre Grassou, Pierre Grassou\ndiscussed in his own mind the Vervelle family. He found it impossible to\nstay peacefully in his studio, so he took a walk on the boulevard, and\nlooked at all the red-haired women who passed him. He made a series of\nthe oddest reasonings to himself: gold was the handsomest of metals; a\ntawny yellow represented gold; the Romans were fond of red-haired women,\nand he turned Roman, etc. After two years of marriage what man would\never care about the color of his wife's hair? Beauty fades,--but\nugliness remains! Money is one-half of all happiness. That night when he\nwent to bed the painter had come to think Virginie Vervelle charming.\n\nWhen the three Vervelles arrived on the day of the second sitting the\nartist received them with smiles. The rascal had shaved and put on clean\nlinen; he had also arranged his hair in a pleasing manner, and chosen\na very becoming pair of trousers and red leather slippers with pointed\ntoes. The family replied with smiles as flattering as those of the\nartist. Virginie became the color of her hair, lowered her eyes, and\nturned aside her head to look at the sketches. Pierre Grassou thought\nthese little affectations charming, Virginie had such grace; happily she\ndidn't look like her father or her mother; but whom did she look like?\n\nDuring this sitting there were little skirmishes between the family\nand the painter, who had the audacity to call pere Vervelle witty. This\nflattery brought the family on the double-quick to the heart of the\nartist; he gave a drawing to the daughter, and a sketch to the mother.\n\n\"What! for nothing?\" they said.\n\nPierre Grassou could not help smiling.\n\n\"You shouldn't give away your pictures in that way; they are money,\"\nsaid old Vervelle.\n\nAt the third sitting pere Vervelle mentioned a fine gallery of pictures\nwhich he had in his country-house at Ville d'Avray--Rubens, Gerard Douw,\nMieris, Terburg, Rembrandt, Titian, Paul Potter, etc.\n\n\"Monsieur Vervelle has been very extravagant,\" said Madame Vervelle,\nostentatiously. \"He has over one hundred thousand francs' worth of\npictures.\"\n\n\"I love Art,\" said the former bottle-dealer.\n\nWhen Madame Vervelle's portrait was begun that of her husband was nearly\nfinished, and the enthusiasm of the family knew no bounds. The notary\nhad spoken in the highest praise of the painter. Pierre Grassou was, he\nsaid, one of the most honest fellows on earth; he had laid by thirty-six\nthousand francs; his days of poverty were over; he now saved about ten\nthousand francs a year and capitalized the interest; in short, he was\nincapable of making a woman unhappy. This last remark had enormous\nweight in the scales. Vervelle's friends now heard of nothing but the\ncelebrated painter Fougeres.\n\nThe day on which Fougeres began the portrait of Mademoiselle Virginie,\nhe was virtually son-in-law to the Vervelle family. The three Vervelles\nbloomed out in this studio, which they were now accustomed to consider\nas one of their residences; there was to them an inexplicable attraction\nin this clean, neat, pretty, and artistic abode. Abyssus abyssum, the\ncommonplace attracts the commonplace. Toward the end of the sitting the\nstairway shook, the door was violently thrust open by Joseph Bridau; he\ncame like a whirlwind, his hair flying. He showed his grand haggard face\nas he looked about him, casting everywhere the lightning of his glance;\nthen he walked round the whole studio, and returned abruptly to Grassou,\npulling his coat together over the gastric region, and endeavouring, but\nin vain, to button it, the button mould having escaped from its capsule\nof cloth.\n\n\"Wood is dear,\" he said to Grassou.\n\n\"Ah!\"\n\n\"The British are after me\" (slang term for creditors) \"Gracious! do you\npaint such things as that?\"\n\n\"Hold your tongue!\"\n\n\"Ah! to be sure, yes.\"\n\nThe Vervelle family, extremely shocked by this extraordinary apparition,\npassed from its ordinary red to a cherry-red, two shades deeper.\n\n\"Brings in, hey?\" continued Joseph. \"Any shot in your locker?\"\n\n\"How much do you want?\"\n\n\"Five hundred. I've got one of those bull-dog dealers after me, and if\nthe fellow once gets his teeth in he won't let go while there's a bit of\nme left. What a crew!\"\n\n\"I'll write you a line for my notary.\"\n\n\"Have you got a notary?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"That explains to me why you still make cheeks with pink tones like a\nperfumer's sign.\"\n\nGrassou could not help coloring, for Virginie was sitting.\n\n\"Take Nature as you find her,\" said the great painter, going on with his\nlecture. \"Mademoiselle is red-haired. Well, is that a sin? All things\nare magnificent in painting. Put some vermillion on your palette, and\nwarm up those cheeks; touch in those little brown spots; come, butter it\nwell in. Do you pretend to have more sense than Nature?\"\n\n\"Look here,\" said Fougeres, \"take my place while I go and write that\nnote.\"\n\nVervelle rolled to the table and whispered in Grassou's ear:--\n\n\"Won't that country lout spoilt it?\"\n\n\"If he would only paint the portrait of your Virginie it would be worth\na thousand times more than mine,\" replied Fougeres, vehemently.\n\nHearing that reply the bourgeois beat a quiet retreat to his wife, who\nwas stupefied by the invasion of this ferocious animal, and very uneasy\nat his co-operation in her daughter's portrait.\n\n\"Here, follow these indications,\" said Bridau, returning the palette,\nand taking the note. \"I won't thank you. I can go back now to d'Arthez'\nchateau, where I am doing a dining-room, and Leon de Lora the tops of\nthe doors--masterpieces! Come and see us.\"\n\nAnd off he went without taking leave, having had enough of looking at\nVirginie.\n\n\"Who is that man?\" asked Madame Vervelle.\n\n\"A great artist,\" answered Grassou.\n\nThere was silence for a moment.\n\n\"Are you quite sure,\" said Virginie, \"that he has done no harm to my\nportrait? He frightened me.\"\n\n\"He has only done it good,\" replied Grassou.\n\n\"Well, if he is a great artist, I prefer a great artist like you,\" said\nMadame Vervelle.\n\nThe ways of genius had ruffled up these orderly bourgeois.\n\nThe phase of autumn so pleasantly named \"Saint Martin's summer\" was\njust beginning. With the timidity of a neophyte in presence of a man of\ngenius, Vervelle risked giving Fougeres an invitation to come out to\nhis country-house on the following Sunday. He knew, he said, how little\nattraction a plain bourgeois family could offer to an artist.\n\n\"You artists,\" he continued, \"want emotions, great scenes, and witty\ntalk; but you'll find good wines, and I rely on my collection of\npictures to compensate an artist like you for the bore of dining with\nmere merchants.\"\n\nThis form of idolatry, which stroked his innocent self-love, was\ncharming to our poor Pierre Grassou, so little accustomed to such\ncompliments. The honest artist, that atrocious mediocrity, that heart\nof gold, that loyal soul, that stupid draughtsman, that worthy fellow,\ndecorated by royalty itself with the Legion of honor, put himself under\narms to go out to Ville d'Avray and enjoy the last fine days of the\nyear. The painter went modestly by public conveyance, and he could not\nbut admire the beautiful villa of the bottle-dealer, standing in a park\nof five acres at the summit of Ville d'Avray, commanding a noble view\nof the landscape. Marry Virginie, and have that beautiful villa some day\nfor his own!\n\nHe was received by the Vervelles with an enthusiasm, a joy, a\nkindliness, a frank bourgeois absurdity which confounded him. It was\nindeed a day of triumph. The prospective son-in-law was marched about\nthe grounds on the nankeen-colored paths, all raked as they should be\nfor the steps of so great a man. The trees themselves looked brushed and\ncombed, and the lawns had just been mown. The pure country air wafted\nto the nostrils a most enticing smell of cooking. All things about the\nmansion seemed to say:\n\n\"We have a great artist among us.\"\n\nLittle old Vervelle himself rolled like an apple through his park, the\ndaughter meandered like an eel, the mother followed with dignified step.\nThese three beings never let go for one moment of Pierre Grassou\nfor seven hours. After dinner, the length of which equalled its\nmagnificence, Monsieur and Madame Vervelle reached the moment of their\ngrand theatrical effect,--the opening of the picture gallery illuminated\nby lamps, the reflections of which were managed with the utmost care.\nThree neighbours, also retired merchants, an old uncle (from whom were\nexpectations), an elderly Demoiselle Vervelle, and a number of other\nguests invited to be present at this ovation to a great artist followed\nGrassou into the picture gallery, all curious to hear his opinion of the\nfamous collection of pere Vervelle, who was fond of oppressing them with\nthe fabulous value of his paintings. The bottle-merchant seemed to have\nthe idea of competing with King Louis-Philippe and the galleries of\nVersailles.\n\nThe pictures, magnificently framed, each bore labels on which was read\nin black letters on a gold ground:\n\n               Rubens\n     Dance of fauns and nymphs\n\n                         Rembrandt\n     Interior of a dissecting room. The physician van Tromp\n             instructing his pupils.\n\nIn all, there were one hundred and fifty pictures, varnished and dusted.\nSome were covered with green baize curtains which were not undrawn in\npresence of young ladies.\n\nPierre Grassou stood with arms pendent, gaping mouth, and no word upon\nhis lips as he recognized half his own pictures in these works of art.\nHe was Rubens, he was Rembrandt, Mieris, Metzu, Paul Potter, Gerard\nDouw! He was twenty great masters all by himself.\n\n\"What is the matter? You've turned pale!\"\n\n\"Daughter, a glass of water! quick!\" cried Madame Vervelle. The painter\ntook pere Vervelle by the button of his coat and led him to a corner on\npretence of looking at a Murillo. Spanish pictures were then the rage.\n\n\"You bought your pictures from Elie Magus?\"\n\n\"Yes, all originals.\"\n\n\"Between ourselves, tell me what he made you pay for those I shall point\nout to you.\"\n\nTogether they walked round the gallery. The guests were amazed at the\ngravity in which the artist proceeded, in company with the host, to\nexamine each picture.\n\n\"Three thousand francs,\" said Vervelle in a whisper, as they reached the\nlast, \"but I tell everybody forty thousand.\"\n\n\"Forty thousand for a Titian!\" said the artist, aloud. \"Why, it is\nnothing at all!\"\n\n\"Didn't I tell you,\" said Vervelle, \"that I had three hundred thousand\nfrancs' worth of pictures?\"\n\n\"I painted those pictures,\" said Pierre Grassou in Vervelle's ear, \"and\nI sold them one by one to Elie Magus for less than ten thousand francs\nthe whole lot.\"\n\n\"Prove it to me,\" said the bottle-dealer, \"and I double my daughter's\n'dot,' for if it is so, you are Rubens, Rembrandt, Titian, Gerard Douw!\"\n\n\"And Magus is a famous picture-dealer!\" said the painter, who now saw\nthe meaning of the misty and aged look imparted to his pictures in\nElie's shop, and the utility of the subjects the picture-dealer had\nrequired of him.\n\nFar from losing the esteem of his admiring bottle-merchant, Monsieur\nde Fougeres (for so the family persisted in calling Pierre Grassou)\nadvanced so much that when the portraits were finished he presented them\ngratuitously to his father-in-law, his mother-in-law and his wife.\n\nAt the present day, Pierre Grassou, who never misses exhibiting at the\nSalon, passes in bourgeois regions for a fine portrait-painter. He earns\nsome twenty thousand francs a year and spoils a thousand francs' worth\nof canvas. His wife has six thousand francs a year in dowry, and he\nlives with his father-in-law. The Vervelles and the Grassous, who agree\ndelightfully, keep a carriage, and are the happiest people on earth.\nPierre Grassou never emerges from the bourgeois circle, in which he\nis considered one of the greatest artists of the period. Not a family\nportrait is painted between the barrier du Trone and the rue du Temple\nthat is not done by this great painter; none of them costs less than\nfive hundred francs. The great reason which the bourgeois families have\nfor employing him is this:--\n\n\"Say what you will of him, he lays by twenty thousand francs a year with\nhis notary.\"\n\nAs Grassou took a creditable part on the occasion of the riots of May\n12th he was appointed an officer of the Legion of honor. He is a major\nin the National Guard. The Museum of Versailles felt it incumbent to\norder a battle-piece of so excellent a citizen, who thereupon walked\nabout Paris to meet his old comrades and have the happiness of saying to\nthem:--\n\n\"The King has given me an order for the Museum of Versailles.\"\n\nMadame de Fougeres adores her husband, to whom she has presented two\nchildren. This painter, a good father and a good husband, is unable to\neradicate from his heart a fatal thought, namely, that artists laugh at\nhis work; that his name is a term of contempt in the studios; and that\nthe feuilletons take no notice of his pictures. But he still works on;\nhe aims for the Academy, where, undoubtedly, he will enter. And--oh!\nvengeance which dilates his heart!--he buys the pictures of celebrated\nartists who are pinched for means, and he substitutes these true works\nof arts that are not his own for the wretched daubs in the collection at\nVille d'Avray.\n\nThere are many mediocrities more aggressive and more mischievous than\nthat of Pierre Grassou, who is, moreover, anonymously benevolent and\ntruly obliging.\n\n\n\n\nADDENDUM\n\nThe following personages appear in other stories of the Human Comedy.\n\n     Bridau, Joseph\n       The Purse\n       A Bachelor's Establishment\n       A Distinguished Provincial at Paris\n       A Start in Life\n       Modeste Mignon\n       Another Study of Woman\n       Letters of Two Brides\n       Cousin Betty\n       The Member for Arcis\n\n     Cardot (Parisian notary)\n       The Muse of the Department\n       A Man of Business\n       Jealousies of a Country Town\n       The Middle Classes\n       Cousin Pons\n\n     Grassou, Pierre\n       A Bachelor's Establishment\n       Cousin Betty\n       The Middle Classes\n       Cousin Pons\n\n     Lora, Leon de\n       The Unconscious Humorists\n       A Bachelor's Establishment\n       A Start in Life\n       Honorine\n       Cousin Betty\n       Beatrix\n\n     Magus, Elie\n       The Vendetta\n       A Marriage Settlement\n       A Bachelor's Establishment\n       Cousin Pons\n\n     Schinner, Hippolyte\n       The Purse\n       A Bachelor's Establishment\n       A Start in Life\n       Albert Savarus\n       The Government Clerks\n       Modeste Mignon\n       The Imaginary Mistress\n       The Unconscious Humorists\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Pierre Grassou, by Honore de Balzac", "answers": ["Their daughter, Virgine.

Since\n1830, the true Salon no longer exists. The Louvre has again been taken\nby assault,--this time by a populace of artists who have maintained\nthemselves in it.\n\nIn other days, when the Salon presented only the choicest works of art,\nit conferred the highest honor on the creations there exhibited. Among\nthe two hundred selected paintings, the public could still choose: a\ncrown was awarded to the masterpiece by hands unseen. Eager, impassioned\ndiscussions arose about some picture. The abuse showered on Delacroix,\non Ingres, contributed no less to their fame than the praises and\nfanaticism of their adherents. To-day, neither the crowd nor the\ncriticism grows impassioned about the products of that bazaar. Forced to\nmake the selection for itself, which in former days the examining\njury made for it, the attention of the public is soon wearied and the\nexhibition closes. Before the year 1817 the pictures admitted never went\nbeyond the first two columns of the long gallery of the old masters; but\nin that year, to the great astonishment of the public, they filled the\nwhole space. Historical, high-art, genre paintings, easel pictures,\nlandscapes, flowers, animals, and water-colors,--these eight specialties\ncould surely not offer more than twenty pictures in one year worthy of\nthe eyes of the public, which, indeed, cannot give its attention to a\ngreater number of such works. The more the number of artists increases,\nthe more careful and exacting the jury of admission ought to be.\n\nThe true character of the Salon was lost as soon as it spread along\nthe galleries. The Salon should have remained within fixed limits of\ninflexible proportions, where each distinct specialty could show its\nmasterpieces only. An experience of ten years has shown the excellence\nof the former institution. Now, instead of a tournament, we have a mob;\ninstead of a noble exhibition, we have a tumultuous bazaar; instead of\na choice selection we have a chaotic mass. What is the result? A great\nartist is swamped. Decamps' \"Turkish Cafe,\" \"Children at a Fountain,\"\n\"Joseph,\" and \"The Torture,\" would have redounded far more to his credit\nif the four pictures had been exhibited in the great Salon with the\nhundred good pictures of that year, than his twenty pictures could,\namong three thousand others, jumbled together in six galleries.\n\nBy some strange contradiction, ever since the doors are open to every\none there has been much talk of unknown and unrecognized genius. When,\ntwelve years earlier, Ingres' \"Courtesan,\" and that of Sigalon, the\n\"Medusa\" of Gericault, the \"Massacre of Scio\" by Delacroix, the \"Baptism\nof Henri IV.\" by Eugene Deveria, admitted by celebrated artists accused\nof jealousy, showed the world, in spite of the denials of criticism,\nthat young and vigorous palettes existed, no such complaint was made.\nNow, when the veriest dauber of canvas can send in his work, the whole\ntalk is of genius neglected! Where judgment no longer exists, there is\nno longer anything judged. But whatever artists may be doing now, they\nwill come back in time to the examination and selection which presents\ntheir works to the admiration of the crowd for whom they work. Without\nselection by the Academy there will be no Salon, and without the Salon\nart may perish.\n\nEver since the catalogue has grown into a book, many names have appeared\nin it which still remain in their native obscurity, in spite of the ten\nor a dozen pictures attached to them. Among these names perhaps the most\nunknown to fame is that of an artist named Pierre Grassou, coming from\nFougeres, and called simply \"Fougeres\" among his brother-artists, who,\nat the present moment holds a place, as the saying is, \"in the sun,\" and\nwho suggested the rather bitter reflections by which this sketch of\nhis life is introduced,--reflections that are applicable to many other\nindividuals of the tribe of artists.\n\nIn 1832, Fougeres lived in the rue de Navarin, on the fourth floor of\none of those tall, narrow houses which resemble the obelisk of Luxor,\nand possess an alley, a dark little stairway with dangerous turnings,\nthree windows only on each floor, and, within the building, a courtyard,\nor, to speak more correctly, a square pit or well. Above the three or\nfour rooms occupied by Grassou of Fougeres was his studio, looking over\nto Montmartre. This studio was painted in brick-color, for a background;\nthe floor was tinted brown and well frotted; each chair was furnished\nwith a bit of carpet bound round the edges; the sofa, simple enough, was\nclean as that in the bedroom of some worthy bourgeoise. All these things\ndenoted the tidy ways of a small mind and the thrift of a poor man. A\nbureau was there, in which to put away the studio implements, a table\nfor breakfast, a sideboard, a secretary; in short, all the articles\nnecessary to a painter, neatly arranged and very clean. The stove\nparticipated in this Dutch cleanliness, which was all the more visible\nbecause the pure and little changing light from the north flooded with\nits cold clear beams the vast apartment. Fougeres, being merely a genre\npainter, does not need the immense machinery and outfit which ruin\nhistorical painters; he has never recognized within himself sufficient\nfaculty to attempt high-art, and he therefore clings to easel painting.\n\nAt the beginning of the month of December of that year, a season at\nwhich the bourgeois of Paris conceive, periodically, the burlesque idea\nof perpetuating their forms and figures already too bulky in themselves,\nPierre Grassou, who had risen early, prepared his palette, and lighted\nhis stove, was eating a roll steeped in milk, and waiting till the frost\non his windows had melted sufficiently to let the full light in. The\nweather was fine and dry. At this moment the artist, who ate his bread\nwith that patient, resigned air that tells so much, heard and recognized\nthe step of a man who had upon his life the influence such men have\non the lives of nearly all artists,--the step of Elie Magus, a\npicture-dealer, a usurer in canvas. The next moment Elie Magus entered\nand found the painter in the act of beginning his work in the tidy\nstudio.\n\n\"How are you, old rascal?\" said the painter.\n\nFougeres had the cross of the Legion of honor, and Elie Magus bought his\npictures at two and three hundred francs apiece, so he gave himself the\nairs of a fine artist.\n\n\"Business is very bad,\" replied Elie. \"You artists have such\npretensions! You talk of two hundred francs when you haven't put six\nsous' worth of color on a canvas. However, you are a good fellow, I'll\nsay that. You are steady; and I've come to put a good bit of business in\nyour way.\"\n\n\"Timeo Danaos et dona ferentes,\" said Fougeres. \"Do you know Latin?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Well, it means that the Greeks never proposed a good bit of business\nto the Trojans without getting their fair share of it. In the olden time\nthey used to say, 'Take my horse.' Now we say, 'Take my bear.' Well,\nwhat do you want, Ulysses-Lagingeole-Elie Magus?\"\n\nThese words will give an idea of the mildness and wit with which\nFougeres employed what painters call studio fun.\n\n\"Well, I don't deny that you are to paint me two pictures for nothing.\"\n\n\"Oh! oh!\"\n\n\"I'll leave you to do it, or not; I don't ask it. But you're an honest\nman.\"\n\n\"Come, out with it!\"\n\n\"Well, I'm prepared to bring you a father, mother, and only daughter.\"\n\n\"All for me?\"\n\n\"Yes--they want their portraits taken. These bourgeois--they are crazy\nabout art--have never dared to enter a studio. The girl has a 'dot' of a\nhundred thousand francs. You can paint all three,--perhaps they'll turn\nout family portraits.\"\n\nAnd with that the old Dutch log of wood who passed for a man and who was\ncalled Elie Magus, interrupted himself to laugh an uncanny laugh which\nfrightened the painter. He fancied he heard Mephistopheles talking\nmarriage.\n\n\"Portraits bring five hundred francs apiece,\" went on Elie; \"so you can\nvery well afford to paint me three pictures.\"\n\n\"True for you!\" cried Fougeres, gleefully.\n\n\"And if you marry the girl, you won't forget me.\"\n\n\"Marry! I?\" cried Pierre Grassou,--\"I, who have a habit of sleeping\nalone; and get up at cock-crow, and all my life arranged--\"\n\n\"One hundred thousand francs,\" said Magus, \"and a quiet girl, full of\ngolden tones, as you call 'em, like a Titian.\"\n\n\"What class of people are they?\"\n\n\"Retired merchants; just now in love with art; have a country-house at\nVille d'Avray, and ten or twelve thousand francs a year.\"\n\n\"What business did they do?\"\n\n\"Bottles.\"\n\n\"Now don't say that word; it makes me think of corks and sets my teeth\non edge.\"\n\n\"Am I to bring them?\"\n\n\"Three portraits--I could put them in the Salon; I might go in for\nportrait-painting. Well, yes!\"\n\nOld Elie descended the staircase to go in search of the Vervelle family.\nTo know to what extend this proposition would act upon the painter, and\nwhat effect would be produced upon him by the Sieur and Dame Vervelle,\nadorned by their only daughter, it is necessary to cast an eye on the\nanterior life of Pierre Grassou of Fougeres.\n\nWhen a pupil, Fougeres had studied drawing with Servin, who was\nthought a great draughtsman in academic circles. After that he went to\nSchinner's, to learn the secrets of the powerful and magnificent color\nwhich distinguishes that master. Master and scholars were all discreet;\nat any rate Pierre discovered none of their secrets. From there he went\nto Sommervieux' atelier, to acquire that portion of the art of painting\nwhich is called composition, but composition was shy and distant to him.\nThen he tried to snatch from Decamps and Granet the mystery of their\ninterior effects. The two masters were not robbed. Finally Fougeres\nended his education with Duval-Lecamus. During these studied and\nthese different transformations Fougeres' habits and ways of life were\ntranquil and moral to a degree that furnished matter of jesting to the\nvarious ateliers where he sojourned; but everywhere he disarmed his\ncomrades by his modesty and by the patience and gentleness of a lamblike\nnature. The masters, however, had no sympathy for the good lad; masters\nprefer bright fellows, eccentric spirits, droll or fiery, or else gloomy\nand deeply reflective, which argue future talent. Everything about\nPierre Grassou smacked of mediocrity. His nickname \"Fougeres\" (that\nof the painter in the play of \"The Eglantine\") was the source of much\nteasing; but, by force of circumstances, he accepted the name of the\ntown in which he had first seen light.\n\nGrassou of Fougeres resembled his name. Plump and of medium height, he\nhad a dull complexion, brown eyes, black hair, a turned-up nose, rather\nwide mouth, and long ears. His gentle, passive, and resigned air gave a\ncertain relief to these leading features of a physiognomy that was full\nof health, but wanting in action. This young man, born to be a virtuous\nbourgeois, having left his native place and come to Paris to be clerk\nwith a color-merchant (formerly of Mayenne and a distant connection of\nthe Orgemonts) made himself a painter simply by the fact of an obstinacy\nwhich constitutes the Breton character. What he suffered, the manner in\nwhich he lived during those years of study, God only knows. He suffered\nas much as great men suffer when they are hounded by poverty and hunted\nlike wild beasts by the pack of commonplace minds and by troops of\nvanities athirst for vengeance.\n\nAs soon as he thought himself able to fly on his own wings, Fougeres\ntook a studio in the upper part of the rue des Martyrs, where he began\nto delve his way. He made his first appearance in 1819. The first\npicture he presented to the jury of the Exhibition at the Louvre\nrepresented a village wedding rather laboriously copied from Greuze's\npicture. It was rejected. When Fougeres heard of the fatal decision,\nhe did not fall into one of those fits of epileptic self-love to which\nstrong natures give themselves up, and which sometimes end in challenges\nsent to the director or the secretary of the Museum, or even by threats\nof assassination. Fougeres quietly fetched his canvas, wrapped it in\na handkerchief, and brought it home, vowing in his heart that he would\nstill make himself a great painter. He placed his picture on the easel,\nand went to one of his former masters, a man of immense talent,--to\nSchinner, a kind and patient artist, whose triumph at that year's Salon\nwas complete. Fougeres asked him to come and criticise the rejected\nwork. The great painter left everything and went at once. When poor\nFougeres had placed the work before him Schinner, after a glance,\npressed Fougeres' hand.\n\n\"You are a fine fellow,\" he said; \"you've a heart of gold, and I must\nnot deceive you. Listen; you are fulfilling all the promises you made in\nthe studios. When you find such things as that at the tip of your brush,\nmy good Fougeres, you had better leave colors with Brullon, and not take\nthe canvas of others. Go home early, put on your cotton night-cap, and\nbe in bed by nine o'clock. The next morning early go to some government\noffice, ask for a place, and give up art.\"\n\n\"My dear friend,\" said Fougeres, \"my picture is already condemned; it is\nnot a verdict that I want of you, but the cause of that verdict.\"\n\n\"Well--you paint gray and sombre; you see nature being a crape veil;\nyour drawing is heavy, pasty; your composition is a medley of Greuze,\nwho only redeemed his defects by the qualities which you lack.\"\n\nWhile detailing these faults of the picture Schinner saw on Fougeres'\nface so deep an expression of sadness that he carried him off to dinner\nand tried to console him. The next morning at seven o'clock Fougeres was\nat his easel working over the rejected picture; he warmed the colors; he\nmade the corrections suggested by Schinner, he touched up his figures.\nThen, disgusted with such patching, he carried the picture to Elie\nMagus. Elie Magus, a sort of Dutch-Flemish-Belgian, had three reasons\nfor being what he became,--rich and avaricious. Coming last from\nBordeaux, he was just starting in Paris, selling old pictures and living\non the boulevard Bonne-Nouvelle. Fougeres, who relied on his palette\nto go to the baker's, bravely ate bread and nuts, or bread and milk, or\nbread and cherries, or bread and cheese, according to the seasons. Elie\nMagus, to whom Pierre offered his first picture, eyed it for some time\nand then gave him fifteen francs.\n\n\"With fifteen francs a year coming in, and a thousand francs for\nexpenses,\" said Fougeres, smiling, \"a man will go fast and far.\"\n\nElie Magus made a gesture; he bit his thumbs, thinking that he might\nhave had that picture for five francs.\n\nFor several days Pierre walked down from the rue des Martyrs and\nstationed himself at the corner of the boulevard opposite to Elie's\nshop, whence his eye could rest upon his picture, which did not obtain\nany notice from the eyes of the passers along the street. At the end of\na week the picture disappeared; Fougeres walked slowly up and approached\nthe dealer's shop in a lounging manner. The Jew was at his door.\n\n\"Well, I see you have sold my picture.\"\n\n\"No, here it is,\" said Magus; \"I've framed it, to show it to some one\nwho fancies he knows about painting.\"\n\nFougeres had not the heart to return to the boulevard. He set about\nanother picture, and spent two months upon it,--eating mouse's meals and\nworking like a galley-slave.\n\nOne evening he went to the boulevard, his feet leading him fatefully to\nthe dealer's shop. His picture was not to be seen.\n\n\"I've sold your picture,\" said Elie Magus, seeing him.\n\n\"For how much?\"\n\n\"I got back what I gave and a small interest. Make me some Flemish\ninteriors, a lesson of anatomy, landscapes, and such like, and I'll buy\nthem of you,\" said Elie.\n\nFougeres would fain have taken old Magus in his arms; he regarded him as\na father. He went home with joy in his heart; the great painter Schinner\nwas mistaken after all! In that immense city of Paris there were some\nhearts that beat in unison with Pierre's; his talent was understood and\nappreciated. The poor fellow of twenty-seven had the innocence of a lad\nof sixteen. Another man, one of those distrustful, surly artists, would\nhave noticed the diabolical look on Elie's face and seen the twitching\nof the hairs of his beard, the irony of his moustache, and the movement\nof his shoulders which betrayed the satisfaction of Walter Scott's Jew\nin swindling a Christian.\n\nFougeres marched along the boulevard in a state of joy which gave to his\nhonest face an expression of pride. He was like a schoolboy protecting\na woman. He met Joseph Bridau, one of his comrades, and one of those\neccentric geniuses destined to fame and sorrow. Joseph Bridau, who had,\nto use his own expression, a few sous in his pocket, took Fougeres to\nthe Opera. But Fougeres didn't see the ballet, didn't hear the music; he\nwas imagining pictures, he was painting. He left Joseph in the middle\nof the evening, and ran home to make sketches by lamp-light. He invented\nthirty pictures, all reminiscence, and felt himself a man of genius. The\nnext day he bought colors, and canvases of various dimensions; he piled\nup bread and cheese on his table, he filled a water-pot with water,\nhe laid in a provision of wood for his stove; then, to use a studio\nexpression, he dug at his pictures. He hired several models and Magus\nlent him stuffs.\n\nAfter two months' seclusion the Breton had finished four pictures. Again\nhe asked counsel of Schinner, this time adding Bridau to the invitation.\nThe two painters saw in three of these pictures a servile imitation\nof Dutch landscapes and interiors by Metzu, in the fourth a copy of\nRembrandt's \"Lesson of Anatomy.\"\n\n\"Still imitating!\" said Schinner. \"Ah! Fougeres can't manage to be\noriginal.\"\n\n\"You ought to do something else than painting,\" said Bridau.\n\n\"What?\" asked Fougeres.\n\n\"Fling yourself into literature.\"\n\nFougeres lowered his head like a sheep when it rains. Then he asked and\nobtained certain useful advice, and retouched his pictures before taking\nthem to Elie Magus. Elie paid him twenty-five francs apiece. At that\nprice of course Fougeres earned nothing; neither did he lose, thanks to\nhis sober living. He made a few excursions to the boulevard to see what\nbecame of his pictures, and there he underwent a singular hallucination.\nHis neat, clean paintings, hard as tin and shiny as porcelain, were\ncovered with a sort of mist; they looked like old daubs. Magus was out,\nand Pierre could obtain no information on this phenomenon. He fancied\nsomething was wrong with his eyes.\n\nThe painter went back to his studio and made more pictures. After seven\nyears of continued toil Fougeres managed to compose and execute quite\npassable work. He did as well as any artist of the second class.\nElie bought and sold all the paintings of the poor Breton, who earned\nlaboriously about two thousand francs a year while he spent but twelve\nhundred.\n\nAt the Exhibition of 1829, Leon de Lora, Schinner, and Bridau, who all\nthree occupied a great position and were, in fact, at the head of the\nart movement, were filled with pity for the perseverance and the poverty\nof their old friend; and they caused to be admitted into the grand salon\nof the Exhibition, a picture by Fougeres. This picture, powerful in\ninterest but derived from Vigneron as to sentiment and from Dubufe's\nfirst manner as to execution, represented a young man in prison, whose\nhair was being cut around the nape of the neck. On one side was\na priest, on the other two women, one old, one young, in tears. A\nsheriff's clerk was reading aloud a document. On a wretched table was a\nmeal, untouched. The light came in through the bars of a window near\nthe ceiling. It was a picture fit to make the bourgeois shudder, and\nthe bourgeois shuddered. Fougeres had simply been inspired by the\nmasterpiece of Gerard Douw; he had turned the group of the \"Dropsical\nWoman\" toward the window, instead of presenting it full front. The\ncondemned man was substituted for the dying woman--same pallor, same\nglance, same appeal to God. Instead of the Dutch doctor, he had painted\nthe cold, official figure of the sheriff's clerk attired in black; but\nhe had added an old woman to the young one of Gerard Douw. The cruelly\nsimple and good-humored face of the executioner completed and dominated\nthe group. This plagiarism, very cleverly disguised, was not discovered.\nThe catalogue contained the following:--\n\n     510. Grassou de Fougeres (Pierre), rue de Navarin, 2.\n     Death-toilet of a Chouan, condemned to execution in 1809.\n\nThough wholly second-rate, the picture had immense success, for it\nrecalled the affair of the \"chauffeurs,\" of Mortagne. A crowd collected\nevery day before the now fashionable canvas; even Charles X. paused to\nlook at it. \"Madame,\" being told of the patient life of the poor Breton,\nbecame enthusiastic over him. The Duc d'Orleans asked the price of\nthe picture. The clergy told Madame la Dauphine that the subject was\nsuggestive of good thoughts; and there was, in truth, a most satisfying\nreligious tone about it. Monseigneur the Dauphin admired the dust on\nthe stone-floor,--a huge blunder, by the way, for Fougeres had painted\ngreenish tones suggestive of mildew along the base of the walls.\n\"Madame\" finally bought the picture for a thousand francs, and the\nDauphin ordered another like it. Charles X. gave the cross of the Legion\nof honor to this son of a peasant who had fought for the royal cause\nin 1799. (Joseph Bridau, the great painter, was not yet decorated.) The\nminister of the Interior ordered two church pictures of Fougeres.\n\nThis Salon of 1829 was to Pierre Grassou his whole fortune, fame,\nfuture, and life. Be original, invent, and you die by inches; copy,\nimitate, and you'll live. After this discovery of a gold mine, Grassou\nde Fougeres obtained his benefit of the fatal principle to which society\nowes the wretched mediocrities to whom are intrusted in these days the\nelection of leaders in all social classes; who proceed, naturally, to\nelect themselves and who wage a bitter war against all true talent. The\nprinciple of election applied indiscriminately is false, and France will\nsome day abandon it.\n\nNevertheless the modesty, simplicity, and genuine surprise of the good\nand gentle Fougeres silenced all envy and all recriminations. Besides,\nhe had on his side all of his clan who had succeeded, and all who\nexpected to succeed. Some persons, touched by the persistent energy of a\nman whom nothing had discouraged, talked of Domenichino and said:--\n\n\"Perseverance in the arts should be rewarded. Grassou hasn't stolen his\nsuccesses; he has delved for ten years, the poor dear man!\"\n\nThat exclamation of \"poor dear man!\" counted for half in the support\nand the congratulations which the painter received. Pity sets up\nmediocrities as envy pulls down great talents, and in equal numbers.\nThe newspapers, it is true, did not spare criticism, but the chevalier\nFougeres digested them as he had digested the counsel of his friends,\nwith angelic patience.\n\nPossessing, by this time, fifteen thousand francs, laboriously earned,\nhe furnished an apartment and studio in the rue de Navarin, and painted\nthe picture ordered by Monseigneur the Dauphin, also the two church\npictures, and delivered them at the time agreed on, with a punctuality\nthat was very discomforting to the exchequer of the ministry, accustomed\nto a different course of action. But--admire the good fortune of men who\nare methodical--if Grassou, belated with his work, had been caught by\nthe revolution of July he would not have got his money.\n\nBy the time he was thirty-seven Fougeres had manufactured for Elie Magus\nsome two hundred pictures, all of them utterly unknown, by the help of\nwhich he had attained to that satisfying manner, that point of execution\nbefore which the true artist shrugs his shoulders and the bourgeoisie\nworships. Fougeres was dear to friends for rectitude of ideas, for\nsteadiness of sentiment, absolute kindliness, and great loyalty; though\nthey had no esteem for his palette, they loved the man who held it.\n\n\"What a misfortune it is that Fougeres has the vice of painting!\" said\nhis comrades.\n\nBut for all this, Grassou gave excellent counsel, like those\nfeuilletonists incapable of writing a book who know very well where a\nbook is wanting. There was this difference, however, between literary\ncritics and Fougeres; he was eminently sensitive to beauties; he felt\nthem, he acknowledged them, and his advice was instinct with a spirit\nof justice that made the justness of his remarks acceptable. After\nthe revolution of July, Fougeres sent about ten pictures a year to the\nSalon, of which the jury admitted four or five. He lived with the most\nrigid economy, his household being managed solely by an old charwoman.\nFor all amusement he visited his friends, he went to see works of art,\nhe allowed himself a few little trips about France, and he planned to go\nto Switzerland in search of inspiration. This detestable artist was an\nexcellent citizen; he mounted guard duly, went to reviews, and paid his\nrent and provision-bills with bourgeois punctuality.\n\nHaving lived all his life in toil and poverty, he had never had the time\nto love. Poor and a bachelor, until now he did not desire to complicate\nhis simple life. Incapable of devising any means of increasing his\nlittle fortune, he carried, every three months, to his notary, Cardot,\nhis quarterly earnings and economies. When the notary had received\nabout three thousand francs he invested them in some first mortgage, the\ninterest of which he drew himself and added to the quarterly payments\nmade to him by Fougeres. The painter was awaiting the fortunate moment\nwhen his property thus laid by would give him the imposing income of two\nthousand francs, to allow himself the otium cum dignitate of the\nartist and paint pictures; but oh! what pictures! true pictures! each a\nfinished picture! chouette, Koxnoff, chocnosoff! His future, his dreams\nof happiness, the superlative of his hopes--do you know what it was?\nTo enter the Institute and obtain the grade of officer of the Legion\nof honor; to side down beside Schinner and Leon de Lora, to reach the\nAcademy before Bridau, to wear a rosette in his buttonhole! What a\ndream! It is only commonplace men who think of everything.\n\nHearing the sound of several steps on the staircase, Fougeres rubbed up\nhis hair, buttoned his jacket of bottle-green velveteen, and was not a\nlittle amazed to see, entering his doorway, a simpleton face vulgarly\ncalled in studio slang a \"melon.\" This fruit surmounted a pumpkin,\nclothed in blue cloth adorned with a bunch of tintinnabulating baubles.\nThe melon puffed like a walrus; the pumpkin advanced on turnips,\nimproperly called legs. A true painter would have turned the little\nbottle-vendor off at once, assuring him that he didn't paint vegetables.\nThis painter looked at his client without a smile, for Monsieur Vervelle\nwore a three-thousand-franc diamond in the bosom of his shirt.\n\nFougeres glanced at Magus and said: \"There's fat in it!\" using a slang\nterm then much in vogue in the studios.\n\nHearing those words Monsieur Vervelle frowned. The worthy bourgeois drew\nafter him another complication of vegetables in the persons of his wife\nand daughter. The wife had a fine veneer of mahogany on her face, and\nin figure she resembled a cocoa-nut, surmounted by a head and tied in\naround the waist. She pivoted on her legs, which were tap-rooted,\nand her gown was yellow with black stripes. She proudly exhibited\nunutterable mittens on a puffy pair of hands; the plumes of a\nfirst-class funeral floated on an over-flowing bonnet; laces adorned\nher shoulders, as round behind as they were before; consequently, the\nspherical form of the cocoa-nut was perfect. Her feet, of a kind that\npainters call abatis, rose above the varnished leather of the shoes in a\nswelling that was some inches high. How the feet were ever got into the\nshoes, no one knows.\n\nFollowing these vegetable parents was a young asparagus, who presented\na tiny head with smoothly banded hair of the yellow-carroty tone that a\nRoman adores, long, stringy arms, a fairly white skin with reddish spots\nupon it, large innocent eyes, and white lashes, scarcely any brows, a\nleghorn bonnet bound with white satin and adorned with two honest bows\nof the same satin, hands virtuously red, and the feet of her mother. The\nfaces of these three beings wore, as they looked round the studio, an\nair of happiness which bespoke in them a respectable enthusiasm for Art.\n\n\"So it is you, monsieur, who are going to take our likenesses?\" said the\nfather, assuming a jaunty air.\n\n\"Yes, monsieur,\" replied Grassou.\n\n\"Vervelle, he has the cross!\" whispered the wife to the husband while\nthe painter's back was turned.\n\n\"Should I be likely to have our portraits painted by an artist who\nwasn't decorated?\" returned the former bottle-dealer.\n\nElie Magus here bowed to the Vervelle family and went away. Grassou\naccompanied him to the landing.\n\n\"There's no one but you who would fish up such whales.\"\n\n\"One hundred thousand francs of 'dot'!\"\n\n\"Yes, but what a family!\"\n\n\"Three hundred thousand francs of expectations, a house in the rue\nBoucherat, and a country-house at Ville d'Avray!\"\n\n\"Bottles and corks! bottles and corks!\" said the painter; \"they set my\nteeth on edge.\"\n\n\"Safe from want for the rest of your days,\" said Elie Magus as he\ndeparted.\n\nThat idea entered the head of Pierre Grassou as the daylight had burst\ninto his garret that morning.\n\nWhile he posed the father of the young person, he thought the\nbottle-dealer had a good countenance, and he admired the face full\nof violent tones. The mother and daughter hovered about the easel,\nmarvelling at all his preparations; they evidently thought him a\ndemigod. This visible admiration pleased Fougeres. The golden calf threw\nupon the family its fantastic reflections.\n\n\"You must earn lots of money; but of course you don't spend it as you\nget it,\" said the mother.\n\n\"No, madame,\" replied the painter; \"I don't spend it; I have not the\nmeans to amuse myself. My notary invests my money; he knows what I have;\nas soon as I have taken him the money I never think of it again.\"\n\n\"I've always been told,\" cried old Vervelle, \"that artists were baskets\nwith holes in them.\"\n\n\"Who is your notary--if it is not indiscreet to ask?\" said Madame\nVervelle.\n\n\"A good fellow, all round,\" replied Grassou. \"His name is Cardot.\"\n\n\"Well, well! if that isn't a joke!\" exclaimed Vervelle. \"Cardot is our\nnotary too.\"\n\n\"Take care! don't move,\" said the painter.\n\n\"Do pray hold still, Antenor,\" said the wife. \"If you move about you'll\nmake monsieur miss; you should just see him working, and then you'd\nunderstand.\"\n\n\"Oh! why didn't you have me taught the arts?\" said Mademoiselle Vervelle\nto her parents.\n\n\"Virginie,\" said her mother, \"a young person ought not to learn certain\nthings. When you are married--well, till then, keep quiet.\"\n\nDuring this first sitting the Vervelle family became almost intimate\nwith the worthy artist. They were to come again two days later. As they\nwent away the father told Virginie to walk in front; but in spite of\nthis separation, she overheard the following words, which naturally\nawakened her curiosity.\n\n\"Decorated--thirty-seven years old--an artist who gets orders--puts his\nmoney with our notary. We'll consult Cardot. Hein! Madame de Fougeres!\nnot a bad name--doesn't look like a bad man either! One might prefer a\nmerchant; but before a merchant retires from business one can never know\nwhat one's daughter may come to; whereas an economical artist--and then\nyou know we love Art--Well, we'll see!\"\n\nWhile the Vervelle family discussed Pierre Grassou, Pierre Grassou\ndiscussed in his own mind the Vervelle family. He found it impossible to\nstay peacefully in his studio, so he took a walk on the boulevard, and\nlooked at all the red-haired women who passed him. He made a series of\nthe oddest reasonings to himself: gold was the handsomest of metals; a\ntawny yellow represented gold; the Romans were fond of red-haired women,\nand he turned Roman, etc. After two years of marriage what man would\never care about the color of his wife's hair? Beauty fades,--but\nugliness remains! Money is one-half of all happiness. That night when he\nwent to bed the painter had come to think Virginie Vervelle charming.\n\nWhen the three Vervelles arrived on the day of the second sitting the\nartist received them with smiles. The rascal had shaved and put on clean\nlinen; he had also arranged his hair in a pleasing manner, and chosen\na very becoming pair of trousers and red leather slippers with pointed\ntoes. The family replied with smiles as flattering as those of the\nartist. Virginie became the color of her hair, lowered her eyes, and\nturned aside her head to look at the sketches. Pierre Grassou thought\nthese little affectations charming, Virginie had such grace; happily she\ndidn't look like her father or her mother; but whom did she look like?\n\nDuring this sitting there were little skirmishes between the family\nand the painter, who had the audacity to call pere Vervelle witty. This\nflattery brought the family on the double-quick to the heart of the\nartist; he gave a drawing to the daughter, and a sketch to the mother.\n\n\"What! for nothing?\" they said.\n\nPierre Grassou could not help smiling.\n\n\"You shouldn't give away your pictures in that way; they are money,\"\nsaid old Vervelle.\n\nAt the third sitting pere Vervelle mentioned a fine gallery of pictures\nwhich he had in his country-house at Ville d'Avray--Rubens, Gerard Douw,\nMieris, Terburg, Rembrandt, Titian, Paul Potter, etc.\n\n\"Monsieur Vervelle has been very extravagant,\" said Madame Vervelle,\nostentatiously. \"He has over one hundred thousand francs' worth of\npictures.\"\n\n\"I love Art,\" said the former bottle-dealer.\n\nWhen Madame Vervelle's portrait was begun that of her husband was nearly\nfinished, and the enthusiasm of the family knew no bounds. The notary\nhad spoken in the highest praise of the painter. Pierre Grassou was, he\nsaid, one of the most honest fellows on earth; he had laid by thirty-six\nthousand francs; his days of poverty were over; he now saved about ten\nthousand francs a year and capitalized the interest; in short, he was\nincapable of making a woman unhappy. This last remark had enormous\nweight in the scales. Vervelle's friends now heard of nothing but the\ncelebrated painter Fougeres.\n\nThe day on which Fougeres began the portrait of Mademoiselle Virginie,\nhe was virtually son-in-law to the Vervelle family. The three Vervelles\nbloomed out in this studio, which they were now accustomed to consider\nas one of their residences; there was to them an inexplicable attraction\nin this clean, neat, pretty, and artistic abode. Abyssus abyssum, the\ncommonplace attracts the commonplace. Toward the end of the sitting the\nstairway shook, the door was violently thrust open by Joseph Bridau; he\ncame like a whirlwind, his hair flying. He showed his grand haggard face\nas he looked about him, casting everywhere the lightning of his glance;\nthen he walked round the whole studio, and returned abruptly to Grassou,\npulling his coat together over the gastric region, and endeavouring, but\nin vain, to button it, the button mould having escaped from its capsule\nof cloth.\n\n\"Wood is dear,\" he said to Grassou.\n\n\"Ah!\"\n\n\"The British are after me\" (slang term for creditors) \"Gracious! do you\npaint such things as that?\"\n\n\"Hold your tongue!\"\n\n\"Ah! to be sure, yes.\"\n\nThe Vervelle family, extremely shocked by this extraordinary apparition,\npassed from its ordinary red to a cherry-red, two shades deeper.\n\n\"Brings in, hey?\" continued Joseph. \"Any shot in your locker?\"\n\n\"How much do you want?\"\n\n\"Five hundred. I've got one of those bull-dog dealers after me, and if\nthe fellow once gets his teeth in he won't let go while there's a bit of\nme left. What a crew!\"\n\n\"I'll write you a line for my notary.\"\n\n\"Have you got a notary?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"That explains to me why you still make cheeks with pink tones like a\nperfumer's sign.\"\n\nGrassou could not help coloring, for Virginie was sitting.\n\n\"Take Nature as you find her,\" said the great painter, going on with his\nlecture. \"Mademoiselle is red-haired. Well, is that a sin? All things\nare magnificent in painting. Put some vermillion on your palette, and\nwarm up those cheeks; touch in those little brown spots; come, butter it\nwell in. Do you pretend to have more sense than Nature?\"\n\n\"Look here,\" said Fougeres, \"take my place while I go and write that\nnote.\"\n\nVervelle rolled to the table and whispered in Grassou's ear:--\n\n\"Won't that country lout spoilt it?\"\n\n\"If he would only paint the portrait of your Virginie it would be worth\na thousand times more than mine,\" replied Fougeres, vehemently.\n\nHearing that reply the bourgeois beat a quiet retreat to his wife, who\nwas stupefied by the invasion of this ferocious animal, and very uneasy\nat his co-operation in her daughter's portrait.\n\n\"Here, follow these indications,\" said Bridau, returning the palette,\nand taking the note. \"I won't thank you. I can go back now to d'Arthez'\nchateau, where I am doing a dining-room, and Leon de Lora the tops of\nthe doors--masterpieces! Come and see us.\"\n\nAnd off he went without taking leave, having had enough of looking at\nVirginie.\n\n\"Who is that man?\" asked Madame Vervelle.\n\n\"A great artist,\" answered Grassou.\n\nThere was silence for a moment.\n\n\"Are you quite sure,\" said Virginie, \"that he has done no harm to my\nportrait? He frightened me.\"\n\n\"He has only done it good,\" replied Grassou.\n\n\"Well, if he is a great artist, I prefer a great artist like you,\" said\nMadame Vervelle.\n\nThe ways of genius had ruffled up these orderly bourgeois.\n\nThe phase of autumn so pleasantly named \"Saint Martin's summer\" was\njust beginning. With the timidity of a neophyte in presence of a man of\ngenius, Vervelle risked giving Fougeres an invitation to come out to\nhis country-house on the following Sunday. He knew, he said, how little\nattraction a plain bourgeois family could offer to an artist.\n\n\"You artists,\" he continued, \"want emotions, great scenes, and witty\ntalk; but you'll find good wines, and I rely on my collection of\npictures to compensate an artist like you for the bore of dining with\nmere merchants.\"\n\nThis form of idolatry, which stroked his innocent self-love, was\ncharming to our poor Pierre Grassou, so little accustomed to such\ncompliments. The honest artist, that atrocious mediocrity, that heart\nof gold, that loyal soul, that stupid draughtsman, that worthy fellow,\ndecorated by royalty itself with the Legion of honor, put himself under\narms to go out to Ville d'Avray and enjoy the last fine days of the\nyear. The painter went modestly by public conveyance, and he could not\nbut admire the beautiful villa of the bottle-dealer, standing in a park\nof five acres at the summit of Ville d'Avray, commanding a noble view\nof the landscape. Marry Virginie, and have that beautiful villa some day\nfor his own!\n\nHe was received by the Vervelles with an enthusiasm, a joy, a\nkindliness, a frank bourgeois absurdity which confounded him. It was\nindeed a day of triumph. The prospective son-in-law was marched about\nthe grounds on the nankeen-colored paths, all raked as they should be\nfor the steps of so great a man. The trees themselves looked brushed and\ncombed, and the lawns had just been mown. The pure country air wafted\nto the nostrils a most enticing smell of cooking. All things about the\nmansion seemed to say:\n\n\"We have a great artist among us.\"\n\nLittle old Vervelle himself rolled like an apple through his park, the\ndaughter meandered like an eel, the mother followed with dignified step.\nThese three beings never let go for one moment of Pierre Grassou\nfor seven hours. After dinner, the length of which equalled its\nmagnificence, Monsieur and Madame Vervelle reached the moment of their\ngrand theatrical effect,--the opening of the picture gallery illuminated\nby lamps, the reflections of which were managed with the utmost care.\nThree neighbours, also retired merchants, an old uncle (from whom were\nexpectations), an elderly Demoiselle Vervelle, and a number of other\nguests invited to be present at this ovation to a great artist followed\nGrassou into the picture gallery, all curious to hear his opinion of the\nfamous collection of pere Vervelle, who was fond of oppressing them with\nthe fabulous value of his paintings. The bottle-merchant seemed to have\nthe idea of competing with King Louis-Philippe and the galleries of\nVersailles.\n\nThe pictures, magnificently framed, each bore labels on which was read\nin black letters on a gold ground:\n\n               Rubens\n     Dance of fauns and nymphs\n\n                         Rembrandt\n     Interior of a dissecting room. The physician van Tromp\n             instructing his pupils.\n\nIn all, there were one hundred and fifty pictures, varnished and dusted.\nSome were covered with green baize curtains which were not undrawn in\npresence of young ladies.\n\nPierre Grassou stood with arms pendent, gaping mouth, and no word upon\nhis lips as he recognized half his own pictures in these works of art.\nHe was Rubens, he was Rembrandt, Mieris, Metzu, Paul Potter, Gerard\nDouw! He was twenty great masters all by himself.\n\n\"What is the matter? You've turned pale!\"\n\n\"Daughter, a glass of water! quick!\" cried Madame Vervelle. The painter\ntook pere Vervelle by the button of his coat and led him to a corner on\npretence of looking at a Murillo. Spanish pictures were then the rage.\n\n\"You bought your pictures from Elie Magus?\"\n\n\"Yes, all originals.\"\n\n\"Between ourselves, tell me what he made you pay for those I shall point\nout to you.\"\n\nTogether they walked round the gallery. The guests were amazed at the\ngravity in which the artist proceeded, in company with the host, to\nexamine each picture.\n\n\"Three thousand francs,\" said Vervelle in a whisper, as they reached the\nlast, \"but I tell everybody forty thousand.\"\n\n\"Forty thousand for a Titian!\" said the artist, aloud. \"Why, it is\nnothing at all!\"\n\n\"Didn't I tell you,\" said Vervelle, \"that I had three hundred thousand\nfrancs' worth of pictures?\"\n\n\"I painted those pictures,\" said Pierre Grassou in Vervelle's ear, \"and\nI sold them one by one to Elie Magus for less than ten thousand francs\nthe whole lot.\"\n\n\"Prove it to me,\" said the bottle-dealer, \"and I double my daughter's\n'dot,' for if it is so, you are Rubens, Rembrandt, Titian, Gerard Douw!\"\n\n\"And Magus is a famous picture-dealer!\" said the painter, who now saw\nthe meaning of the misty and aged look imparted to his pictures in\nElie's shop, and the utility of the subjects the picture-dealer had\nrequired of him.\n\nFar from losing the esteem of his admiring bottle-merchant, Monsieur\nde Fougeres (for so the family persisted in calling Pierre Grassou)\nadvanced so much that when the portraits were finished he presented them\ngratuitously to his father-in-law, his mother-in-law and his wife.\n\nAt the present day, Pierre Grassou, who never misses exhibiting at the\nSalon, passes in bourgeois regions for a fine portrait-painter. He earns\nsome twenty thousand francs a year and spoils a thousand francs' worth\nof canvas. His wife has six thousand francs a year in dowry, and he\nlives with his father-in-law. The Vervelles and the Grassous, who agree\ndelightfully, keep a carriage, and are the happiest people on earth.\nPierre Grassou never emerges from the bourgeois circle, in which he\nis considered one of the greatest artists of the period. Not a family\nportrait is painted between the barrier du Trone and the rue du Temple\nthat is not done by this great painter; none of them costs less than\nfive hundred francs. The great reason which the bourgeois families have\nfor employing him is this:--\n\n\"Say what you will of him, he lays by twenty thousand francs a year with\nhis notary.\"\n\nAs Grassou took a creditable part on the occasion of the riots of May\n12th he was appointed an officer of the Legion of honor. He is a major\nin the National Guard. The Museum of Versailles felt it incumbent to\norder a battle-piece of so excellent a citizen, who thereupon walked\nabout Paris to meet his old comrades and have the happiness of saying to\nthem:--\n\n\"The King has given me an order for the Museum of Versailles.\"\n\nMadame de Fougeres adores her husband, to whom she has presented two\nchildren. This painter, a good father and a good husband, is unable to\neradicate from his heart a fatal thought, namely, that artists laugh at\nhis work; that his name is a term of contempt in the studios; and that\nthe feuilletons take no notice of his pictures. But he still works on;\nhe aims for the Academy, where, undoubtedly, he will enter. And--oh!\nvengeance which dilates his heart!--he buys the pictures of celebrated\nartists who are pinched for means, and he substitutes these true works\nof arts that are not his own for the wretched daubs in the collection at\nVille d'Avray.\n\nThere are many mediocrities more aggressive and more mischievous than\nthat of Pierre Grassou, who is, moreover, anonymously benevolent and\ntruly obliging.\n\n\n\n\nADDENDUM\n\nThe following personages appear in other stories of the Human Comedy.\n\n     Bridau, Joseph\n       The Purse\n       A Bachelor's Establishment\n       A Distinguished Provincial at Paris\n       A Start in Life\n       Modeste Mignon\n       Another Study of Woman\n       Letters of Two Brides\n       Cousin Betty\n       The Member for Arcis\n\n     Cardot (Parisian notary)\n       The Muse of the Department\n       A Man of Business\n       Jealousies of a Country Town\n       The Middle Classes\n       Cousin Pons\n\n     Grassou, Pierre\n       A Bachelor's Establishment\n       Cousin Betty\n       The Middle Classes\n       Cousin Pons\n\n     Lora, Leon de\n       The Unconscious Humorists\n       A Bachelor's Establishment\n       A Start in Life\n       Honorine\n       Cousin Betty\n       Beatrix\n\n     Magus, Elie\n       The Vendetta\n       A Marriage Settlement\n       A Bachelor's Establishment\n       Cousin Pons\n\n     Schinner, Hippolyte\n       The Purse\n       A Bachelor's Establishment\n       A Start in Life\n       Albert Savarus\n       The Government Clerks\n       Modeste Mignon\n       The Imaginary Mistress\n       The Unconscious Humorists\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Pierre Grassou, by Honore de Balzac", "answers": ["Grassou"], "length": 7899, "dataset": "narrativeqa", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "321a85aa34669657c041d72547da9f30764447d789bf0e2d"}

On\neither side are single windows on which signs, at left, \"POST OFFICE\",\nand at right, \"GENERAL STORE\" are painted.

During the act the women all dressed up in starched dresses\nparade in and out of store. People buying groceries, kids playing in\nthe street, etc. General noise of conversation, laughter and children\nshouting. But when the curtain rises there is momentary lull for\ncane-chewing. At left of porch four men are playing cards on a soap\nbox, and seated on the edge of the porch at extreme right two children\nare engaged in a checker game, with the board on the floor between\nthem.\n\nWhen the curtain goes up the following characters are discovered on\nthe porch: MAYOR JOE CLARK, the storekeeper; DEACON HAMBO; DEACON\nGOODWIN; Old Man MATT BRAZZLE; WILL CODY; SYKES JONES; LUM BOGER, the\nyoung town marshall; LIGE MOSELY and WALTER THOMAS, two village wags;\nTOM NIXON and SAM MOSELY, and several others, seated on boxes, kegs,\nbenches and floor of the porch. TONY TAYLOR is sitting on steps of\nporch with empty basket. MRS. TAYLOR comes out with her arms full of\ngroceries, empties them into basket and goes back in store. All the\nmen are chewing sugar cane earnestly with varying facial expressions.\nThe noise of the breaking and sucking of cane can be clearly heard in\nthe silence. Occasionally the laughter and shouting of children is\nheard nearby off stage.\n\nHAMBO: (To BRAZZLE) Say, Matt, gimme a jint or two of dat green\ncane--dis ribbon cane is hard.\n\nLIGE: Yeah, and you ain't got de chears in yo' parlor you useter have.\n\nHAMBO: Dat's all right, Lige, but I betcha right now wid dese few\nteeth I got I kin eat up more cane'n you kin grow.\n\nLIGE: I know you kin and that's de reason I ain't going to tempt you.\nBut youse gettin' old in lots of ways--look at dat bald-head--just as\nclean as my hand.

Silence for a moment.)\n\n(Off stage a high shrill voice can be heard calling:)\n\nVOICE: Sister Mosely, Oh, Sister Mosely! (A pause) Miz Mosely! (Very\nirritated) Oh, Sister Mattie! You hear me out here--you just won't\nanswer!\n\nVOICE OF MRS. MOSELY: Whoo-ee ... somebody calling me?\n\nVOICE OF MRS. ROBERTS: (Angrily) Never mind now--you couldn't come\nwhen I called you. I don't want yo' lil ole weasley turnip greens.\n(Silence)\n\nMATT BRAZZLE: Sister Roberts is en town agin! If she was mine, I'll\nbe hen-fired if I wouldn't break her down in de lines (loins)--good as\ndat man is to her!\n\nHAMBO: I wish she was mine jes' one day--de first time she open her\nmouf to beg _anybody_, I'd lam her wid lightning.\n\nJOE CLARK: I God, Jake Roberts buys mo' rations out dis store than any\nman in dis town. I don't see to my Maker whut she do wid it all....\nHere she come....\n\n(ENTER MRS. JAKE ROBERTS, a heavy light brown woman with a basket on\nher arm. A boy about ten walks beside her carrying a small child about\na year old straddle of his back. Her skirts are sweeping the ground.\nShe walks up to the step, puts one foot upon the steps and looks\nforlornly at all the men, then fixes her look on JOE CLARK.)\n\nMRS. ROBERTS: Evenin', Brother Mayor.\n\nCLARK: Howdy do, Mrs. Roberts. How's yo' husband?\n\nMRS. ROBERTS: (Beginning her professional whine): He ain't much and I\nain't much and my chillun is poly. We ain't got 'nough to eat! Lawd,\nMr. Clark, gimme a lil piece of side meat to cook us a pot of greens.\n\nCLARK: Aw gwan, Sister Roberts. You got plenty bacon home. Last week\nJake bought....\n\nMRS. ROBERTS: (Frantically) Lawd, Mist' Clark, how long you think dat\nlil piece of meat last me an' my chillun? Lawd, me and my chillun is\n_hongry_! God knows, Jake don't fee-eed me!\n\n(MR. CLARK sits unmoved. MRS. ROBERTS advances upon him)\n\nMist' Clark!\n\nCLARK: I God, woman, don't keep on after me! Every time I look, youse\nround here beggin' for everything you see.\n\nLIGE: And whut she don't see she whoops for it just de same.\n\nMRS. ROBERTS: (In dramatic begging pose) Mist' Clark! Ain't you boin'\ndo nuthin' for me? And you see me and my poor chillun is starvin'....\n\nCLARK: (Exasperated rises) I God, woman, a man can't git no peace wid\nsomebody like you in town. (He goes angrily into the store followed by\nMRS. ROBERTS. The boy sits down on the edge of the porch sucking the\nbaby's thumb.)\n\nVOICE OF MRS. ROBERTS: A piece 'bout dis wide....\n\nVOICE OF CLARK: I God, naw! Yo' husband done bought you plenty meat,\nnohow.\n\nVOICE OF MRS. ROBERTS: (In great anguish) Ow! Mist' Clark! Don't you\ncut dat lil tee-ninchy piece of meat for me and my chillun! (Sound of\nrunning feet inside the store.) I ain't a going to tetch it!\n\nVOICE OF CLARK: Well, don't touch it then. That's all you'll git outa\nme.\n\nVOICE OF MRS. ROBERTS: (Calmer) Well, hand it chear den. Lawd, me and\nmy chillun is _so_ hongry.... Jake don't fee-eed me. (She re-enters by\ndoor of store with the slab of meat in her hand and an outraged look\non her face. She gazes all about her for sympathy.) Lawd, me and my\npoor chillun is _so_ hongry ... and some folks has _every_thing and\nthey's so _stingy_ and gripin'.... Lawd knows, Jake don't fee-eed me!\n(She exits right on this line followed by the boy with the baby on his\nback.)\n\n(All the men gaze behind her, then at each other and shake their\nheads.)\n\nHAMBO: Poor Jak.... I'm really sorry for dat man. If she was mine I'd\nbeat her till her ears hung down like a Georgy mule.\n\nWALTER THOMAS: I'd beat her till she smell like onions.\n\nLIGE: I'd romp on her till she slack like lime.\n\nNIXON: I'd stomp her till she rope like okra.\n\nVOICE OF MRS. ROBERTS: (Off stage right) Lawd, Miz Lewis, you goin'\ngive me dat lil han'ful of greens for me and my chillun. Why dat ain't\na eye-full. I ought not to take 'em ... but me and my chillun is _so_\nhongry.... Some folks is so stingy and gripin'! Lawd knows, Tony don't\n_feed_ me!\n\n(The noise of cane-chewing is heard again. Enter JOE LINDSAY left with\na gun over his shoulder and the large leg bone of a mule in the other\nhand. He approaches the step wearily.)\n\nHAMBO: Well, did you git any partridges, Joe?\n\nJOE: (Resting his gun and seating himself) Nope, but I made de\nfeathers fly.\n\nHAMBO: I don't see no birds.\n\nJOE: Oh, the feathers flew off on de birds.\n\nLIGE: I don't see nothin' but dat bone. Look lak you done kilt a cow\nand et 'im raw out in de woods.\n\nJOE: Don't y'all know dat hock-bone?\n\nWALTER: How you reckon we gointer know every hock-bone in Orange\nCounty sight unseen?\n\nJOE: (Standing the bone up on the floor of the porch) Dis is a\nhock-bone of Brazzle's ole yaller mule.\n\n(General pleased interest. Everybody wants to touch it.)\n\nBRAZZLE: (Coming forward) Well, sir! (Takes bone in both hands and\nlooks up and down the length of it) If 'tain't my ole mule! This sho\nwas one hell of a mule, too. He'd fight every inch in front of de\nplow ... he'd turn over de mowing machine ... run away wid de\nwagon ... and you better not look like you wanter _ride_ 'im!\n\nLINDSAY: (Laughing) Yeah, I 'member seein' you comin' down de road\njust so ... (He limps wid one hand on his buttocks) one day.\n\nBRAZZLE: Dis mule was so evil he used to try to bite and kick when I'd\ngo in de stable to feed 'im.\n\nWALTER: He was too mean to git fat. He was so skinny you could do a\nweek's washing on his ribs for a washboard and hang 'em up on his\nhip-bones to dry.\n\nLIGE: I 'member one day, Brazzle, you sent yo' boy to Winter Park\nafter some groceries wid a basket. So here he went down de road ridin'\ndis mule wid dis basket on his arm.... Whut you reckon dat ole\ncontrary mule done when he got to dat crooked place in de road going\nround Park Lake? He turnt right round and went through de handle of\ndat basket ... wid de boy still up on his back. (General laughter)\n\nBRAZZLE: Yeah, he up and died one Sat'day just for spite ... but he\nwas too contrary to lay down on his side like a mule orter and die\ndecent. Naw, he made out to lay down on his narrer contracted back and\ndie wid his feets sticking straight up in de air just so. (He gets\ndown on his back and illustrates.) We drug him out to de swamp wid 'im\ndat way, didn't we, Hambo?\n\nJOE CLARK: I God, Brazzle, we all seen it. Didn't we all go to de\ndraggin' out? More folks went to yo' mule's draggin' out than went to\nlast school closing.... Bet there ain't been a thing right in\nmule-hell for four years.\n\nHAMBO: Been dat long since he been dead?\n\nCLARK: I God, yes. He died de week after I started to cutting' dat new\nground.\n\n(The bone is passing from hand to hand. At last a boy about twelve\ntakes it. He has just walked up and is proudly handling the bone when\na woman's voice is heard off stage right.)\n\nVOICE: Senator! Senator!! Oh, you Senator?\n\nBOY: (Turning displeased mutters) Aw, shux. (Loudly) Ma'm?\n\nVOICE: If you don't come here you better!\n\nSENATOR: Yes ma'am. (He drops bone on ground down stage and trots off\nfrowning.) Soon as we men git to doing something dese wimmen....\n(Exits, right.)\n\n(Enter TEET and BOOTSIE left, clean and primped in voile dresses just\nalike. They speak diffidently and enter store. The men admire them\ncasually.)\n\nLIGE: Them girls done turned out to be right good-looking.\n\nWALTER: Teet ain't as pretty now as she was a few years back. She used\nto be fat as a butter ball wid legs just like two whiskey-kegs. She's\ntoo skinny since she got her growth.\n\nCODY: Ain't none of 'em pretty as dat Miss Daisy. God! She's pretty as\na speckled pup.\n\nLIGE: But she was sho nuff ugly when she was little ... little ole\nhard black knot. She sho has changed since she been away up North. If\nshe ain't pretty now, there ain't a hound dog in Georgy.\n\n(Re-enter SENATOR BAILEY and stops on the steps. He addresses JOE\nCLARK.)\n\nSENATOR: Mist' Clark....\n\nHAMBO: (To Senator) Ain't you got no manners? We all didn't sleep wid\nyou last night.\n\nSENATOR: (Embarrassed) Good evening, everybody.\n\nALL THE MEN: Good evening, son, boy, Senator, etc.\n\nSENATOR: Mist' Clark, mama said is Daisy been here dis evenin'?\n\nJOE CLARK: Ain't laid my eyes on her. Ain't she working over in\nMaitland?\n\nSENATOR: Yessuh ... but she's off today and mama sent her down here to\nget de groceries.\n\nJOE CLARK: Well, tell yo' ma I ain't seen her.\n\nSENATOR: Well, she say to tell you when she come, to tell her ma say\nshe better git home and dat quick.\n\nJOE CLARK: I will. (Exit BOY right.)\n\nLIGE: Bet she's off somewhere wid Dave or Jim.\n\nWALTER: I don't bet it ... I know it. She's got them two in de\ngo-long.\n\n(Re-enter TEET and BOOTSIE from store. TEET has a letter and BOOTSIE\ntwo or three small parcels. The men look up with interest as they come\nout on the porch.)\n\nWALTER: (Winking) Whut's dat you got, Teet ... letter from Dave?\n\nTEET: (Flouncing) Naw indeed! It's a letter from my B-I-T-sweetie!\n(Rolls her eyes and hips.)\n\nWALTER: (Winking) Well, ain't Dave yo' B-I-T-sweetie? I thought y'all\nwas 'bout to git married. Everywhere I looked dis summer 'twas you and\nDave, Bootsie and Jim. I thought all of y'all would've done jumped\nover de broomstick by now.\n\nTEET: (Flourishing letter) Don't tell it to me ... tell it to the\never-loving Mr. Albert Johnson way over in Apopka.\n\nBOOTSIE: (Rolling her eyes) Oh, tell 'em 'bout the ever-loving Mr.\nJimmy Cox from Altamont. Oh, I can't stand to see my baby lose.\n\nHAMBO: It's lucky y'all girls done got some more fellers, cause look\nlike Daisy done treed both Jim and Dave at once, or they done treed\nhere one.\n\nTEET: Let her have 'em ... nobody don't keer. They don't handle de \"In\nGod we trust\" lak my Johnson. He's head bellman at de hotel.\n\nBOOTSIE: Mr. Cox got money's grandma and old grandpa change. (The\ngirls exit huffily.)\n\nLINDSAY: (To HAMBO, pseudo-seriously) You oughtn't tease dem gals lak\ndat.\n\nHAMBO: Oh, I laks to see gals all mad. But dem boys is crazy sho nuff.\nBefore Daisy come back here they both had a good-looking gal a piece.\nNow they 'bout to fall out and fight over half a gal a piece. Neither\none won't give over and let de other one have her.\n\nLIGE: And she ain't thinking too much 'bout no one man. (Looks off\nleft.) Here she come now. God! She got a mean walk on her!\n\nWALTER: Yeah, man. She handles a lot of traffic! Oh, mama, throw it in\nde river ... papa'll come git it!\n\nLINDSAY: Aw, shut up, you married men!\n\nLIGE: Man don't go blind cause he gits married, do he? (Enter DAISY\nhurriedly. Stops at step a moment. She is dressed in sheer organdie,\nwhite shoes and stockings.)\n\nDAISY: Good evening, everybody. (Walks up on the porch.)\n\nALL THE MEN: (Very pleasantly) Good evening, Miss Daisy.\n\nDAISY: (To CLARK) Mama sent me after some meal and flour and some\nbacon and sausage oil.\n\nCLARK: Senator been here long time ago hunting you.\n\nDAISY: (Frightened) Did he? Oo ... Mist' Clark, hurry up and fix it\nfor me. (She starts on in the store.)\n\nLINDSAY: (Giving her his seat) You better wait here, Daisy.\n\n(WALTER kicks LIGE to call his attention to LINDSAY'S attitude)\n\nIt's powerful hot in dat store. Lemme run fetch 'em out to you.\n\nLIGE: (To LINDSAY) _Run!_ Joe Lindsay, you ain't been able to run\nsince de big bell rung. Look at dat gray beard.\n\nLINDSAY: Thank God, I ain't gray all over. I'm just as good a man\nright now as any of you young 'uns. (He hurries on into the store.)\n\nWALTER: Daisy, where's yo' two body guards? It don't look natural to\nsee you thout nary one of 'em.\n\nDAISY: (Archly) I ain't got no body guards. I don't know what you\ntalkin' about.\n\nLIGE: Aw, don' try to come dat over us, Daisy. You know who we talkin'\n'bout all right ... but if you want me to come out flat footed ...\nwhere's Jim and Dave?\n\nDAISY: Ain't they playin' somewhere for de white folks?\n\nLIGE: (To WALTER) Will you listen at dis gal, Walter? (To DAISY) When\nI ain't been long seen you and Dave going down to de Lake.\n\nDAISY: (Frightened) Don't y'all run tell mama where I been.\n\nWALTER: Well, you tell us which one you laks de best and we'll wipe\nour mouf (Gesture) and say nothin'. Dem boys been de best of friends\nall they life, till both of 'em took after you ... then good-bye, Katy\nbar de door!\n\nDAISY: (Affected innocence) Ain't they still playin' and dancin'\ntogether?\n\nLIGE: Yeah, but that's 'bout all they do 'gree on these days. That's\nde way it is wid men, young and old.... I don't keer how long they\nbeen friends and how thick they been ... a woman kin come between 'em.\nDavid and Jonather never would have been friends so long if Jonather\nhad of been any great hand wid de wimmen. You ain't never seen no two\nroosters that likes one another.\n\nDAISY: I ain't tried to break 'em up.\n\nWALTER: Course you ain't. You don't have to. All two boys need to do\nis to git stuck on de same girl and they done broke up ... _right\nnow_! Wimmen is something can't be divided equal.\n\n(Re-enter JOE LINDSAY and CLARK with the groceries. DAISY jumps up and\ngrabs the packages.)\n\nLIGE: (To DAISY) Want some of us ... me ... to go long and tote yo'\nthings for you?\n\nDAISY: (Nervously) Naw, mama is riding her high horse today. Long as I\nbeen gone it wouldn't do for me to come walking up wid nobody. (She\nexits hurriedly right.)\n\n(All the men watch her out of sight in silence.)\n\nCLARK: (Sighing) I God, know whut Daisy puts me in de mind of?\n\nHAMBO: No, what? (They all lean together.)\n\nCLARK: I God, a great big mango ... a sweet smell, you know, Th a\nstrong flavor, but not something you could mash up like a strawberry.\nSomething with a body to it.\n\n(General laughter, but not obscene.)\n\nHAMBO: (Admiringly) Joe Clark! I didn't know you had it in you!\n\n(MRS. CLARK enters from store door and they all straighten up\nguiltily)\n\nCLARK: (Angrily to his wife) Now whut do you want? I God, the minute I\nset down, here you come....\n\nMRS. CLARK: Somebody want a stamp, Jody. You know you don't 'low me to\nbove wid de post office. (HE rises sullenly and goes inside the\nstore.)\n\nBRAZZLE: Say, Hambo, I didn't see you at our Sunday School picnic.\n\nHAMBO: (Slicing some plug-cut tobacco) Nope, wan't there dis time.\n\nWALTER: Looka here, Hambo. Y'all Baptist carry dis close-communion\nbusiness too far. If a person ain't half drownded in de lake and half\net up by alligators, y'all think he ain't baptized, so you can't take\ncommunion wid him. Now I reckon you can't even drink lemonade and eat\nchicken perlow wid us.\n\nHAMBO: My Lord, boy, youse just _full_ of words. Now, in de first\nplace, if this year's picnic was lak de one y'all had last year ...\nyou ain't had no lemonade for us Baptists to turn down. You had a big\nole barrel of rain water wid about a pound of sugar in it and one\nlemon cut up over de top of it.\n\nLIGE: Man, you sho kin mold 'em!\n\nWALTER: Well, I went to de Baptist picnic wid my mouf all set to eat\nchicken, when lo and behold y'all had chitlings! Do Jesus!\n\nLINDSAY: Hold on there a minute. There was plenty chicken at dat\npicnic, which I do know is right.\n\nWALTER: Only chicken I seen was half a chicken yo' pastor musta tried\nto swaller whole cause he was choked stiff as a board when I come\nlong ... wid de whole deacon's board beating him in de back, trying\nto knock it out his throat.\n\nLIGE: Say, dat puts me in de mind of a Baptist brother that was crazy\n'bout de preachers and de preacher was crazy 'bout feeding his face.\nSo his son got tired of trying to beat dese stump-knockers to de grub\non the table, so one day he throwed out some slams 'bout dese\npreachers. Dat made his old man mad, so he tole his son to git out.\nHe boy ast him \"Where must I go, papa?\" He says, \"Go on to hell I\nreckon ... I don't keer where you go.\"\n\nSo de boy left and was gone seven years. He come back one cold, windy\nnight and rapped on de door. \"Who dat?\" de old man ast him \"It's me,\nJack.\" De old man opened de door, so glad to see his son agin, and\ntole Jack to come in. He did and looked all round de place. Seven or\neight preachers was sitting round de fire eatin' and drinkin'.\n\n\"Where you been all dis time, Jack?\" de old man ast him.\n\n\"I been to hell,\" Jack tole him.\n\n\"Tell us how it is down there, Jack.\"\n\n\"Well,\" he says, \"It's just like it is here ... you cain't git to de\nfire for de preachers.\"\n\nHAMBO: Boy, you kin lie just like de cross-ties from Jacksonville to\nKey West. De presidin' elder must come round on his circuit teaching\ny'all how to tell 'em, cause you couldn't lie dat good just natural.\n\nWALTER: Can't nobody beat Baptist folks lying ... and I ain't never\nfound out how come you think youse so important.\n\nLINDSAY: Ain't we got de finest and de biggest church? Macedonia\nBaptist will hold more folks than any two buildings in town.\n\nLIGE: Thass right, y'all got a heap more church than you got members\nto go in it.\n\nHAMBO: Thass all right ... y'all ain't got neither de church nor de\nmembers. Everything that's had in this town got to be held in our\nchurch.\n\n(Re-enter JOE CLARK.)\n\nCLARK: What you-all talkin'?\n\nHAMBO: Come on out, Tush Hawg, lemme beat you some checkers. I'm tired\nof fending and proving wid dese boys ain't got no hair on they chest\nyet.\n\nCLARK: I God, you mean you gointer get beat. You can't handle me ...\nI'm a tush hawg.\n\nHAMBO: Well, I'm going to draw dem tushes right now. (To two small\nboys using checker board on edge of porch.) Here you chilluns, let de\nMayor and me have that board. Go on out an' play an' give us grown\nfolks a little peace. (The children go down stage and call out:)\n\nSMALL BOY: Hey, Senator. Hey, Marthy. Come on let's play chick-me,\nchick-me, cranie-crow.\n\nCHILD'S VOICE: (Off stage) All right! Come on, Jessie! (Enter several\nchildren, led by SENATOR, and a game begins in front of the store as\nJOE CLARK and HAMBO play checkers.)\n\nJOE CLARK: I God! Hambo, you can't play no checkers.\n\nHAMBO: (As they seat themselves at the check board) Aw, man, if you\nwasn't de Mayor I'd beat you all de time.\n\n(The children get louder and louder, drowning out the men's voices.)\n\nSMALL GIRL: I'm gointer be de hen.\n\nBOY: And I'm gointer be de hawk. Lemme git maself a stick to mark wid.\n\n(The boy who is the hawk squats center stage with a short twig in his\nhand. The largest girl lines up the other children behind her.)\n\nGIRL: (Mother Hen) (Looking back over her flock): Y'all ketch holt of\none 'Nother's clothes so de hawk can't git yuh. (They do.) You all\nstraight now?\n\nCHILDREN: Yeah. (The march around the hawk commences.)\n\nHEN AND CHICKS:\n  Chick mah chick mah craney crow\n  Went to de well to wash ma toe\n  When I come back ma chick was gone\n  What time, ole witch?\n\nHAWK: (Making a tally on the ground) One!\n\nHEN AND CHICKS: (Repeat song and march.)\n\nHAWK: (Scoring again) Two!\n\n(Can be repeated any number of times.)\n\nHAWK: Four. (He rises and imitates a hawk flying and trying to catch a\nchicken. Calling in a high voice:) Chickee.\n\nHEN: (Flapping wings to protect her young) My chickens sleep.\n\nHAWK: Chickee. (During all this the hawk is feinting and darting in\nhis efforts to catch a chicken, and the chickens are dancing\ndefensively, the hen trying to protect them.)\n\nHEN: My chicken's sleep.\n\nHAWK: I shall have a chick.\n\nHEN: You shan't have a chick.\n\nHAWK: I'm goin' home. (Flies off)\n\nHEN: Dere's de road.\n\nHAWK: My pot's a boilin'.\n\nHEN: Let it boil.\n\nHAWK: My guts a growlin'.\n\nHEN: Let 'em growl.\n\nHAWK: I must have a chick.\n\nHEN: You shan't have n'airn.\n\nHAWK: My mama's sick.\n\nHEN: Let her die.\n\nHAWK: Chickie!\n\nHEN: My chicken's sleep.\n\n(HAWK darts quickly around the hen and grabs a chicken and leads him\noff and places his captive on his knees at the store porch. After a\nbrief bit of dancing he catches another, then a third, etc.)\n\nHAMBO: (At the checker board, his voice rising above the noise of the\nplaying children, slapping his sides jubilantly) Ha! Ha! I got you\nnow. Go ahead on and move, Joe Clark ... jus' go ahead on and move.\n\nLOUNGERS: (Standing around two checker players) Ol' Deacon's got you\nnow.\n\nANOTHER VOICE: Don't see how he can beat the Mayor like that.\n\nANOTHER VOICE: Got him in the Louisville loop. (These remarks are\ndrowned by the laughter of the playing children directly in front of\nthe porch. MAYOR JOE CLARK disturbed in his concentration on the\ncheckers and peeved at being beaten suddenly turns toward the\nchildren, throwing up his hands.)\n\nCLARK: Get on 'way from here, you limbs of Satan, making all that\nracket so a man can't hear his ears. Go on, go on!\n\n(THE MAYOR looks about excitedly for the town marshall. Seeing him\nplaying cards on the other side of porch, he bellows:)\n\nLum Boger, whyn't you git these kids away from here! What kind of a\nmarshall is you? All this passle of young'uns around here under grown\npeople's feet, creatin' disorder in front of my store.\n\n(LUM BOGER puts his cards down lazily, comes down stage and scatters\nthe children away. One saucy little girl refuses to move.)\n\nLUM BOGER: Why'nt you go on away from here, Matilda? Didn't you hear\nme tell you-all to move?\n\nLITTLE MATILDA: (Defiantly) I ain't goin' nowhere. You ain't none of\nmy mama. (Jerking herself free from him as LUM touches her.) My mama\nin the store and she told me to wait out here. So take that, ol' Lum.\n\nLUM BOGER: You impudent little huzzy, you! You must smell yourself ...\nyouse so fresh.\n\nMATILDA: The wind musta changed and you smell your own top lip.\n\nLUM BOGER: Don't make me have to grab you and take you down a\nbuttonhole lower.\n\nMATILDA: (Switching her little head) Go ahead on and grab me. You sho\ncan't kill me, and if you kill me, you sho can't eat me. (She marches\ninto the store.)\n\nSENATOR: (Derisively from behind stump) Ol' dumb Lum! Hey! Hey!\n\n(LITTLE BOY at edge of stage thumbs his nose at the marshall.)\n\n(LUM lumbers after the small boy. Both exit.)\n\nHAMBO: (To CLARK who has been thinking all this while what move to\nmake) You ain't got but one move ... go ahead on and make it. What's\nde matter, Mayor?\n\nCLARK: (Moving his checker) Aw, here.\n\nHAMBO: (Triumphant) Now! Look at him, boys. I'm gonna laugh in notes.\n(Laughing to the scale and jumping a checker each time) Do, sol, fa,\nme, lo ... one! (Jumping another checker) La, sol, fa, me, do ... two!\n(Another jump.) Do sol, re, me, lo ... three! (Jumping a third.) Lo\nsol, fa, me, re ... four! (The crowd begins to roar with laughter. LUM\nBOGER returns, looking on. Children come drifting back again playing\nchick-me-chick-me-cranie crow.)\n\nVOICE: Oh, ha! Done got the ol' tush hog.\n\nANOTHER VOICE: Thought you couldn't be beat, Brother Mayor?\n\nCLARK: (Peeved, gets up and goes into the store mumbling) Oh, I coulda\nbeat you if I didn't have this store on my mind. Saturday afternoon\nand I got work to do. Lum, ain't I told you to keep them kids from\nplayin' right in front of this store?\n\n(LUM makes a pass at the nearest half-grown boy. The kids dart around\nhim teasingly.)\n\nANOTHER VOICE: Eh, heh.... Hambo done run him on his store ... done\nrun the ol' coon in his hole.\n\nANOTHER VOICE: That ain't good politics, Hambo, beatin' the Mayor.\n\nANOTHER VOICE: Well, Hambo, you don't got to be so hard at checkers,\ncome on let's see what you can do with de cards. Lum Boger there got\nhis hands full nursin' the chilluns.\n\nANOTHER VOICE: (At the table) We ain't playin' for money, nohow,\nDeacon. We just playin' a little Florida Flip.\n\nHAMBO: Ya all can't play no Florida Flip. When I was a sinner there\nwasn't a man in this state could beat me playin' that game. But I'm a\ndeacon in Macedonia Baptist now and I don't bother with the cards no\nmore.\n\nVOICE AT CARD TABLE: All right, then, come on here Tony (To man with\nbasket on steps.) let me catch your jack.\n\nTAYLOR: (Looking toward door) I don't reckon I got time. I guess my\nwife gonna get through buying out that store some time or other and\nwant to go home.\n\nOLD MAN: (On opposite side of porch from card game) I bet my wife\nwould know better than expect me to sit around and wait for her with a\nbasket. Whyn't you tell her to tote it on home herself?\n\nTAYLOR: (Sighing and shaking his head.) Eh, Lawd!\n\nVOICE AT CARD TABLE: Look like we can't get nobody to come into this\ngame. Seem like everybody's scared a us. Come on back here, Lum, and\ntake your hand. (LUM makes a final futile gesture at the children.)\n\nLUM: Ain't I tole you little haitians to stay away from here?\n\n(CHILDREN scatter teasingly only to return to their play in front of\nthe store later on. LUM comes up on the porch and re-joins the card\ngame. Just as he gets seated, MRS. CLARK comes to the door of the\nstore and calls him.)\n\nMRS. CLARK: (Drawlingly) Columbus!\n\nLUM: (Wearily) Ma'am?\n\nMRS. CLARK: De Mayor say for you to go round in de back yard and tie\nup old lady Jackson's mule what's trampin' aup all de tomatoes in my\ngarden.\n\nLUM: All right. (Leaving card game.) Wait till I come back, folkses.\n\nLIGE: Oh, hum! (Yawning and putting down the deck of cards) Lum's sho\na busy marshall. Say, ain't Dave and Jim been round here yet? I feel\nkinder like hearin' a little music 'bout now.\n\nBOY: Naw, they ain't been here today. You-all know they ain't so thick\nnohow as they was since Daisy Bailey come back and they started\nrunnin' after her.\n\nWOMAN: You mean since she started runnin' after them, the young hussy.\n\nMRS. CLARK: (In doorway) She don't mean 'em no good.\n\nWALTER: That's a shame, ain't it now? (Enter LUM from around back of\nstore. He jumps on the porch and takes his place at the card box.)\n\nLUM: (To the waiting players) All right, boys! Turn it on and let the\nbad luck happen.\n\nLIGE: My deal. (He begins shuffling the cards with an elaborate\nfan-shape movement.)\n\nVOICE AT TABLE: Look out there, Lige, you shuffling mighty lot. Don't\ncarry the cub to us.\n\nLIGE: Aw, we ain't gonna cheat you ... we gonna beat you. (He slams\ndown the cards for LUM BOGER to cut.) Wanta cut 'em?\n\nLUM: No, ain't no need of cutting a rabbit out when you can twist him\nout. Deal 'em. (LIGE deals out the cards.)\n\nCLARK'S VOICE: (Inside the store) You, Mattie! (MRS. CLARK, who has\nbeen standing in the DOE, quickly turns and goes inside.)\n\nLIGE: Y-e-e-e! Spades! (The game is started.)\n\nLUM: Didn't snatch that jack, did you?\n\nLIGE: Aw, no, ain't snatched no jack. Play.\n\nWALTER: (LUM'S partner) Well, here it is, partner. What you want me to\nplay for you?\n\nLUM: Play jus' like I'm in New York, partner. But we gotta try to\ncatch that jack.\n\nLIGE: (Threateningly) Stick out your hand and draw back a nub.\n\n(WALTER THOMAS plays.)\n\nWALTER: I'm playin' a diamond for you, partner.\n\nLUM: I done tole you you ain't got no partner.\n\nLIGE: Heh, Heh! Partner, we got 'em. Pull off wid your king. Dey got\nto play 'em. (When that trick is turned, triumphantly:) Didn't I tell\nyou, partner? (Stands on his feet and slams down with his ace\nviolently) Now, come up under this ace. Aw, hah, look at ol' low,\npartner. I knew I was gonna catch 'em. (When LUM plays) Ho, ho, there\ngoes the queen.... Now, the jack's a gentleman.... Now, I'm playin' my\nknots. (Everybody plays and the hand is ended.) Partner, high, low,\njack and the game and four.\n\nWALTER: Give me them cards. I believe you-all done give me the cub\nthat time. Look at me ... this is Booker T Washington dealing these\ncards. (Shuffles cards grandly and gives them to LIGE to cut.) Wanta\ncut 'em?\n\nLIGE: Yeah, cut 'em and shoot 'em. I'd cut behind my ma. (He cuts the\ncards.)\n\nWALTER: (Turning to player at left, FRANK, LIGE'S partner) What you\nsaying, Frank?\n\nFRANK: I'm beggin'. (LIGE is trying to peep at cards.)\n\nWALTER: (Turning to LIGE) Stop peepin' at them cards, Lige. (To FRANK)\nDid you say you was beggin' or standin'?\n\nFRANK: I'm beggin'.\n\nWALTER: Get up off your knees. Go ahead and tell 'em I sent you.\n\nFRANK: Well, that makes us four.\n\nWALTER: I don't care if you is. (Pulls a quarter out of his pocket and\nlays it down on the box.) Twenty-five cents says I know the best one.\nLet's go. (Everybody puts down a quarter.)\n\nFRANK: What you want me to play for you partner?\n\nLIGE: Play me a club. (The play goes around to dealer, WALTER, who\ngets up and takes the card off the top of the deck and slams it down\non the table.)\n\nWALTER: Get up ol' deuce of deamonds and gallop off with your load.\n(TO LUM) Partner, how many times you seen the deck?\n\nLUM: Two times.\n\nWALTER: Well, then I'm gonna pull off, partner. Watch this ol' queen.\n(Everyone plays) Ha! Ha! Wash day and no soap. (Takes the jack of\ndiamonds and sticks him up on his forehead. Stands up on his feet.)\nPartner, I'm dumping to you ... play your king. (When it comes to his\nplay LUM, too, stands up. The others get up and they, too, excitedly\nslam their cards down.) Now, come on in this kitchen and let me splice\nthat cabbage! (He slams down the ace of diamonds. Pats the jack on his\nfor head, sings:) Hey, hey, back up, jenny, get your load. (Talking)\nDump to that jack, boys, dump to it. High, low, jack and the game and\nfour. One to go. We're four wid you, boys.\n\nLIGE: Yeah, but you-all playin' catch-up.\n\nFRANK: Gimme them cards ... lemme deal some.\n\nLIGE: Frank, now you really got responsibility on you. They's got one\ngame on us.\n\nFRANK: Aw, man, I'm gonna deal 'em up a mess. This deal's in the White\nHouse. (He shuffles and puts the cards down for WALTER to cut.) Cut\n'em.\n\nWALTER: Nope, I never cut green timber. (FRANK deals and turns the\ncard up.)\n\nFRANK: Hearts, boys. (He turns up an ace.)\n\nLUM: Aw, you snatched that ace, nigger.\n\nWALTER: Yeah, they done carried the cub to us, partner.\n\nLIGE: Oh, he didn't do no such a thing. That ace was turned fair. We\njus' too hard for you ... we eats our dinner out a the blacksmith\nshop.\n\nWALTER: Aw, you all cheatin'. You know it wasn't fair.\n\nFRANK: Aw, shut up, you all jus' whoopin' and hollerin' for nothin'.\nTryin' to bully the game. (FRANK and LIGE rise and shake hands\ngrandly.)\n\nLIGE: Mr. Hoover, you sho is a noble president. We done stuck these\nniggers full of cobs. They done got scared to play us.\n\nLIGE (?) Scared to play you? Get back down to this table, let me\nspread my mess.\n\nLOUNGER: Yonder comes Elder Simms. You all better squat that rabbit.\nThey'll be having you all up in the church for playin' cards.\n\n(FRANK grabs up the cards and puts them in his pocket quickly.\nEverybody picks up the money and looks unconcerned as the preacher\nenters. Enter ELDER SIMMS with his two prim-looking little children by\nthe hand.)\n\nELDER SIMMS: How do, children. Right warm for this time in November,\nain't it?\n\nVOICE: Yes sir, Reverend, sho is. How's Sister Simms?\n\nSIMMS: She's feelin' kinda po'ly today. (Goes on in store with his\nchildren)\n\nVOICE: (Whispering loudly) Don't see how that great big ole powerful\nwoman could be sick. Look like she could go bear huntin' with her\nfist.\n\nANOTHER VOICE: She look jus' as good as you-all's Baptist pastor's\nwife. Pshaw, you ain't seen no big woman, nohow, man. I seen one once\nso big she went to whip her little boy and he run up under her belly\nand hid six months 'fore she could find him.\n\nANOTHER VOICE: Well, I knowed a woman so little that she had to get up\non a soap box to look over a grain of sand.\n\n(REV. SIMMS comes out of store, each child behind him sucking a stick\nof candy.)\n\nSIMMS: (To his children) Run on home to your mother and don't get\ndirty on the way. (The two children start primly off down the street\nbut just out of sight one of them utters a loud cry.)\n\nSIMMS'S CHILD: (Off stage) Papa, papa. Nunkie's trying to lick my\ncandy.\n\nSIMMS: I told you to go on and leave them other children alone.\n\nVOICE ON PORCH: (Kidding) Lum, whyn't you tend to your business.\n\n(TOWN MARSHALL rises and shoos the children off again.)\n\nLUM: You all varmints leave them nice chillun alone.\n\nLIGE: (Continuing the lying on porch) Well, you all done seen so much,\nbut I bet you ain't never seen a snake as big as the one I saw when I\nwas a boy up in middle Georgia. He was so big couldn't hardly move his\nself. He laid in one spot so long he growed moss on him and everybody\nthought he was a log, till one day I set down on him and went to\nsleep, and when I woke up that snake done crawled to Florida. (Loud\nlaughter.)\n\nFRANK: (Seriously) Layin' all jokes aside though now, you all remember\nthat rattlesnake I killed last year was almost as big as that Georgia\nsnake.\n\nVOICE: How big, you say it was, Frank?\n\nFRANK: Maybe not quite as big as that, but jus' about fourteen feet.\n\nVOICE: (Derisively) Gimme that lyin' snake. That snake wasn't but four\nfoot long when you killed him last year and you done growed him ten\nfeet in a year.\n\nANOTHER VOICE: Well, I don't know about that. Some of the snakes\naround here is powerful long. I went out in my front yard yesterday\nright after the rain and killed a great big ol' cottonmouth.\n\nSIMMS: This sho is a snake town. I certainly can't raise no chickens\nfor 'em. They kill my little biddies jus' as fast as they hatch out.\nAnd yes ... if I hadn't cut them weeds out of the street in front of\nmy parsonage, me or some of my folks woulda been snake-bit right at\nour front door. (To whole crowd) Whyn't you all cut down these weeds\nand clean up these streets?\n\nHAMBO: Well, the Mayor ain't said nothin' 'bout it.\n\nSIMMS: When the folks misbehaves in this town I think they oughta lock\n'em up in a jail and make 'em work their fine out on the streets, then\nthese weeds would be cut down.\n\nVOICE: How we gonna do that when we ain't got no jail?\n\nSIMMS: Well, you sho needs a jail ... you-all needs a whole lot of\nimprovements round this town. I ain't never pastored no town so\nway-back as this one here.\n\nCLARK: (Who has lately emerged from the store, fanning himself,\noverhears this last remark and bristles up) What's that you say 'bout\nthis town?\n\nSIMMS: I say we needs some improvements here in this town ... that's\nwhat.\n\nCLARK: (In a powerful voice) And what improvements you figgers we\nneeds?\n\nSIMMS: A whole heap. Now, for one thing we really does need a jail,\nMayor. We oughta stop runnin' these people out of town that\nmisbehaves, and lock 'em up. Others towns has jails, everytown I ever\npastored had a jail. Don't see how come we can't have one.\n\nCLARK: (Towering angrily above the preacher) Now, wait a minute,\nSimms. Don't you reckon the man who knows how to start a town knows\nhow to run it? I paid two hundred dollars out of this right hand for\nthis land and walked out here and started this town befo' you was\nborn. I ain't like some of you new niggers, come here when grapes'\nripe. I was here to cut new ground, and I been Mayor ever since.\n\nSIMMS: Well, there ain't no sense in no one man stayin' Mayor all the\ntime.\n\nCLARK: Well, it's my town and I can be mayor jus' as long as I want\nto. It was me that put this town on the map.\n\nSIMMS: What map you put it on, Joe Clark? I ain't seen it on no map.\n\nCLARK: (Indignant) I God! Listen here, Elder Simms. If you don't like\nthe way I run this town, just' take your flat feets right on out and\ngit yonder crost the woods. You ain't been here long enough to say\nnothin' nohow.\n\nHAMBO: (From a nail keg) Yeah, you Methodist niggers always telling\npeople how to run things.\n\nTAYLOR: (Practically unheard by the others) We do so know how to run\nthings, don't we? Ain't Brother Mayor a Methodist, and ain't the\nschool-teacher a ...? (His remarks are drowned out by the others.)\n\nSIMMS: No, we don't like the way you're runnin' things. Now looka\nhere, (Pointing at the Marshall) You got that lazy Lum Boger here for\nmarshall and he ain't old enough to be dry behind his ears yet ... and\nall these able-bodied means in this town! You won't 'low nobody else\nto run a store 'ceptin' you. And looka yonder (happening to notice the\nstreet light) only street lamp in town, you got in front of your\nplace. (Indignantly) We pay the taxes and you got the lamp.\n\nVILLAGER: Don't you-all fuss now. How come you two always yam-yamming\nat each other?\n\nCLARK: How come this fly-by-night Methodist preacher over here ...\nain't been here three months ... tries to stand up on my store porch\nand tries to tell me how to run my town? (MATTIE CLARK, the Mayor's\nwife, comes timidly to the door, wiping her hands on her apron.) Ain't\nno man gonna tell me how to run my town. I God, I 'lected myself in\nand I'm gonna run it. (Turns and sees wife standing in door.\nCommandingly.) I God, Mattie, git on back in there and wait on that\nstore!\n\nMATTIE: (Timidly) Jody, somebody else wantin' stamps.\n\nCLARK: I God, woman, what good is you? Gwan, git in. Look like between\nwomen and preachers a man can't have no peace. (Exit CLARK.)\n\nSIMMS: (Continuing his argument) Now, when I pastored in Jacksonville\nyou oughta see what kinda jails they got there....\n\nLOUNGER: White folks needs jails. We colored folks don't need no jail.\n\nANOTHER VILLAGER: Yes, we do, too. Elder Simms is right....\n\n(The argument becomes a hubbub of voices.)\n\nTAYLOR: (Putting down his basket) Now, I tell you a jail....\n\nMRS. TAYLOR: (Emerging from the store door, arms full of groceries,\nlooking at her husband) Yeah, and if you don't shut up and git these\nrations home I'm gonna be worse on you than a jail and six judges.\nPickup that basket and let's go. (TONY meekly picks up the basket and\nhe and his wife exit as the sound of an approaching guitar is heard\noff stage.)\n\n(Two carelessly dressed, happy-go-lucky fellows enter together. One is\nfingering a guitar without playing any particular tune, and the other\nhas his hat cocked over his eyes in a burlesque, dude-like manner.\nThere are casual greetings.)\n\nWALTER: Hey, there, bums, how's tricks?\n\nLIGE: What yo' sayin', boys?\n\nHAMBO: Good evenin' sons.\n\nLIGE: How did you-all make out this evenin', boys?\n\nJIM: Oh, them white folks at the party shelled out right well. Kept\nDave busy pickin' it up. How much did we make today, Dave?\n\nDAVE: (Striking his pocket) I don't know, boy, but feels right heavy\nhere. Kept me pickin' up money just like this.... (As JIM picks a few\ndance chords, Dave gives a dance imitation of how he picked up the\ncoins from the ground as the white folks threw them.) We count it\nafter while. Woulda divided up with you already if you hadn't left me\nwhen you seen Daisy comin' by. Let's sit down on the porch and rest\nnow.\n\nLIGE: She sho is lookin' stylish and pretty since she come back with\nher white folks from up North. Wearin' the swellest clothes. And that\ncoal-black hair of hers jus' won't quit.\n\nMATTIE CLARK: (In doorway) I don't see what the mens always hanging\nafter Daisy Taylor for.\n\nCLARK: (Turning around on the porch) I God, you back here again. Who's\ntendin' that store? (MATTIE disappears inside.)\n\nDAVE: Well, she always did look like new money to me when she was here\nbefore.\n\nJIM: Well, that's all you ever did get was a look.\n\nDAVE: That's all you know! I bet I get more than that now.\n\nJIM: You might git it but I'm the man to use it. I'm a bottom fish.\n\nDAVE: Aw, man. You musta been walking round here fast asleep when\nDaisy was in this county last. You ain't seen de go I had with her.\n\nJIM: No, I ain't seen it. Bet you didn't have no letter from her while\nshe been away.\n\nDAVE: Bet you didn't neither.\n\nJIM: Well, it's just cause she can't write. If she knew how to scratch\nwith a pencil I'd had a ton of 'em.\n\nDAVE: Shaw, man! I'd had a post office full of 'em.\n\nOLD WOMAN: You-all ought to be shame, carrying on over a brazen heifer\nlike Daisy Taylor. Jus' cause she's been up North and come back, I\nreckon you cutting de fool sho 'nough now. She ain't studying none of\nyou-all nohow. All she wants is what you got in your pocket.\n\nJIM: I likes her but she won't git nothin' outa me. She never did. I\nwouldn't give a poor consumpted cripple crab a crutch to cross the\nRiver Jurdon.\n\nDAVE: I know I ain't gonna give no woman nothin'. I wouldn't give a\ndog a doughnut if he treed a terrapin.\n\nLIGE: Youse a cottontail dispute ... both of you. You'd give her\nanything you got. You'd give her Georgia with a fence 'round it.\n\nOLD MAN: Yeah, and she'd take it, too.\n\nLINDSAY: Don't distriminate the woman like that. That ain't nothing\nbut hogism. Ain't nothin' the matter with Daisy, she's all right.\n\n(Enter TEETS and BOOTSIE tittering coyly and switching themselves.)\n\nBOOTSIE: Is you seen my mama?\n\nOLD WOMAN: You know you ain't lookin' for no mama. Jus' come back down\nhere to show your shape and fan around awhile. (BOOTSIE and TEETS\ngoing into the store.)\n\nBOOTSIE & TEETS: No, we ain't. We'se come to get our mail.\n\nOLD WOMAN: (After girls enter store) Why don't you all keep up some\nattention to these nice girls here, Bootsie and Teets. They wants to\nmarry.\n\nDAVE: Aw, who thinkin' 'bout marryin' now? They better stay home and\neat their own pa's rations. I gotta buy myself some shoes.\n\nJIM: The woman I'm gonna marry ain't born yet and her maw is dead.\n\n(GIRLS come out giggling and exit.) (JIM begins to strum his guitar\nlightly at first as the talk goes on.)\n\nCLARK: (To DAVE and JIM) Two of the finest gals that ever lived and\nfriendly jus' like you-all is. You two boys better take 'em back and\nstop them shiftless ways.\n\nHAMBO: Yeah, hurry up and do somethin'! I wants to taste a piece yo'\nweddin' cake.\n\nJIM: (Embarrassed but trying to be jocular) Whut you trying to rush\nme up so fast?... Look at Will Cody here (Pointing to little man on\nporch) he been promising to bring his already wife down for two\nmonths ... and nair one of us ain't seen her yet.\n\nDAVE: Yeah, how you speck me to haul in a brand new wife when he can't\nlead a wagon-broke wife eighteen miles? Me, I'm going git one soon's\nCody show me his'n. (General sly laughter at CODY'S expense.)\n\nWALTER: (Snaps his fingers and pretends to remember something) Thass\nright, Cody. I been intending to tell you.... I know where you kin buy\na ready-built house for you and yo' wife. (Calls into the store.) Hey,\nClark, cime on out here and tell Cody 'bout dat Bradley house. (To\nCODY.) I know you wants to git a place of yo' own so you kin settle\ndown.\n\nHAMBO: He done moved so much since he been here till every time he\nwalk out in his back yeard his chickens lay down and cross they legs.\n\nLINDSAY: Cody, I thought you tole us you was going up to Sanford to\nbring dat 'oman down here last Sat'day.\n\nLIGE: That ain't de way he tole me 'bout it. Look, fellers, (Getting\nup and putting one hand on his hips and one finger of the other hand\nagainst his chin coquettishly) Where you reckon I'll be next Sat'day\nnight?... Sittin' up side of Miz Cody. (Great burst of laughter.)\n\nSYKES JONES: (Laughing) Know what de folks tole me in Sanford? Dat was\nanother man's wife. (Guffaws.)\n\nCODY: (Feebly) Aw, you don't know whut you talkin' bout.\n\nJONES: Naw, I don't know, but de folks in Sanford does. (Laughing) Dey\ntell me when dat lady's husband come home Sat'day night, ole Cody\njumped out de window. De man grabbed his old repeater and run out in\nde yard to head him off. When Cody seen him come round de corner de\nhouse (Gesture) he flopped his wings and flew up on de fence. De man\nthowed dat shotgun dead on him. (Laughs) Den, man! Cody flopped his\nwings lak a buzzard (Gesture) and sailed on off. De man dropped to his\nknees lak dis (Gesture of kneeling on one knee and taking aim) Die!\ndie! die! (Supposedly sound of shots as the gun is moved in a circle\nfollowing the course of Cody's supposed flight) Cody just flew right\non off and lit on a hill two miles off. Then, man! (Gesture of swift\nflight) In ten minutes he was back here in Eatonville and in he bed.\n\nWALTER: I passed there and seen his house shakin', but I didn't know\nhow come.\n\nHAMBO: Aw, leave de boy alone.... If you don't look out some of y'all\ngoing to have to break his record.\n\nLIGE: I'm prepared to break it now. (General laughter.)\n\nJIM: Well, anyhow, I don't want to marry and leave Dave ... yet\nawhile. (Picking a chord.)\n\nDAVE: And I ain't gonna leave Jim. We been palling around together\never since we hollered titty mama, ain't we, boy?\n\nJIM: Sho is. (Music of the guitar increases in volume. DAVE shuffles a\nfew steps and the two begin to sing.)\n\nJIM:\n  Rabbit on the log.\n  I ain't got no dog.\n  How am I gonna git him?\n  God knows.\n\nDAVE:\n  Rabbit on the log.\n  Ain't got no dog.\n  Shoot him with my rifle\n  Bam! Bam!\n\n(Some of the villagers join in song and others get up and march around\nthe porch in time with the music. BOOTSIE and TEETS re-enter, TEETS\nsticking her letter down the neck of her blouse. JOE LINDSAY grabs\nTEETS and WALTER THOMAS grabs BOOTSIE. There is dancing, treating and\ngeneral jollification. Little children dance the parse-me-la. The\nmusic fills the air just as the sun begins to go down. Enter DAISY\nTAYLOR coming down the road toward the store.)\n\nCLARK: (Bawls out from the store porch) I God, there's Daisy again.\n\n(Most of the dancing stops, the music slows down and then stops\ncompletely. DAVE and JIM greet DAISY casually as she approaches the\nporch.)\n\nJIM: Well, Daisy, we knows you, too.\n\nDAVE: Gal, youse jus' as pretty as a speckled pup.\n\nDAISY: (Giggling) I see you two boys always playin' and singin'\ntogether. That music sounded right good floating down the road.\n\nJIM: Yeah, child, we'se been playin' for the white folks all week.\nWe'se playin' for the colored now.\n\nDAVE: (Showing off, twirling his dancing feet) Yeah, we're standin' on\nour abstract and livin' on our income.\n\nOLD MAN: Um-ump, but they ain't never workin'. Just round here playing\nas usual.\n\nJIM: Some folks think you ain't workin' lessen you smellin' a mule.\n(He sits back down on box and picks at his guitar.) Think you gotta\nbe beatin' a man to his barn every mornin'.\n\nVOICE: Glad to be round home with we-all again, ain't you Daisy?\n\nDAISY: Is I glad? I jus' got off special early this evenin' to come\nover here and see everybody. I was kinda 'fraid sundown would catch me\n'fore I got round that lake. Don't know how I'm gonna walk back to my\nworkin' place in the dark by muself.\n\nDAVE: Don't no girl as good-lookin' as you is have to go home by\nherself tonight.\n\nJIM: No, cause I'm here.\n\nDAVE: (To DAISY) Don't you trust yourself round that like wid all them\n'gators and moccasins with that nigger there, Daisy (Pointing at JIM)\nHe's jus' full of rabbit blood. What you need is a real man ... with\ngood feet. (Cutting a dance step.)\n\nDAISY: I ain't thinking 'bout goin' home yet. I'm goin' in the store.\n\nJIM: What you want in the store?\n\nDAISY: I want some gum.\n\nDAVE: (Starting toward door) Girl, you don't have to go in there to\ngit no gum. I'll go in there and buy you a carload of gum. What kind\nyou want?\n\nDAISY: Bubble gum. (DAVE goes in the store with his hand in his\npocket. The sun is setting and the twilight deepens.)\n\nJIM: (Pulling package out of his pocket and laughing) Here your gum,\nbaby. What it takes to please the ladies, I totes it. I don't have to\ngo get it, like Dave. What you gimme for it?\n\nDAISY: A bushel and a peck, and a hug around the neck. (She embraces\nJIM playfully. He hands her the gum, patting his shoulder as he sits\non box.) Oh, thank you. Youse a ready man.\n\nJIM: Yeah, there's a lot of good parts to me. You can have West Tampa\nif you want it.\n\nDAISY: You always was a nice quiet boy, Jim.\n\nDAVE: (Emerging from the store with a package of gum) Here's your gum,\nDaisy.\n\nJIM: Oh, youse late. She's done got gum now. Chaw that yourself.\n\nDAVE: (Slightly peeved and surprised) Hunh, you mighty fast here now\nwith Daisy but you wasn't that fast gettin' out of that white man's\nchicken house last week.\n\nJIM: Who you talkin' 'bout?\n\nDAVE: Hoo-oo? (Facetiously) You ain't no owl. Your feet don't fit no\nlimb.\n\nJIM: Aw, nigger, hush.\n\nDAVE: Aw, hush, yourself. (He walks away for a minute as DAISY turns\nto meet some newcomers. DAVE throws his package of gum down on the\nground. It breaks and several children scramble for the pieces. An old\nman, very drunk, carrying an empty jug enters on left and staggers\ntipsily across stage.) (MAYOR JOE CLARK emerges from the store and\nlooks about for his marshall.)\n\nCLARK: (Bellowing) Lum Boger!\n\nLUM BOGER: (Eating a stalk of cane) Yessir!\n\nCLARK: I God, Lum, take your lazy self off that keg and go light that\ntown lamp. All summer long you eatin' up my melon, and all winter long\nyou chawin' up my cane. What you think this town is payin' you for?\nLaying round here doin' nothin'? Can't you see it's gettin' dark?\n\n(LUM BOGER rises lazily and takes the soap box down stage, stands on\nit to light the lamp, discovers no oil in it and goes in store. In a\nfew moments he comes out of store, fills the lamp and lights it.)\n\nDAISY: (Coming back toward JIM) Ain't you all gonna play and sing a\nlittle somethin' for me? I ain't heard your all's music much for so\nlong.\n\nJIM: Play anything you want, Daisy. Don't make no difference what 'tis\nI can pick it. Where's that old coon, Dave? (Looking around for his\npartner.)\n\nLIGE: (Calling Dave, who is leaning against post at opposite end of\nporch) Come here, an' get warmed up for Daisy.\n\nDAVE: Aw, ma throat's tired.\n\nJIM: Leave the baby be.\n\nDAISY: Come on, sing a little, Dave.\n\nDAVE: (Going back toward Jim) Well, seeing who's asking ... all right.\nWhat song yo like, Daisy?\n\nDAISY: Um-m. Lemme think.\n\nVOICE ON PORCH: \"Got on the train, didn't have no fare\".\n\nDAISY: (Gaily) Yes, that one. That's a good one.\n\nJIM: (Begins to tune up. DAVE touches Daisy's hand.)\n\nVOICE: (In fun) Hunh, you all wouldn't play at the hall last week when\nwe asked you.\n\nVOICE OF SPITEFUL OLD WOMAN: Daisy wasn't here then.\n\nANOTHER VOICE: (Teasingly) All you got to do to some men is to shake a\nskirt tail in their face and they goes off their head.\n\nDAVE: (To JIM who is still tuning up) Come if you're comin' boy, let's\ngo if you gwine. (The full melody of the guitar comes out in a lively,\nold-fashioned tune.)\n\nVOICE: All right now, boys, do it for Daisy jus' as good as you do for\ndem white folks over in Maitland.\n\nDAVE & JIM: (Beginning to sing)\n  Got on the train,\n  Didn't have no fare,\n  But I rode some,\n  I rode some.\n  Got on the train,\n  Didn't have no fare,\n  But I rode some,\n  But I rode some.\n  Got on the train,\n  Didn't have no fare,\n  Conductor asked me what I'm doin' there,\n  But I rode some!\n\n  Grabbed me by the neck\n  And led me to the door.\n  But I rode some,\n  But I rode some.\n  Grabbed me by the neck\n  And led me to the door.\n  But I rode some,\n  But I rode some.\n  Grabbed me by the neck,\n  And led me to the door.\n  Rapped me cross the head with a forty-four,\n  But I rode some.\n\n  First thing I saw in jail\n  Was a pot of peas.\n  But I rode some,\n  But I rode some.\n  First thing I saw in jail\n  Was a pot of peas.\n  But I rode some,\n  But I rode some.\n  The peas was good,\n  The meat was fat,\n  Fell in love with the chain gang jus' for that,\n  But I rode some.\n\n(DAVE acts out the song in dancing pantomime and when it ends there\nare shouts and general exclamations of approval from the crowd.)\n\nVOICES: I don't blame them white folks for goin' crazy 'bout that....\n\nOLD MAN: Oh, when I was a young boy I used to swing the gals round on\nthat piece.\n\nDAISY: (TO JIM) Seem like your playin' gits better and better.\n\nDAVE: (Quickly) And how 'bout my singin'? (Everybody laughs.)\n\nVOICES IN THE CROWD: Ha! Ha! Ol' Dave's gittin' jealous when she\nspeaks o' Jim.\n\nJIM: (To DAVE, in fun) Ain't nothin' to it but my playin'. You ain't\ngot no singin' voice. If that's singin', God's a gopher.\n\nDAVE: (Half-seriously) My singin' is a whole lot better'n your\nplayin'. You jus' go along and fram. The reason why the white folks\ngives us money is cause I'm singin'.\n\nJIM: Yeah?\n\nDAVE: And you can't dance.\n\nVOICE IN THE CROWD: You oughta dance. Big as your feet is, Dave.\n\nDAISY: (Diplomatically) Both of you all is wonderful and I would like\nto see Dave dance a little.\n\nDAVE: There now, I told you. What did I tell you. (To JIM) Stop\nwoofing and pick a little tune there so that I can show Daisy\nsomethin'.\n\nJIM: Pick a tune? I bet if you fool with me I'll pick your bones jus'\nlike a buzzard did the rabbit. You can't sing and now you wants to\ndance.\n\nDAVE: Yeah, and I'll lam your head. Come on and play,\ngood-for-nothing.\n\nJIM: All right, then. You say you can dance ... show these people what\nyou can do. But don't bring that little stuff I been seein' you doin'\nall these years. (JIM plays and DAVE dances, various members of the\ncrowd keep time with their hands and feet, DAISY looks on enjoying\nherself immensely.)\n\nDAISY: (As DAVE cuts a very fancy step) I ain't seen nothin' like this\nup North. Dave you sho hot.\n\n(As DAVE cuts a more complicated step the crowd applauds, but just as\nthe show begins to get good, suddenly JIM stops playing.)\n\nDAVE: (Surprised) What's the matter, buddy?\n\nJIM: (Envious of the attention DAVE has been getting from DAISY,\ndisgustedly) Oh, nigger, I'm tired of seein' you cut the fool. 'Sides\nthat, I been playin' all afternoon for the white folks.\n\nDAISY: But I though you was playin' for me now, Jim.\n\nJIM: Yeah, I'd play all night long for you, but I'm gettin' sick of\nDave round here showin' off. Let him git somethin' and play for\nhimself if he can. (An OLD MAN with a lighted lantern enters.)\n\nDAISY: (Coyly) Well, honey, play some more for me, then, and don't\nmind Dave. I reckon he done danced enough. Play me \"Shake That\nThing\".\n\nOLD MAN WITH LANTERN: Sho, you ain't stopped, is you, boy? Music sound\nmighty good floatin' down that dark road.\n\nOLD WOMAN: Yeah, Jim, go on play a little more. Don't get to acting so\nniggerish this evening.\n\nDAVE: Aw, let the ol' darky alone. Nobody don't want to hear him play,\nnohow. I know I don't.\n\nJIM: Well, I'm gonna play. (And he begins to pick \"Shake That Thing\".\nTEETS and BOOTSIE begin to dance with LIGE MOSELY and FRANK WARRICK.\nAs the tune gets good, DAVE cannot resist the music either.)\n\nDAVE: Old nigger's eveil but he sho can play. (He begins to do a few\nsteps by himself, then twirls around in front of DAISY and approaches\nher. DAISY, overcome by the music, begins to step rhythmically toward\nDAVE and together they dance unobserved by JIM, absorbed in picking\nhis guitar.)\n\nDAISY: Look here, baby, at this new step I learned up North.\n\nDAVE: You can show me anything, sugar lump.\n\nDAISY: Hold me tight now. (But just as they begin the new movement JIM\nnotices DAISY and DAVE. He stops playing again and lays his guitar\ndown.)\n\nVOICES IN THE CROWD: (Disgustedly) Aw, come on, Jim.... You must be\njealous....\n\nJIM: No, I ain't jealous. I jus' get tired of seein' that ol' nigger\nclownin' all the time.\n\nDAVE: (Laughing and pointing to JIM on porch) Look at that mad baby.\nTake that lip up off the ground. Got your mouth stuck out jus' because\nsome one is enjoying themselves. (He comes up and pushes JIM\nplayfully.)\n\nJIM: You better go head and let me alone. (TO DAISY) Come here,\nDaisy!\n\nLIGE: That's just what I say. Niggers can't have no fun without\nsomeone getting mad ... specially over a woman.\n\nJIM: I ain't mad.... Daisy, 'scuse me, honey, but that fool, Dave....\n\nDAVE: I ain't mad neither.... Jim always tryin' to throw off on me.\nBut you can't joke him.\n\nDAISY: (Soothingly) Aw, now, now!\n\nJIM: You ain't jokin'. You means that, nigger. And if you tryin' to\nget hot, first thing, you can pull of my blue shirt you put on this\nmorning.\n\nDAVE: Youse a got that wrong. I ain't got on no shirt of yours.\n\nJIM: Yes, you is got on my shirt, too. Don't tell me you ain't got on\nmy shirt.\n\nDAVE: Well, even if I is, you can just lift your big plantations out\nof my shoes. You can just foot it home barefooted.\n\nJIM: You try to take any shoes offa me!\n\nLIGE: (Pacifying them) Aw, there ain't no use of all that. What you\nall want to start this quarreling for over a little jokin'.\n\nJIM: Nobody's quarreling.... I'm just playin' a little for Daisy and\nDave's out there clownin' with her.\n\nCLARK: (In doorway) I ain't gonna have no fussin' round my store, no\nway. Shut up, you all.\n\nJIM: Well, Mayor Clark, I ain't mad with him. We'se been friends all\nour lives. He's slept in my bed and wore my clothes and et my grub....\n\nDAVE: I et your grub? And many time as you done laid down with your\nbelly full of my grandma's collard greens. You done et my meat and\nbread a whole lot more times than I et your stewed fish-heads.\n\nJIM: I'd rather eat stewed fish-heads than steal out of other folkses\nhouses so much till you went to sleep on the roost and fell down one\nnight and broke up the settin' hen. (Loud laughter from the crowd)\n\nDAVE: Youse a liar if you say I stole anybody's chickens. I didn't\nhave to. But you ... 'fore you started goin' around with me, playin'\nthat little box of yours, you was so hungry you had the white mouth.\nIf it wasn't for these white folks throwin' _me_ money for _my_\ndancin', you would be thin as a whisper right now.\n\nJIM: (Laughing sarcastically) Your dancin'! You been leapin' around\nhere like a tailless monkey in a wash pot for a long time and nobody\nwas payin' no 'tention to you, till I come along playing.\n\nLINDSAY: Boys, boys, that ain't no way for friends to carry on.\n\nDAISY: Well, if you all gonna keep up this quarrelin' and carryin' on\nI'm goin' home. 'Bout time for me to be gittin' back to my white folks\nanyhow. It's dark now. I'm goin', even if I have to go by myself. I\nshouldn't a stopped by here nohow.\n\nJIM: (Stopping his quarrel) You ain't gonna go home by yourself. I'm\ngoin' with you.\n\nDAVE: (Singing softly)\n  It may be so,\n  I don't know.\n  But it sounds to me\n  Like a lie.\n\nWALTER: Dave ain't' got as much rabbit blood as folks thought.\n\nDAVE: Tell 'em 'bout me. (Turns to DAISY) Won't you choose a treat on\nme, Miss Daisy, 'fore we go?\n\nDAISY: (Coyly) Yessir, thank you. I wants a drink of soda water.\n\n(DAVE pulls his hat down over his eyes, whirls around and offers his\narm to DAISY. They strut into the store, DAVE gazing contemptuously at\nJIM as he passes. Crowd roars with laughter, much to the embarrassment\nof JIM.)\n\nLIGE: Ol' fast Dave jus' runnin' the hog right over you, Jim.\n\nWALTER: Thought you was such a hot man.\n\nLUM BOGER: Want me to go in there and put Daisy under arrest and bring\nher to you?\n\nJIM: (Sitting down on the edge of porch with one foot on the step and\nlights a cigarette pretending not to be bothered.) Aw, I'll get her\nwhen I want her. Let him treat her, but see who struts around that\nlake and down the railroad with her by and by.\n\n(DAVE and DAISY emerge from the store, each holding a bottle of red\nsoda pop and laughing together. As they start down the steps DAVE\naccidentally steps on JIM's outstretched foot. JIM jumps up and pushes\nDAVE back, causing him to spill the red soda all over his white shirt\nfront.)\n\nJIM: Stay off my foot, you big ox.\n\nDAVE: Well, you don't have to wet me all up, do you, and me in\ncompany? Why don't you put your damn foot in your pocket?\n\nDAISY: (Wiping DAVE'S shirt front with her handkerchief) Aw, ain't\nthat too bad.\n\nJIM: (To DAVE) Well, who's shirt did I wet? It's mine, anyhow, ain't\nit?\n\nDAVE: (Belligerently) Well, if it's your shirt, then you come take it\noff me. I'm tired of your lip.\n\nJIM: Well, I will.\n\nDAVE: Well, put your fist where you lip is. (Pushing DAISY aside.)\n\nDAISY: (Frightened) I want to go home. Now, don't you all boys fight.\n\n(JIM attempts to come up the steps. DAVE pushes him back and he\nstumbles and falls in the dust. General excitement as the crowd senses\na fight.)\n\nLITTLE BOY: (On the edge of crowd) Fight, fight, you're no kin. Kill\none another, won't be no sin. Fight, fight, you're no kin.\n\n(JIM jumps up and rushes for DAVE as the latter starts down the steps.\nDAVE meets him with his fist squarely in the face and causes him to\nstep backward, confused.)\n\nDAISY: (Still on porch, half crying) Aw, my Lawd! I want to go home.\n\n(General hubbub, women's cries of \"Don't let 'em fight.\" \"Why don't\nsomebody stop 'em?\" \"What kind of men is you all, sit there and let\nthem boys fight like that.\" Men's voices urging the fight: \"Aw, let\n'em fight.\" \"Go for him, Dave.\" \"Slug him, Jim.\"\n\nJIM makes another rush toward the steps. He staggers DAVE. DAVE knocks\nJIM sprawling once more. This time JIM grabs the mule bone as he\nrises, rushes DAVE, strikes DAVE over the head with it and knocks him\nout. DAVE falls prone on his back. There is great excitement.)\n\nOLD WOMAN: (Screams) Lawdy, is he kilt? (Several men rush to the\nfallen man.)\n\nVOICE: Run down to the pump and get a dipper o' water.\n\nCLARK: (To his wife in door) Mattie, come out of that store with a\nbottle of witch hazely oil quick as you can. Jim Weston, I'm gonna\narrest you for this. You Lum Boger. Where is that marshall? Lum Boger!\n(LUM BOGER detaches himself from the crowd.) Arrest Jim.\n\nLUM: (Grabs JIM'S arm, relieves him of the mule bone and looks\nhelplessly at the Mayor.) Now I got him arrested, what's I going to do\nwith him?\n\nCLARK: Lock him up back yonder in my barn till Monday when we'll have\nthe trial in de Baptist Church.\n\nLINDSAY: Yeah, just like all the rest of them Methodists ... always\ntryin' to take undercurrents on people.\n\nWALTER: Ain't no worse then some of you Baptists, nohow. You all don't\nrun this town. We got jus' as much to say as you have.\n\nCLARK: (Angrily to both men) Shut up! Done had enough arguing in front\nof my place. (To LUM BOGER) Take that boy on and lock him up in my\nbarn. And save that mule bone for evidence.\n\n(LUM BOGER leads JIM off toward the back of the store. A crowd follows\nhim. Other men and women are busy applying restoratives to DAVE. DAISY\nstands alone, unnoticed in the center of the stage.)\n\nDAISY: (Worriedly) Now, who's gonna take me home?\n\n\n:::: CURTAIN::::\n\n\n\n\nACT TWO\n\n\nSCENE I\n\nSETTING: Village street scene; huge oak tree upstage center; a house\nor two on back drop. When curtain goes up, Sister LUCY TAYLOR is seen\nstanding under the tree. She is painfully spelling it out.\n\n(Enter SISTER THOMAS, a younger woman (In her thirties) at left.)\n\nSISTER THOMAS: Evenin', Sis Taylor.\n\nSISTER TAYLOR: Evenin'. (Returns to the notice)\n\nSISTER THOMAS: Whut you doin'? Readin' dat notice Joe Clark put up\n'bout de meeting? (Approaches tree)\n\nSISTER TAYLOR: Is dat whut it says? I ain't much on readin' since I\nhad my teeth pulled out. You know if you pull out dem eye teeth you\nruins' yo' eye sight. (Turns back to notice) Whut it say?\n\nSISTER THOMAS: (Reading notice) \"The trial of Jim Weston for assault\nand battery on Dave Carter wid a dangerous weapon will be held at\nMacedonia Baptist Church on Monday, November 10, at three o'clock. All\nare welcome. By order of J. Clark, Mayor of Eatonville, Florida.\"\n(Turning to SISTER TAYLOR) Hit's makin' on to three now.\n\nSISTER TAYLOR: You mean it's right _now_. (Looks up at sun to tell\ntime) Lemme go git ready to be at de trial 'cause I'm sho goin' to be\nthere an' I ain't goin' to bite my tongue neither.\n\nSISTER THOMAS: I done went an' crapped a mess of collard greens for\nsupper. I better go put 'em on 'cause Lawd knows when we goin' to git\nouta there an' my husband is one of them dat's gointer eat don't keer\nwhut happen. I bet if judgment day was to happen tomorrow he'd speck I\norter fix him a bucket to carry long. (She moves to exit, right)\n\nSISTER TAYLOR: All men favors they guts, chile. But what you think of\nall dis mess they got goin' on round here?\n\nSISTER THOMAS: I just think it's a sin an' a shame befo' de livin'\njustice de way dese Baptis' niggers is runnin' round here carryin' on.\n\nSISTER TAYLOR: Oh, they been puttin' out the brags ever since Sat'day\nnight 'bout whut they gointer do to Jim. They thinks they runs this\ntown. They tell me Rev. CHILDERS preached a sermon on it yistiddy.\n\nSISTER THOMAS: Lawd help us! He can't preach an' he look like 10 cents\nworth of have-mercy let lone gittin' up dere tryin' to throw slams at\nus. Now all Elder Simms done wuz to explain to us our rights ... whut\nyou think 'bout Joe Clarke runnin' round here takin' up for these ole\nBaptist niggers?\n\nSISTER TAYLOR: De puzzle-gut rascal ... we oughter have him up in\nconference an' put him out de Methdis' faith. He don't b'long in\nthere--wanter tun dat boy outa town for nothin'.\n\nSISTER THOMAS: But we all know how come he so hot to law Jim outa\ntown--hit's to dig de foundation out from under Elder Simms.\n\nSISTER TAYLOR: Whut he wants do dat for?\n\nSISTER THOMAS: 'Cause he wants to be a God-know-it-all an' a\nGod-do-it-all an' Simms is de onliest one in this town whut will buck\nup to him.\n\n(Enter SISTER JONES, walking leisurely)\n\nSISTER JONES: Hello, Hoyt, hello, Lucy.\n\nSISTER TAYLOR: Goin' to de meetin'?\n\nSISTER JONES: Done got my clothes on de line an' I'm bound to be dere.\n\nSISTER THOMAS: Gointer testify for Jim?\n\nSISTER JONES: Naw, I reckon--don't make such difference to me which\nway de drop fall.... 'Tain't neither one of 'em much good.\n\nSISTER TAYLOR: I know it. I know it, Ida. But dat ain't de point. De\ncrow we wants to pick is: Is we gointer set still an' let dese Baptist\ntell us when to plant an' when to pluck up?\n\nSISTER JONES: Dat is something to think about when you come to think\n'bout it. (Starts to move on) Guess I better go ahead--see y'all later\nan tell you straighter.\n\n(Enter ELDER SIMMS, right, walking fast, Bible under his arm, almost\ncollides with SISTER JONES as she exits.)\n\nSIMMS: Oh, 'scuse me, Sister Jones. (She nods and smiles and exits.)\nHow you do, Sister Taylor, Sister Thomas.\n\nBOTH: Good evenin', Elder.\n\nSIMMS: Sho is a hot day.\n\nSISTER TAYLOR: Yeah, de bear is walkin' de earth lak a natural man.\n\nSISTER THOMAS: Reverend, look like you headed de wrong way. It's\nalmost time for de trial an' youse all de dependence we got.\n\nSIMMS: I know it. I'm tryin' to find de marshall so we kin go after\nJim. I wants a chance to talk wid him a minute before court sets.\n\nSISTER TAYLOR: Y'think he'll come clear?\n\nSIMMS: (Proudly) I _know_ it! (Shakes the Bible) I'm goin' to law 'em\nfrom Genesis to Revelation.\n\nSISTER THOMAS: Give it to 'em, Elder. Wear 'em out!\n\nSIMMS: We'se liable to havea new Mayor when all dis dust settle. Well,\nI better scuffle on down de road. (Exits, left.)\n\nSISTER THOMAS: Lord, lemme gwan home an' put dese greens on. (Looks\noff stage left) Here come Mayor Clark now, wid his belly settin' out\nin front of him like a cow catcher! His name oughter be Mayor Belly.\n\nSISTER TAYLOR: (Arms akimbo) Jus' look at him! Tryin' to look like a\njigadier Breneral.\n\n(Enter CLARK hot and perspiring. They look at him coldly.)\n\nCLARK: I God, de bear got me! (Silence for a moment) How y'all\nfeelin', ladies?\n\nSISTER TAYLOR: Brother Mayor, I ain't one of these folks dat bite my\ntongue an' bust my gall--whut's inside got to come out! I can't see to\nmy rest why you cloakin' in wid dese Baptist buzzards 'ginst yo' own\nchurch.\n\nMAYOR CLARK: I ain't cloakin' in wid _none_. I'm de Mayor of dis whole\ntown I stands for de right an' ginst de wrong--I don't keer who it\nkill or cure.\n\nSISTER THOMAS: You think it's right to be runnin' dat boy off for\nnothin'?\n\nCLARK: I God! You call knockin' a man in de head wid a mule bone\nnothin'? 'Nother thin; I done missed nine of my best-layin' hens. I\nain't sayin' Jim got 'em, but different people has tole me he burries\na powerful lot of feathers in his back yard. I God, I'm a ruint man!\n(He starts towards the right exit, but LUM BOGER enters right.) I God,\nLum, I been lookin' for you all day. It's almost three o'clock. (Hands\nhim a key from his ring) Take dis key an' go fetch Jim Weston on to de\nchurch.\n\nLUM: Have you got yo' gavel from de lodge-room?\n\nCLARK: I God, that's right, Lum. I'll go get it from de lodge room\nwhilst you go git de bone an' de prisoner. Hurry up! You walk like\ndead lice droppin' off you. (He exits right while LUM crosses stage\ntowards left.)\n\nSISTER TAYLOR: Lum, Elder Simms been huntin' you--he's gone on down\n'bout de barn. (She gestures)\n\nLUM BOGER: I reckon I'll overtake him. (Exit left.)\n\nSISTER THOMAS: I better go put dese greens on. My husband will kill me\nif he don't find no supper ready. Here come Mrs. Blunt. She oughter\nfeel like a penny's worth of have-mercy wid all dis stink behind her\ndaughter.\n\nSISTER TAYLOR: Chile, some folks don't keer. They don't raise they\nchillun; they drags 'em up. God knows if dat Daisy wuz mine, I'd throw\nher down an' put a hundred lashes on her back wid a plow-line. Here\nshe come in de store Sat'day night (Acts coy and coquettish,\nburlesques DAISY'S walk) a wringing and a twisting!\n\n(Enter MRS. BLUNT, left.)\n\nMRS. BLUNT: How y'all sisters?\n\nSISTER THOMAS: Very well, Miz Blunt, how you?\n\nMRS. BLUNT: Oh, so-so.\n\nMRS. TAYLOR: I'm kickin', but not high.\n\nMRS. BLUNT: Well, thank God you still on prayin' ground an' in a Bible\ncountry. Me, I ain't so many today. De niggers got my Daisy's name all\nmixed up in dis mess.\n\nMRS. TAYLOR: You musn't mind dat, Sister Blunt. People jus' _will_\ntalk. They's talkin' in New York an' they's talkin' in Georgy an'\nthey's talkin' in Italy.\n\nSISTER THOMAS: Chile, if you talk folkses talk, they'll have you in de\ngraveyard or in Chattahoochee one. You can't pay no 'tention to talk.\n\nMRS. BLUNT: Well, I know one thing. De man or women, chick or child,\ngrizzly or gray, that tells me to my face anything wrong 'bout _my_\nchile, I'm goin' to take _my_ fist (Rolls up right sleeve and gestures\nwith right fist) and knock they teeth down they throat. (She looks\nferocious) 'Case y'all know I raised my Daisy right round my feet till\nI let her go up north last year wid them white folks. I'd ruther her\nto be in de white folks' kitchen than walkin' de streets like some of\ndese girls round here. If I do say so, I done raised a lady. She can't\nhelp it if all dese mens get stuck on her.\n\nMRS. TAYLOR: You'se tellin' de truth, Sister Blunt. That's whut I\nalways say: Don't confidence dese niggers. Do, they'll sho put you in\nde street.\n\nMRS. THOMAS: Naw indeed, never syndicate wid niggers. Do, they will\ndistriminate you. They'll be an _anybody_. You goin' to de trial,\nain't you?\n\nMRS. BLUNT: Just as sho as you snore. An' they better leave Daisy's\nname outa dis, too. I done told her and told her to come straight home\nfrom her work. Naw, she had to stop by dat store and skin her gums\nback wid dem trashy niggers. She better not leave them white folks\ntoday to come traipsin' over here scornin' her name all up wid dis\nnigger mess. Do, I'll kill her. No daughter of mine ain't goin' to do\nas she please, long as she live under de sound of my voice. (She\ncrosses to right.)\n\nMRS. THOMAS: That's right, Sister Blunt. I glory in yo' spunk. Lord, I\nbetter go put on my supper.\n\n(As MRS. BLUNT exits, right, REV. CHILDERS enters left with DAVE and\nDEACON LINDSAY and SISTER LEWIS. Very hostile glances from SISTERS\nTHOMAS and TAYLOR toward the others.)\n\nCHILDERS: Good evenin', folks.\n\n(SISTERS THOMAS and TAYLOR just grunt. MRS. THOMAS moves a step or two\ntowards exit. Flirts her skirts and exits.)\n\nLINDSAY: (Angrily) Whut's de matter, y'all? Cat got yo' tongue?\n\nMRS. TAYLOR: More matter than you kin scatter all over Cincinnatti.\n\nLINDSAY: Go 'head on, Lucy Taylor. Go 'head on. You know a very little\nof yo' sugar sweetens my coffee. Go 'head on. Everytime you lift yo'\narm you smell like a nest of yellow hammers.\n\nMRS. TAYLOR: Go 'head on yo'self. Yo' head look like it done wore out\nthree bodies. Talkin' 'bout _me_ smellin'--you smell lak a nest of\ngrand daddies yo'self.\n\nLINDSAY: Aw rock on down de road, 'oman. Ah, don't wantuh change words\nwid yuh. Youse too ugly.\n\nMRS.

You fool wid me now an' I'll knock\nyou into doll rags, Tony or no Tony.\n\nMRS. TAYLOR: (Jumping up in his face) Hit me? Hit me! I dare you tuh\nhit me. If you take dat dare, you'll steal uh hawg an' eat his hair.\n\nLINDSAY: Lemme gwan down to dat church befo' you make me stomp you.\n(He exits, right.)\n\nMRS. TAYLOR: You mean you'll _git_ stomped. Ah'm goin' to de trial,\ntoo. De nex trial gointer be _me_ for kickin' some uh you Baptist\nniggers around.\n\n(A great noise is heard off stage left. The angry and jeering voices\nof children. MRS. TAYLOR looks off left and takes a step or two\ntowards left exit as the noise comes nearer.)\n\nVOICE OF ONE CHILD: Tell her! Tell her! Turn her up and smell her.

It is a story\n    which will make the heart of many readers leap with joy._\n\n    _We have rarely printed a story in this magazine that for scientific\n    interest, as well as suspense, could hold its own with this\n    particular story. We prophesy that this story will become more\n    valuable as the years go by. It certainly holds a number of\n    interesting prophecies, of which no doubt, many will come true. For\n    wealth of science, it will be hard to beat for some time to come. It\n    is one of those rare stories that will bear reading and re-reading\n    many times._\n\n    _This story has impressed us so favorably, that we hope the author\n    may be induced to write a sequel to it soon._\n\n\n\n\nForeword\n\n\nElsewhere I have set down, for whatever interest they have in this, the\n25th Century, my personal recollections of the 20th Century.\n\nNow it occurs to me that my memoirs of the 25th Century may have an\nequal interest 500 years from now--particularly in view of that unique\nperspective from which I have seen the 25th Century, entering it as I\ndid, in one leap across a gap of 492 years.\n\nThis statement requires elucidation. There are still many in the world\nwho are not familiar with my unique experience. Five centuries from now\nthere may be many more, especially if civilization is fated to endure\nany worse convulsions than those which have occurred between 1975 A.D.\nand the present time.\n\nI should state therefore, that I, Anthony Rogers, am, so far as I know,\nthe only man alive whose normal span of eighty-one years of life has\nbeen spread over a period of 573 years. To be precise, I lived the first\ntwenty-nine years of my life between 1898 and 1927; the other fifty-two\nsince 2419. The gap between these two, a period of nearly five hundred\nyears, I spent in a state of suspended animation, free from the ravages\nof katabolic processes, and without any apparent effect on my physical\nor mental faculties.\n\nWhen I began my long sleep, man had just begun his real conquest of the\nair in a sudden series of transoceanic flights in airplanes driven by\ninternal combustion motors. He had barely begun to speculate on the\npossibilities of harnessing sub-atomic forces, and had made no further\npractical penetration into the field of ethereal pulsations than the\nprimitive radio and television of that day. The United States of America\nwas the most powerful nation in the world, its political, financial,\nindustrial and scientific influence being supreme; and in the arts also\nit was rapidly climbing into leadership.\n\nI awoke to find the America I knew a total wreck--to find Americans a\nhunted race in their own land, hiding in the dense forests that covered\nthe shattered and leveled ruins of their once magnificent cities,\ndesperately preserving, and struggling to develop in their secret\nretreats, the remnants of their culture and science--and the undying\nflame of their sturdy independence.\n\nWorld domination was in the hands of Mongolians and the center of world\npower lay in inland China, with Americans one of the few races of\nmankind unsubdued--and it must be admitted in fairness to the truth, not\nworth the trouble of subduing in the eyes of the Han Airlords who ruled\nNorth America as titular tributaries of the Most Magnificent.\n\nFor they needed not the forests in which the Americans lived, nor the\nresources of the vast territories these forests covered. With the\nperfection to which they had reduced the synthetic production of\nnecessities and luxuries, their remarkable development of scientific\nprocesses and mechanical accomplishment of work, they had no economic\nneed for the forests, and no economic desire for the enslaved labor of\nan unruly race.\n\nThey had all they needed for their magnificently luxurious and degraded\nscheme of civilization, within the walls of the fifteen cities of\nsparkling glass they had flung skyward on the sites of ancient American\ncenters, into the bowels of the earth underneath them, and with\nrelatively small surrounding areas of agriculture.\n\nComplete domination of the air rendered communication between these\ncenters a matter of ease and safety. Occasional destructive raids on the\nwaste lands were considered all that was necessary to keep the \"wild\"\nAmericans on the run within the shelter of their forests, and prevent\ntheir becoming a menace to the Han civilization.\n\nBut nearly three hundred years of easily maintained security, the last\ncentury of which had been nearly sterile in scientific, social and\neconomic progress, had softened and devitalized the Hans.\n\nIt had likewise developed, beneath the protecting foliage of the forest,\nthe growth of a vigorous new American civilization, remarkable in the\nmobility and flexibility of its organization, in its conquest of almost\ninsuperable obstacles, in the development and guarding of its industrial\nand scientific resources, all in anticipation of that \"Day of Hope\" to\nwhich it had been looking forward for generations, when it would be\nstrong enough to burst from the green chrysalis of the forests, soar\ninto the upper air lanes and destroy the yellow incubus.\n\nAt the time I awoke, the \"Day of Hope\" was almost at hand. I shall not\nattempt to set forth a detailed history of the Second War of\nIndependence, for that has been recorded already by better historians\nthan I am. Instead I shall confine myself largely to the part I was\nfortunate enough to play in this struggle and in the events leading up\nto it.\n\n[Illustration: Seen upon the ultroscope viewplate, the battle looked as\nthough it were being fought in daylight, perhaps on a cloudy day, while\nthe explosions of the rockets appeared as flashes of extra brilliance.]\n\nIt all resulted from my interest in radioactive gases. During the latter\npart of 1927 my company, the American Radioactive Gas Corporation, had\nbeen keeping me busy investigating reports of unusual phenomena observed\nin certain abandoned coal mines near the Wyoming Valley, in\nPennsylvania.\n\nWith two assistants and a complete equipment of scientific instruments,\nI began the exploration of a deserted working in a mountainous district,\nwhere several weeks before, a number of mining engineers had reported\ntraces of carnotite[1] and what they believed to be radioactive gases.\nTheir report was not without foundation, it was apparent from the\noutset, for in our examination of the upper levels of the mine, our\ninstruments indicated a vigorous radioactivity.\n\n    [1] A hydrovanadate of uranium, and other metals; used as a source\n    of radium compounds.\n\nOn the morning of December 15th, we descended to one of the lowest\nlevels. To our surprise, we found no water there. Obviously it had\ndrained off through some break in the strata. We noticed too that the\nrock in the side walls of the shaft was soft, evidently due to the\nradioactivity, and pieces crumbled under foot rather easily. We made our\nway cautiously down the shaft, when suddenly the rotted timbers above us\ngave way.\n\nI jumped ahead, barely escaping the avalanche of coal and soft rock, but\nmy companions, who were several paces behind me, were buried under it,\nand undoubtedly met instant death.\n\nI was trapped. Return was impossible. With my electric torch I explored\nthe shaft to its end, but could find no other way out. The air became\nincreasingly difficult to breathe, probably from the rapid accumulation\nof the radioactive gas. In a little while my senses reeled and I lost\nconsciousness.\n\nWhen I awoke, there was a cool and refreshing circulation of air in the\nshaft. I had no thought that I had been unconscious more than a few\nhours, although it seems that the radioactive gas had kept me in a state\nof suspended animation for something like 500 years. My awakening, I\nfigured out later, had been due to some shifting of the strata which\nreopened the shaft and cleared the atmosphere in the working. This must\nhave been the case, for I was able to struggle back up the shaft over a\npile of debris, and stagger up the long incline to the mouth of the\nmine, where an entirely different world, overgrown with a vast forest\nand no visible sign of human habitation, met my eyes.\n\nI shall pass over the days of mental agony that followed in my attempt\nto grasp the meaning of it all. There were times when I felt that I was\non the verge of insanity. I roamed the unfamiliar forest like a lost\nsoul. Had it not been for the necessity of improvising traps and crude\nclubs with which to slay my food, I believe I should have gone mad.\n\nSuffice it to say, however, that I survived this psychic crisis. I shall\nbegin my narrative proper with my first contact with Americans of the\nyear 2419 A.D.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nFloating Men\n\n\nMy first glimpse of a human being of the 25th Century was obtained\nthrough a portion of woodland where the trees were thinly scattered,\nwith a dense forest beyond.\n\nI had been wandering along aimlessly, and hopelessly, musing over my\nstrange fate, when I noticed a figure that cautiously backed out of the\ndense growth across the glade. I was about to call out joyfully, but\nthere was something furtive about the figure that prevented me. The\nboy's attention (for it seemed to be a lad of fifteen or sixteen) was\ncentered tensely on the heavy growth of trees from which he had just\nemerged.\n\nHe was clad in rather tight-fitting garments entirely of green, and wore\na helmet-like cap of the same color. High around his waist he wore a\nbroad, thick belt, which bulked up in the back across the shoulders,\ninto something of the proportions of a knapsack.\n\nAs I was taking in these details, there came a vivid flash and heavy\ndetonation, like that of a hand grenade, not far to the left of him. He\nthrew up an arm and staggered a bit in a queer, gliding way; then he\nrecovered himself and slipped cautiously away from the place of the\nexplosion, crouching slightly, and still facing the denser part of the\nforest. Every few steps he would raise his arm, and point into the\nforest with something he held in his hand. Wherever he pointed there was\na terrific explosion, deeper in among the trees. It came to me then that\nhe was shooting with some form of pistol, though there was neither flash\nnor detonation from the muzzle of the weapon itself.\n\nAfter firing several times, he seemed to come to a sudden resolution,\nand turning in my general direction, leaped--to my amazement sailing\nthrough the air between the sparsely scattered trees in such a jump as I\nhad never in my life seen before. That leap must have carried him a full\nfifty feet, although at the height of his arc, he was not more than ten\nor twelve feet from the ground.\n\nWhen he alighted, his foot caught in a projecting root, and he sprawled\ngently forward. I say \"gently\" for he did not crash down as I expected\nhim to do. The only thing I could compare it with was a slow-motion\ncinema, although I had never seen one in which horizontal motions were\nregistered at normal speed and only the vertical movements were slowed\ndown.\n\nDue to my surprise, I suppose my brain did not function with its normal\nquickness, for I gazed at the prone figure for several seconds before I\nsaw the blood that oozed out from under the tight green cap. Regaining\nmy power of action, I dragged him out of sight back of the big tree. For\na few moments I busied myself in an attempt to staunch the flow of\nblood. The wound was not a deep one. My companion was more dazed than\nhurt. But what of the pursuers?\n\nI took the weapon from his grasp and examined it hurriedly. It was not\nunlike the automatic pistol to which I was accustomed, except that it\napparently fired with a button instead of a trigger. I inserted several\nfresh rounds of ammunition into its magazine from my companion's belt,\nas rapidly as I could, for I soon heard, near us, the suppressed\nconversation of his pursuers.\n\nThere followed a series of explosions round about us, but none very\nclose. They evidently had not spotted our hiding place, and were firing\nat random.\n\nI waited tensely, balancing the gun in my hand, to accustom myself to\nits weight and probable throw.\n\nThen I saw a movement in the green foliage of a tree not far away, and\nthe head and face of a man appeared. Like my companion, he was clad\nentirely in green, which made his figure difficult to distinguish. But\nhis face could be seen clearly. It was an evil face, and had murder in\nit.\n\nThat decided me. I raised the gun and fired. My aim was bad, for there\nwas no kick in the gun, as I had expected, and I hit the trunk of the\ntree several feet below him. It blew him from his perch like a crumpled\nbit of paper, and he _floated_ down to the ground, like some limp, dead\nthing, gently lowered by an invisible hand. The tree, its trunk blown\napart by the explosion, crashed down.\n\nThere followed another series of explosions around us. These guns we\nwere using made no sound in the firing, and my opponents were evidently\nas much at sea as to my position as I was to theirs. So I made no\nattempt to reply to their fire, contenting myself with keeping a sharp\nlookout in their general direction. And patience had its reward.\n\nVery soon I saw a cautious movement in the top of another tree. Exposing\nmyself as little as possible, I aimed carefully at the tree trunk and\nfired again. A shriek followed the explosion. I heard the tree crash\ndown; then a groan.\n\nThere was silence for a while. Then I heard a faint sound of boughs\nswishing. I shot three times in its direction, pressing the button as\nrapidly as I could. Branches crashed down where my shells had exploded,\nbut there was no body.\n\nThen I saw one of them. He was starting one of those amazing leaps from\nthe bough of one tree to another, about forty feet away.\n\nI threw up my gun impulsively and fired. By now I had gotten the feel of\nthe weapon, and my aim was good. I hit him. The \"bullet\" must have\npenetrated his body and exploded. For one moment I saw him flying\nthrough the air. Then the explosion, and he had vanished. He never\nfinished his leap. It was annihilation.\n\nHow many more of them there were I don't know. But this must have been\ntoo much for them. They used a final round of shells on us, all of which\nexploded harmlessly, and shortly after I heard them swishing and\ncrashing away from us through the tree tops. Not one of them descended\nto earth.\n\nNow I had time to give some attention to my companion. She was, I found,\na girl, and not a boy. Despite her bulky appearance, due to the peculiar\nbelt strapped around her body high up under the arms, she was very\nslender, and very pretty.\n\nThere was a stream not far away, from which I brought water and bathed\nher face and wound.\n\nApparently the mystery of these long leaps, the monkey-like ability to\njump from bough to bough, and of the bodies that floated gently down\ninstead of falling, lay in the belt. The thing was some sort of\nanti-gravity belt that almost balanced the weight of the wearer, thereby\ntremendously multiplying the propulsive power of the leg muscles, and\nthe lifting power of the arms.\n\nWhen the girl came to, she regarded me as curiously as I did her, and\npromptly began to quiz me. Her accent and intonation puzzled me a lot,\nbut nevertheless we were able to understand each other fairly well,\nexcept for certain words and phrases. I explained what had happened\nwhile she lay unconscious, and she thanked me simply for saving her\nlife.\n\n\"You are a strange exchange,\" she said, eying my clothing quizzically.\nEvidently she found it mirth provoking by contrast with her own neatly\nefficient garb. \"Don't you understand what I mean by 'exchange?' I mean\nah--let me see--a stranger, somebody from some other gang. What gang do\nyou belong to?\" (She pronounced it \"gan,\" with only a suspicion of a\nnasal sound.)\n\nI laughed. \"I'm not a gangster,\" I said. But she evidently did not\nunderstand this word. \"I don't belong to any gang,\" I explained, \"and\nnever did. Does everybody belong to a gang nowadays?\"\n\n\"Naturally,\" she said, frowning. \"If you don't belong to a gang, where\nand how do you live? Why have you not found and joined a gang? How do\nyou eat? Where do you get your clothing?\"\n\n\"I've been eating wild game for the past two weeks,\" I explained, \"and\nthis clothing I--er--ah--.\" I paused, wondering how I could explain that\nit must be many hundred years old.\n\nIn the end I saw I would have to tell my story as well as I could,\npiecing it together with my assumptions as to what had happened. She\nlistened patiently; incredulously at first, but with more confidence as\nI went on. When I had finished, she sat thinking for a long time.\n\n\"That's hard to believe,\" she said, \"but I believe it.\" She looked me\nover with frank interest.\n\n\"Were you married when you slipped into unconsciousness down in that\nmine?\" she asked me suddenly. I assured her I had never married. \"Well,\nthat simplifies matters,\" she continued. \"You see, if you were\ntechnically classed as a family man, I could take you back only as an\ninvited exchange and I, being unmarried, and no relation of yours,\ncouldn't do the inviting.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nThe Forest Gangs\n\n\nShe gave me a brief outline of the very peculiar social and economic\nsystem under which her people lived. At least it seemed very peculiar\nfrom my 20th Century viewpoint.\n\nI learned with amazement that exactly 492 years had passed over my head\nas I lay unconscious in the mine.\n\nWilma, for that was her name, did not profess to be a historian, and so\ncould give me only a sketchy outline of the wars that had been fought,\nand the manner in which such radical changes had come about. It seemed\nthat another war had followed the First World War, in which nearly all\nthe European nations had banded together to break the financial and\nindustrial power of America. They succeeded in their purpose, though\nthey were beaten, for the war was a terrific one, and left America, like\nthemselves, gasping, bleeding and disorganized, with only the hollow\nshell of a victory.\n\nThis opportunity had been seized by the Russian Soviets, who had made a\ncoalition with the Chinese, to sweep over all Europe and reduce it to a\nstate of chaos.\n\nAmerica, industrially geared to world production and the world trade,\ncollapsed economically, and there ensued a long period of stagnation and\ndesperate attempts at economic reconstruction. But it was impossible to\nstave off war with the Mongolians, who by now had subjugated the\nRussians, and were aiming at a world empire.\n\nIn about 2109, it seems, the conflict was finally precipitated. The\nMongolians, with overwhelming fleets of great airships, and a science\nthat far outstripped that of crippled America, swept in over the Pacific\nand Atlantic Coasts, and down from Canada, annihilating American\naircraft, armies and cities with their terrific _disintegrator_ rays.\nThese rays were projected from a machine not unlike a searchlight in\nappearance, the reflector of which, however, was not material substance,\nbut a complicated balance of interacting electronic forces. This\nresulted in a terribly destructive beam. Under its influence, material\nsubstance melted into \"nothingness\"; i. e., into electronic vibrations.\nIt destroyed all then known substances, from air to the most dense\nmetals and stone.\n\nThey settled down to the establishment of what became known as the Han\ndynasty in America, as a sort of province in their World Empire.\n\nThose were terrible days for the Americans. They were hunted like wild\nbeasts. Only those survived who finally found refuge in mountains,\ncanyons and forests. Government was at an end among them. Anarchy\nprevailed for several generations. Most would have been eager to submit\nto the Hans, even if it meant slavery. But the Hans did not want them,\nfor they themselves had marvelous machinery and scientific process by\nwhich all difficult labor was accomplished.\n\nUltimately they stopped their active search for, and annihilation of,\nthe widely scattered groups of now savage Americans. So long as they\nremained hidden in their forests, and did not venture near the great\ncities the Hans had built, little attention was paid to them.\n\nThen began the building of the new American civilization. Families and\nindividuals gathered together in clans or \"gangs\" for mutual protection.\nFor nearly a century they lived a nomadic and primitive life, moving\nfrom place to place, in desperate fear of the casual and occasional Han\nair raids, and the terrible disintegrator ray. As the frequency of these\nraids decreased, they began to stay permanently in given localities,\norganizing upon lines which in many respects were similar to those of\nthe military households of the Norman feudal barons, except that instead\nof gathering together in castles, their defense tactics necessitated a\ncertain scattering of living quarters for families and individuals. They\nlived virtually in the open air, in the forests, in green tents,\nresorting to camouflage tactics that would conceal their presence from\nair observers. They dug underground factories and laboratories, that\nthey might better be shielded from the electrical detectors of the\nHans. They tapped the radio communication lines of the Hans, with crude\ninstruments at first; better ones later on. They bent every effort\ntoward the redevelopment of science. For many generations they labored\nas unseen, unknown scholars of the Hans, picking up their knowledge\npiecemeal, as fast as they were able to.\n\nDuring the earlier part of this period, there were many deadly wars\nfought between the various gangs, and occasional courageous but\nchildishly futile attacks upon the Hans, followed by terribly punitive\nraids.\n\nBut as knowledge progressed, the sense of American brotherhood\nredeveloped. Reciprocal arrangements were made among the gangs over\nconstantly increasing areas. Trade developed to a certain extent, as\nbetween one gang and another. But the interchange of knowledge became\nmore important than that of goods, as skill in the handling of synthetic\nprocesses developed.\n\nWithin the gang, an economy was developed that was a compromise between\nindividual liberty and a military socialism. The right of private\nproperty was limited practically to personal possessions, but private\nprivileges were many, and sacredly regarded. Stimulation to achievement\nlay chiefly in the winning of various kinds of leadership and\nprerogatives, and only in a very limited degree in the hope of owning\nanything that might be classified as \"wealth,\" and nothing that might be\nclassified as \"resources.\" Resources of every description, for military\nsafety and efficiency, belonged as a matter of public interest to the\ncommunity as a whole.\n\nIn the meantime, through these many generations, the Hans had developed\na luxury economy, and with it the perfection of gilded vice and\ndegradation. The Americans were regarded as \"wild men of the woods.\" And\nsince they neither needed nor wanted the woods or the wild men, they\ntreated them as beasts, and were conscious of no human brotherhood with\nthem. As time went on, and synthetic processes of producing foods and\nmaterials were further developed, less and less ground was needed by the\nHans for the purposes of agriculture, and finally, even the working of\nmines was abandoned when it became cheaper to build up metal from\nelectronic vibrations than to dig them out of the ground.\n\nThe Han race, devitalized by its vices and luxuries, with machinery and\nscientific processes to satisfy its every want, with virtually no\nnecessity of labor, began to assume a defensive attitude toward the\nAmericans.\n\nAnd quite naturally, the Americans regarded the Hans with a deep, grim\nhatred. Conscious of individual superiority as men, knowing that\nlatterly they were outstripping the Hans in science and civilization,\nthey longed desperately for the day when they should be powerful enough\nto rise and annihilate the Yellow Blight that lay over the continent.\n\nAt the time of my awakening, the gangs were rather loosely organized,\nbut were considering the establishment of a special military force,\nwhose special business it would be to harry the Hans and bring down\ntheir air ships whenever possible without causing general alarm among\nthe Mongolians. This force was destined to become the nucleus of the\nnational force, when the Day of Retribution arrived. But that, however,\ndid not happen for ten years, and is another story.\n\n[Illustration: On the left of the illustration is a Han girl, and on the\nright is an American girl, who, like all of her race, is equipped with\nan inertron belt and a rocket gun.]\n\nWilma told me she was a member of the Wyoming Gang, which claimed the\nentire Wyoming Valley as its territory, under the leadership of Boss\nHart. Her mother and father were dead, and she was unmarried, so she was\nnot a \"family member.\" She lived in a little group of tents known as\nCamp 17, under a woman Camp Boss, with seven other girls.\n\nHer duties alternated between military or police scouting and factory\nwork. For the two-week period which would end the next day, she had been\non \"air patrol.\" This did not mean, as I first imagined, that she was\nflying, but rather that she was on the lookout for Han ships over this\noutlying section of the Wyoming territory, and had spent most of her\ntime perched in the tree tops scanning the skies. Had she seen one she\nwould have fired a \"drop flare\" several miles off to one side, which\nwould ignite when it was floating vertically toward the earth, so that\nthe direction or point from which it had been fired might not be guessed\nby the airship and bring a blasting play of the disintegrator ray in her\nvicinity. Other members of the air patrol would send up rockets on\nseeing hers, until finally a scout equipped with an ultrophone, which,\nunlike the ancient radio, operated on the ultronic ethereal vibrations,\nwould pass the warning simultaneously to the headquarters of the Wyoming\nGang and other communities within a radius of several hundred miles, not\nto mention the few American rocket ships that might be in the air, and\nwhich instantly would duck to cover either through forest clearings or\nby flattening down to earth in green fields where their coloring would\nprobably protect them from observation. The favorite American method of\npropulsion was known as \"_rocketing_.\" The _rocket_ is what I would\ndescribe, from my 20th Century comprehension of the matter, as an\nextremely powerful gas blast, atomically produced through the\nstimulation of chemical action. Scientists of today regard it as a\nchildishly simple reaction, but by that very virtue, most economical and\nefficient.\n\nBut tomorrow, she explained, she would go back to work in the cloth\nplant, where she would take charge of one of the synthetic processes by\nwhich those wonderful substitutes for woven fabrics of wool, cotton and\nsilk are produced. At the end of another two weeks, she would be back on\nmilitary duty again, perhaps at the same work, or maybe as a \"contact\nguard,\" on duty where the territory of the Wyomings merged with that of\nthe Delawares, or the \"Susquannas\" (Susquehannas) or one of the half\ndozen other \"gangs\" in that section of the country which I knew as\nPennsylvania and New York States.\n\nWilma cleared up for me the mystery of those flying leaps which she and\nher assailants had made, and explained in the following manner, how the\ninertron belt balances weight:\n\n\"_Jumpers_\" were in common use at the time I \"awoke,\" though they were\ncostly, for at that time _inertron_ had not been produced in very great\nquantity. They were very useful in the forest. They were belts,\nstrapped high under the arms, containing an amount of inertron adjusted\nto the wearer's weight and purposes. In effect they made a man weigh as\nlittle as he desired; two pounds if he liked.\n\n\"_Floaters_\" are a later development of \"_jumpers_\"--rocket motors\nencased in _inertron_ blocks and strapped to the back in such a way that\nthe wearer floats, when drifting, facing slightly downward. With his\nmotor in operation, he moves like a diver, headforemost, controlling his\ndirection by twisting his body and by movements of his outstretched arms\nand hands. Ballast weights locked in the front of the belt adjust weight\nand lift. Some men prefer a few ounces of weight in floating, using a\nslight motor thrust to overcome this. Others prefer a buoyance balance\nof a few ounces. The inadvertent dropping of weight is not a serious\nmatter. The motor thrust always can be used to descend. But as an extra\nprecaution, in case the motor should fail, for any reason, there are\nbuilt into every belt a number of detachable sections, one or more of\nwhich can be discarded to balance off any loss in weight.\n\n\"But who were your assailants,\" I asked, \"and why were you attacked?\"\n\nHer assailants, she told me, were members of an outlaw gang, referred to\nas \"Bad Bloods,\" a group which for several generations had been under\nthe domination of conscienceless leaders who tried to advance the\ninterests of their clan by tactics which their neighbors had come to\nregard as unfair, and who in consequence had been virtually boycotted.\nTheir purpose had been to slay her near the Delaware frontier, making it\nappear that the crime had been committed by Delaware scouts and thus\nembroil the Delawares and Wyomings in acts of reprisal against each\nother, or at least cause suspicions.\n\nFortunately they had not succeeded in surprising her, and she had been\nsuccessful in dodging them for some two hours before the shooting began,\nat the moment when I arrived on the scene.\n\n\"But we must not stay here talking,\" Wilma concluded. \"I have to take\nyou in, and besides I must report this attack right away. I think we had\nbetter slip over to the other side of the mountain. Whoever is on that\npost will have a phone, and I can make a direct report. But you'll have\nto have a belt. Mine alone won't help much against our combined weights,\nand there's little to be gained by jumping heavy. It's almost as bad as\nwalking.\"\n\nAfter a little search, we found one of the men I had killed, who had\nfloated down among the trees some distance away and whose belt was not\nbadly damaged. In detaching it from his body, it nearly got away from me\nand shot up in the air. Wilma caught it, however, and though it\nreinforced the lift of her own belt so that she had to hook her knee\naround a branch to hold herself down, she saved it. I climbed the tree\nand, with my weight added to hers, we floated down easily.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nLife in the 25th Century\n\n\nWe were delayed in starting for quite a while since I had to acquire a\nfew crude ideas about the technique of using these belts. I had been\nsitting down, for instance, with the belt strapped about me, enjoying an\nease similar to that of a comfortable armchair; when I stood up with a\nnatural exertion of muscular effort, I shot ten feet into the air, with\na wild instinctive thrashing of arms and legs that amused Wilma greatly.\n\nBut after some practice, I began to get the trick of gauging muscular\neffort to a minimum of vertical and a maximum of horizontal. The correct\nform, I found, was in a measure comparable to that of skating. I found,\nalso, that in forest work particularly the arms and hands could be used\nto great advantage in swinging along from branch to branch, so\nprolonging leaps almost indefinitely at times.\n\nIn going up the side of the mountain, I found that my 20th Century\nmuscles did have an advantage, in spite of lack of skill with the belt,\nand since the slopes were very sharp, and most of our leaps were upward,\nI could have distanced Wilma easily. But when we crossed the ridge and\ndescended, she outstripped me with her superior technique. Choosing the\nsteepest slopes, she would crouch in the top of a tree, and propel\nherself outward, literally diving until, with the loss of horizontal\nmomentum, she would assume a more upright position and float downward.\nIn this manner she would sometimes cover as much as a quarter of a mile\nin a single leap, while I leaped and scrambled clumsily behind,\nthoroughly enjoying the novel sensation.\n\nHalf way down the mountain, we saw another green-clad figure leap out\nabove the tree tops toward us. The three of us perched on an outcropping\nof rock from which a view for many miles around could be had, while\nWilma hastily explained her adventure and my presence to her fellow\nguard; whose name was Alan. I learned later that this was the modern\nform of Helen.\n\n\"You want to report by phone then, don't you?\" Alan took a compact\npacket about six inches square from a holster attached to her belt and\nhanded it to Wilma.\n\nSo far as I could see, it had no special receiver for the ear. Wilma\nmerely threw back a lid, as though she were opening a book, and began to\ntalk. The voice that came back from the machine was as audible as her\nown.\n\nShe was queried closely as to the attack upon her, and at considerable\nlength as to myself, and I could tell from the tone of that voice that\nits owner was not prepared to take me at my face value as readily as\nWilma had. For that matter, neither was the other girl. I could realize\nit from the suspicious glances she threw my way, when she thought my\nattention was elsewhere, and the manner in which her hand hovered\nconstantly near her gun holster.\n\nWilma was ordered to bring me in at once, and informed that another\nscout would take her place on the other side of the mountain. So she\nclosed down the lid of the phone and handed it back to Alan, who seemed\nrelieved to see us departing over the tree tops in the direction of the\ncamps.\n\nWe had covered perhaps ten miles, in what still seemed to me a\nsurprisingly easy fashion, when Wilma explained, that from here on we\nwould have to keep to the ground. We were nearing the camps, she said,\nand there was always the possibility that some small Han scoutship,\ninvisible high in the sky, might catch sight of us through a\nprojectoscope and thus find the general location of the camps.\n\nWilma took me to the Scout office, which proved to be a small building\nof irregular shape, conforming to the trees around it, and substantially\nconstructed of green sheet-like material.\n\nI was received by the assistant Scout Boss, who reported my arrival at\nonce to the historical office, and to officials he called the Psycho\nBoss and the History Boss, who came in a few minutes later. The attitude\nof all three men was at first polite but skeptical, and Wilma's ardent\nadvocacy seemed to amuse them secretly.\n\nFor the next two hours I talked, explained and answered questions. I had\nto explain, in detail, the manner of my life in the 20th Century and my\nunderstanding of customs, habits, business, science and the history of\nthat period, and about developments in the centuries that had elapsed.\nHad I been in a classroom, I would have come through the examination\nwith a very poor mark, for I was unable to give any answer to fully half\nof their questions. But before long I realized that the majority of\nthese questions were designed as traps. Objects, of whose purpose I knew\nnothing, were casually handed to me, and I was watched keenly as I\nhandled them.\n\nIn the end I could see both amazement and belief begin to show in the\nfaces of my inquisitors, and at last the Historical and Psycho Bosses\nagreed openly that they could find no flaw in my story or reactions, and\nthat unbelievable as it seemed, my story must be accepted as genuine.\n\nThey took me at once to Big Boss Hart. He was a portly man with a \"poker\nface.\" He would probably have been the successful politician even in the\n20th Century.\n\nThey gave him a brief outline of my story and a report of their\nexamination of me. He made no comment other than to nod his acceptance\nof it. Then he turned to me.\n\n\"How does it feel?\" he asked. \"Do we look funny to you?\"\n\n\"A bit strange,\" I admitted. \"But I'm beginning to lose that dazed\nfeeling, though I can see I have an awful lot to learn.\"\n\n\"Maybe we can learn some things from you, too,\" he said. \"So you fought\nin the First World War. Do you know, we have very little left in the way\nof records of the details of that war, that is, the precise conditions\nunder which it was fought, and the tactics employed. We forgot many\nthings during the Han terror, and--well, I think you might have a lot of\nideas worth thinking over for our raid masters. By the way, now that\nyou're here, and can't go back to your own century, so to speak, what do\nyou want to do? You're welcome to become one of us. Or perhaps you'd\njust like to visit with us for a while, and then look around among the\nother gangs. Maybe you'd like some of the others better. Don't make up\nyour mind now. We'll put you down as an exchange for a while. Let's see.\nYou and Bill Hearn ought to get along well together. He's Camp Boss of\nNumber 34 when he isn't acting as Raid Boss or Scout Boss. There's a\nvacancy in his camp. Stay with him and think things over as long as you\nwant to. As soon as you make up your mind to anything, let me know.\"\n\nWe all shook hands, for that was one custom that had not died out in\nfive hundred years, and I set out with Bill Hearn.\n\nBill, like all the others, was clad in green. He was a big man. That is,\nhe was about my own height, five feet eleven. This was considerably\nabove the average now, for the race had lost something in stature, it\nseemed, through the vicissitudes of five centuries. Most of the women\nwere a bit below five feet, and the men only a trifle above this height.\n\nFor a period of two weeks Bill was to confine himself to camp duties, so\nI had a good chance to familiarize myself with the community life. It\nwas not easy. There were so many marvels to absorb. I never ceased to\nwonder at the strange combination of rustic social life and feverish\nindustrial activity. At least, it was strange to me. For in my\nexperience, industrial development meant crowded cities, tenements,\npaved streets, profusion of vehicles, noise, hurrying men and women with\nstrained or dull faces, vast structures and ornate public works.\n\nHere, however, was rustic simplicity, apparently isolated families and\ngroups, living in the heart of the forest, with a quarter of a mile or\nmore between households, a total absence of crowds, no means of\nconveyance other than the belts called jumpers, almost constantly worn\nby everybody, and an occasional rocket ship, used only for longer\njourneys, and underground plants or factories that were to my mind more\nlike laboratories and engine rooms; many of them were excavations as\ndeep as mines, with well finished, lighted and comfortable interiors.\nThese people were adepts at camouflage against air observation. Not only\nwould their activity have been unsuspected by an airship passing over\nthe center of the community, but even by an enemy who might happen to\ndrop through the screen of the upper branches to the floor of the\nforest. The camps, or household structures, were all irregular in shape\nand of colors that blended with the great trees among which they were\nhidden.\n\nThere were 724 dwellings or \"camps\" among the Wyomings, located within\nan area of about fifteen square miles. The total population was 8,688,\nevery man, woman and child, whether member or \"exchange,\" being listed.\n\nThe plants were widely scattered through the territory also. Nowhere was\nanything like congestion permitted. So far as possible, families and\nindividuals were assigned to living quarters, not too far from the\nplants or offices in which their work lay.\n\nAll able-bodied men and women alternated in two-week periods between\nmilitary and industrial service, except those who were needed for\nhousehold work. Since working conditions in the plants and offices were\nideal, and everybody thus had plenty of healthy outdoor activity in\naddition, the population was sturdy and active. Laziness was regarded as\nnearly the greatest of social offenses. Hard work and general merit were\nvariously rewarded with extra privileges, advancement to positions of\nauthority, and with various items of personal equipment for convenience\nand luxury.\n\nIn leisure moments, I got great enjoyment from sitting outside the\ndwelling in which I was quartered with Bill Hearn and ten other men,\nwatching the occasional passers-by, as with leisurely, but swift\nmovements, they swung up and down the forest trail, rising from the\nground in long almost-horizontal leaps, occasionally swinging from one\nconvenient branch overhead to another before \"sliding\" back to the\nground farther on. Normal traveling pace, where these trails were\nstraight enough, was about twenty miles an hour. Such things as\nautomobiles and railroad trains (the memory of them not more than a\nmonth old in my mind) seemed inexpressibly silly and futile compared\nwith such convenience as these belts or jumpers offered.\n\nBill suggested that I wander around for several days, from plant to\nplant, to observe and study what I could. The entire community had been\napprised of my coming, my rating as an \"exchange\" reaching every\nbuilding and post in the community, by means of ultronic broadcast.\nEverywhere I was welcomed in an interested and helpful spirit.\n\nI visited the plants where ultronic vibrations were isolated from the\nether and through slow processes built up into sub-electronic,\nelectronic and atomic forms into the two great synthetic elements,\nultron and inertron. I learned something, superficially at least, of the\nprocesses of combined chemical and mechanical action through which were\nproduced the various forms of synthetic cloth. I watched the manufacture\nof the machines which were used at locations of construction to produce\nthe various forms of building materials. But I was particularly\ninterested in the munitions plants and the rocket-ship shops.\n\nUltron is a solid of great molecular density and moderate elasticity,\nwhich has the property of being 100 percent conductive to those\npulsations known as light, electricity and heat. Since it is completely\npermeable to light vibrations, it is therefore _absolutely invisible and\nnon-reflective_. Its magnetic response is almost, but not quite, 100\npercent also. It is therefore very heavy under normal conditions but\nextremely responsive to the _repellor_ or anti-gravity rays, such as the\nHans use as \"_legs_\" for their airships.\n\nInertron is the second great triumph of American research and\nexperimentation with ultronic forces. It was developed just a few years\nbefore my awakening in the abandoned mine. It is a synthetic element,\nbuilt up, through a complicated heterodyning of ultronic pulsations,\nfrom \"infra-balanced\" sub-ionic forms. It is completely inert to both\nelectric and magnetic forces in all the orders above the _ultronic_;\nthat is to say, the _sub-electronic_, the _electronic_, the _atomic_ and\nthe _molecular_. In consequence it has a number of amazing and\nvaluable properties. One of these is _the total lack of weight_. Another\nis a total lack of heat. It has no molecular vibration whatever. It\nreflects 100 percent of the heat and light impinging upon it. It does\nnot feel cold to the touch, of course, since it will not absorb the heat\nof the hand. It is a solid, very dense in molecular structure despite\nits lack of weight, of great strength and considerable elasticity. It is\na perfect shield against the disintegrator rays.\n\n[Illustration: Setting his rocket gun for a long-distance shot.]\n\nRocket guns are very simple contrivances so far as the mechanism of\nlaunching the bullet is concerned. They are simple light tubes, closed\nat the rear end, with a trigger-actuated pin for piercing the thin skin\nat the base of the cartridge. This piercing of the skin starts the\nchemical and atomic reaction. The entire cartridge leaves the tube under\nits own power, at a very easy initial velocity, just enough to insure\naccuracy of aim; so the tube does not have to be of heavy construction.\nThe bullet increases in velocity as it goes. It may be solid or\nexplosive. It may explode on contact or on time, or a combination of\nthese two.\n\nBill and I talked mostly of weapons, military tactics and strategy.\nStrangely enough he had no idea whatever of the possibilities of the\nbarrage, though the tremendous effect of a \"curtain of fire\" with such\nhigh-explosive projectiles as these modern rocket guns used was obvious\nto me. But the barrage idea, it seemed, has been lost track of\ncompletely in the air wars that followed the First World War, and in the\npeculiar guerilla tactics developed by Americans in the later period of\noperations from the ground against Han airships, and in the gang wars\nwhich, until a few generations ago I learned, had been almost\ncontinuous.\n\n\"I wonder,\" said Bill one day, \"if we couldn't work up some form of\nbarrage to spring on the Bad Bloods. The Big Boss told me today that\nhe's been in communication with the other gangs, and all are agreed that\nthe Bad Bloods might as well be wiped out for good. That attempt on\nWilma Deering's life and their evident desire to make trouble among the\ngangs, has stirred up every community east of the Alleghenies. The Boss\nsays that none of the others will object if we go after them. So I\nimagine that before long we will. Now show me again how you worked that\nbusiness in the Argonne forest. The conditions ought to be pretty much\nthe same.\"\n\nI went over it with him in detail, and gradually we worked out a\nmodified plan that would be better adapted to our more powerful weapons,\nand the use of jumpers.\n\n\"It will be easy,\" Bill exulted. \"I'll slide down and talk it over with\nthe Boss tomorrow.\"\n\nDuring the first two weeks of my stay with the Wyomings, Wilma Deering\nand I saw a great deal of each other. I naturally felt a little closer\nfriendship for her, in view of the fact that she was the first human\nbeing I saw after waking from my long sleep; her appreciation of my\nsaving her life, though I could not have done otherwise than I did in\nthat matter, and most of all my own appreciation of the fact that she\nhad not found it as difficult as the others to believe my story,\noperated in the same direction. I could easily imagine my story must\nhave sounded incredible.\n\nIt was natural enough too, that she should feel an unusual interest in\nme. In the first place, I was her personal discovery. In the second, she\nwas a girl of studious and reflective turn of mind. She never got tired\nof my stories and descriptions of the 20th Century.\n\nThe others of the community, however, seemed to find our friendship a\nbit amusing. It seemed that Wilma had a reputation for being cold toward\nthe opposite sex, and so others, not being able to appreciate some of\nher fine qualities as I did, misinterpreted her attitude, much to their\nown delight. Wilma and I, however, ignored this as much as we could.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nA Han Air Raid\n\n\nThere was a girl in Wilma's camp named Gerdi Mann, with whom Bill Hearn\nwas desperately in love, and the four of us used to go around a lot\ntogether. Gerdi was a distinct type. Whereas Wilma had the usual dark\nbrown hair and hazel eyes that marked nearly every member of the\ncommunity, Gerdi had red hair, blue eyes and very fair skin. She has\nbeen dead many years now, but I remember her vividly because she was a\nthrowback in physical appearance to a certain 20th Century type which I\nhave found very rare among modern Americans; also because the four of us\nwere engaged one day in a discussion of this very point, when I obtained\nmy first experience of a Han air raid.\n\nWe were sitting high on the side of a hill overlooking the valley that\nteemed with human activity, invisible beneath its blanket of foliage.\n\nThe other three, who knew of the Irish but vaguely and indefinitely, as\na race on the other side of the globe, which, like ourselves, had\nsucceeded in maintaining a precarious and fugitive existence in\nrebellion against the Mongolian domination of the earth, were listening\nwith interest to my theory that Gerdi's ancestors of several hundred\nyears ago must have been Irish. I explained that Gerdi was an Irish\ntype, evidently a throwback, and that her surname might well have been\nMcMann, or McMahan, and still more anciently \"mac Mathghamhain.\" They\nwere interested too in my surmise that \"Gerdi\" was the same name as that\nwhich had been \"Gerty\" or \"Gertrude\" in the 20th Century.\n\nIn the middle of our discussion, we were startled by an alarm rocket\nthat burst high in the air, far to the north, spreading a pall of red\nsmoke that drifted like a cloud. It was followed by others at scattered\npoints in the northern sky.\n\n\"A Han raid!\" Bill exclaimed in amazement. \"The first in seven years!\"\n\n\"Maybe it's just one of their ships off its course,\" I ventured.\n\n\"No,\" said Wilma in some agitation. \"That would be green rockets. Red\nmeans only one thing, Tony. They're sweeping the countryside with their\ndis beams. Can you see anything, Bill?\"\n\n\"We had better get under cover,\" Gerdi said nervously. \"The four of us\nare bunched here in the open. For all we know they may be twelve miles\nup, out of sight, yet looking at us with a projecto'.\"\n\nBill had been sweeping the horizon hastily with his glass, but\napparently saw nothing.\n\n\"We had better scatter, at that,\" he said finally. \"It's orders, you\nknow. See!\" He pointed to the valley.\n\nHere and there a tiny human figure shot for a moment above the foliage\nof the treetops.\n\n\"That's bad,\" Wilma commented, as she counted the jumpers. \"No less than\nfifteen people visible, and all clearly radiating from a central point.\nDo they want to give away our location?\"\n\nThe standard orders covering air raids were that the population was to\nscatter individually. There should be no grouping, or even pairing, in\nview of the destructiveness of the disintegrator rays. Experience of\ngenerations had proved that if this were done, and everybody remained\nhidden beneath the tree screens, the Hans would have to sweep mile after\nmile of territory, foot by foot, to catch more than a small percentage\nof the community.\n\nGerdi, however, refused to leave Bill, and Wilma developed an equal\nobstinacy against quitting my side. I was inexperienced at this sort of\nthing, she explained, quite ignoring the fact that she was too; she was\nonly thirteen or fourteen years old at the time of the last air raid.\n\nHowever, since I could not argue her out of it, we leaped together about\na quarter of a mile to the right, while Bill and Gerdi disappeared down\nthe hillside among the trees.\n\nWilma and I both wanted a point of vantage from which we might overlook\nthe valley and the sky to the north, and we found it near the top of the\nridge, where, protected from visibility by thick branches, we could look\nout between the tree trunks, and get a good view of the valley.\n\nNo more rockets went up. Except for a few of those warning red clouds,\ndrifting lazily in a blue sky, there was no visible indication of man's\npast or present existence anywhere in the sky or on the ground.\n\nThen Wilma gripped my arm and pointed. I saw it; away off in the\ndistance; looking like a phantom dirigible airship, in its coat of\nlow-visibility paint, a bare spectre.\n\n\"Seven thousand feet up,\" Wilma whispered, crouching close to me.\n\"Watch.\"\n\nThe ship was about the same shape as the great dirigibles of the 20th\nCentury that I had seen, but without the suspended control car, engines,\npropellors, rudders or elevating planes. As it loomed rapidly nearer, I\nsaw that it was wider and somewhat flatter than I had supposed.\n\nNow I could see the repellor rays that held the ship aloft, like\nsearchlight beams faintly visible in the bright daylight (and still\nfaintly visible to the human eye at night). Actually, I had been\ninformed by my instructors, there were two rays; the visible one\ngenerated by the ship's apparatus, and directed toward the ground as a\nbeam of \"carrier\" impulses; and the true repellor ray, the complement of\nthe other in one sense, induced by the action of the \"carrier\" and\nreacting in a concentrating upward direction from the mass of the earth,\nbecoming successively electronic, atomic and finally molecular, in its\nnature, according to various ratios of distance between earth mass and\n\"carrier\" source, until, in the last analysis, the ship itself actually\nis supported on an upward rushing column of air, much like a ball\ncontinuously supported on a fountain jet.\n\nThe raider neared with incredible speed. Its rays were both slanted\nastern at a sharp angle, so that it slid forward with tremendous\nmomentum.\n\nThe ship was operating two disintegrator rays, though only in a casual,\nintermittent fashion. But whenever they flashed downward with blinding\nbrilliancy, forest, rocks and ground melted instantaneously into\nnothing, where they played upon them.\n\nWhen later I inspected the scars left by these rays I found them some\nfive feet deep and thirty feet wide, the exposed surfaces being\nlava-like in texture, but of a pale, iridescent, greenish hue.\n\nNo systematic use of the rays was made by the ship, however, until it\nreached a point over the center of the valley--the center of the\ncommunity's activities. There it came to a sudden stop by shooting its\nrepellor beams sharply forward and easing them back gradually to the\nvertical, holding the ship floating and motionless. Then the work of\ndestruction began systematically.\n\nBack and forth traveled the destroying rays, ploughing parallel furrows\nfrom hillside to hillside. We gasped in dismay, Wilma and I, as time\nafter time we saw it plough through sections where we knew camps or\nplants were located.\n\n\"This is awful,\" she moaned, a terrified question in her eyes. \"How\ncould they know the location so exactly, Tony? Did you see? They were\nnever in doubt. They stalled at a predetermined spot--and--and it was\nexactly the right spot.\"\n\nWe did not talk of what might happen if the rays were turned in our\ndirection. We both knew. We would simply disintegrate in a split second\ninto mere scattered electronic vibrations. Strangely enough, it was this\nself-reliant girl of the 25th Century, who clung to me, a relatively\nprimitive man of the 20th, less familiar than she with the thought of\nthis terrifying possibility, for moral support.\n\nWe knew that many of our companions must have been whisked into absolute\nnon-existence before our eyes in these few moments. The whole thing\nparalyzed us into mental and physical immobility for I do not know how\nlong.\n\nIt couldn't have been long, however, for the rays had not ploughed more\nthan thirty of their twenty-foot furrows or so across the valley, when I\nregained control of myself, and brought Wilma to herself by shaking her\nroughly.\n\n\"How far will this rocket gun shoot, Wilma?\" I demanded, drawing my\npistol.\n\n\"It depends on your rocket, Tony. It will take even the longest range\nrocket, but you could shoot more accurately from a longer tube. But why?\nYou couldn't penetrate the shell of that ship with rocket force, even if\nyou could reach it.\"\n\nI fumbled clumsily with my rocket pouch, for I was excited. I had an\nidea I wanted to try; a \"hunch\" I called it, forgetting that Wilma could\nnot understand my ancient slang. But finally, with her help, I selected\nthe longest range explosive rocket in my pouch, and fitted it to my\npistol.\n\n\"It won't carry seven thousand feet, Tony,\" Wilma objected. But I took\naim carefully. It was another thought that I had in my mind. The\nsupporting repellor ray, I had been told, became molecular in character\nat what was called a logarithmic level of five (below that it was a\npurely electronic \"flow\" or pulsation between the source of the\n\"carrier\" and the average mass of the earth). Below that level if I\ncould project my explosive bullet into this stream where it began to\ncarry material substance upward, might it not rise with the air column,\ngathering speed and hitting the ship with enough impact to carry it\nthrough the shell? It was worth trying anyhow. Wilma became greatly\nexcited, too, when she grasped the nature of my inspiration.\n\nFeverishly I looked around for some formation of branches against which\nI could rest the pistol, for I had to aim most carefully. At last I\nfound one. Patiently I sighted on the hulk of the ship far above us,\naiming at the far side of it, at such an angle as would, so far as I\ncould estimate, bring my bullet path through the forward repellor beam.\nAt last the sights wavered across the point I sought and I pressed the\nbutton gently.\n\nFor a moment we gazed breathlessly.\n\nSuddenly the ship swung bow down, as on a pivot, and swayed like a\npendulum. Wilma screamed in her excitement.\n\n\"Oh, Tony, you hit it! You hit it! Do it again; bring it down!\"\n\nWe had only one more rocket of extreme range between us, and we dropped\nit three times in our excitement in inserting it in my gun. Then,\nforcing myself to be calm by sheer will power, while Wilma stuffed her\nlittle fist into her mouth to keep from shrieking, I sighted carefully\nagain and fired. In a flash, Wilma had grasped the hope that this\ndiscovery of mine might lead to the end of the Han domination.\n\nThe elapsed time of the rocket's invisible flight seemed an age.\n\nThen we saw the ship falling. It seemed to plunge lazily, but actually\nit fell with terrific acceleration, turning end over end, its\ndisintegrator rays, out of control, describing vast, wild arcs, and once\ncutting a gash through the forest less than two hundred feet from where\nwe stood.\n\nThe crash with which the heavy craft hit the ground reverberated from\nthe hills--the momentum of eighteen or twenty thousand tons, in a sheer\ndrop of seven thousand feet. A mangled mass of metal, it buried itself\nin the ground, with poetic justice, in the middle of the smoking,\nsemi-molten field of destruction it had been so deliberately ploughing.\n\nThe silence, the vacuity of the landscape, was oppressive, as the last\nechoes died away.\n\nThen far down the hillside, a single figure leaped exultantly above the\nfoliage screen. And in the distance another, and another.\n\nIn a moment the sky was punctured by signal rockets. One after another\nthe little red puffs became drifting clouds.\n\n\"Scatter! Scatter!\" Wilma exclaimed. \"In half an hour there'll be an\nentire Han fleet here from Nu-yok, and another from Bah-flo. They'll get\nthis instantly on their recordographs and location finders. They'll\nblast the whole valley and the country for miles beyond. Come, Tony.\nThere's no time for the gang to rally. See the signals. We've got to\njump. Oh, I'm so proud of you!\"\n\nOver the ridge we went, in long leaps toward the east, the country of\nthe Delawares.\n\nFrom time to time signal rockets puffed in the sky. Most of them were\nthe \"red warnings,\" the \"scatter\" signals. But from certain of the\nothers, which Wilma identified as Wyoming rockets, she gathered that\nwhoever was in command (we did not know whether the Boss was alive or\nnot) was ordering an ultimate rally toward the south, and so we changed\nour course.\n\nIt was a great pity, I thought, that the clan had not been equipped\nthroughout its membership with ultrophones, but Wilma explained to me,\nthat not enough of these had been built for distribution as yet,\nalthough general distribution had been contemplated within a couple of\nmonths.\n\nWe traveled far before nightfall overtook us, trying only to put as much\ndistance as possible between ourselves and the valley.\n\nWhen gathering dusk made jumping too dangerous, we sought a comfortable\nspot beneath the trees, and consumed part of our emergency rations. It\nwas the first time I had tasted the stuff--a highly nutritive synthetic\nsubstance called \"concentro,\" which was, however, a bit bitter and\nunpalatable. But as only a mouthful or so was needed, it did not matter.\n\nNeither of us had a cloak, but we were both thoroughly tired and happy,\nso we curled up together for warmth. I remember Wilma making some sleepy\nremark about our mating, as she cuddled up, as though the matter were\nall settled, and my surprise at my own instant acceptance of the idea,\nfor I had not consciously thought of her that way before. But we both\nfell asleep at once.\n\nIn the morning we found little time for love making. The practical\nproblem facing us was too great. Wilma felt that the Wyoming plan must\nbe to rally in the Susquanna territory, but she had her doubts about the\nwisdom of this plan. In my elation at my success in bringing down the\nHan ship, and my newly found interest in my charming companion, who was,\nfrom my viewpoint of another century, at once more highly civilized and\nyet more primitive than myself, I had forgotten the ominous fact that\nthe Han ship I had destroyed must have known the exact location of the\nWyoming Works.\n\nThis meant, to Wilma's logical mind, either that the Hans had perfected\nnew instruments as yet unknown to us, or that somewhere, among the\nWyomings or some other nearby gang, there were traitors so degraded as\nto commit that unthinkable act of trafficking in information with the\nHans. In either contingency, she argued, other Han raids would follow,\nand since the Susquannas had a highly developed organization and more\nthan usually productive plants, the next raid might be expected to\nstrike them.\n\nBut at any rate it was clearly our business to get in touch with the\nother fugitives as quickly as possible, so in spite of muscles that were\nsore from the excessive leaping of the day before, we continued on our\nway.\n\nWe traveled for only a couple of hours when we saw a multi-colored\nrocket in the sky, some ten miles ahead of us.\n\n\"Bear to the left, Tony,\" Wilma said, \"and listen for the whistle.\"\n\n\"Why?\" I asked.\n\n\"Haven't they given you the rocket code yet?\" she replied. \"That's what\nthe green, followed by yellow and purple means; to concentrate five\nmiles east of the rocket position. You know the rocket position itself\nmight draw a play of disintegrator beams.\"\n\nIt did not take us long to reach the neighborhood of the indicated\nrallying, though we were now traveling beneath the trees, with but an\noccasional leap to a top branch to see if any more rocket smoke was\nfloating above. And soon we heard a distant whistle.\n\nWe found about half the Gang already there, in a spot where the trees\nmet high above a little stream. The Big Boss and Raid Bosses were busy\nreorganizing the remnants.\n\nWe reported to Boss Hart at once. He was silent, but interested, when he\nheard our story.\n\n\"You two stick close to me,\" he said, adding grimly, \"I'm going back to\nthe valley at once with a hundred picked men, and I'll need you.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nSetting the Trap\n\n\nInside of fifteen minutes we were on our way. A certain amount of\ncaution was sacrificed for the sake of speed, and the men leaped away\neither across the forest top, or over open spaces of ground, but\nconcentration was forbidden. The Big Boss named the spot on the hillside\nas the rallying point.\n\n\"We'll have to take a chance on being seen, so long as we don't group,\"\nhe declared, \"at least until within five miles of the rallying spot.\nFrom then on I want every man to disappear from sight and to travel\nunder cover. And keep your ultrophones open, and tuned on\nten-four-seven-six.\"\n\nWilma and I had received our battle equipment from the Gear boss. It\nconsisted of a long-gun, a hand-gun, with a special case of ammunition\nconstructed of inertron, which made the load weigh but a few ounces, and\na short sword. This gear we strapped over each other's shoulders, on top\nof our jumping belts. In addition, we each received an ultrophone, and a\nlight inertron blanket rolled into a cylinder about six inches long by\ntwo or three in diameter. This fabric was exceedingly thin and light,\nbut it had considerable warmth, because of the mixture of inertron in\nits composition.\n\n[Illustration: The Han raider neared with incredible speed. Its rays\nwere both slanted astern at a sharp angle, so that it slid forward with\ntremendous momentum.... Whenever the disintegrator rays flashed downward\nwith blinding brilliancy, forest, rocks and ground melted\ninstantaneously into nothing, where they played upon them.]\n\n\"This looks like business,\" Wilma remarked to me with sparkling eyes.\n(And I might mention a curious thing here. The word \"business\" had\nsurvived from the 20th Century American vocabulary, but not with any\nmeaning of \"industry\" or \"trade,\" for such things being purely community\nactivities were spoken of as \"work\" and \"clearing.\" Business simply\nmeant fighting, and that was all.)\n\n\"Did you bring all this equipment from the valley?\" I asked the Gear\nBoss.\n\n\"No,\" he said. \"There was no time to gather anything. All this stuff we\ncleared from the Susquannas a few hours ago. I was with the Boss on the\nway down, and he had me jump on ahead and arrange it. But you two had\nbetter be moving. He's beckoning you now.\"\n\nHart was about to call us on our phones when we looked up. As soon as we\ndid so, he leaped away, waving us to follow closely.\n\nHe was a powerful man, and he darted ahead in long, swift, low leaps up\nthe banks of the stream, which followed a fairly straight course at this\npoint. By extending ourselves, however, Wilma and I were able to catch\nup to him.\n\nAs we gradually synchronized our leaps with his, he outlined to us,\nbetween the grunts that accompanied each leap, his plan of action.\n\n\"We have to start the big business--unh--sooner or later,\" he said.\n\"And if--unh--the Hans have found any way of locating our\npositions--unh--it's time to start now, although the Council of\nBosses--unh--had intended waiting a few years until enough rocket ships\nhave been--unh--built. But no matter what the sacrifice--unh--we can't\nafford to let them get us on the run--unh--. We'll set a trap for the\nyellow devils in the--unh--valley if they come back for their\nwreckage--unh--and if they don't, we'll go rocketing for some of their\nliners--unh--on the Nu-yok, Clee-lan, Si-ka-ga course. We can\nuse--unh--that idea of yours of shooting up the repellor--unh--beams.\nWant you to give us a demonstration.\"\n\nWith further admonition to follow him closely, he increased his pace,\nand Wilma and I were taxed to our utmost to keep up with him. It was\nonly in ascending the slopes that my tougher muscles overbalanced his\ngreater skill, and I was able to set the pace for him, as I had for\nWilma.\n\nWe slept in greater comfort that night, under our inertron blankets, and\nwere off with the dawn, leaping cautiously to the top of the ridge\noverlooking the valley which Wilma and I had left.\n\nThe Boss scanned the sky with his ultroscope, patiently taking some\nfifteen minutes to the task, and then swung his phone into use, calling\nthe roll and giving the men their instructions.\n\nHis first order was for us all to slip our ear and chest discs into\npermanent position.\n\nThese ultrophones were quite different from the one used by Wilma's\ncompanion scout the day I saved her from the vicious attack of the\nbandit Gang. That one was contained entirely in a small pocket case.\nThese, with which we were now equipped, consisted of a pair of ear\ndiscs, each a separate and self-contained receiving set. They slipped\ninto little pockets over our ears in the fabric helmets we wore, and\nshut out virtually all extraneous sounds. The chest discs were likewise\nself-contained sending sets, strapped to the chest a few inches below\nthe neck and actuated by the vibrations from the vocal cords through the\nbody tissues. The total range of these sets was about eighteen miles.\nReception was remarkably clear, quite free from the static that so\nmarked the 20th Century radios, and of a strength in direct proportion\nto the distance of the speaker.\n\nThe Boss' set was triple powered, so that his orders would cut in on any\nlocal conversations, which were indulged in, however, with great\nrestraint, and only for the purpose of maintaining contacts.\n\nI marveled at the efficiency of this modern method of battle\ncommunication in contrast to the clumsy signaling devices of more\nancient times; and also at other military contrasts in which the 20th\nand 25th Century methods were the reverse of each other in efficiency.\nThese modern Americans, for instance, knew little of hand to hand\nfighting, and nothing, naturally, of trench warfare. Of barrages they\nwere quite ignorant, although they possessed weapons of terrific power.\nAnd until my recent flash of inspiration, no one among them, apparently,\nhad ever thought of the scheme of shooting a rocket into a repellor beam\nand letting the beam itself hurl it upward into the most vital part of\nthe Han ship.\n\nHart patiently placed his men, first giving his instructions to the\ncampmasters, and then remaining silent, while they placed the\nindividuals.\n\nIn the end, the hundred men were ringed about the valley, on the\nhillsides and tops, each in a position from which he had a good view of\nthe wreckage of the Han ship. But not a man had come in view, so far as\nI could see, in the whole process.\n\nThe Boss explained to me that it was his idea that he, Wilma and I\nshould investigate the wreck. If Han ships should appear in the sky, we\nwould leap for the hillsides.\n\nI suggested to him to have the men set up their long-guns trained on an\nimaginary circle surrounding the wreck. He busied himself with this\nafter the three of us leaped down to the Han ship, serving as a target\nhimself, while he called on the men individually to aim their pieces and\nlock them in position.\n\nIn the meantime Wilma and I climbed into the wreckage, but did not find\nmuch. Practically all of the instruments and machinery had been twisted\nout of all recognizable shape, or utterly destroyed by the ship's\ndisintegrator rays which apparently had continued to operate in the\nmidst of its warped remains for some moments after the crash.\n\nIt was unpleasant work searching the mangled bodies of the crew. But it\nhad to be done. The Han clothing, I observed, was quite different from\nthat of the Americans, and in many respects more like the garb to which\nI had been accustomed in the earlier part of my life. It was made of\nsynthetic fabrics like silks, loose and comfortable trousers of knee\nlength, and sleeveless shirts.\n\nNo protection, except that against drafts, was needed, Wilma explained\nto me, for the Han cities were entirely enclosed, with splendid\narrangements for ventilation and heating. These arrangements of course\nwere equally adequate in their airships. The Hans, indeed, had quite a\ndistaste for unshaded daylight, since their lighting apparatus diffused\na controlled amount of violet rays, making the unmodified sunlight\nunnecessary for health, and undesirable for comfort. Since the Hans did\nnot have the secret of inertron, none of them wore anti-gravity belts.\nYet in spite of the fact that they had to bear their own full weights at\nall times, they were physically far inferior to the Americans, for they\nlived lives of degenerative physical inertia, having machinery of every\ndescription for the performance of all labor, and convenient conveyances\nfor any movement of more than a few steps.\n\nEven from the twisted wreckage of this ship I could see that seats,\nchairs and couches played an extremely important part in their scheme of\nexistence.\n\nBut none of the bodies were overweight. They seemed to have been the\nbodies of men in good health, but muscularly much underdeveloped. Wilma\nexplained to me that they had mastered the science of gland control, and\nof course dietetics, to the point where men and women among them not\nuncommonly reached the age of a hundred years with arteries and general\nhealth in splendid condition.\n\nI did not have time to study the ship and its contents as carefully as I\nwould have liked, however. Time pressed, and it was our business to\ndiscover some clue to the deadly accuracy with which the ship had\nspotted the Wyoming Works.\n\nThe Boss had hardly finished his arrangements for the ring barrage, when\none of the scouts on an eminence to the north, announced the approach of\nseven Han ships, spread out in a great semi-circle.\n\nHart leaped for the hillside, calling to us to do likewise, but Wilma\nand I had raised the flaps of our helmets and switched off our\n\"speakers\" for conversation between ourselves, and by the time we\ndiscovered what had happened, the ships were clearly visible, so fast\nwere they approaching.\n\n\"Jump!\" we heard the Boss order, \"Deering to the north. Rogers to the\neast.\"\n\nBut Wilma looked at me meaningly and pointed to where the twisted plates\nof the ship, projecting from the ground, offered a shelter.\n\n\"Too late, Boss,\" she said. \"They'd see us. Besides I think there's\nsomething here we ought to look at. It's probably their magnetic graph.\"\n\n\"You're signing your death warrant,\" Hart warned.\n\n\"We'll risk it,\" said Wilma and I together.\n\n\"Good for you,\" replied the Boss. \"Take command then, Rogers, for the\npresent. Do you all know his voice, boys?\"\n\nA chorus of assent rang in our ears, and I began to do some fast\nthinking as the girl and I ducked into the twisted mass of metal.\n\n\"Wilma, hunt for that record,\" I said, knowing that by the simple\nprocess of talking I could keep the entire command continuously informed\nas to the situation. \"On the hillsides, keep your guns trained on the\ncircles and stand by. On the hilltops, how many of you are there? Speak\nin rotation from Bald Knob around to the east, north, west.\"\n\nIn turn the men called their names. There were twenty of them.\n\nI assigned them by name to cover the various Han ships, numbering the\nlatter from left to right.\n\n\"Train your rockets on their repellor rays about three-quarters of the\nway up, between ships and ground. Aim is more important than elevation.\nFollow those rays with your aim continuously. Shoot when I tell you, not\nbefore. Deering has the record. The Hans probably have not seen us, or\nat least think there are but two of us in the valley, since they're\nsettling without opening up disintegrators. Any opinions?\"\n\nMy ear discs remained silent.\n\n\"Deering and I remain here until they land and debark. Stand by and keep\nalert.\"\n\nRapidly and easily the largest of the Han ships settled to the earth.\nThree scouted sharply to the south, rising to a higher level. The others\nfloated motionless about a thousand feet above.\n\nPeeping through a small fissure between two plates, I saw the vast hulk\nof the ship come to rest full on the line of our prospective ring\nbarrage. A door clanged open a couple of feet from the ground, and one\nby one the crew emerged.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nThe \"Wyoming Massacre\"\n\n\n\"They're coming out of the ship.\" I spoke quietly, with my hand over\nmy mouth, for fear they might hear me. \"One--two--three--four,\nfive--six--seven--eight--nine. That seems to be all. Who knows how\nmany men a ship like that is likely to carry?\"\n\n\"About ten, if there are no passengers,\" replied one of my men, probably\none of those on the hillside.\n\n\"How are they armed?\" I asked.\n\n\"Just knives,\" came the reply. \"They never permit hand-rays on the\nships. Afraid of accidents. Have a ruling against it.\"\n\n\"Leave them to us then,\" I said, for I had a hastily formed plan in my\nmind. \"You, on the hillsides, take the ships above. Abandon the ring\ntarget. Divide up in training on those repellor rays. You, on the\nhilltops, all train on the repellors of the ships to the south. Shoot at\nthe word, but not before.\n\n\"Wilma, crawl over to your left where you can make a straight leap for\nthe door in that ship. These men are all walking around the wreck in a\nbunch. When they're on the far side, I'll give the word and you leap\nthrough that door in one bound. I'll follow. Maybe we won't be seen.\nWe'll overpower the guard inside, but don't shoot. We may escape being\nseen by both this crew and ships above. They can't see over this wreck.\"\n\nIt was so easy that it seemed too good to be true. The Hans who had\nemerged from the ship walked round the wreckage lazily, talking in\nguttural tones, keenly interested in the wreck, but quite unsuspicious.\n\nAt last they were on the far side. In a moment they would be picking\ntheir way into the wreck.\n\n\"Wilma, leap!\" I almost whispered the order.\n\nThe distance between Wilma's hiding place and the door in the side of\nthe Han ship was not more than fifteen feet. She was already crouched\nwith her feet braced against a metal beam. Taking the lift of that\nwonderful inertron belt into her calculation, she dove headforemost,\nlike a green projectile, through the door. I followed in a split second,\nmore clumsily, but no less speedily, bruising my shoulder painfully, as\nI ricocheted from the edge of the opening and brought up sliding against\nthe unconscious girl; for she evidently had hit her head against the\npartition within the ship into which she had crashed.\n\nWe had made some noise within the ship. Shuffling footsteps were\napproaching down a well lit gangway.\n\n\"Any signs we have been observed?\" I asked my men on the hillsides.\n\n\"Not yet,\" I heard the Boss reply. \"Ships overhead still standing. No\nbeams have been broken out. Men on ground absorbed in wreck. Most of\nthem have crawled into it out of sight.\"\n\n\"Good,\" I said quickly. \"Deering hit her head. Knocked out. One or more\nmembers of the crew approaching. We're not discovered yet. I'll take\ncare of them. Stand a bit longer, but be ready.\"\n\nI think my last words must have been heard by the man who was\napproaching, for he stopped suddenly.\n\nI crouched at the far side of the compartment, motionless. I would not\ndraw my sword if there were only one of them. He would be a weakling, I\nfigured, and I should easily overcome him with my bare hands.\n\nApparently reassured at the absence of any further sound, a man came\naround a sort of bulkhead--and I leaped.\n\nI swung my legs up in front of me as I did so, catching him full in the\nstomach and knocked him cold.\n\nI ran forward along the keel gangway, searching for the control room. I\nfound it well up in the nose of the ship. And it was deserted. What\ncould I do to jam the controls of the ships that would not register on\nthe recording instruments of the other ships? I gazed at the mass of\ncontrols. Levers and wheels galore. In the center of the compartment, on\na massively braced universal joint mounting, was what I took for the\nrepellor generator. A dial on it glowed and a faint hum came from within\nits shielding metallic case. But I had no time to study it.\n\nAbove all else, I was afraid that some automatic telephone apparatus\nexisted in the room, through which I might be heard on the other ships.\nThe risk of trying to jam the controls was too great. I abandoned the\nidea and withdrew softly. I would have to take a chance that there was\nno other member of the crew aboard.\n\nI ran back to the entrance compartment. Wilma still lay where she had\nslumped down. I heard the voices of the Hans approaching. It was time to\nact. The next few seconds would tell whether the ships in the air would\ntry or be able to melt us into nothingness. I spoke.\n\n\"Are you boys all ready?\" I asked, creeping to a position opposite the\ndoor and drawing my hand-gun.\n\nAgain there was a chorus of assent.\n\n\"Then on the count of three, shoot up those repellor rays--all of\nthem--and for God's sake, don't miss.\" And I counted.\n\nI think my \"three\" was a bit weak. I know it took all the courage I had\nto utter it.\n\nFor an agonizing instant nothing happened, except that the landing party\nfrom the ship strolled into my range of vision.\n\nThen startled, they turned their eyes upward. For an instant they stood\nfrozen with horror at whatever they saw.\n\nOne hurled his knife at me. It grazed my cheek. Then a couple of them\nmade a break for the doorway. The rest followed. But I fired pointblank\nwith my hand-gun, pressing the button as fast as I could and aiming at\ntheir feet to make sure my explosive rockets would make contact and do\ntheir work.\n\nThe detonations of my rockets were deafening. The spot on which the Hans\nstood flashed into a blinding glare. Then there was nothing there except\ntheir torn and mutilated corpses. They had been fairly bunched, and I\ngot them all.\n\nI ran to the door, expecting any instant to be hurled into infinity by\nthe sweep of a disintegrator ray.\n\nSome eighth of a mile away I saw one of the ships crash to earth. A\ndisintegrator ray came into my line of vision, wavered uncertainly for a\nmoment and then began to sweep directly toward the ship in which I\nstood. But it never reached it. Suddenly, like a light switched off, it\nshot to one side, and a moment later another vast hulk crashed to earth.\nI looked out, then stepped out on the ground.\n\nThe only Han ships in the sky were two of the scouts to the south which\nwere hanging perpendicularly, and sagging slowly down. The others must\nhave crashed down while I was deafened by the sound of the explosion of\nmy own rockets.\n\nSomebody hit the other repellor ray of one of the two remaining ships\nand it fell out of sight beyond a hilltop. The other, farther away,\ndrifted down diagonally, its disintegrator ray playing viciously over\nthe ground below it.\n\nI shouted with exultation and relief.\n\n\"Take back the command, Boss!\" I yelled.\n\nHis commands, sending out jumpers in pursuit of the descending ship,\nrang in my ears, but I paid no attention to them. I leaped back into the\ncompartment of the Han ship and knelt beside my Wilma. Her padded helmet\nhad absorbed much of the blow, I thought; otherwise, her skull might\nhave been fractured.\n\n\"Oh, my head!\" she groaned, coming to as I lifted her gently in my arms\nand strode out in the open with her. \"We must have won, dearest, did\nwe?\"\n\n\"We most certainly did,\" I reassured her. \"All but one crashed and that\none is drifting down toward the south; we've captured this one we're in\nintact. There was only one member of the crew aboard when we dove in.\"\n\n[Illustration: As the American leaped, he swung his legs up in front of\nhim, catching the Han full in the stomach.]\n\nLess than an hour afterward the Big Boss ordered the outfit to tune in\nultrophones on three-twenty-three to pick up a translated broadcast of\nthe Han intelligence office in Nu-yok from the Susquanna station. It\nwas in the form of a public warning and news item, and read as follows:\n\n\"This is Public Intelligence Office, Nu-yok, broadcasting warning to\nnavigators of private ships, and news of public interest. The squadron\nof seven ships, which left Nu-yok this morning to investigate the recent\ndestruction of the GK-984 in the Wyoming Valley, has been destroyed by a\nseries of mysterious explosions similar to those which wrecked the\nGK-984.\n\n\"The phones, viewplates, and all other signaling devices of five of the\nseven ships ceased operating suddenly at approximately the same moment,\nabout seven-four-nine.\" (According to the Han system of reckoning time,\nseven and forty-nine one hundredths after midnight.) \"After violent\ndisturbances the location finders went out of operation. Electroactivity\nregisters applied to the territory of the Wyoming Valley remain dead.\n\n\"The Intelligence Office has no indication of the kind of disaster which\novertook the squadron except certain evidences of explosive phenomena\nsimilar to those in the case of the GK-984, which recently went dead\nwhile beaming the valley in a systematic effort to wipe out the works\nand camps of the tribesmen. The Office considers, as obvious, the\ndeduction that the tribesmen have developed a new, and as yet\nundetermined, technique of attack on airships, and has recommended to\nthe Heaven-Born that immediate and unlimited authority be given the\nNavigation Intelligence Division to make an investigation of this\ntechnique and develop a defense against it.\n\n\"In the meantime it urges that private navigators avoid this territory\nin particular, and in general hold as closely as possible to the\nofficial inter-city routes, which now are being patrolled by the entire\nforce of the Military Office, which is beaming the routes generously to\na width of ten miles. The Military Office reports that it is at present\nconsidering no retaliatory raids against the tribesmen. With the\nNavigation Intelligence Division, it holds that unless further evidence\nof the nature of the disaster is developed in the near future, the\npublic interest will be better served, and at smaller cost of life, by a\nscientific research than by attempts at retaliation, which may bring\ndestruction on all ships engaging therein. So unless further evidence\nactually is developed, or the Heaven-Born orders to the contrary, the\nMilitary will hold to a defensive policy.\n\n\"Unofficial intimations from Lo-Tan are to the effect that the\nHeaven-Council has the matter under consideration.\n\n\"The Navigation Intelligence Office permits the broadcast of the\nfollowing condensation of its detailed observations:\n\n\"The squadron proceeded to a position above the Wyoming Valley where\nthe wreck of the GK-984 was known to be, from the record of its location\nfinder before it went dead recently. There the bottom projectoscope\nrelays of all ships registered the wreck of the GK-984. Teleprojectoscope\nviews of the wreck and the bowl of the valley showed no evidence of the\npresence of tribesmen. Neither ship registers nor base registers showed\nany indication of electroactivity except from the squadron itself. On\norders from the Base Squadron Commander, the LD-248, LK-745 and LG-25\nscouted southward at 3,000 feet. The GK-43, GK-981 and GK-220 stood\nabove at 2,500 feet, and the GK-18 landed to permit personal inspection\nof the wreck by the science committee. The party debarked, leaving one\nman on board in the control cabin. He set all projectoscopes at\nuniversal focus except RB-3,\" (this meant the third projectoscope from\nthe bow of the ship, on the right-hand side of the lower deck) \"with\nwhich he followed the landing group as it walked around the wreck.\n\n\"The first abnormal phenomenon recorded by any of the instruments at\nBase was that relayed automatically from projectoscope RB-4 of the\nGK-18, which as the party disappeared from view in back of the wreck,\nrecorded two green missiles of roughly cylindrical shape, projected from\nthe wreckage into the landing compartment of the ship. At such close\nrange these were not clearly defined, owing to the universal focus at\nwhich the projectoscope was set. The Base Captain of GK-18 at once\nordered the man in the control room to investigate, and saw him leave\nthe control room in compliance with this order. An instant later\nconfused sounds reached the control-room electrophone, such as might be\nmade by a man falling heavily, and footsteps reapproached the control\nroom, a figure entering and leaving the control room hurriedly. The Base\nCaptain now believes, and the stills of the photorecord support his\nbelief, that this was not the crew member who had been left in the\ncontrol room. Before the Base Captain could speak to him he left the\nroom, nor was any response given to the attention signal the Captain\nflashed throughout the ship.\n\n\"At this point projectoscope RB-3 of the ship now out of focus control,\ndimly showed the landing party walking back toward the ship. RB-4 showed\nit more clearly. Then on both these instruments, a number of blinding\nexplosives in rapid succession were seen and the electrophone relays\nregistered terrific concussions; the ship's electronic apparatus and\nprojectoscopes apparatus went dead.\n\n\"Reports of the other ships' Base Observers and Executives, backed by\nthe photorecords, show the explosions as taking place in the midst of\nthe landing party as it returned, evidently unsuspicious, to the ship.\nThen in rapid succession they indicate that terrific explosions occurred\ninside and outside the three ships standing above close to their rep-ray\ngenerators, and all signals from these ships thereupon went dead.\n\n\"Of the three ships scouting to the south, the LD-248 suffered an\nidentical fate, at the same moment. Its records add little to the\nknowledge of the disaster. But with the LK-745 and the LG-25 it was\ndifferent.\n\n\"The relay instruments of the LK-745 indicated the destruction by an\nexplosion of the rear rep-ray generator, and that the ship hung stern\ndown for a short space, swinging like a pendulum. The forward viewplates\nand indicators did not cease functioning, but their records are chaotic,\nexcept for one projectoscope still, which shows the bowl of the valley,\nand the GK-981 falling, but no visible evidence of tribesmen. The\ncontrol-room viewplate is also a chaotic record of the ship's crew\ntumbling and falling to the rear wall. Then the forward rep-ray\ngenerator exploded, and all signals went dead.\n\n\"The fate of the LG-25 was somewhat similar, except that this ship hung\nnose down, and drifted on the wind southward as it slowly descended out\nof control.\n\n\"As its control room was shattered, verbal report from its Action\nCaptain was precluded. The record of the interior rear viewplate shows\nmembers of the crew climbing toward the rear rep-ray generator in an\nattempt to establish manual control of it, and increase the lift. The\nprojectoscope relays, swinging in wide arcs, recorded little of value\nexcept at the ends of their swings. One of these, from a machine which\nhappened to be set in telescopic focus, shows several views of great\nvalue in picturing the falls of the other ships, and all of the rear\nprojectoscope records enable the reconstruction in detail of the\npendulum and torsional movements of the ship, and its sag toward the\nearth. But none of the views showing the forest below contain any\nindication of tribesmen's presence. A final explosion put this ship out\nof commission at a height of 1,000 feet, and at a point four miles S. by\nE. of the center of the valley.\"\n\nThe message ended with a repetition of the warning to other airmen to\navoid the valley.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nIncredible Treason\n\n\nAfter receiving this report, and reassurances of support from the Big\nBosses of the neighboring Gangs, Hart determined to reestablish the\nWyoming Valley community.\n\nA careful survey of the territory showed that it was only the northern\nsections and slopes that had been \"beamed\" by the first Han ship.\n\nThe synthetic-fabrics plant had been partially wiped out, though the\nlower levels underground had not been reached by the dis ray. The forest\nscreen above it, however, had been annihilated, and it was determined to\nabandon it, after removing all usable machinery and evidences of the\nprocesses that might be of interest to the Han scientists, should they\nreturn to the valley in the future.\n\nThe ammunition plant, and the rocket-ship plant, which had just been\nabout to start operation at the time of the raid, were intact, as were\nthe other important plants.\n\nHart brought the Camboss up from the Susquanna Works, and laid out new\ncamp locations, scattering them farther to the south, and avoiding\nground which had been seared by the Han beams and the immediate\nlocations of the Han wrecks.\n\nDuring this period, a sharp check was kept upon Han messages, for the\nphone plant had been one of the first to be put in operation, and when\nit became evident that the Hans did not intend any immediate reprisals,\nthe entire membership of the community was summoned back, and normal\nlife was resumed.\n\nWilma and I had been married the day after the destruction of the ships,\nand spent this intervening period in a delightful honeymoon, camping\nhigh in the mountains. On our return, we had a camp of our own, of\ncourse. We were assigned to location 1017. And as might be expected, we\nhad a great deal of banter over which one of us was Camp Boss. The title\nstood after my name on the Big Boss' records, and those of the Big\nCamboss, of course, but Wilma airily held that this meant nothing at\nall--and generally succeeded in making me admit it whenever she chose.\n\nI found myself a full-fledged member of the Gang now, for I had elected\nto search no farther for a permanent alliance, much as I would have\nliked to familiarize myself with this 25th Century life in other\nsections of the country. The Wyomings had a high morale, and had\nprospered under the rule of Big Boss Hart for many years. But many of\nthe gangs, I found, were badly organized, lacked strong hands in\nauthority, and were rife with intrigue. On the whole, I thought I would\nbe wise to stay with a group which had already proved its friendliness,\nand in which I seemed to have prospects of advancement. Under these\nmodern social and economic conditions, the kind of individual freedom to\nwhich I had been accustomed in the 20th Century was impossible. I would\nhave been as much of a nonentity in every phase of human relationship by\nattempting to avoid alliances, as any man of the 20th Century would have\nbeen politically, who aligned himself with no political party.\n\nThis entire modern life, it appeared to me, judging from my ancient\nviewpoint, was organized along what I called \"political\" lines. And in\nthis connection, it amused me to notice how universal had become the use\nof the word \"boss.\" The leader, the person in charge or authority over\nanything, was a \"boss.\" There was as little formality in his relations\nwith his followers as there was in the case of the 20th Century\npolitical boss, and the same high respect paid him by his followers as\nwell as the same high consideration by him of their interests. He was\njust as much of an autocrat, and just as much dependent upon the general\npopularity of his actions for the ability to maintain his autocracy.\n\nThe sub-boss who could not command the loyalty of his followers was as\nquickly deposed, either by them or by his superiors, as the ancient ward\nleader of the 20th Century who lost control of his votes.\n\nAs society was organized in the 20th Century, I do not believe the\nsystem could have worked in anything but politics. I tremble to think\nwhat would have happened, had the attempt been made to handle the A. E.\nF. this way during the First World War, instead of by that rigid\nmilitary discipline and complete assumption of the individual as a mere\nstandardized cog in the machine.\n\nBut owing to the centuries of desperate suffering the people had endured\nat the hands of the Hans, there developed a spirit of self-sacrifice and\nconsideration for the common good that made the scheme applicable and\nefficient in all forms of human co-operation.\n\nI have a little heresy about all this, however. My associates regard the\nthought with as much horror as many worthy people of the 20th Century\nfelt in regard to any heretical suggestion that the original outline of\ngovernment as laid down in the First Constitution did not apply as well\nto 20th Century conditions as to those of the early 19th.\n\nIn later years, I felt that there was a certain softening of moral fiber\namong the people, since the Hans had been finally destroyed with all\ntheir works; and Americans have developed a new luxury economy. I have\nseen signs of the reawakening of greed, of selfishness. The eternal\ncycle seems to be at work. I fear that slowly, though surely, private\nwealth is reappearing, codes of inflexibility are developing; they will\nbe followed by corruption, degradation; and in the end some cataclysmic\nevent will end this era and usher in a new one.\n\nAll this, however, is wandering afar from my story, which concerns our\nearly battles against the Hans, and not our more modern problems of\nself-control.\n\nOur victory over the seven Han ships had set the country ablaze. The\nsecret had been carefully communicated to the other gangs, and the\ncountry was agog from one end to the other. There was feverish activity\nin the ammunition plants, and the hunting of stray Han ships became an\nenthusiastic sport. The results were disastrous to our hereditary\nenemies.\n\nFrom the Pacific Coast came the report of a great transpacific liner of\n75,000 tons \"lift\" being brought to earth from a position of\ninvisibility above the clouds. A dozen Sacramentos had caught the hazy\noutlines of its rep rays approaching them, head-on, in the twilight,\nlike ghostly pillars reaching into the sky. They had fired rockets into\nit with ease, whereas they would have had difficulty in hitting it if it\nhad been moving at right angles to their position. They got one rep ray.\nThe other was not strong enough to hold it up. It floated to earth, nose\ndown, and since it was unarmed and unarmored, they had no difficulty in\nshooting it to pieces and massacring its crew and passengers. It seemed\nbarbarous to me. But then I did not have centuries of bitter persecution\nin my blood.\n\nFrom the Jersey Beaches we received news of the destruction of a\nNu-yok-A-lan-a liner. The Sand-snipers, practically invisible in their\nsand-colored clothing, and half buried along the beaches, lay in wait\nfor days, risking the play of dis beams along the route, and finally\nregistering four hits within a week. The Hans discontinued their service\nalong this route, and as evidence that they were badly shaken by our\nsuccess, sent no raiders down the Beaches.\n\nIt was a few weeks later that Big Boss Hart sent for me.\n\n\"Tony,\" he said, \"There are two things I want to talk to you about. One\nof them will become public property in a few days, I think. We aren't\ngoing to get any more Han ships by shooting up their repellor rays\nunless we use much larger rockets. They are wise to us now. They're\nputting armor of great thickness in the hulls of their ships below the\nrep-ray machines. Near Bah-flo this morning a party of Eries shot one\nwithout success. The explosions staggered her, but did not penetrate. As\nnear as we can gather from their reports, their laboratories have\ndeveloped a new alloy of great tensile strength and elasticity which\nnevertheless lets the rep rays through like a sieve. Our reports\nindicate that the Eries' rockets bounced off harmlessly. Most of the\nparty was wiped out as the dis rays went into action on them.\n\n\"This is going to mean real business for all of the gangs before long.\nThe Big Bosses have just held a national ultrophone council. It was\ndecided that America must organize on a national basis. The first move\nis to develop sectional organization by Zones. I have been made\nSuperboss of the Mid-Atlantic Zone.\n\n\"We're in for it now. The Hans are sure to launch reprisal expeditions.\nIf we're to save the race we must keep them away from our camps and\nplants. I'm thinking of developing a permanent field force, along the\nlines of the regular armies of the 20th Century you told me about. Its\nbusiness will be twofold: to carry the warfare as much as possible to\nthe Hans, and to serve as a decoy, to keep their attention from our\nplants. I'm going to need your help in this.\n\n\"The other thing I wanted to talk to you about is this: Amazing and\nimpossible as it seems, there is a group, or perhaps an entire gang,\nsomewhere among us, that is betraying us to the Hans. It may be the Bad\nBloods, or it may be one of those gangs who live near one of the Han\ncities. You know, a hundred and fifteen or twenty years ago there were\ncertain of these people's ancestors who actually degraded themselves by\nmating with the Hans, sometimes even serving them as slaves, in the days\nbefore they brought all their service machinery to perfection.\n\n\"There is such a gang, called the Nagras, up near Bah-flo, and another\nin Mid-Jersey that men call the Pineys. But I hardly suspect the Pineys.\nThere is little intelligence among them. They wouldn't have the\ninformation to give the Hans, nor would they be capable of imparting it.\nThey're absolute savages.\"\n\n\"Just what evidence is there that anybody has been clearing information\nto the Hans?\" I asked.\n\n\"Well,\" he replied, \"first of all there was that raid upon us. That\nfirst Han ship knew the location of our plants exactly. You remember it\nfloated directly into position above the valley and began a systematic\nbeaming. Then, the Hans quite obviously have learned that we are picking\nup their electrophone waves, for they've gone back to their old, but\nextremely accurate, system of directional control. But we've been\ngetting them for the past week by installing automatic re-broadcast\nunits along the scar paths. This is what the Americans called those\nstrips of country directly under the regular ship routes of the Hans,\nwho as a matter of precaution frequently blasted them with their dis\nbeams to prevent the growth of foliage which might give shelter to the\nAmericans. But they've been beaming those paths so hard, it looks as\nthough they even had information of this strategy. And in addition,\nthey've been using code. Finally, we've picked up three of their\nmessages in which they discuss, with some nervousness, the existence of\nour 'mysterious' ultrophone.\"\n\n\"But they still have no knowledge of the nature and control of ultronic\nactivity?\" I asked.\n\n\"No,\" said the Big Boss thoughtfully, \"they don't seem to have a bit of\ninformation about it.\"\n\n\"Then it's quite clear,\" I ventured, \"that whoever is 'clearing' us to\nthem is doing it piecemeal. It sounds like a bit of occasional barter,\nrather than an out-and-out alliance. They're holding back as much\ninformation as possible for future bartering, perhaps.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Hart said, \"and it isn't information the Hans are giving in\nreturn, but some form of goods, or privilege. The trick would be to\nlocate the goods. I guess I'll have to make a personal trip around among\nthe Big Bosses.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nThe Han City\n\n\nThis conversation set me thinking. All of the Han electrophone\ninter-communication had been an open record to the Americans for a good\nmany years, and the Hans were just finding it out. For centuries they\nhad not regarded us as any sort of a menace. Unquestionably it had never\noccurred to them to secrete their own records. Somewhere in Nu-yok or\nBah-flo, or possibly in Lo-Tan itself, the record of this traitorous\ntransaction would be more or less openly filed. If we could only get at\nit! I wondered if a raid might not be possible.\n\nBill Hearn and I talked it over with our Han-affairs Boss and his\nexperts. There ensued several days of research, in which the Han records\nof the entire decade were scanned and analyzed. In the end they picked\nout a mass of detail, and fitted it together into a very definite\npicture of the great central filing office of the Hans in Nu-yok, where\nthe entire mass of official records was kept, constantly available for\ninstant projectoscoping to any of the city's offices, and of the system\nby which the information was filed.\n\nThe attempt began to look feasible, though Hart instantly turned the\nidea down when I first presented it to him. It was unthinkable, he said.\nSheer suicide. But in the end I persuaded him.\n\n\"I will need,\" I said, \"Blash, who is thoroughly familiar with the Han\nlibrary system; Bert Gaunt, who for years has specialized on their\nmilitary offices; Bill Barker, the ray specialist, and the best swooper\npilot we have.\" _Swoopers_ are one-man and two-man ships, developed by\nthe Americans, with skeleton backbones of inertron (during the war\npainted green for invisibility against the green forests below) and\n\"bellies\" of clear ultron.\n\n\"That will be Mort Gibbons,\" said Hart. \"We've only got three swoopers\nleft, Tony, but I'll risk one of them if you and the others will\nvoluntarily risk your existences. But mind, I won't urge or order one of\nyou to go. I'll spread the word to every Plant Boss at once to give you\nanything and everything you need in the way of equipment.\"\n\nWhen I told Wilma of the plan, I expected her to raise violent and\ntearful objections, but she didn't. She was made of far sterner stuff\nthan the women of the 20th Century. Not that she couldn't weep as\ncopiously or be just as whimsical on occasion; but she wouldn't weep for\nthe same reasons.\n\nShe just gave me an unfathomable look, in which there seemed to be a bit\nof pride, and asked eagerly for the details. I confess I was somewhat\ndisappointed that she could so courageously risk my loss, even though I\nwas amazed at her fortitude. But later I was to learn how little I knew\nher then.\n\nWe were ready to slide off at dawn the next morning. I had kissed Wilma\ngood-bye at our camp, and after a final conference over our plans, we\nboarded our craft and gently glided away over the tree tops on a course,\nwhich, after crossing three routes of the Han ships, would take us out\nover the Atlantic, off the Jersey coast, whence we would come up on\nNu-yok from the ocean.\n\nTwice we had to nose down and lie motionless on the ground near a route\nwhile Han ships passed. Those were tense moments. Had the green back of\nour ship been observed, we would have been disintegrated in a second.\nBut it wasn't.\n\nOnce over the water, however, we climbed in a great spiral, ten miles in\ndiameter, until our altimeter registered ten miles. Here Gibbons shut\noff his rocket motor, and we floated, far above the level of the\nAtlantic liners, whose course was well to the north of us anyhow, and\nwaited for nightfall.\n\nThen Gibbons turned from his control long enough to grin at me.\n\n\"I have a surprise for you, Tony,\" he said, throwing back the lid of\nwhat I had supposed was a big supply case. And with a sigh of relief,\nWilma stepped out of the case.\n\n\"If you 'go into zero' (a common expression of the day for being\nannihilated by the disintegrator ray), you don't think I'm going to let\nyou go alone, do you, Tony? I couldn't believe my ears last night when\nyou spoke of going without me, until I realized that you are still five\nhundred years behind the times in lots of ways. Don't you know, dear\nheart, that you offered me the greatest insult a husband could give a\nwife? You didn't, of course.\"\n\nThe others, it seemed, had all been in on the secret, and now they would\nhave kidded me unmercifully, except that Wilma's eyes blazed\ndangerously.\n\nAt nightfall, we maneuvered to a position directly above the city. This\ntook some time and calculation on the part of Bill Barker, who explained\nto me that he had to determine our point by ultronic bearings. The\nslightest resort to an electronic instrument, he feared, might be\ndetected by our enemies' locators. In fact, we did not dare bring our\nswooper any lower than five miles for fear that its capacity might be\nreflected in their instruments.\n\nFinally, however, he succeeded in locating above the central tower of\nthe city.\n\n\"If my calculations are as much as ten feet off,\" he remarked with\nconfidence, \"I'll eat the tower. Now the rest is up to you, Mort. See\nwhat you can do to hold her steady. No--here, watch this indicator--the\nred beam, not the green one. See--if you keep it exactly centered on the\nneedle, you're O.K. The width of the beam represents seventeen feet. The\ntower platform is fifty feet square, so we've got a good margin to work\non.\"\n\nFor several moments we watched as Gibbons bent over his levers,\nconstantly adjusting them with deft touches of his fingers. After a bit\nof wavering, the beam remained centered on the needle.\n\n\"Now,\" I said, \"let's drop.\"\n\nI opened the trap and looked down, but quickly shut it again when I felt\nthe air rushing out of the ship into the rarefied atmosphere in a\ntorrent. Gibbons literally yelled a protest from his instrument board.\n\n\"I forgot,\" I mumbled. \"Silly of me. Of course, we'll have to drop out\nof compartment.\"\n\nThe compartment, to which I referred, was similar to those in some of\nthe 20th Century submarines. We all entered it. There was barely room\nfor us to stand, shoulder to shoulder. With some struggles, we got into\nour special air helmets and adjusted the pressure. At our signal,\nGibbons exhausted the air in the compartment, pumping it into the body\nof the ship, and as the little signal light flashed, Wilma threw open\nthe hatch.\n\nSetting the ultron-wire reel, I climbed through, and began to slide down\ngently.\n\nWe all had our belts on, of course, adjusted to a weight balance of but\na few ounces. And the five-mile reel of ultron wire that was to be our\nguide, was of gossamer fineness, though, anyway, I believe it would have\nlifted the full weight of the five of us, so strong and tough was this\ninvisible metal. As an extra precaution, since the wire was of the\npurest metal, and therefore totally invisible, even in daylight, we all\nhad our belts hooked on small rings that slid down the wire.\n\nI went down with the end of the wire. Wilma followed a few feet above\nme, then Barker, Gaunt and Blash. Gibbons, of course, stayed behind to\nhold the ship in position and control the paying out of the line. We all\nhad our ultrophones in place inside our air helmets, and so could\nconverse with one another and with Gibbons. But at Wilma's suggestion,\nalthough we would have liked to let the Big Boss listen in, we kept them\nadjusted to short-range work, for fear that those who had been clearing\nwith the Hans, and against whom we were on a raid for evidence, might\nalso pick up our conversation. We had no fear that the Hans would hear\nus. In fact, we had the added advantage that, even after we landed, we\ncould converse freely without danger of their hearing our voices through\nour air helmets.\n\nFor a while I could see nothing below but utter darkness. Then I\nrealized, from the feel of the air as much as from anything, that we\nwere sinking through a cloud layer. We passed through two more cloud\nlayers before anything was visible to us.\n\nThen there came under my gaze, about two miles below, one of the most\nbeautiful sights I have ever seen; the soft, yet brilliant, radiance of\nthe great Han city of Nu-yok. Every foot of its structural members\nseemed to glow with a wonderful incandescence, tower piled up on tower,\nand all built on the vast base-mass of the city, which, so I had been\ntold, sheered upward from the surface of the rivers to a height of 728\nlevels.\n\nThe city, I noticed with some surprise, did not cover anything like the\nsame area as the New York of the 20th Century. It occupied, as a matter\nof fact, only the lower half of Manhattan Island, with one section\nstraddling the East River, and spreading out sufficiently over what once\nhad been Brooklyn, to provide berths for the great liners and other air\ncraft.\n\nStraight beneath my feet was a tiny dark patch. It seemed the only spot\nin the entire city that was not aflame with radiance. This was the\ncentral tower, in the top floors of which were housed the vast library\nof record files and the main projectoscope plant.\n\n\"You can shoot the wire now,\" I ultrophoned Gibbons, and let go the\nlittle weighted knob. It dropped like a plummet, and we followed with\nconsiderable speed, but braking our descent with gloved hands\nsufficiently to see whether the knob, on which a faint light glowed as a\nsignal for ourselves, might be observed by any Han guard or night\nprowler. Apparently it was not, and we again shot down with accelerated\nspeed.\n\nWe landed on the roof of the tower without any mishap, and fortunately\nfor our plan, in darkness. Since there was nothing above it on which it\nwould have been worth while to shed illumination, or from which there\nwas any need to observe it, the Hans had neglected to light the tower\nroof, or indeed to occupy it at all. This was the reason we had selected\nit as our landing place.\n\nAs soon as Gibbons had our word, he extinguished the knob light, and the\nknob, as well as the wire, became totally invisible. At our ultrophoned\nword, he would light it again.\n\n\"No gun play now,\" I warned. \"Swords only, and then only if absolutely\nnecessary.\"\n\nClosely bunched, and treading as lightly as only inertron-belted people\ncould, we made our way cautiously through a door and down an inclined\nplane to the floor below, where Gaunt and Blash assured us the military\noffices were located.\n\nTwice Barker cautioned us to stop as we were about to pass in front of\nmirror-like \"windows\" in the passage wall, and flattening ourselves to\nthe floor, we crawled past them.\n\n\"Projectoscopes,\" he said. \"Probably on automatic record only, at this\ntime of night. Still, we don't want to leave any records for them to\nstudy after we're gone.\"\n\n\"Were you ever here before?\" I asked.\n\n\"No,\" he replied, \"but I haven't been studying their electrophone\ncommunications for seven years without being able to recognize these\nmachines when I run across them.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nThe Fight in the Tower\n\n\nSo far we had not laid eyes on a Han. The tower seemed deserted. Blash\nand Gaunt, however, assured me that there would be at least one man on\n\"duty\" in the military offices, though he would probably be asleep, and\ntwo or three in the library proper and the projectoscope plant.\n\n\"We've got to put them out of commission,\" I said. \"Did you bring the\n'dope' cans, Wilma?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she said, \"two for each. Here,\" and she distributed them.\n\nWe were now two levels below the roof, and at the point where we were to\nseparate.\n\nI did not want to let Wilma out of my sight, but it was necessary.\n\nAccording to our plan, Barker was to make his way to the projectoscope\nplant, Blash and I to the library, and Wilma and Gaunt to the military\noffice.\n\nBlash and I traversed a long corridor, and paused at the great arched\ndoorway of the library. Cautiously we peered in. Seated at three great\nswitchboards were library operatives. Occasionally one of them would\nreach lazily for a lever, or sleepily push a button, as little numbered\nlights winked on and off. They were answering calls for electrograph and\nviewplate records on all sorts of subjects from all sections of the\ncity.\n\nI apprised my companions of the situation.\n\n\"Better wait a bit,\" Blash added. \"The calls will lessen shortly.\"\n\nWilma reported an officer in the military office sound asleep.\n\n\"Give him the can, then,\" I said.\n\nBarker was to do nothing more than keep watch in the projectoscope\nplant, and a few moments later he reported himself well concealed, with\na splendid view of the floor.\n\n\"I think we can take a chance now,\" Blash said to me, and at my nod, he\nopened the lid of his dope can. Of course, the fumes did not affect us,\nthrough our helmets. They were absolutely without odor or visibility,\nand in a few seconds the librarians were unconscious. We stepped into\nthe room.\n\nThere ensued considerable cautious observation and experiment on the\npart of Gaunt, working from the military office, and Blash in the\nlibrary; while Wilma and I, with drawn swords and sharply attuned\nmicrophones, stood guard, and occasionally patrolled nearby corridors.\n\n\"I hear something approaching,\" Wilma said after a bit, with excitement\nin her voice. \"It's a soft, gliding sound.\"\n\n\"That's an elevator somewhere,\" Barker cut in from the projectoscope\nfloor. \"Can you locate it? I can't hear it.\"\n\n\"It's to the east of me,\" she replied.\n\n\"And to my west,\" said I, faintly catching it. \"It's between us, Wilma,\nand nearer you than me. Be careful. Have you got any information yet,\nBlash and Gaunt?\"\n\n\"Getting it now,\" one of them replied. \"Give us two minutes more.\"\n\n\"Keep at it then,\" I said. \"We'll guard.\"\n\nThe soft, gliding sound ceased.\n\n\"I think it's very close to me,\" Wilma almost whispered. \"Come closer,\nTony. I have a feeling something is going to happen. I've never known my\nnerves to get taut like this without reason.\"\n\nIn some alarm, I launched myself down the corridor in a great leap\ntoward the intersection whence I knew I could see her.\n\nIn the middle of my leap my ultrophone registered her gasp of alarm. The\nnext instant I glided to a stop at the intersection to see Wilma backing\ntoward the door of the military office, her sword red with blood, and an\ninert form on the corridor floor. Two other Hans were circling to either\nside of her with wicked-looking knives, while a third evidently a high\nofficer, judging by the resplendence of his garb tugged desperately to\nget an electrophone instrument out of a bulky pocket. If he ever gave\nthe alarm, there was no telling what might happen to us.\n\nI was at least seventy feet away, but I crouched low and sprang with\nevery bit of strength in my legs. It would be more correct to say that I\ndived, for I reached the fellow head on, with no attempt to draw my legs\nbeneath me.\n\nSome instinct must have warned him, for he turned suddenly as I hurtled\nclose to him. But by this time I had sunk close to the floor, and had\nstiffened myself rigidly, lest a dragging knee or foot might just\nprevent my reaching him. I brought my blade upward and over. It was a\nvicious slash that laid him open, bisecting him from groin to chin, and\nhis dead body toppled down on me, as I slid to a tangled stop.\n\nThe other two startled, turned. Wilma leaped at one and struck him down\nwith a side slash. I looked up at this instant, and the dazed fear on\nhis face at the length of her leap registered vividly. The Hans knew\nnothing of our inertron belts, it seemed, and these leaps and dives of\nours filled them with terror.\n\nAs I rose to my feet, a gory mess, Wilma, with a poise and speed which I\nfound time to admire even in this crisis, again leaped. This time she\ndove head first as I had done and, with a beautifully executed thrust,\nran the last Han through the throat.\n\nUncertainly, she scrambled to her feet, staggered queerly, and then sank\ngently prone on the corridor. She had fainted.\n\nAt this juncture, Blash and Gaunt reported with elation that they had\nthe record we wanted.\n\n\"Back to the roof, everybody!\" I ordered, as I picked Wilma up in my\narms. With her inertron belt, she felt as light as a feather.\n\nGaunt joined me at once from the military office, and at the\nintersection of the corridor, we came upon Blash waiting for us. Barker,\nhowever, was not in evidence.\n\n\"Where are you, Barker?\" I called.\n\n\"Go ahead,\" he replied. \"I'll be with you on the roof at once.\"\n\nWe came out in the open without any further mishap, and I instructed\nGibbons in the ship to light the knob on the end of the ultron wire. It\nflashed dully a few feet away from us. Just how he had maneuvered the\nship to keep our end of the line in position, without its swinging in a\ntremendous arc, I have never been able to understand. Had not the night\nbeen an unusually still one, he could not have checked the initial\npendulum-like movements. As it was, there was considerable air current\nat certain of the levels, and in different directions too. But Gibbons\nwas an expert of rare ability and sensitivity in the handling of a\nrocket ship, and he managed, with the aid of his delicate instruments,\nto sense the drifts almost before they affected the fine ultron wire,\nand to neutralize them with little shifts in the position of the ship.\n\nBlash and Gaunt fastened their rings to the wire, and I hooked my own\nand Wilma's on, too. But on looking around, I found Barker was still\nmissing.\n\n\"Barker, come!\" I called. \"We're waiting.\"\n\n\"Coming!\" he replied, and indeed, at that instant, his figure appeared\nup the ramp. He chuckled as he fastened his ring to the wire, and said\nsomething about a little surprise he had left for the Hans.\n\n\"Don't reel in the wire more than a few hundred feet,\" I instructed\nGibbons. \"It will take too long to wind it in. We'll float up, and when\nwe're aboard, we can drop it.\"\n\nIn order to float up, we had to dispense with a pound or two of weight\napiece. We hurled our swords from us, and kicked off our shoes as\nGibbons reeled up the line a bit, and then letting go of the wire, began\nto hum upward on our rings with increasing velocity.\n\nThe rush of air brought Wilma to, and I hastily explained to her that we\nhad been successful. Receding far below us now, I could see our dully\nshining knob swinging to and fro in an ever widening arc, as it crossed\nand recrossed the black square of the tower roof. As an extra\nprecaution, I ordered Gibbons to shut off the light, and to show one\nfrom the belly of the ship, for so great was our speed now, that I began\nto fear we would have difficulty in checking ourselves. We were\nliterally falling upward, and with terrific acceleration.\n\nFortunately, we had several minutes in which to solve this difficulty,\nwhich none of us, strangely enough, had foreseen. It was Gibbons who\nfound the answer.\n\n\"You'll be all right if all of you grab the wire tight when I give the\nword,\" he said. \"First I'll start reeling it in at full speed. You won't\nget much of a jar, and then I'll decrease its speed again gradually, and\nits weight will hold you back. Are you ready? One--two--three!\"\n\nWe all grabbed tightly with our gloved hands as he gave the word. We\nmust have been rising a good bit faster than he figured, however, for it\nwrenched our arms considerably, and the maneuver set up a sickening\npendulum motion.\n\nFor a while all we could do was swing there in an arc that may have been\na quarter of a mile across, about three and a half miles above the city,\nand still more than a mile from our ship.\n\nGibbons skilfully took up the slack as our momentum pulled up the line.\nThen at last we had ourselves under control again, and continued our\nupward journey, checking our speed somewhat with our gloves.\n\nThere was not one of us who did not breathe a big sigh of relief when we\nscrambled through the hatch safely into the ship again, cast off the\nultron line and slammed the trap shut.\n\nLittle realizing that we had a still more terrible experience to go\nthrough, we discussed the information Blash and Gaunt had between them\nextracted from the Han records, and the advisability of ultrophoning\nHart at once.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nThe Walls of Hell\n\n\nThe traitors were, it seemed, a degenerate gang of Americans, located a\nfew miles north of Nu-yok on the wooded banks of the Hudson, the\nSinsings. They had exchanged scraps of information to the Hans in return\nfor several old repellor-ray machines, and the privilege of tuning in on\nthe Han electronic power broadcast for their operation, provided their\nships agreed to subject themselves to the orders of the Han traffic\noffice, while aloft.\n\nThe rest wanted to ultrophone their news at once, since there was always\ndanger that we might never get back to the gang with it.\n\nI objected, however. The Sinsings would be likely to pick up our\nmessage. Even if we used the directional projector, they might have\nscouts out to the west and south in the big inter-gang stretches of\ncountry. They would flee to Nu-yok and escape the punishment they\nmerited. It seemed to be vitally important that they should not, for the\nsake of example to other weak groups among the American gangs, as well\nas to prevent a crisis in which they might clear more vital information\nto the enemy.\n\n\"Out to sea again,\" I ordered Gibbons. \"They'll be less likely to look\nfor us in that direction.\"\n\n\"Easy, Boss, easy,\" he replied. \"Wait until we get up a mile or two\nmore. They must have discovered evidences of our raid by now, and their\ndis-ray wall may go in operation any moment.\"\n\nEven as he spoke, the ship lurched downward and to one side.\n\n\"There it is!\" he shouted. \"Hang on, everybody. We're going to nose\nstraight up!\" And he flipped the rocket-motor control wide open.\n\nLooking through one of the rear ports, I could see a nebulous, luminous\nring, and on all sides the atmosphere took on a faint iridescence.\n\nWe were almost over the destructive range of the disintegrator-ray wall,\na hollow cylinder of annihilation shooting upward from a solid ring of\ngenerators surrounding the city. It was the main defense system of the\nHans, which had never been used except in periodic tests. They may or\nmay not have suspected that an American rocket ship was within the\ncylinder; probably they had turned on their generators more as a\nprecaution to prevent any reaching a position above the city.\n\nBut even at our present great height, we were in great danger. It was a\nquestion how much we might have been harmed by the rays themselves, for\ntheir effective range was not much more than seven or eight miles. The\ngreater danger lay in the terrific downward rush of air within the\ncylinder to replace that which was being burned into nothingness by the\ncontinual play of the disintegrators. The air fell into the cylinder\nwith the force of a gale. It would be rushing toward the wall from the\noutside with terrific force also, but, naturally, the effect was\nintensified on the interior.\n\nOur ship vibrated and trembled. We had only one chance of escape--to\nfight our way well above the current. To drift down with it meant\nultimately, and inevitably, to be sucked into the destruction wall at\nsome lower level.\n\nBut very gradually and jerkily our upward movement, as shown on the\nindicators, began to increase, and after an hour of desperate struggle\nwe were free of the maelstrom and into the rarefied upper levels. The\nterror beneath us was now invisible through several layers of cloud\nformations.\n\nGibbons brought the ship back to an even keel, and drove her eastward\ninto one of the most brilliantly gorgeous sunrises I have ever seen.\n\nWe described a great circle to the south and west, in a long easy dive,\nfor he had cut out his rocket motors to save them as much as possible.\nWe had drawn terrifically on their fuel reserves in our battle with the\nelements. For the moment, the atmosphere below cleared, and we could see\nthe Jersey coast far beneath, like a great map.\n\n\"We're not through yet,\" remarked Gibbons suddenly, pointing at his\nperiscope, and adjusting it to telescopic focus. \"A Han ship, and a\n'drop ship' at that--and he's seen us. If he whips that beam of his on\nus, we're done.\"\n\nI gazed, fascinated, at the viewplate. What I saw was a cigar-shaped\nship not dissimilar to our own in design, and from the proportional size\nof its ports, of about the same size as our swoopers. We learned later\nthat they carried crews, for the most part of not more than three or\nfour men. They had streamline hulls and tails that embodied\nuniversal-jointed double fish-tail rudders. In operation they rose to\ngreat heights on their powerful repellor rays, then gathered speed\neither by a straight nose dive, or an inclined dive in which they\nsometimes used the repellor ray slanted at a sharp angle. He was already\nabove us, though several miles to the north. He could, of course, try to\nget on our tail and \"spear\" us with his beam as he dropped at us from a\ngreat height.\n\nSuddenly his beam blazed forth in a blinding flash, whipping downward\nslowly to our right. He went through a peculiar corkscrew-like\nevolution, evidently maneuvering to bring his beam to bear on us with a\nspiral motion.\n\nGibbons instantly sent our ship into a series of evolutions that must\nhave looked like those of a frightened hen. Alternately, he used the\nforward and the reverse rocket blasts, and in varying degree. We\nfluttered, we shot suddenly to right and left, and dropped like a\nplummet in uncertain movements. But all the time the Han scout dropped\ntoward us, determinedly whipping the air around us with his beam. Once\nit sliced across beneath us, not more than a hundred feet, and we\ndropped with a jar into the pocket formed by the destruction of the air.\n\nHe had dropped to within a mile of us, and was coming with the speed of\na projectile, when the end came. Gibbons always swore it was sheer luck.\nMaybe it was, but I like pilots who are lucky that way.\n\nIn the midst of a dizzy, fluttering maneuver of our own, with the Han\nship enlarging to our gaze with terrifying rapidity, and its beam slowly\nslicing toward us in what looked like certain destruction within the\nsecond, I saw Gibbons' fingers flick at the lever of his rocket gun and\na split second later the Han ship flew apart like a clay pigeon.\n\nWe staggered, and fluttered crazily for several moments while Gibbons\nstruggled to bring our ship into balance, and a section of about four\nsquare feet in the side of the ship near the stern slowly crumbled like\nrusted metal. His beam actually had touched us, but our explosive rocket\nhad got him a thousandth of a second sooner.\n\nPart of our rudder had been annihilated, and our motor damaged. But we\nwere able to swoop gently back across Jersey, fortunately crossing the\nship lanes without sighting any more Han craft, and finally settling to\nrest in the little glade beneath the trees, near Hart's camp.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nThe New Boss\n\n\nWe had ultrophoned our arrival and the Big Boss himself, surrounded by\nthe Council, was on hand to welcome us and learn our news. In turn we\nwere informed that during the night a band of raiding Bad Bloods,\ndisguised under the insignia of the Altoonas, a gang some distance to\nthe west of us, had destroyed several of our camps before our people had\nrallied and driven them off. Their purpose, evidently, had been to\nembroil us with the Altoonas, but fortunately, one of our exchanges\nrecognized the Bad Blood leader, who had been slain.\n\nThe Big Boss had mobilized the full raiding force of the Gang, and was\non the point of heading an expedition for the extermination of the Bad\nBloods.\n\nI looked around the grim circle of the sub-bosses, and realized the fate\nof America, at this moment, lay in their hands. Their temper demanded\nthe immediate expenditure of our full effort in revenging ourselves for\nthis raid. But the strategic exigencies, to my mind, quite clearly\ndemanded the instant and absolute extermination of the Sinsings. It\nmight be only a matter of hours, for all we knew, before these degraded\npeople would barter clues to the American ultronic secrets to the Hans.\n\n\"How large a force have we?\" I asked Hart.\n\n\"Every man and maid who can be spared,\" he replied. \"That gives us seven\nhundred married and unmarried men, and three hundred girls, more than\nthe entire Bad Blood Gang. Every one is equipped with belts,\nultrophones, rocket guns and swords, and all fighting mad.\"\n\nI meditated how I might put the matter to these determined men, and was\nvaguely conscious that they were awaiting my words.\n\nFinally I began to speak. I do not remember to this day just what I\nsaid. I talked calmly, with due regard for their passion, but with deep\nconviction. I went over the information we had collected, point by\npoint, building my case logically, and painting a lurid picture of the\ndanger impending in that half-alliance between the Sinsings and the Hans\nof Nu-yok. I became impassioned, culminating, I believe, with a vow to\nproceed single-handed against the hereditary enemies of our race, \"if\nthe Wyomings were blindly set on placing a gang feud ahead of honor and\nduty and the hopes of all America.\"\n\nAs I concluded, a great calm came over me, as of one detached. I had\nfelt much the same way during several crises in the First World War. I\ngazed from face to face, striving to read their expressions, and in a\nmood to make good my threat without any further heroics, if the decision\nwas against me.\n\nBut it was Hart who sensed the temper of the Council more quickly than I\ndid, and looked beyond it into the future.\n\nHe arose from the tree trunk on which he had been sitting.\n\n\"That settles it,\" he said, looking around the ring. \"I have felt this\nthing coming on for some time now. I'm sure the Council agrees with me\nthat there is among us a man more capable than I, to boss the Wyoming\nGang, despite his handicap of having had all too short a time in which\nto familiarize himself with our modern ways and facilities. Whatever I\ncan do to support his effective leadership, at any cost, I pledge myself\nto do.\"\n\nAs he concluded, he advanced to where I stood, and taking from his head\nthe green-crested helmet that constituted his badge of office, to my\nsurprise he placed it in my mechanically extended hand.\n\nThe roar of approval that went up from the Council members left me\ndazed. Somebody ultrophoned the news to the rest of the Gang, and even\nthough the earflaps of my helmet were turned up, I could hear the cheers\nwith which my invisible followers greeted me, from near and distant\nhillsides, camps and plants.\n\nMy first move was to make sure that the Phone Boss, in communicating\nthis news to the members of the Gang, had not re-broadcast my talk nor\nmentioned my plan of shifting the attack from the Bad Bloods to the\nSinsings. I was relieved by his assurance that he had not, for it would\nhave wrecked the whole plan. Everything depended upon our ability to\nsurprise the Sinsings.\n\nSo I pledged the Council and my companions to secrecy, and allowed it to\nbe believed that we were about to take to the air and the trees against\nthe Bad Bloods.\n\nThat outfit must have been badly scared, the way they were \"burning\" the\nether with ultrophone alibis and propaganda for the benefit of the more\ndistant gangs. It was their old game, and the only method by which they\nhad avoided extermination long ago from their immediate neighbors--these\nappeals to the spirit of American brotherhood, addressed to gangs too\nfar away to have had the sort of experience with them that had fallen to\nour lot.\n\nI chuckled. Here was another good reason for the shift in my plans. Were\nwe actually to undertake the exterminations of the Bad Bloods at once,\nit would have been a hard job to convince some of the gangs that we had\nnot been precipitate and unjustified. Jealousies and prejudices existed.\nThere were gangs which would give the benefit of the doubt to the Bad\nBloods, rather than to ourselves, and the issue was now hopelessly\nbeclouded with the clever lies that were being broadcast in an unceasing\nstream.\n\nBut the extermination of the Sinsings would be another thing. In the\nfirst place, there would be no warning of our action until it was all\nover, I hoped. In the second place, we would have indisputable proof, in\nthe form of their rep-ray ships and other paraphernalia, of their\ntraffic with the Hans; and the state of American prejudice, at the time\nof which I write held trafficking with the Hans a far more heinous thing\nthan even a vicious gang feud.\n\nI called an executive session of the Council at once. I wanted to\ninventory our military resources.\n\nI created a new office on the spot, that of \"Control Boss,\" and\nappointed Ned Garlin to the post, turning over his former responsibility\nas Plants Boss to his assistant. I needed someone, I felt, to tie in the\nrecords of the various functional activities of the campaign, and take\nover from me the task of keeping the records of them up to the minute.\n\nI received reports from the bosses of the ultrophone unit, and those of\nfood, transportation, fighting gear, chemistry, electronic activity and\nelectrophone intelligence, ultroscopes, air patrol and contact guard.\n\nMy ideas for the campaign, of course, were somewhat tinged with my 20th\nCentury experience, and I found myself faced with the task of working\nout a staff organization that was a composite of the best and most\neasily applied principles of business and military efficiency, as I knew\nthem from the viewpoint of immediate practicality.\n\nWhat I wanted was an organization that would be specialized,\nfunctionally, not as that indicated above, but from the angles of:\nintelligence as to the Sinsings' activities; intelligence as to Han\nactivities; perfection of communication with my own units; co-operation\nof field command; and perfect mobilization of emergency supplies and\nresources.\n\nIt took several hours of hard work with the Council to map out the plan.\nFirst we assigned functional experts and equipment to each \"Division\" in\naccordance with its needs. Then these in turn were reassigned by the new\nDivision Bosses to the Field Commands as needed, or as Independent or\nHeadquarters Units. The two intelligence divisions were named the White\nand the Yellow, indicating that one specialized on the American enemy\nand the other on the Mongolians.\n\nThe division in charge of our own communications, the assignment of\nultrophone frequencies and strengths, and the maintenance of operators\nand equipment, I called \"Communications.\"\n\nI named Bill Hearn to the post of Field Boss, in charge of the main or\nundetached fighting units, and to the Resources Division, I assigned all\nresponsibility for what few aircraft we had; and all transportation and\nsupply problems, I assigned to \"Resources.\" The functional bosses stayed\nwith this division.\n\nWe finally completed our organization with the assignment of liaison\nrepresentatives among the various divisions as needed.\n\nThus I had a \"Headquarters Staff\" composed of the Division Bosses who\nreported directly to Ned Garlin as Control Boss, or to Wilma as my\npersonal assistant. And each of the Division Bosses had a small staff of\nhis own.\n\nIn the final summing up of our personnel and resources, I found we had\nroughly a thousand \"troops,\" of whom some three hundred and fifty were,\nin what I called the Service Divisions, the rest being in Bill Hearn's\nField Division. This latter number, however, was cut down somewhat by\nthe assignment of numerous small units to detached service. Altogether,\nthe actual available fighting force, I figured, would number about five\nhundred, by the time we actually went into action.\n\nWe had only six small swoopers, but I had an ingenious plan in my mind,\nas the result of our little raid on Nu-yok, that would make this\nsufficient, since the reserves of inertron blocks were larger than I\nexpected to find them. The Resources Division, by packing its supply\ncases a bit tight, or by slipping in extra blocks of inertron, was able\nto reduce each to a weight of a few ounces. These easily could be\nfloated and towed by the swoopers in any quantity. Hitched to ultron\nlines, it would be a virtual impossibility for them to break loose.\n\nThe entire personnel, of course, was supplied with jumpers, and if each\nman and girl was careful to adjust balances properly, the entire number\ncould also be towed along through the air, grasping wires of ultron,\nswinging below the swoopers, or stringing out behind them.\n\nThere would be nothing tiring about this, because the strain would be no\ngreater than that of carrying a one or two pound weight in the hand,\nexcept for air friction at high speeds. But to make doubly sure that we\nshould lose none of our personnel, I gave strict orders that the belts\nand tow lines should be equipped with rings and hooks.\n\nSo great was the efficiency of the fundamental organization and\ndiscipline of the Gang, that we got under way at nightfall.\n\nOne by one the swoopers eased into the air, each followed by its long\ntrain or \"kite-tail\" of humanity and supply cases hanging lightly from\nits tow line. For convenience, the tow lines were made of an alloy of\nultron which, unlike the metal itself, is visible.\n\nAt first these \"tails\" hung downward, but as the ships swung into\nformation and headed eastward toward the Bad Blood territory, gathering\nspeed, they began to string out behind. And swinging low from each ship\non heavily weighted lines, ultroscope, ultrophone, and straight-vision\nobservers keenly scanned the countryside, while intelligence men in the\nswoopers above bent over their instrument boards and viewplates.\n\nLeaving Control Boss Ned Garlin temporarily in charge of affairs, Wilma\nand I dropped a weighted line from our ship, and slid down about half\nway to the under lookouts, that is to say, about a thousand feet. The\nsensation of floating swiftly through the air like this, in the absolute\nsecurity of one's confidence in the inertron belt, was one of\nnever-ending delight to me.\n\nWe reascended into the swooper as the expedition approached the\nterritory of the Bad Bloods, and directed the preparations for the\nbombardment. It was part of my plan to appear to carry out the attack as\noriginally planned.\n\nAbout fifteen miles from their camps our ships came to a halt and\nmaintained their positions for a while with the idling blasts of their\nrocket motors, to give the ultroscope operators a chance to make a\nthorough examination of the territory below us, for it was very\nimportant that this next step in our program should be carried out with\nall secrecy.\n\nAt length they reported the ground below us entirely clear of any\nappearance of human occupation, and a gun unit of long-range specialists\nwas lowered with a dozen rocket guns, equipped with special automatic\ndevices that the Resources Division had developed at my request, a few\nhours before our departure. These were aiming and timing devices. After\ncalculating the range, elevation and rocket charges carefully, the guns\nwere left, concealed in a ravine, and the men were hauled up into the\nship again. At the predetermined hour, those unmanned rocket guns would\nbegin automatically to bombard the Bad Bloods' hillsides, shifting their\naim and elevation slightly with each shot, as did many of our artillery\npieces in the First World War.\n\nIn the meantime, we turned south about twenty miles, and grounded,\nwaiting for the bombardment to begin before we attempted to sneak across\nthe Han ship lane. I was relying for security on the distraction that\nthe bombardment might furnish the Han observers.\n\nIt was tense work waiting, but the affair went through as planned, our\nsquadron drifting across the route high enough to enable the ships'\ntails of troops and supply cases to clear the ground.\n\nIn crossing the second ship route, out along the Beaches of Jersey, we\nwere not so successful in escaping observation. A Han ship came speeding\nalong at a very low elevation. We caught it on our electronic location\nand direction finders, and also located it with our ultroscopes, but it\ncame so fast and so low that I thought it best to remain where we had\ngrounded the second time, and lie quiet, rather than get under way and\ncross in front of it.\n\nThe point was this. While the Hans had no such devices as our\nultroscopes, with which we could see in the dark (within certain\nlimitations of course), and their electronic instruments would be\nvirtually useless in uncovering our presence, since all but natural\nelectronic activities were carefully eliminated from our apparatus,\nexcept electrophone receivers (which are not easily spotted), the Hans\ndid have some very highly sensitive sound devices which operated with\ngreat efficiency in calm weather, so far as sounds emanating from the\nair were concerned. But the \"ground roar\" greatly confused their use of\nthese instruments in the location of specific sounds floating up from\nthe surface of the earth.\n\nThis ship must have caught some slight noise of ours, however, in its\nsensitive instruments, for we heard its electronic devices go into play,\nand picked up the routine report of the noise to its Base Ship\nCommander. But from the nature of the conversation, I judged they had\nnot identified it, and were, in fact, more curious about the detonations\nthey were picking up now from the Bad Blood lands some sixty miles or so\nto the west.\n\nImmediately after this ship had shot by, we took the air again, and\nfollowing much the same route that I had taken the previous night,\nclimbed in a long semi-circle out over the ocean, swung toward the north\nand finally the west. We set our course, however, for the Sinsings' land\nnorth of Nu-yok, instead of for the city itself.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nThe Finger of Doom\n\n\nAs we crossed the Hudson River, a few miles north of the city, we\ndropped several units of the Yellow Intelligence Division, with full\ninstrumental equipment. Their apparatus cases were nicely balanced at\nonly a few ounces weight each, and the men used their chute capes to\nease their drops.\n\nWe recrossed the river a little distance above and began dropping White\nIntelligence units and a few long and short range gun units. Then we\nheld our position until we began to get reports. Gradually we ringed the\nterritory of the Sinsings, our observation units working busily and\npatiently at their locators and scopes, both aloft and aground, until\nGarlin finally turned to me with the remark:\n\n\"The map circle is complete now, Boss. We've got clear locations all the\nway around them.\"\n\n\"Let me see it,\" I replied, and studied the illuminated viewplate map,\nwith its little overlapping circles of light that indicated spots proved\nclear of the enemy by ultroscopic observation.\n\nI nodded to Bill Hearn. \"Go ahead now, Hearn,\" I said, \"and place your\nbarrage men.\"\n\nHe spoke into his ultrophone, and three of the ships began to glide in a\nwide ring around the enemy territory. Every few seconds, at the word\nfrom his Unit Boss, a gunner would drop off the wire, and slipping the\nclasp of his chute cape, drift down into the darkness below.\n\nBill formed two lines, parallel to and facing the river, and enclosing\nthe entire territory of the enemy between them. Above and below,\nstraddling the river, were two defensive lines. These latter were merely\nto hold their positions. The others were to close in toward each other,\npushing a high-explosive barrage five miles ahead of them. When the two\nbarrages met, both lines were to switch to short-vision-range barrage\nand continue to close in on any of the enemy who might have drifted\nthrough the previous curtain of fire.\n\nIn the meantime Bill kept his reserves, a picked corps of a hundred men\n(the same that had accompanied Hart and myself in our fight with the Han\nsquadron) in the air, divided about equally among the \"kite-tails\" of\nfour ships.\n\nA final roll call, by units, companies, divisions and functions,\nestablished the fact that all our forces were in position. No Han\nactivity was reported, and no Han broadcasts indicated any suspicion of\nour expedition. Nor was there any indication that the Sinsings had any\nknowledge of the fate in store for them. The idling of rep-ray\ngenerators was reported from the center of their camp, obviously those\nof the ships the Hans had given them--the price of their treason to\ntheir race.\n\nAgain I gave the word, and Hearn passed on the order to his\nsubordinates.\n\nFar below us, and several miles to the right and left, the two barrage\nlines made their appearance. From the great height to which we had\nrisen, they appeared like lines of brilliant, winking lights, and the\ndetonations were muffled by the distances into a sort of rumbling,\ndistant thunder. Hearn and his assistants were very busy: measuring,\ncalculating, and snapping out ultrophone orders to unit commanders that\nresulted in the straightening of lines and the closing of gaps in the\nbarrage.\n\nThe White Division Boss reported the utmost confusion in the Sinsing\norganization. They were, as might be expected, an inefficient, loosely\ndisciplined gang, and repeated broadcasts for help to neighboring gangs.\nIgnoring the fact that the Mongolians had not used explosives for many\ngenerations, they nevertheless jumped at the conclusion that they were\nbeing raided by the Hans. Their frantic broadcasts persisted in this\nthought, despite the nervous electrophonic inquiries of the Hans\nthemselves, to whom the sound of the battle was evidently audible, and\nwho were trying to locate the trouble.\n\nAt this point, the swooper I had sent south toward the city went into\naction as a diversion, to keep the Hans at home. Its \"kite-tail\" loaded\nwith long-range gunners, using the most highly explosive rockets we had,\nhung invisible in the darkness of the sky and bombarded the city from a\ndistance of about five miles. With an entire city to shoot at, and the\nobject of creating as much commotion therein as possible, regardless of\nactual damage, the gunners had no difficulty in hitting the mark. I\ncould see the glow of the city and the stabbing flashes of exploding\nrockets. In the end, the Hans, uncertain as to what was going on, fell\nback on a defensive policy, and shot their \"hell cylinder,\" or wall of\nupturned disintegrator rays into operation. That, of course, ended our\nbombardment of them. The rays were a perfect defense, disintegrating our\nrockets as they were reached.\n\nIf they had not sent out ships before turning on the rays, and if they\nhad none within sufficient radius already in the air, all would be well.\n\nI queried Garlin on this, but he assured me Yellow Intelligence reported\nno indications of Han ships nearer than 800 miles. This would probably\ngive us a free hand for a while, since most of their instruments\nrecorded only imperfectly or not at all, through the death wall.\n\nRequisitioning one of the viewplates of the headquarters ship, and the\nservices of an expert operator, I instructed him to focus on our lines\nbelow. I wanted a close-up of the men in action.\n\nHe began to manipulate his controls and chaotic shadows moved rapidly\nacross the plate, fading in and out of focus, until he reached an\nadjustment that gave me a picture of the forest floor, apparently 100\nfeet wide, with the intervening branches and foliage of the trees\nappearing like shadows that melted into reality a few feet above the\nground.\n\nI watched one man setting up his long-gun with skillful speed. His lips\npursed slightly as though he were whistling, as he adjusted the tall\ntripod on which the long tube was balanced. Swiftly he twirled the knobs\ncontrolling the aim and elevation of his piece. Then, lifting a belt of\nammunition from the big box, which itself looked heavy enough to break\ndown the spindly tripod, he inserted the end of it in the lock of his\ntube and touched the proper combination of buttons.\n\nThen he stepped aside, and occupied himself with peering carefully\nthrough the trees ahead. Not even a tremor shook the tube, but I knew\nthat at intervals of something less than a second, it was discharging\nsmall projectiles which, traveling under their own continuously reduced\npower, were arching into the air, to fall precisely five miles ahead and\nexplode with the force of eight-inch shells, such as we used in the\nFirst World War.\n\nAnother gunner, fifty feet to the right of him, waved a hand and called\nout something to him. Then, picking up his own tube and tripod, he\ngauged the distance between the trees ahead of him, and the height of\ntheir lowest branches, and bending forward a bit, flexed his muscles and\nleaped lightly, some twenty-five feet. Another leap took him another\ntwenty feet or so, where he began to set up his piece.\n\nI ordered my observer then to switch to the barrage itself. He got a\nclose focus on it, but this showed little except a continuous series of\nblinding flashes, which, from the viewplate, lit up the entire interior\nof the ship. An eight-hundred-foot focus proved better. I had thought\nthat some of our French and American artillery of the 20th Century had\nachieved the ultimate in mathematical precision of fire, but I had never\nseen anything to equal the accuracy of that line of terrific explosions\nas it moved steadily forward, mowing down trees as a scythe cuts grass\n(or used to 500 years ago), literally churning up the earth and the\nsplintered, blasted remains of the forest giants, to a depth of from ten\nto twenty feet.\n\nBy now the two curtains of fire were nearing each other, lines of\nvibrant, shimmering, continuous, brilliant destruction, inevitably\nsqueezing the panic-stricken Sinsings between them.\n\nEven as I watched, a group of them, who had been making a futile effort\nto get their three rep-ray machines into the air, abandoned their\nefforts, and rushed forth into the milling mob.\n\nI queried the Control Boss sharply on the futility of this attempt of\ntheirs, and learned that the Hans, apparently in doubt as to what was\ngoing on, had continued to \"play safe,\" and broken off their power\nbroadcast, after ordering all their own ships east of the Alleghenies to\nthe ground, for fear these ships they had traded to the Sinsings might\nbe used against them.\n\nAgain I turned to my viewplate, which was still focussed on the central\nsection of the Sinsing works. The confusion of the traitors was entirely\nthat of fear, for our barrage had not yet reached them.\n\nSome of them set up their long-guns and fired at random over the barrage\nline, then gave it up. They realized that they had no target to shoot\nat, no way of knowing whether our gunners were a few hundred feet or\nseveral miles beyond it.\n\nTheir ultrophone men, of whom they did not have many, stood around in\ntense attitudes, their helmet phones strapped around their ears,\nnervously fingering the tuning controls at their belts. Unquestionably\nthey must have located some of our frequencies, and overheard many of\nour reports and orders. But they were confused and disorganized. If they\nhad an Ultrophone Boss they evidently were not reporting to him in an\norganized way.\n\nThey were beginning to draw back now before our advancing fire. With\nintermittent desperation, they began to shoot over our barrage again,\nand the explosions of their rockets flashed at widely scattered points\nbeyond. A few took distance \"pot shots.\"\n\nOddly enough it was our own forces that suffered the first casualties in\nthe battle. Some of these distance shots by chance registered hits,\nwhile our men were under strict orders not to exceed their barrage\ndistances.\n\nSeen upon the ultroscope viewplate, the battle looked as though it were\nbeing fought in daylight, perhaps on a cloudy day, while the explosions\nof the rockets appeared as flashes of extra brilliance.\n\nThe two barrage lines were not more than five hundred feet apart when\nthe Sinsings resorted to tactics we had not foreseen. We noticed first\nthat they began to lighten themselves by throwing away extra equipment.\nA few of them in their excitement threw away too much, and shot suddenly\ninto the air. Then a scattering few floated up gently, followed by\nincreasing numbers, while still others, preserving a weight balance,\njumped toward the closing barrages and leaped high, hoping to clear\nthem. Some succeeded. We saw others blown about like leaves in a\nwindstorm, to crumple and drift slowly down, or else to fall into the\nbarrage, their belts blown from their bodies.\n\nHowever, it was not part of our plan to allow a single one of them to\nescape and find his way to the Hans. I quickly passed the word to Bill\nHearn to have the alternate men in his line raise their barrages and\nheard him bark out a mathematical formula to the Unit Bosses.\n\nWe backed off our ships as the explosions climbed into the air in\nstagger formation until they reached a height of three miles. I don't\nbelieve any of the Sinsings who tried to float away to freedom\nsucceeded.\n\nBut we did know later, that a few who leaped the barrage got away and\nultimately reached Nu-yok.\n\nIt was those who managed to jump the barrage who gave us the most\ntrouble. With half of our long-guns turned aloft, I foresaw we would not\nhave enough to establish successive ground barrages and so ordered the\nbarrage back two miles, from which positions our \"curtains\" began to\nclose in again, this time, however, gauged to explode, not on contact,\nbut thirty feet in the air. This left little chance for the Sinsings to\nleap either over or under it.\n\nGradually, the two barrages approached each other until they finally\nmet, and in the grey dawn the battle ended.\n\nOur own casualties amounted to forty-seven men in the ground forces,\neighteen of whom had been slain in hand to hand fighting with the few of\nthe enemy who managed to reach our lines, and sixty-two in the crew and\n\"kite-tail\" force of swooper No. 4, which had been located by one of\nthe enemy's ultroscopes and brought down with long-gun fire.\n\nSince nearly every member of the Sinsing Gang had, so far as we knew,\nbeen killed, we considered the raid a great success.\n\nIt had, however, a far greater significance than this. To all of us who\ntook part in the expedition, the effectiveness of our barrage tactics\ndefinitely established a confidence in our ability to overcome the Hans.\n\nAs I pointed out to Wilma:\n\n\"It has been my belief all along, dear, that the American explosive\nrocket is a far more efficient weapon than the disintegrator ray of the\nHans, once we can train all our gangs to use it systematically and in\nco-ordinated fashion. As a weapon in the hands of a single individual,\nshooting at a mark in direct line of vision, the rocket-gun is inferior\nin destructive power to the dis ray, except as its range may be a little\ngreater. The trouble is that to date it has been used only as we used\nour rifles and shot guns in the 20th Century. The possibilities of its\nuse as artillery, in laying barrages that advance along the ground, or\nclimb into the air, are tremendous.\n\n\"The dis ray inevitably reveals its source of emanation. The rocket gun\ndoes not. The dis ray can reach its target only in a straight line. The\nrocket may be made to travel in an arc, over intervening obstacles, to\nan unseen target.\n\n\"Nor must we forget that our ultronists now are promising us a perfect\nshield against the dis ray in inertron.\"\n\n\"I tremble though, Tony dear, when I think of the horrors that are ahead\nof us. The Hans are clever. They will develop defenses against our new\ntactics. And they are sure to mass against us not only the full force of\ntheir power in America, but the united forces of the World Empire. They\nare a cowardly race in one sense, but clever as the very Devils in Hell,\nand inheritors of a calm, ruthless, vicious persistency.\"\n\n\"Nevertheless,\" I prophesied, \"the Finger of Doom points squarely at\nthem today, and unless you and I are killed in the struggle, we shall\nlive to see America blast the Yellow Blight from the face of the Earth.\"\n\n\nTHE END.\n\n\n\n\nTranscriber's Note:\n\n    This etext was produced from _Amazing Stories_ August 1928.\n    Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\n    copyright on this publication was renewed.

Sunday.\n\n<b>  INT. OUISHI HOUSEHOLD  TOMOKOS ROOM - NIGHT\n</b>\n  CLOSEUP on a TELEVISION SET.  Theres a baseball game on, but the sound \n  is turned completely down.  Camera PANS to show two cute high school \n  girls, MASAMI and TOMOKO.  Masami is seated on the floor at a low coffee \n  table, TEXTBOOK in front of her. Tomoko is at her desk.  There are SNACKS \n  all over the room, and its obvious there hasnt been much studying going \n  on. Masami is currently in mid-story, speaking excitedly.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMASAMI\n</b>\t\tThey say that some elementary school \n\t\tkid spent the night with his parents \n\t\tat a bed and breakfast in Izu.  The kid\n\t\twanted to go out and play with everybody, \n\t\tright, but he didnt want to miss the \n\t\tprogram he always used to watch back in \n\t\tTokyo, so he records it on the VCR in \n\t\ttheir room.  But of course the stations \n\t\tin Izu are different from the ones in \n\t\tTokyo.  In Izu, it was just an empty \n\t\tchannel, so he shouldve recorded\n\t\tnothing but static.  But when the kid \n\t\tgets back to his house and watches the \n\t\ttape, all of a sudden this woman comes \n\t\ton the screen and says--\n\n  Masami points so suddenly and dramatically at her friend that Tomoko \n  actually jumps in her seat.\n\n\t\t\t\tMASAMI (contd)\n\t\tOne week from now, you will die.\n\n  Short silence as Masami pauses, relishing the moment.\n\n\t\t\t\tMASAMI (contd)\t\n\t\tOf course the kids completely \n\t\tfreaked, and he stops the video.  \n\t\tJust then the phone rings, and when he \n\t\tpicks it up a voice says--\n\n  Her voice drops voice almost to a whisper.\n\n\t\t\t\tMASAMI (contd)\t\n\t\tYou watched it, didnt you?  That \n\t\tsame time, exactly one week later... \n\t\thes dead!\n\n  Masami laughs loudly, thoroughly enjoying her own performance.  \n  Tomoko, however, is completely silent.  She begins looking more \n  and more distressed, until finally Masami notices.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMASAMI\n</b>\t\tWhat is it, Tomoko?\n\n  Tomoko comes out of her chair and drops onto the floor next to her \n  friend.  Her words are quick, earnest.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTOMOKO\n</b>\t\tWho did you hear that story from?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMASAMI\n</b>\t\tWho?  Its just a rumor.  Everybody \n\t\tknows it.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTOMOKO\n</b>\t\tYouko told you?\t\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMASAMI\t\n</b>\t\tNo, it wasnt Youko...\n\n  Tomoko looks away, worried.  Masami slaps her on the knee, \n  laughing.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMASAMI\n</b>\t\tWhats up with you?\n\n  Tomoko speaks slowly, still looking away.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTOMOKO\n</b>\t\tThe other day, I... I watched this \n\t\tstrange video.\n<b>\t\t\n</b><b>\t\t\t\tMASAMI\n</b>\t\tWhere?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTOMOKO\t\n</b>\t\tWith Youko and them.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMASAMI\t\n</b>\t\t\t(excited) \n\t\tSo thats what Ive been hearing \n\t\tabout you doing some double-date/\n\t\tsleepover thing!  So, you and that \n\t\tguy Iwata, huh? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTOMOKO\t\n</b>\t\tNo, its not like that.  Nothing \n\t\thappened!\n\n  Their eyes meet and Tomoko half-blushes, looks away again.  Her \n  expression becomes serious as she resumes her conversation.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTOMOKO\n</b>\t\tIwata... he found this weird video.  \n\t\tEveryone was like, Whats that? so \n\t\the put it on and we all watched it.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMASAMI\n</b>\t\t\t(quietly) \n\t\tAnd?  What kind of video was it?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTOMOKO\n</b>\t\tJust... weird, I cant really explain \n\t\tit.  Anyway, right after we finished \n\t\twatching it, the phone rang.  Whoever\n\t\tit was didnt say anything, but still...\n\n  Silence.  Masami curls up on herself, thoroughly spooked.  \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMASAMI\t\n</b>\t\tJesus.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTOMOKO\n</b>  \t\tIt's cuz, you know, we'd all heard the \n\t\trumors.\n\nTomoko looks seriously over at her friend.\n\n\t\t\t\tTOMOKO (cont'd)\n\t\tThat was one week ago today.\n\n  There is a long, heavy silence as neither of them says anything.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMASAMI  \t\n</b>\t\tWaaait a minute.  Are you faking me \n\t\tout?\n\n  Tomokos face suddenly breaks into a smile. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTOMOKO\t\n</b>\t\tBusted, huh?\n\n  They both crack up laughing. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMASAMI\n</b>\t\tOh, my... I cant believe you!  \n\n  Masami reaches out, slaps her friend on the knee.\n\n\t\t\t\tMASAMI (contd)\n\t\tYoure terrible!\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTOMOKO\n</b>\t\tGotcha!\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMASAMI\t\n</b>\t\t\t(thinking) \n\t\tBut hang on... you really stayed\n\t\tthe night with Youko and Iwata, \n\t\tright?\n\n  Tomoko nods, uh-huh.  Masami dives forward, pinching her friends \n  cheeks and grinning wildly.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMASAMI\t\n</b>\t\tSo, how far did you and he get?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTOMOKO \t\n</b>\t\tOh... I cant remember.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMASAMI\t\n</b>\t\tYou cant remember, huh?\n\n  Masami laughs, then slaps Tomoko on the knee again as she remembers \n  the trick her friend played on her.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMASAMI\t\n</b>\t\tMan, you had me freaked me out. \n<b>\t\tI--\n</b>\n  Just at that moment, the phone RINGS.  They are both suddenly, \n  instantly serious.  Tomokos eyes go off in one direction and she \n  begins shaking her head, -No-.  Masami looks over her shoulder, \n  following her friends gaze.  \n\n  Tomoko is looking at the CLOCK, which currently reads 9:40.\n\n  The phone continues to ring.  Tomoko is now clutching tightly onto her \n  friend, looking panicked.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMASAMI\n</b>\t\t\t(softly) \n\t\tWas it true?\n\n  Tomoko nods her head, still holding on tightly.  Masami has to \n  forcibly disengage herself in order to stand.  The phone is downstairs, \n  so Masami opens the bedroom DOOR and races down the STAIRS.  Tomoko \n  calls out to her from behind.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTOMOKO\n</b>\t\tMasami!\n\n<b>  INT. OUISHI HOUSEHOLD  STAIRCASE - NIGHT  \n</b>\n  Tomoko and Masami run down the staircase, through the hallway towards \n  the kitchen.  Tomoko cries out again just before they reach the kitchen.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTOMOKO\t\n</b>\t\tMasami!\n\n<b>  INT. OUISHI HOUSEHOLD  KITCHEN - NIGHT  \n</b>\n  Masami has come to a halt before a PHONE mounted on the wall.  She \n  pauses, looking slowly at her friend, then back to the phone.  She \n  takes it tentatively from its cradle, answers it wordlessly.  The \n  tension continues to mount as nothing is said. Masami suddenly breaks \n  into a huge grin.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMASAMI\t\n</b>\t\tIll put her on.\n\n  Still grinning, she hands the phone to Tomoko.  Tomoko snatches it \n  quickly.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTOMOKO\n</b>\t\t\t(softly) \n\t\tYes?\n\n  She is silent for a moment, then smiling widely.  \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTOMOKO\n</b>\t\tOh, man!\n\n  She is so relieved that all the strength seeps out of her and she \n  sinks to the kitchen floor.  Masami, equally relieved, slides down \n  the wall and sits down next to her.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTOMOKO\n</b>\t\t\t(on the phone) \n\t\tYeah, Ive got a friend over now.  \n\t\tYeah.  Yeah, OK.  Bye.\n\n  Tomoko stands to place the phone back in its wall cradle, and then \n  squats back down onto the kitchen floor.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTOMOKO\t\n</b>\t\tThe games gone into overtime, so \n\t\ttheyre gonna be a little late. \n\n  They burst out laughing with relief again, and are soon both \n  clutching their stomachs.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTOMOKO\t\n</b>\t\tJeeezus, my parents...\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMASAMI\t\n</b>\t\tOh man, Im tellin everybody about \n\t\tthis tomorrow!\n\n  Tomoko shakes her head, -Dont you dare-.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMASAMI\t\n</b>\t\tIm gonna use your bathroom.  Dont \n\t\tgo anywhere.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTOMOKO\t\n</b><b>\t\tK.\n</b>\n  Masami walks out of the kitchen. Alone now, Tomoko stands and walks \n  toward the SINK, where she takes a GLASS from the DISH RACK.  She \n  then goes to the FRIDGE and sticks her face in, looking for something \n  to drink.  Suddenly there is the SOUND of people clapping and \n  cheering.  Tomoko, startled, peers her head over the refrigerator \n  door to check for the source of the sound.  \n\n  She begins walking slowly, following the sound to the DINING ROOM \n  adjacent the kitchen. \n\n<b>  INT. OUISHI HOUSEHOLD - DINING ROOM - NIGHT  \n</b>\n  The lights are off, and there is no one in the room.  Tomoko pauses a \n  moment, bathed in the garish LIGHT from the TV, which has been switched\n  on.  Playing is the same baseball game they had on the TV upstairs; the \n  same game that Tomokos parents are currently at.  The VOLUME is up \n  quite high.\n\n  A puzzled look on her face, Tomoko takes the REMOTE from the coffee \n  table and flicks the TV off.  She walks back to the kitchen.\n\n<b>  INT. OUISHI HOUSEHOLD  KITCHEN - NIGHT  \n</b>\n  A bottle of SODA that Tomoko had earlier taken from the fridge is on \n  the kitchen table.  She picks the bottle up, pours herself a drink.  \n  Before she can take a sip, however, the air around her becomes suddenly \n  charged, heavy.  Her body begins to shiver as somewhere out of sight \n  comes a popping, crackling SOUND underscored by a kind of GROANING.  \n  Trembling now, Tomoko spins around to see what she has already felt \n  lurking behind her.  She draws in her breath to scream.\n\n  The screen goes white, and fades into:\n\n<b>  CAMERA POV \n</b>\n  The screen is filled with the visage of a nervous-looking YOUNG GIRL.  \n  She is being interviewed by ASAKAWA, a female reporter seated offscreen.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tASAKAWA (O.S.)\n</b>\t\tThere seems to be a popular rumor \n\t\tgoing around about a cursed \n\t\tvideotape.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tYOUNG GIRL\t\n</b>\t\tUh-huh.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tASAKAWA (O.S.) \n</b>\t\tHave you heard what kind of video \n\t\tit might be?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tYOUNG GIRL\t\n</b>\t\tUh-huh.\n\n  The girl looks directly at the camera, her mouth dropping into an O \n  as shes suddenly overcome by a kind of stage fright.  She continues \n  staring, silently, at the camera.\n\n<b>  INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY  \n</b>\n  KOMIYA, the cameraman, has lowered his camera. We can now see that \n  the young girl being interviewed is seated at a table between two \n  friends, a SHORT-HAIRED GIRL (GIRL#2) and a LONG-HAIRED GIRL (GIRL #3).  \n  They are all dressed in the UNIFORMS of junior high school students.  \n  Opposite them sits Komiya and Asakawa, a pretty woman in her mid-\n  twenties.

Girl #3 nods slowly, opens and closes her \n  mouth as if deciding whether to say something or not.

She begins \n  flipping the pages, and suddenly spies this story:  \n\n<b>    STRANGE AUTOMOBILE DEATH OF YOUNG COUPLE IN YOKOHAMA\n</b>\n    The bodies of a young man and woman were discovered in their \n    passenger car at around 10 A.M. September 6th.  The location was a \n    vacant lot parallel to Yokohama Prefectural Road.  Local authorities \n    identified the deceased as a 19-year old preparatory school student \n    of Tokyo, and a 16-year old Yokohama resident, a student of a \n    private all-girls high school. Because there were no external \n    injuries, police are investigating the possibility of drug-induced \n    suicide...\n\n  Just then two men walk by, a GUY IN A BUSINESS SUIT and a youngish \n  intern named OKAZAKI.  Okazaki is carrying an armload of VIDEOTAPES.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tGUY IN SUIT\n</b>\t\tOK, Okazaki, Im counting on you.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tOKAZAKI\t\n</b>\t\tYessir.\n\n  The guy in the suit pats Okazaki on the shoulder and walks off.  \n\n  Okazaki turns to walk away, spots Asakawa bent over the small table \n  and peering intently at the newspaper article.\n\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tOKAZAKI\t\n</b>\t\tMiss Asakawa?

Okazaki, still carrying the videotapes, leans \n  forward to take a look at the article.\n<b>   \n</b><b>  EXT.

He is wearing a white DRESS SHIRT with \n  a brown sweater-type VEST over it.  He sees Asakawa, his mother, \n  run in the door.  She is panting lightly.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tASAKAWA\n</b>\t\tSorry Im late.  Oh, youve already \n\t\tchanged.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tYOICHI\n</b>\t\tYup. \n\n  He points over to his mothers right.\n\n\t\t\t\tYOICHI (contd)\n\t\tI got your clothes out for you.\n\n  Asakawa turns to see a DARK SUIT hanging from one of the living \n  room shelves.  She reaches out, takes it.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tASAKAWA\n</b>\t\tAargh, weve gotta hurry!\n\n  She runs into the next room to change.\n\n<b>  INT.

OUISHI HOUSEHOLD - NIGHT  \n</b>\n  RED PAPER LANTERNS mark this place as the site of a wake.  Several \n  GIRLS in high school uniforms are standing together and talking in \n  groups. Asakawa and Yoichi, walking hand in hand, enter the house.\n\n<b>  INT. OUISHI HOUSEHOLD - NIGHT \n</b>\n  There are many PEOPLE milling about, speaking softly.  A MAN seated \n  at a counter is taking monetary donations from guests and entering \n  their information into a LEDGER.  Asakawa and Yoichi continue walking, \n  down a hallway.\n\n<b>  INT. OUISHI HOUSEHOLD - NIGHT \n</b>\n  Mother and son halt before the open DOOR to the main wake room, where \n  guests may show their respects to the departed.  The room is laid in \n  traditional Japanese-style tatami, a kind of woven straw mat that \n  serves as a carpet. Two GUESTS, their shoes off, are kneeling upon \n  zabuton cushions.  \n\n  Kneeling opposite the guests is KOUICHI, Asakawas father.  The two \n  guests are bowing deeply, and Kouichi bows in response.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tASAKAWA\t\n</b>\t\tDad.\n\n  Kouichi turns to see her.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKOUICHI\n</b>\t\tAh!\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tASAKAWA\n</b>\t\tHow is sis holding up?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKOUICHI\n</b>\t\tShes resting inside right now.  \n\t\tShes shaken up pretty badly, you \n\t\tknow.

Why dont you sit \n\t\there for a little while?\n\n  He grabs the young boy and seats him on a cushion next to the two guests.  \n  As the guests resume their conversation with Asakawas father, Yoichis \n  eyes wander to the ALTAR at the front of the room set up to honor the \n  deceased.  It is made of wood, and surrounded by candles, flowers, and \n  small paper lanterns.  At the center is a PICTURE of the deceased, a \n  teenage girl.  A small wooden PLAQUE reads her name: Tomoko Ouishi. It \n  is the same Tomoko from the first scene.\n\n  Yoichi continues to stare at Tomokos picture.  He makes a peculiar \n  gesture as he does so, rubbing his index finger in small circles just \n  between his eyes.\n\n<b>  INT. HALLWAY  NIGHT\n</b>\n  Asakawa walks down the hallway, looking for her aunt.  She walks until \n  finding the open doorway to the kitchen.  There are a few people in \n  there, preparing busily. Asakawa sees her AUNT, who rushes into the \n  hallway to meet her, holds her fast by the arm.  The aunt speaks in a \n  fierce, quick whisper.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tAUNT\t\t\n</b>\t\tHave you heard anything more about \n\t\tTomo-chans death?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tASAKAWA\t\n</b>\t\tNo, I...\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tAUNT\t\t\n</b>\t\tBut the police have already finished \n\t\ttheir autopsy!\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tASAKAWA\t\n</b>\t\tWell, they said there was no sign of \n\t\tfoul play.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tAUNT\t\n</b>\t\t\t(shaking her head) \n\t\tThat was no normal death.

He stops at the foot of the \n  steps, looking up-- and catches a glimpse of a pair of BARE FEET \n  running up to the second floor.  \n\n  A guarded expression on his face, Yoichi walks slowly up the \n  stairs.  \n\n<b>  INT. OUISHI HOUSEHOLD - TOMOKOS BEDROOM - NIGHT  \n</b>\n  Yoichi has wandered into Tomokos bedroom.  The lights are all off, \n  and there is an eerie feel to it.  Yoichis eyes wander about the \n  room, finally coming to rest on the TELEVISION SET.  Suddenly, he \n  hears his mothers voice from behind him.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tASAKWAWA (O.S.) \n</b>\t\tYoichi?\n\n  Yoichi turns to face her as she approaches, puts an arm around him.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tASAKAWA\t\n</b>\t\tWhat are you doing up here?

The placard reads \n  that the wake is being held for a student of the Seikei School \n  for Women. \n\n  Asakawa stares at that placard, making the mental connections.  \n  She turns abruptly, walks towards a nearby TRIO of HIGH SCHOOL \n<b>  GIRLS.\n</b>\n<b>\t\t\t\tASAKAWA\t\n</b>\t\tExcuse me.

In the footage there are lots of \n  POLICEMEN milling about, one of them trying to pick the door to \n  the passenger side.  Yoshino is giving Asakawa the blow-by-blow.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tYOSHINO\n</b>\t\tThe bodies of those found were \n\t\tTsuji Youko, age 17, a student of \n\t\tthe Seikei School for Women, and \n\t\tNomi Takehiko, age 19, preparatory \n\t\tschool student.  Both their doors \n\t\twere securely locked.\n\n  Onscreen, the policeman has finally picked the lock.  The door opens, \n  and a girls BODY halffalls out, head facing upwards.  Yoshino flicks \n  a BUTTON on the control panel, scans the footage frame by frame.  He \n  stops when he gets a good close-up of the victim. \n\n  Her face is twisted into an insane rictus of fear, mouth open, eyes \n  wide and glassy. Yoshino and Asakawa lean back in their seats.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tYOSHINO\n</b>\t\tThis is the first time Ive -ever- \n\t\tseen something like this.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tASAKAWA\n</b>\t\tCause of death?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tYOSHINO\n</b>\t\tCouldnt say, aside from sudden \n\t\theart failure.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tASAKAWA\t\n</b>\t\tDrugs?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tYOSHINO\t\n</b>\t\tThe autopsy came up negative.\n\n\n  Yoshino takes the video off pause.

OUISHI HOUSEHOLD - DAY  \n</b>\n  Asakawas CAR is already halted before a modest-sized, two-story HOUSE \n  with a small covered parkway for a garage.  She gets out of her car, \n  closes the door.  She stares at the house, unmoving.\n\n<b>  INT. OUISHI HOUSEHOLD  KITCHEN - DAY  \n</b>\n  Asakawa stands before her SISTER RYOMI, who is seated at the kitchen \n  TABLE.  Ryomi is staring blankly away, making no sign of acknowledging \n  her sister.  The silence continues unabated, and Asakawa, pensive, \n  wanders idly into the adjoining dining room.  She takes a long look at \n  the television, the same television that had puzzled Tomoko by suddenly \n  switching itself on, sitting darkly in one corner.  Her reflection in \n  the screen looks stretched, distorted.\n\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYOMI\t(O.S.) \n</b>\t\tThey tell me that Yoichi came to \n\t\tthe funeral, too. \n\n  Asakawa steps back into the kitchen.

Asakawa waits for her to say more, \n  but when it is clear that nothing else is forthcoming, she quietly gives \n  up and exits the kitchen.\n\n<b>  INT.

OUISHI HOUSEHOLD - TOMOKOS ROOM - DAY  \n</b>\n  As if intruding, Asakawa walks slowly, cautiously into Tomokos room.  \n  The window to the room is open, and a single piece of folded white PAPER \n  on Tomokos desk flutters in the breeze.  Asakawa walks towards it, picks \n  it up.  It is a RECEIPT from a photo shop.  The developed photos have yet \n  to be claimed.  \n\n  Asakawa senses something, spins to look over her shoulder.  Her sister \n  has crept quietly up the stairs and down the hall, and stands now in the \n  doorway to Tomokos room.  She appears not to notice what Asakawa has in \n  her hands, as her gaze has already shifted to the sliding closet door.  \n  She regards it almost druggedly.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYOMI\n</b>\t\t\t(haltingly) \n\t\tThis... this is where Tomoko died.\n\n<b>  FLASHBACK\n</b><b>\t\t\t\tRYOMI (O.S.)\n</b>\t\tTomoko!\n\n  Ryomis hands fling aside the CLOSET DOOR.  Within, she finds the pale \n  blue CARCASS of her daughter, curled up into an unnatural fetal position.  \n  Tomokos mouth yawns gaping, her eyes glassy and rolled up into the back \n  of her head.  Her hands are caught in her hair, as if trying to pull it \n  out by the roots.  It is a horrific scene, one that says Tomoko died as \n  if from some unspeakable fear.\n\n<b>  PRESENT\n</b>\n  Ryomi sinks to her knees, hitting the wooden floor hard.  She puts her \n  face into her hands and begins sobbing loudly.  Asakawa says nothing.\n\n<b>  EXT. CAMERA SHOP  DAY\n</b>\n  Asakawa leaves the camera shop clutching Tomokos unclaimed PHOTOS.  She \n  walks out onto the sidewalk and begins flipping through them.  We see \n  Tomoko standing arm-in-arm with Iwata, her secret boyfriend. Tomoko and \n  her friends eating lunch.  The camera had its date-and-time function \n  enabled, and the photos are marked\n\n<b>    97 8 29.\n</b>\n  The next shot is of Tomoko, Iwata, and another young couple posing in \n  front of a SIGN for a bed and breakfast.  The sign reads:\n\n<b>    IZU PACIFIC LAND\n</b>\n<b>\t\t\t\tASAKAWA\t\n</b>\t\tIzu...\n\n  Asakawa continues looking through the photos, various shots of the \n  four friends clowning around in their room.  Suddenly she comes to a \n  shot taken the next day, at check out.  The friends are lined up, arms \n  linked-- and all four of their faces are blurred, distorted as if \n  someone had taken an eraser to them and tried to rub them out of \n  existence.\n\n<b>  INT.

IZU PACIFIC LAND - DRIVEWAY  DAY\n</b>\n  Asakawa has left her car and is walking around the driveway of what is \n  less a bed and breakfast and more like a series of cabin-style rental \n<b>  COTTAGES. \n</b>\n  She wanders about for a while, trying to get her bearings.  She pauses \n  now in front of a particular cottage and reaches into her PURSE.  She \n  withdraws the PICTURE from the photomat, the one that showed Tomoko and \n  her friends with their faces all blurred.  The four are posing in front \n  of their cottage, marked in the photograph as B4.  Asakawa lowers the \n  photo to regard the cottage before her.\n\n<b>    B4\n</b>\n  She walks to the door, turns the handle experimentally.  Its open.  \n  Asakawa walks in.\n\n<b>  INT. PACIFIC LAND - COTTAGE B4  DAY\n</b>\n  Asakawa lets her eyes wander around the cottage.  It looks very modern, \n  all wood paneling and spacious comfort.  \n\n  Her eyes rest on the TV/VCR setup at the front of the room.  Crouching \n  before the VCR now, she presses the eject button.  Nothing happens.  \n  She fingers the inside of the deck, finds it empty, then reaches behind \n  to the rear of the VCR, searching.  Again, there is nothing.  Asakawa \n  presses the power button on the television, picks up the REMOTE, and \n  takes a seat on the SOFA.  She runs through a few channels but theyre \n  all talk shows, no clues whatsoever.  She flicks the TV off and leans \n  back in the sofa, sighing.\n\n  Just then, she spies a LEDGER on the coffee table.  These things are \n  sometimes left in hotels in Japan, so that guests can write a few \n  comments about their stay for others to read.  Asakawa picks the \n  ledger up, begins thumbing through it.  She stops at a strange PICTURE\n  obviously drawn by a child, that shows three rotund, almost entirely \n  round personages.  She reads the handwritten MESSAGE.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tASAKAWA\t\n</b>\t\t\"My dad is fat.  My mom is fat.  \n\t\tThats why Im fat, too.\"\n\n  She smiles in spite of herself.  \n\n  Asakawa flips through the rest of the ledger, but theres nothing else \n  of any import.  \n\n  She tosses it back onto the coffee table and, sighing again, leans into \n  the sofa and closes her eyes.\n\n<b>  EXT.

They are all in their original boxes, \n  and she lets her eyes glance over the titles.  Raiders of the Lost Ark, \n  48 Hours--\n\n  --and then, suddenly, she spies a VIDEOTAPE in a plain, unmarked \n  sleeve, tucked away in the back of the very bottom shelf.  She feels \n  the hairs on the back of her neck rise.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tASAKAWA\t\n</b>\t\tThat...\n\n  The clerk looks up.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCLERK\n</b>\t\tHmm?\n\n  Asakawa stabs a finger excitedly towards the shelf.\n\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tASAKAWA\n</b>\t\tThat!

Hmm...\n\n  The clerk pulls the tape out of its SLEEVE and checks for a label.  \n  Its unmarked.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCLERK\n</b>\t\tMaybe one of the guests left it behind\n\n<b>  INT. PACIFIC LAND  COTTAGE B4 - NIGHT \n</b>\n  Asakawa flips on the TV.  Its on channel 2, and there is nothing but \n  static. She kneels down to slide the tape into the deck and pauses a \n  moment, framed in the vaguely spectral LIGHT from the television \n  screen.  Steeling her nerves, she puts the tape into the machine, picks \n  up the remote, and presses play.\n\n\n  NOTE: This next scene is entirely visual.  If you are reading this \n  translation before watching the movie, do yourself a favor; STOP \n  reading this now and watch the scene for itself.  Afterwards, you can \n  come back here to check the meaning of the Japanese characters \n  displayed.\n\n\n<b>  THE VIDEOTAPE\n</b>\n  At first it looks like nothing has happened-- then Asakawa realizes that \n  she is now viewing recorded static instead of broadcast static.  She \n  watches, waiting, but the static continues unbroken.  Asakawa looks \n  down at the remote, is about to press fast forward, when suddenly the \n  picture on the screen clears and for a moment she thinks shes looking \n  at the moon.\n\n  Its not the moon at all, she realizes.  The shape is round like a full \n  moon, but it seems to be made up of thin RIBBONS of cloud streaking \n  against a night sky.  And theres a FACE, she sees, a face hidden in \n  shadows, looking down from above.  \n\n  What is this?\n\n  The scene changes now, and Asakawa notes that the tape has that kind of \n  grainy quality one sees in 3rd or 4th generation copies.  The scene is of \n  a WOMAN brushing her long hair before an oval-shaped MIRROR.  The nerve-\n  wracking grating as if of some giant metallic insect sounds in the \n  background, but the lady doesnt seem to notice.  The mirror the lady is \n  using to brush her hair suddenly changes position from the left part of \n  the wall before which she stands, to the right.  Almost instantly the \n  mirror returns to its original position, but in that one moment in its \n  changed location we see a small FIGURE in a white GOWN.  The woman turns \n  towards where that figure stood, and smiles.\n\n  The screen next becomes a twitching, undulating impenetrable sea of the \n  kanji characters used in the Japanese language.  Asakawa can pick out \n  only two things recognizable:\n\n    local     volcanic eruption\n\n  Now the screen is awash in PEOPLE-- crawling, scrabbling, shambling \n  masses, some of them moving in reverse.  A sound like moaning accompanies \n  them.\n<b>  -\n</b>\n  A FIGURE stands upon a shore, its face shrouded.  It points accusingly, \n  not towards the screen, but at something unseen off to one side.  The \n  insect-like screeching sounds louder. \n<b>  --\n</b>\n  Close up on inhuman, alien-looking EYE.  Inside that eye a single \n  character is reflected in reverse:  SADA, meaning \"chastity.\"\n\n  The eye blinks once, twice.  The symbol remains.\n<b>  ---\n</b>\n  A long shot of an outdoor, uncovered WELL.\n<b>  ----\n</b>\n  Sudden loud, blinding STATIC as the tape ends.\n\n  Asakawa turns the TV off, looking physically drained.  She sighs shakily \n  and slumps forward, resting on her knees.  Just then, she glances at the \n  television screen.  She sees, reflected, a small FIGURE in a white gown \n  standing at the rear of the room.  Shocked, Asakawa draws in breath, \n  spins around.\n\n  The room is empty.  Asakawa runs to the sofa to collect her jacket--\n\n  --and the RINGING of the telephone stops her dead in her tracks.  Zombie-\n  like, she walks towards the telephone, picks it up wordlessly.  \n\n  From the other end comes the same metallic, insectoid SQUEAKING heard on \n  the video.  Asakawa slams the phone down and glances up at the CLOCK.  \n  Its about seven minutes after 7 P.M.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tASAKAWA\t\n</b>\t\t\t(to herself) \n\t\tOne week\n\n  Asakawa grabs her coat, pops the tape out of the deck, and runs out the \n  door.\n\n<b>  EXT.

The sidewalk is quite narrow, and Yoichi \n  comes to a halt when a second PERSON comes from the opposite direction, \n  blocking his way. Yoichi slowly raises his umbrella, peers up to look at \n  this other pedestrian.  It is a MAN, a BAG slung over one shoulder.  He \n  has a beard; unusual for Japan where clean-shaven is the norm.  \n\n  The two continue looking directly at each other, neither moving nor \n  speaking.  Yoichi then walks around the persons left and continues on his\n   way.  The man resumes walking as well.\n\n  Caption-- September 14th.  Tuesday.\n\n<b>  EXT. OUTSIDE AN APARTMENT DOOR - DAY  \n</b>\n  The bearded man, whose name is RYUJI, reaches out to press the DOORBELL, \n  but the door has already opened from within.

ASAKAWAS APARTMENT - DAY  \n</b>\n  Ryuji puts his bag down, looks around the apartment.  The interior is dark, \n  ominous somehow.  He takes his JACKET off and wanders into the living room.  \n  Asakawa is in the kitchen behind him, preparing TEA.  Ryuji spies the \n  collection of FRAMED PHOTOGRAPHS in living room.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI\n</b>\t\tYoichis in elementary school \n\t\talready, is he?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tASAKAWA\t\n</b>\t\tHis first year.

She shoves it \n  into Ryujis hands, then turns to look down at the floor.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tASAKAWA\t\n</b>\t\tTake my picture.\n\n  Ryuji raises the camera to his eye.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI\t\t\n</b>\t\tTurn this way.\n\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tASAKAWA\t\n</b>\t\t\t(unmoving) \n\t\tHurry up and take it.\n\n  Ryuji snaps off a shot.  It comes out the other end and he takes it, \n  waits impatiently for an image to appear.  When it does, all he can \n  do is pass it wordlessly over to Asakawa.  Her face is twisted, \n  misshapen.  \n\n  Just like the picture of Tomoko and her friends.\n\n  Asakawa stares at it, horrified.  By the time she finally looks up, \n  Ryuji has already risen from his seat and slid the videotape into the \n  VCR.  Again, the screen is filled with static, only to be replaced \n  with what looks like the moon.  Asakawa slams the Polaroid on the \n  coffee table and goes outside onto the veranda.  \n\n<b>  EXT.

A split-second \n  afterwards, there is a KNOCK on the door and Okazaki enters, holding \n  a FILE.

Hes deep in \n  thought, writing in a NOTEPAD. There are multitudes of PEOPLE about \n  him, and we can hear the sounds of their coming and going.  A PAIR \n  OF LEGS attached to a woman in white dress, hose, and pumps appears, \n  heading directly for Ryuji.  Her pace is slow, rhythmical, and as \n  that pace progresses all other sounds FADE into the background, so \n  that all we can hear is the CLOMP, CLOMP as those legs walk to stand \n  just before Ryuji.  The pumps are scuffed, dirtied with grime.  \n\n  A gust of WIND rips by.  Ryuji fights the urge to look up as in his \n  ears rings the same hollowed, multi-voiced BABBLING heard on the \n  videotape.  The sound grows stronger.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI (VO)\n</b> \t\tSo, it was you.  You did it.\n\n  The babbling fades, disappears as slowly the worlds normal \n  background sounds return.  Ryuji looks up, but the woman in white \n  is nowhere to be seen.\n\n<b>  EXT. OUTSIDE RYUJIS APARTMENT  AFTERNOON\n</b>\n  Ryuji rides up on a BICYCLE.

He squats down on the tatami in \n  frontof his TV and slides the tape in.  Asakawa sits on the \n  tatami as well, but positions herself away from the TV and keeps \n  her eyes averted.  Ryuji glares over his shoulder at her.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI\n</b>\t\t\t(sternly) \n\t\tAsakawa.\n\n  She reluctantly scoots closer, looks up at the screen.  Ryuji \n  fast-forwards the tape a bit, stopping at the scene where the \n  woman is brushing her long hair before an oval mirror.  He puts \n  the video on frame-by-frame. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI\n</b>\t\tHave you ever seen this woman?\n\n  Asakawa regards the screen intently.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tASAKAWA\n</b> \t\tNo...\n\n  The tape advances to the scene where the mirror suddenly changes \n  positions.  When it does, we can again see the small figure in the \n  white gown, a figure with long black hair. When Ryuji sees this \n  his body stiffens, becomes tense.  Asakawa notices but says nothing.  \n  She also notices something else.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tASAKAWA\n</b>\t\t\t(excitedly) \n\t\tTheres something strange about \n\t\tthis shot.\n\n  She takes the remote from Ryuji, rewinds it a ways.

Ryuji turns off the TV, \n  ejects the tape from the deck.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI\t\n</b>\t\tCome on in.\n\n  Asakawa flashes a look at Ryuji and then turns her head back towards \n  the front door to see who has entered.  A cute, nervous-looking young \n  GIRL with short hair approaches slowly.  She is carrying a PLASTIC BAG \n  filled with groceries.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI\t\n</b>\t\tAsakawa, meet my student, Takano Mai.\n\n  He turns, addresses Mai.\n\n\t\t\t\tRYUJI\t(contd)\t\n\t\tThis is Asakawa, my ex-wife.\n\n  Ryuji gets up and walks conveniently away.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMAI\t\t\n</b>\t\tNice to meet you.

They leave.\n\n  Mai pouts unhappily a bit, and then breaks into a smile as an idea \n  crosses her mind.  She walks across the room to where Ryuji has set \n  up a large BLACKBOARD filled with mathematical equations.  Grinning, \n  Mai rubs out part of one equation with her sleeve and writes in a \n  new value.\n\n<b>  INT. NEWS STATION  HALLWAY - NIGHT  \n</b>\n  Asakawa and Ryuji stride purposefully.

Theyre \n\t\tprobably waiting for us to find it.\n\n  Asakawa turns a DIAL to bring up the volume, which up until now has \n  been  on mute.  The room is filled with an eerie, metallic GRATING, \n  and Asakawa spins the dial again, shutting it off.  Just as she does, \n  Ryujis eyes widen.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI\t\n</b>\t\tWait a minute.\n\n  He turns the dial again, punches a few buttons as if searching for \n  something.  He listens carefully, and when he hears that strange \n  something again he stops, looks at the screen.\n\n  It is paused at the scene with the figure, pointing, a CLOTH draped \n  over its head.  The figure now looks oddly like a messenger.\n\n  Ryuji and Asakawa exchange glances.  This could be it.  Ryuji flips \n  some more switches, setting the sound for super-slow mo.  What follows \n  is a strange, labored sort of speech- a hidden message-- framed in \n  the skittering distortion of the tape in slow motion. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTAPE\t\n</b>\t\tShoooomonnn bakkkkkarrri toou...  \n\t\tboooouuuukonn ga kuuru zouuu...\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI\t\n</b>\t\t\t(repeating) \n\t\tShoumon bakkari, boukon ga kuru \n\t\tzo.

She turns around to walk back down the hallway \n  only to find her father standing there, face full of concern.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKOUJI\n</b>\t\tWhats happened?\n\n  Asakawa shakes her head.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tASAKAWA\n</b>\t\tNothing.

KOUJIS HOUSE - GUEST ROOM  NIGHT\n</b>\n  The lights are all off and Asakawa is asleep in her futon.  Her eyes \n  suddenly fly open as a VOICE sounding eerily like her deceased niece \n  Tomoko calls out to her.\n\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTOMOKO (O.S.) \n</b>\t\tAuntie?\n\n  Asakawa looks around the room, gets her bearings.  Her eyes fall on \n  the futon next to hers.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tASAKAWA\n</b>\t\tYoichi?\n\n  There is a BODY in that futon, but it is full-grown, dressed all in \n  black.  It is curled into a fetal position and has its head turned \n  away.\n\n  Suddenly, the IMAGE from the video of the figure with its face \n  shrouded springs to Asakawas mind.  Just an instant, its pointing \n  visage materializes, and then disappears.  It reappears a moment \n  later, pointing more insistently now, and disappears again.  \n\n  Asakawa blinks her eyes and realizes that the futon next to hers is \n  empty.  Yoichi is nowhere to be seen.\n\n  Just then, she hears that high-pitched, metallic SQUEAKING from the \n  video.  Eyes wide with horror, she flings the sliding doors apart--\n  --and there, seated before the television, is Yoichi.\n\n  He is watching the video.\n\n  It is already at the very last scene, the shot of the outdoor well. \n  CLOSEUP on the screen now, and for just an instant we can see that \n  something is trying to claw its way out of the well.  The video cuts \n  off, and the screen fills with static.  \n\n  Shrieking, Asakawa races over to Yoichi, covers his eyes though it is \n  already too late.  She scoots over to the VCR, ejects the tape and \n  stares at it uncomprehendingly.  She is then at Yoichis side again, \n  shaking him roughly.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tASAKAWA\n</b>\t\tYoichi!

There, \n  hanging from one of the walls, is the oval-shaped MIRROR from the \n  video, the one used by the mysterious lady to brush her long hair.  \n  Ryuji stares at the mirror, almost wincing.  He turns around as if \n  to look at Asakawa,but continues turning, looks past her.  Asakawa \n  follows his gaze, as does Kazue.  Standing at the end of the corridor \n  is an old man, MR.

Asakawa \n  sits alone, knees curled up to her chin, eyes wide and frightened.  \n  She is whimpering softly to herself.  Just then, the DOOR slides \n  open and Ryuji walks in.  He sits at the table and picks up a \n  pair of CHOPSTICKS.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI\t\t\n</b>\t\tArent you gonna eat?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tASAKAWA\t\n</b>\t\tUmm...\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI\t\t\n</b>\t\tHm?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tASAKAWA\t\n</b>\t\tYoull stay with me wont you?  \n\t\tWhen its time for me to die.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI\t\t\n</b>\t\tOh, stop it.\n\n  Asakawa scoots across the tatami mats towards the table, grabs \n  Ryuji fiercely by the arm.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tASAKAWA\n</b>\t\tYoull stay, wont you?

Yamamura glances up to see Ryuji approaching.  \n  Ryuji takes a seat next to the old man, but its Yamamura who speaks \n  first.

At their touch Ryujis power awakens, and as \n  he peers into the old mans mind there is a sudden blinding\n\n<b>  FLASH\n</b>\n  The setting is a large MEETING HALL.  A number of people are seated \n  in folding chairs before a STAGE, on which are a four MEN in BUSINESS \n  SUITS and a WOMAN in a KIMONO.  A BANNER hangs above the stage, which \n  reads PUBLIC DEMONSTRATION ON THE EXISTENCE OF CLAIRVOYANCE.  \n\n<b>  FLASH\n</b>\n  Ryuji eyes widen as he realizes he is seeing Shizukos demonstration \n  before the press.  He also realizes--\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI\n</b>\t\t\t(to Yamamura)\n\t\tYou were there!\n\n<b>  FLASH\n</b>\n  YAMAMURA SHIZUKO, the woman in the kimono, is sitting at a TABLE \n  onstage.

Asakawa comes running up toward Ryuji and the \n  prone Mr. Yamamura.  Suddenly there is another\n\n<b>  FLASH\n</b>\n  Asakawa, her eyes wide, finds herself inside the scene, reliving it \n  as if she had actually been there.  She watches as Shizuko receives \n  a sealed clay POT in both hands.  Shizuko regards the pot a moment \n  and then places it gently on the table before her.  She takes a \n  calligraphy STYLUS from the table, begins writing on a thin, \n  rectangular sheet of RICE PAPER.  The members of the press talk \n  excitedly, craning their necks for a better look.\n\n  Onstage, a JUDGE holds up the phrase written by Shizuko and the \n  folded sheet of paper taken from the sealed pot.  The phrase on both \n  sheets is identical.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJUDGE\t\t\n</b>\t\tMatch.\n\n  Cameras begin FLASHING excitedly.  Shizukos features melt into a soft \n  smile. \n\n  The experiment is performed again, and again the phrase written by \n  Shizuko corresponds to the sealed sheet of paper.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJUDGE\n</b>\t\tMatch.\n\n  Again and again, Shizuko unerringly demonstrates her power to see \n  the unseen.  Finally, a bearded REPORTER explodes from his chair, \n  begins striding angrily towards the stage.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tREPORTER\t\n</b>\t\tFaker!

She covers both ears, trying to block out the increasing \n  din.  Professor Ikuma holds her protectively by the shoulders.  The \n  first reporter is still shouting angrily, his voice rising above the \n  others.  Suddenly, a pained look crosses his face and he collapses to \n  the floor.  The crowd, and Asakawa as well, see that the reporters \n  face is contorted into a grotesque mask of fear.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tREPORTER #3\t\n</b>\t\tWhats happened?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tREPORTER #4\t\n</b>\t\tHes dead!\n\n\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tREPORTER #5\t\n</b>\t\t\t(to Shizuko) \n\t\tWitch!\n\n  Professor Ikuma begins leading Shizuko offstage.

He looks up excitedly.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI\t\t\n</b>\t\tSadako?!\n\n  He recalls the image from the video, the alien eye with the single \n  character SADA reflected in reverse. *\n\n\n  >* The majority of girls' names in Japanese end in either -mi (\"beauty\") \n  >or -ko (\"child\").

Sadako, her face completely hidden \n  by her long hair, runs offstage... and heads directly for Asakawa.  \n  Asakawa instinctively raises her arm, and Sadako grasps it fiercely.  \n  All the nails on Sadako hand are stripped away; her fingers are raw, \n  bloody stumps.\n\n  CUT back to the beach.  Asakawa, still caught in the throes of the \n  vision, has begun to swoon.  Finally her legs give out and she crumples \n  to the beach.  Ryuji grabs hold of her supportively.  He glances down at \n  her wrist, sees an ugly, purple BRUISE already beginning to form.  \n\n  The bruise is in the shape of five long, spindly fingers.\n\n  Mr. Yamamura slowly rises to a sitting position, and together the three \n  watch the approach of ominous, dark STORM CLOUDS.\n\n<b>  INT.

She\n\t\tcould kill people with just a thought, \n\t\tremember?  Her mother wasnt even \n\t\tclose to that.\n\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tASAKAWA\t\n</b>\t\t\t(flustered) \n\t\tWell, what about that video?  If \n\t\tSadakos dead then who made it?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI\t\n</b>\t\tNobody made it. It wasnt made at \n\t\tall. That video... is the pure, \n\t\tphysical manifestation of Sadakos \n\t\thatred.\n\n  Ryuji turns to regard Asakawa, his eyes blank.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI\n</b>\t\tWeve been cursed.\n\n  There is a moment of silence before Mr. Hayatsu slides the door open, \n  almost falling into the room.  He is out of breath, and speaks rapidly.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tHAYATSU\t\n</b>\t\tIts no good.  With the typhoon \n\t\tcoming in, all ships are \n\t\ttemporarily staying docked.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI\t\n</b>\t\tWhat about the fishing boats?  \n\t\tTell their captains Ill pay.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tHAYATSU\n</b>\t\tFishing boats?  Sir, without knowing \n\t\twhether this typhoon is going to hit \n\t\tus or not, I think itd be better to \n\t\twait and see how things turn--\n\n  Ryuji interrupts him, slamming both palms on the table.  Glasses \n  rattle wildly.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI\t\n</b>\t\tFine!  Ill try searching myself!\n\n  Ryuji stands and races past Mr. Hayatsu out into the rain.  Hayatsu \n  takes pursuit, calling after him.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tHAYATSU\t\n</b>\t\tMr. Takayama!?  Mr. Takayama...\n\n  Asakawa, left alone, stares down at the tatami mats.\n\n<b>  EXT.

Her \n  eyes are wide and glassy.  The phone RINGS suddenly and Asakawa dives \n  for it, wrenching it from the cradle before it can ring a second time.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tASAKAWA\t\n</b>\t\tHello?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tOKAZAKI (O.S.) \n</b>\t\tMrs. Asakawa?

He is \n  in mid-conversation with Mr. Hayatsu.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tASAKAWA\t\n</b>\t\tRyuji!  The phone in my apartment \n\t\tnever rang!  It only ever rang at\n\t\tthe rental cottage!

HARDWARE STORE  DAY\n</b>\n  Ryuji races out of the store, loaded down with supplies.  He holds a \n  pair of BUCKETS in one hand and a CROWBAR and SHOVEL in the other.  A \n  length of ROPE is coiled over his left shoulder.  He runs towards a \n  RENTAL CAR, passing by Asakawa who stands at a PAYPHONE, receiver in \n  hand.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tYOICHI (O.S.) \n</b>\t\tHello?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tASAKAWA\t\n</b>\t\tYoichi?  Its mommy.

He shuts the DOOR \n  just short of a slam.  CUT to Asakawa hanging up the phone.  She half-\n  runs towards the rental car and enters the passenger side, staring \n  blankly into space.  Ryuji slides into the drivers seat, buckles his \n<b>  SEATBELT.  \n</b>\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI\t\t\n</b>\t\tWhat time was it when you first \n\t\twatched the video?\n\n  Asakawa glances at her watch.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tASAKAWA\t\n</b>\t\tSeven or eight minutes past \n\t\tseven.

RENTAL CAR  DAY\n</b>\n  Asakawa sits in the passenger side.  Her face is almost angelic, \n  with the faintest hint of a smile.  Ryuji shoots a questioning look \n  at her.\n\n<b>  EXT. COUNTRY ROAD  DAY\n</b>\n  The white rental car tears past the SIGN reading Izu Pacific Land.  \n  The car continues into the LOT, screeching around corners before \n  coming to an abrupt halt.  Asakawa, her face still oddly expressionless, \n  gets out of the passenger side.  Ryuji exits as well, the hint of a \n  shudder running through him as he regards the series of rental cabins.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI\t\t\n</b>\t\t-Here-.\n\n  CUT to Asakawa and Ryuji walking up the gravel PATH towards the rental \n  cabins.  Ryuji looks back over his shoulder as both he and Asakawa stop \n  before cabin B4.  The cabin is on STILTS, its underbelly fenced off by \n  wooden LATICEWORK.  Ryuji drops most of his supplies to the ground, but \n  keeps hold of the PICK.  He raises the pick over one shoulder and begins \n  smashing away at the latticework.  When he has cleared enough space for   \n  passage, he begins picking up supplies and tossing them hastily within.  \n  When finished, he holds a hand out for Asakawa.  The two enter the \n  earthen basement.\n\n\n<b>  UNDER COTTAGE B4 - DAY  \n</b>\n  Ryuji pulls a FLASHLIGHT out, flicks it on.  The BEAM arcs outwards, \n  illuminating what looks more like an old mine shaft than a modern \n  rental cottage.  The beam halts when it suddenly encounters an old \n  STONE WELL.  The well is badly chipped on one side, and sealed off \n  with a solid-looking stone LID.  Ryuji rushes quickly towards it.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI\n</b>\t\tI knew it!  The well.\n\n  He squats down beside the well, setting the flashlight on the \n  lid.  Asakawa sinks slowly down beside him.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tASAKAWA\n</b>\t\tThe well...\n\n  Ryuji reaches out and takes Asakawas hand.  He sets their enclasped \n  hands onto the lid, and together they begin lightly tracing the \n  surface of the lid with their free hands.  Asakawa closes her eyes in \n  concentration... and suddenly, as with the incident on the beach, \n  Asakawa finds herself drawn into Ryujis psychometric VISION.\n\n<b>  FLASH\n</b>\n  The picture is black and white, grainy like old film.  A YOUNG GIRL in \n  a WHITE GOWN walks slowly towards an open well. She places her hand on \n  the LIP of the well, peers curiously down.  \n\n<b>  FLASH\n</b>\n  Asakawa looks up, her eyes wide open.\n\n<b>  FLASH\n</b><b>  \n</b>  There is now a second person in the vision, an ELDERLY MAN in an old-\n  fashioned tweed SUIT standing behind the young girl.  He suddenly \n  produces some BLADED OBJECT, and strikes the girl savagely across the \n  back of the head.  \n\n  The girl falls forward. The man drops to the ground, grabbing the girl \n  behind the knees and hoisting her limp BODY over the lip and into the \n  well.  The body falls into its depths.\n\n  Panting heavily, the man leans forward and grasps the lip of the well \n  with both hands, looking down.  He flashes a guilty look in either \n  direction, checking that his crime has gone unnoticed, and as he does \n  so Asakawa realizes that she knows this face.  The image from the \n  videotape, like a face in the moon: it had been Sadako inside the well, \n  looking up to see this man staring back down at her.\n\n  This man whose name is Professor Ikuma Heihachiro.\n\n<b>  FLASH\n</b>\n<b>\t\t\t\tASAKAWA\n</b>\t\tHer own father!\n\n  The energy seems to drain out of Asakawa in a rush, and her body \n  crumbles.  Ryuji catches hold of her.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI\t\t\n</b>\t\tIt was Ikuma who put this lid on.  \n\t\tAnd Sadakos still inside.\n\n  Ryuji stands quickly, takes hold of the crowbar.  He inserts it under \n  the lid and begins trying to pry it off, face scrunched with effort.  \n  Asakawa digs her fingers in and lends her own strength as well. Slowly,\n  the lid begins to move.  Ryuji tosses the crowbar aside and the two \n  lean the combined weight of their bodies into it.  The lid slides off, \n  dropping to the earth with a dull THUD.  Ryuji sits to one side, winded \n  with effort, as Asakawa takes hold of the flashlight.  She shines it \n  down into the well, but it only seems to intensify the gloom. What \n  WATER she can see looks fetid and brackish.  Ryuji sees her expression \n  and begins removing his JACKET.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI\n</b>\t\tIll go.\n\n  He walks off, leaving Asakawa alone.\n\n  CUT to an overhead shot of the well.  A ROPE is fastened to one side, \n  and Ryuji has already begun lowering himself down.  His eyes wander \n  overthe grime-smeared WALLS, and with a shudder he begins to pick out \n  human FINGERNAILS.  Torn loose and spattered with blood, countless \n  fingernails line the sides of the well. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI\n</b> \t\tSadako was alive!  Shed tried to \n\t\tclimb her way out.\n\n  Ryujis face twists into a grimace as if momentarily experiencing \n  Sadakosterrible agony.  He waits a moment longer before edging his \n  way down the rope again, finally SPLASHING to rest at the bottom of \n  the well.  He holds his flashlight above the brackish water, calls up \n  to Asakawa.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI\n</b>\t\tLower the buckets!\n\n  Asakawa nods and lowers two plastic BUCKETS fastened to a rope.  Ryuji \n  grabs one and scoops up a bucketful of water, tugging on the rope when \n  finished.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI\n</b>\t\tTake it up!\n\n  Asakawa hoists the bucket up to the rim of the well.  She walks a small \n  distance and tosses the contents out onto the ground.  She happens to \n  glance through the wooden lattice to the outside, and with a start \n  realizes that the sun has already started to set.  A nervous glance at \n  her WATCH later and she is back at the well, lowering the empty bucket \n  to find another full one already awaiting her.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI\n</b>\t\tTake it up!\n\n  In the well, Ryuji glances at his watch.  He looks at it for a long \n  moment, the expression on his face saying Were not going to make it.  \n  Time passes as Asakawa pulls up bucketload after bucketload, her \n  strength beginning to fade.  She half-stumbles, glances up... and is \n  shocked to realize that NIGHT has fallen.\n\n  CUT to Asakawa slowly pulling up yet another bucket, her strength \n  almost gone.  She looks at her watch and sees that it is now past \n  6:00.  She calls frantically down to Ryuji.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tASAKAWA\n</b>\t\tIts already six!\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI\n</b>\t\t\t(explosively) \n\t\tI know!  Hurry up and TAKE IT UP!!\n\n  The bucket slowly jerks into motion.  Asakawa pulls it up to the rim \n  of the well, holds it unsteadily.  She takes one faltering step and \n  falls, spilling the buckets contents onto the ground.  \n\n  CUT to Ryuji in the well, standing ready with another bucketful.\n\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI\n</b> \t\tTake it up!\n\n  Nothing happens.  \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI\n</b>\t\tAsakawa!\n\n  The bucket begins moving, even slower than before.  CUT to Asakawa, \n  her body trembling with effort. By now its all she can do to simply \n  keep her body moving.  She glances behind her, sees through the wooden \n  lattice that it is now pitch black.  A look of resignation crosses her \n  face and she releases her hold on the bucket, her body crumpling and \n  falling in on itself. \n<b>  \n</b>  CUT to the bucket splashing back into the well, narrowly missing \n  Ryuji.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI\t\n</b>\t\t\t(fuming) \n\t\tWhat the hell are you doing?  Trying \n\t\tto get me killed?\n\n  CUT back to Asakawa, her face dead.  Ryuji calls out from the well.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI (O.S.) \n</b>\t\tHey!\n\n  Asakawa falls backward onto the ground, arms splayed. CUT to the rim \n  of the well.  Ryuji pulls himself up over the rim, catches sight of \n  Asakawa.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI\n</b>\t\tAsakawa!\n\n  She lifts her head up but says nothing as Ryuji walks over to her.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI\n</b>\t\tWell change.  Youre in no condition \n\t\tto keep this up.\n\n  Asakawa suddenly springs into life.  Her voice is frantic, fearful.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tASAKAWA:\t\n</b>\t\tNo!\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI\n</b>\t\tWho do you expect to pull up these \n\t\tbuckets, then?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tASAKAWA\n</b>\t\tBut, we dont even know if its doing \n\t\tany good...\n\n  Ryuji strides forward and slaps Asakawa painfully across the cheek.  \n  He begins shaking her roughly for good measure.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI\n</b>\t\tAnd what about Yoichi, huh?  Is his\n\t\tmother not coming to pick him up \n\t\tafter all?\n\n  He releases his hold on her.  The two stare at each other a long time, \n  saying nothing.\n<b> \n</b>  CUT to an overhead shot of Asakawa being lowered into the well. CUT \n  now to Asakawa inside the well, her face and clothes covered with \n  grime, body simultaneously limp with exhaustion and tense with fright.  \n  Unable to resist the impulse, Asakawa slowly looks over her shoulder \n  and down into the well.  The dankness, the claustrophobia seeps in \n  and she draws in her breath in the first signs of panic.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI\n</b>\t\tDont look down!\n\n  She returns her gaze, cranes her neck upward.  CUT to Ryuji leaning \n  over the rim of the well, peering down at her.  For an instant, \n  everything becomes monochrome. Its not Ryuji looking down at her at \n  all; its Professor Ikuma, checking to see if shes still alive or \n  if the blow to the back of her head has finished her off.  CUT to \n  Asakawa, her eyes wide with fright.\n\n  Asakawa comes to rest at the bottom of the well.  A FLASHLIGHT hangs \n  from another rope, but its beam has almost no effect on the darkness.  \n  Asakawa crouches forward, hands moving searchingly through the water.  \n  She calls out pleadingly.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tASAKAWA\n</b>\t\tWhere are you?  Please, come out.\n\n  Asakawa straightens, unties herself from the rope.  A full bucket \n  already awaits.  She tugs on the rope and Ryuji pulls it up.  \n\n  She scoops up a second bucket, but something stops her from sending \n  it up.  Instead, she begins running her arms through the water again, \n  her voice close to tears.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tASAKAWA\n</b>\t\tPlease.  Where are you?\n\n  Asakawa continues her blind fumbling, which sends up little splashes \n  of stagnant water.  With a start, she realizes that her fingers have \n  caught something.  Seaweed?  Asakawa draws her hands close for a \n  better look... and sees that is HAIR.  A thick clump of long, black \n  hair.\n\n  Suddenly a pale, thin ARM shoots out from beneath the water, catching \n  Asakawa just below the wrist.  Asakawas ears are filled with a SOUND \n  like moaning as something slowly rises from its watery slumber.  It \n  is a GIRL, her face completely hidden by long, black hair.  CUT to a \n  shot of Asakawas face.  Far from being frightened, her features are \n  oddly placid.  She regards the fearsome thing before her with an \n  almost tender look.  Asakawa reaches out, lightly strokes that long \n  hair.  \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tASAKAWA\n</b>\t\tIts you...\n\n  She strokes the hair again, and abruptly it peels right off the head \n  with a loud SQUELCH. Revealed is not a face at all but a SKULL.  Its \n  sockets are at first menacingly empty, but then begin to ooze the \n  green SLUDGE it has pulled up from the bottom of the well.  Like a \n  mother comforting a frightened child, Asakawa pulls the skeletal \n  remains to her breast, strokes the bony head comfortingly. Her eyes \n  begin to glaze.\n\n  CUT to Ryuji racing up to the rim of the well, leaning down intently.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI\n</b>\t\tHey!  Asakawa!  Its already 10 \n\t\tminutes past seven!  We did it!\n\n  Down in the well, Asakawa continues staring blankly ahead.  Her body \n  suddenly falls forward, limp.\n\n<b>  EXT. OUTSIDE COTTAGE B4  NIGHT\n</b>\n  Three POLICE CARS are parked outside the rental cottages, crimson \n  headlights flashing.   A few COPS walk by, two of them carrying \n  something off in white PLASTIC BAGS.  CUT to Ryuji and Asakawa \n  sitting on the curb.  Asakawa is staring off at something, a BLANKET \n  draped over her shoulder.  \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tASAKAWA\t\n</b>\t\tWhy would Ikuma have killed her?  \n\t\tHis own daughter...\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI\n</b>\t\tMaybe she wasnt his daughter at all.  \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tASAKAWA\n</b>\t\tWhat?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI\n</b>\t\tMaybe her father... wasnt even human.\n\n  The two exchange glances.  Ryujis gaze falls to Asakawas WRIST, \n  which he suddenly takes and holds close to his face.  The ugly \n  bruise where Sadako had grabbed her has disappeared.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI\n</b>\t\tIts gone...  \n\n  He shakes his head, clearing his analytical mind of their ordeal.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI\n</b>\t\tEnough, already.  Its over.  Cmon.  \n\t\tIll take you home.\n\n  Ryuji stands, pulls Asakawa to her feet.\n\n<b>  EXT. OUTSIDE ASKAWAS APARTMENT - NIGHT  \n</b>\n  Ryujis white CAR pulls up into the parking lot.  He and Asakawa \n  get out, regard each other from opposite sides of the car. There is \n  a long moment where neither of them says anything.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI\t\n</b>\t\tGet some rest.  \n\n  He flashes her the slightest of grins. \n\n\t\t\t\tRYUJI (contd)\n\t\tI still have a thesis to finish. \n\n  CUT to a shot of Ryuji and Asakawa, the car creating an almost \n  metaphoric distance between them. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tASAKAWA\n</b>\t\t...thank you.\n\n  Ryuji nods silently by way of reply.  He gets into his car and \n  drives off.  Asakawa watches him go, and then walks towards the \n  entrance of her apartment.\n\n<b>  INT.

He \n  glances over at his BLACKBOARD for confirmation when a small scowl \n  crosses his brow.  Its gone a moment later as he chuckles wryly \n  to himself.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI\n</b>\t\tThat girl...\n\n  Ryuji stands, walks over to the blackboard.

His hand suddenly \n  ceases, eyes dancing worriedly as he hears a faint...\n\n  No.\n\n  Breath rattling fearfully in his throat, Ryuji spins around to face \n  the TELEVISION SET.  He gets out of his seat for a better look, \n  falling to his knees on the tatami. \n\n  The image that fills the screen is the last scene from the videotape; \n  the shot of the well.  \n\n  The SOUND from before comes louder now, more insistent, a metallic \n  screeching that both repulses and beckons him closer. Ryuji crawls on \n  all fours towards the SCREEN, stares at its unchanging image with \n  terrible foreboding.\n\n  There is a flash of MOTION as something shoots out of the well. A \n  hand. First one, and then another, as Sadako, still in her grimy white \n  dress, face hidden beneath long, oily strands of hair, begins slowly \n  pulling herself out.  The television screen jumps unsteadily, fills \n  with static as if barely able to contain her image.  \n\n  CUT back and forth between Ryuji, who is beginning to visibly panic, \n  and the television, which shows Sadako lurching ever closer.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI\n</b>\t\t\t(almost frantic) \n\t\tWhy?!\n\n  The TELEPHONE rings, and Ryuji spins round towards it, breath catching \n  in his throat.  He looks at the phone, over his shoulder at the \n  television, back to the phone.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI\n</b>\t\tThats it!  Asakawa...\n\n  Ryuji scrambles wildly towards the phone.  He takes the receiver but \n  is unable to do more than clutch it fearfully as his gaze is drawn \n  inexorably back to the television.  Sadakos shrouded face has filled \n  the entire screen... and then, television popping and crackling, she \n  jerks forward and emerges from the television onto the floor of \n  Ryujis apartment.  Ryuji backs away, screaming in terror.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI\n</b>\t\tAaargh!\n\n  Sadako lies prone, collapsed, hair splayed out like a drowned corpse.  \n  Only her FINGERS are active, crawling, feeling.  The TIPS of her \n  fingers are little more than bloodied stumps, not a single fingernail \n  on them.  She uses the strength in those fingers to pull herself \n  forward, coming jerkily to her feet.  The joints of her body twist \n  unnaturally, more insect-like than human.\n\n  Ryuji flings the phone aside and begins scrambling about the apartment \n  as if looking for cover.  The strength has already begun to fade from \n  his body, however, and his movements are clumsy, exaggerated. He falls \n  to the floor, panting heavily.  \n\n  Sadako turns to regard him, and for just an instant we can see beneath \n  her impenetrable shroud of hair; a single EYE burns with manic, \n  unbridled hatred.   \n\n  Its gaze meets Ryujis, and his face twists into a grimace as he \n  SCREAMS loudly.\n\n<b>  FLASH\n</b>\n<b>  EXT.

There is a \n  single GUARD posted at the entrance.

She drops the videotape \n  loudly onto the coffee table and slouches into a CHAIR.

{"input": "How many ethical arguments does Socrates propose?", "context": "This etext was prepared by Sue Asscher <asschers@aia.net.au>\n\n\n\n\n\nCRITO\n\nby Plato\n\n\n\n\nTranslated by Benjamin Jowett\n\n\n\n\nINTRODUCTION.\n\nThe Crito seems intended to exhibit the character of Socrates in one light\nonly, not as the philosopher, fulfilling a divine mission and trusting in\nthe will of heaven, but simply as the good citizen, who having been\nunjustly condemned is willing to give up his life in obedience to the laws\nof the state...\n\nThe days of Socrates are drawing to a close; the fatal ship has been seen\noff Sunium, as he is informed by his aged friend and contemporary Crito,\nwho visits him before the dawn has broken; he himself has been warned in a\ndream that on the third day he must depart.  Time is precious, and Crito\nhas come early in order to gain his consent to a plan of escape.  This can\nbe easily accomplished by his friends, who will incur no danger in making\nthe attempt to save him, but will be disgraced for ever if they allow him\nto perish.  He should think of his duty to his children, and not play into\nthe hands of his enemies.  Money is already provided by Crito as well as by\nSimmias and others, and he will have no difficulty in finding friends in\nThessaly and other places.\n\nSocrates is afraid that Crito is but pressing upon him the opinions of the\nmany:  whereas, all his life long he has followed the dictates of reason\nonly and the opinion of the one wise or skilled man.  There was a time when\nCrito himself had allowed the propriety of this.  And although some one\nwill say 'the many can kill us,' that makes no difference; but a good life,\nin other words, a just and honourable life, is alone to be valued.  All\nconsiderations of loss of reputation or injury to his children should be\ndismissed:  the only question is whether he would be right in attempting to\nescape.  Crito, who is a disinterested person not having the fear of death\nbefore his eyes, shall answer this for him.  Before he was condemned they\nhad often held discussions, in which they agreed that no man should either\ndo evil, or return evil for evil, or betray the right.  Are these\nprinciples to be altered because the circumstances of Socrates are altered?\nCrito admits that they remain the same.  Then is his escape consistent with\nthe maintenance of them?  To this Crito is unable or unwilling to reply.\n\nSocrates proceeds:--Suppose the Laws of Athens to come and remonstrate with\nhim:  they will ask 'Why does he seek to overturn them?' and if he replies,\n'they have injured him,' will not the Laws answer, 'Yes, but was that the\nagreement?  Has he any objection to make to them which would justify him in\noverturning them?  Was he not brought into the world and educated by their\nhelp, and are they not his parents?  He might have left Athens and gone\nwhere he pleased, but he has lived there for seventy years more constantly\nthan any other citizen.'  Thus he has clearly shown that he acknowledged\nthe agreement, which he cannot now break without dishonour to himself and\ndanger to his friends.  Even in the course of the trial he might have\nproposed exile as the penalty, but then he declared that he preferred death\nto exile.  And whither will he direct his footsteps?  In any well-ordered\nstate the Laws will consider him as an enemy.  Possibly in a land of\nmisrule like Thessaly he may be welcomed at first, and the unseemly\nnarrative of his escape will be regarded by the inhabitants as an amusing\ntale.  But if he offends them he will have to learn another sort of lesson.\nWill he continue to give lectures in virtue?  That would hardly be decent.\nAnd how will his children be the gainers if he takes them into Thessaly,\nand deprives them of Athenian citizenship?  Or if he leaves them behind,\ndoes he expect that they will be better taken care of by his friends\nbecause he is in Thessaly?  Will not true friends care for them equally\nwhether he is alive or dead?\n\nFinally, they exhort him to think of justice first, and of life and\nchildren afterwards.  He may now depart in peace and innocence, a sufferer\nand not a doer of evil.  But if he breaks agreements, and returns evil for\nevil, they will be angry with him while he lives; and their brethren the\nLaws of the world below will receive him as an enemy.  Such is the mystic\nvoice which is always murmuring in his ears.\n\nThat Socrates was not a good citizen was a charge made against him during\nhis lifetime, which has been often repeated in later ages.  The crimes of\nAlcibiades, Critias, and Charmides, who had been his pupils, were still\nrecent in the memory of the now restored democracy.  The fact that he had\nbeen neutral in the death-struggle of Athens was not likely to conciliate\npopular good-will.  Plato, writing probably in the next generation,\nundertakes the defence of his friend and master in this particular, not to\nthe Athenians of his day, but to posterity and the world at large.\n\nWhether such an incident ever really occurred as the visit of Crito and the\nproposal of escape is uncertain:  Plato could easily have invented far more\nthan that (Phaedr.); and in the selection of Crito, the aged friend, as the\nfittest person to make the proposal to Socrates, we seem to recognize the\nhand of the artist.  Whether any one who has been subjected by the laws of\nhis country to an unjust judgment is right in attempting to escape, is a\nthesis about which casuists might disagree.  Shelley (Prose Works) is of\nopinion that Socrates 'did well to die,' but not for the 'sophistical'\nreasons which Plato has put into his mouth.  And there would be no\ndifficulty in arguing that Socrates should have lived and preferred to a\nglorious death the good which he might still be able to perform.  'A\nrhetorician would have had much to say upon that point.'  It may be\nobserved however that Plato never intended to answer the question of\ncasuistry, but only to exhibit the ideal of patient virtue which refuses to\ndo the least evil in order to avoid the greatest, and to show his master\nmaintaining in death the opinions which he had professed in his life.  Not\n'the world,' but the 'one wise man,' is still the paradox of Socrates in\nhis last hours.  He must be guided by reason, although her conclusions may\nbe fatal to him.  The remarkable sentiment that the wicked can do neither\ngood nor evil is true, if taken in the sense, which he means, of moral\nevil; in his own words, 'they cannot make a man wise or foolish.'\n\nThis little dialogue is a perfect piece of dialectic, in which granting the\n'common principle,' there is no escaping from the conclusion.  It is\nanticipated at the beginning by the dream of Socrates and the parody of\nHomer.  The personification of the Laws, and of their brethren the Laws in\nthe world below, is one of the noblest and boldest figures of speech which\noccur in Plato.\n\n\nCRITO\n\nby\n\nPlato\n\nTranslated by Benjamin Jowett\n\n\nPERSONS OF THE DIALOGUE:  Socrates, Crito.\n\nSCENE:  The Prison of Socrates.\n\n\nSOCRATES:  Why have you come at this hour, Crito? it must be quite early.\n\nCRITO:  Yes, certainly.\n\nSOCRATES:  What is the exact time?\n\nCRITO:  The dawn is breaking.\n\nSOCRATES:  I wonder that the keeper of the prison would let you in.\n\nCRITO:  He knows me because I often come, Socrates; moreover.  I have done\nhim a kindness.\n\nSOCRATES:  And are you only just arrived?\n\nCRITO:  No, I came some time ago.\n\nSOCRATES:  Then why did you sit and say nothing, instead of at once\nawakening me?\n\nCRITO:  I should not have liked myself, Socrates, to be in such great\ntrouble and unrest as you are--indeed I should not:  I have been watching\nwith amazement your peaceful slumbers; and for that reason I did not awake\nyou, because I wished to minimize the pain.  I have always thought you to\nbe of a happy disposition; but never did I see anything like the easy,\ntranquil manner in which you bear this calamity.\n\nSOCRATES:  Why, Crito, when a man has reached my age he ought not to be\nrepining at the approach of death.\n\nCRITO:  And yet other old men find themselves in similar misfortunes, and\nage does not prevent them from repining.\n\nSOCRATES:  That is true.  But you have not told me why you come at this\nearly hour.\n\nCRITO:  I come to bring you a message which is sad and painful; not, as I\nbelieve, to yourself, but to all of us who are your friends, and saddest of\nall to me.\n\nSOCRATES:  What?  Has the ship come from Delos, on the arrival of which I\nam to die?\n\nCRITO:  No, the ship has not actually arrived, but she will probably be\nhere to-day, as persons who have come from Sunium tell me that they have\nleft her there; and therefore to-morrow, Socrates, will be the last day of\nyour life.\n\nSOCRATES:  Very well, Crito; if such is the will of God, I am willing; but\nmy belief is that there will be a delay of a day.\n\nCRITO:  Why do you think so?\n\nSOCRATES:  I will tell you.  I am to die on the day after the arrival of\nthe ship?\n\nCRITO:  Yes; that is what the authorities say.\n\nSOCRATES:  But I do not think that the ship will be here until to-morrow;\nthis I infer from a vision which I had last night, or rather only just now,\nwhen you fortunately allowed me to sleep.\n\nCRITO:  And what was the nature of the vision?\n\nSOCRATES:  There appeared to me the likeness of a woman, fair and comely,\nclothed in bright raiment, who called to me and said:  O Socrates,\n\n'The third day hence to fertile Phthia shalt thou go.'  (Homer, Il.)\n\nCRITO:  What a singular dream, Socrates!\n\nSOCRATES:  There can be no doubt about the meaning, Crito, I think.\n\nCRITO:  Yes; the meaning is only too clear.  But, oh! my beloved Socrates,\nlet me entreat you once more to take my advice and escape.  For if you die\nI shall not only lose a friend who can never be replaced, but there is\nanother evil:  people who do not know you and me will believe that I might\nhave saved you if I had been willing to give money, but that I did not\ncare.  Now, can there be a worse disgrace than this--that I should be\nthought to value money more than the life of a friend?  For the many will\nnot be persuaded that I wanted you to escape, and that you refused.\n\nSOCRATES:  But why, my dear Crito, should we care about the opinion of the\nmany?  Good men, and they are the only persons who are worth considering,\nwill think of these things truly as they occurred.\n\nCRITO:  But you see, Socrates, that the opinion of the many must be\nregarded, for what is now happening shows that they can do the greatest\nevil to any one who has lost their good opinion.\n\nSOCRATES:  I only wish it were so, Crito; and that the many could do the\ngreatest evil; for then they would also be able to do the greatest good--\nand what a fine thing this would be!  But in reality they can do neither;\nfor they cannot make a man either wise or foolish; and whatever they do is\nthe result of chance.\n\nCRITO:  Well, I will not dispute with you; but please to tell me, Socrates,\nwhether you are not acting out of regard to me and your other friends:  are\nyou not afraid that if you escape from prison we may get into trouble with\nthe informers for having stolen you away, and lose either the whole or a\ngreat part of our property; or that even a worse evil may happen to us?\nNow, if you fear on our account, be at ease; for in order to save you, we\nought surely to run this, or even a greater risk; be persuaded, then, and\ndo as I say.\n\nSOCRATES:  Yes, Crito, that is one fear which you mention, but by no means\nthe only one.\n\nCRITO:  Fear not--there are persons who are willing to get you out of\nprison at no great cost; and as for the informers they are far from being\nexorbitant in their demands--a little money will satisfy them.  My means,\nwhich are certainly ample, are at your service, and if you have a scruple\nabout spending all mine, here are strangers who will give you the use of\ntheirs; and one of them, Simmias the Theban, has brought a large sum of\nmoney for this very purpose; and Cebes and many others are prepared to\nspend their money in helping you to escape.  I say, therefore, do not\nhesitate on our account, and do not say, as you did in the court (compare\nApol.), that you will have a difficulty in knowing what to do with yourself\nanywhere else.  For men will love you in other places to which you may go,\nand not in Athens only; there are friends of mine in Thessaly, if you like\nto go to them, who will value and protect you, and no Thessalian will give\nyou any trouble.  Nor can I think that you are at all justified, Socrates,\nin betraying your own life when you might be saved; in acting thus you are\nplaying into the hands of your enemies, who are hurrying on your\ndestruction.  And further I should say that you are deserting your own\nchildren; for you might bring them up and educate them; instead of which\nyou go away and leave them, and they will have to take their chance; and if\nthey do not meet with the usual fate of orphans, there will be small thanks\nto you.  No man should bring children into the world who is unwilling to\npersevere to the end in their nurture and education.  But you appear to be\nchoosing the easier part, not the better and manlier, which would have been\nmore becoming in one who professes to care for virtue in all his actions,\nlike yourself.  And indeed, I am ashamed not only of you, but of us who are\nyour friends, when I reflect that the whole business will be attributed\nentirely to our want of courage.  The trial need never have come on, or\nmight have been managed differently; and this last act, or crowning folly,\nwill seem to have occurred through our negligence and cowardice, who might\nhave saved you, if we had been good for anything; and you might have saved\nyourself, for there was no difficulty at all.  See now, Socrates, how sad\nand discreditable are the consequences, both to us and you.  Make up your\nmind then, or rather have your mind already made up, for the time of\ndeliberation is over, and there is only one thing to be done, which must be\ndone this very night, and if we delay at all will be no longer practicable\nor possible; I beseech you therefore, Socrates, be persuaded by me, and do\nas I say.\n\nSOCRATES:  Dear Crito, your zeal is invaluable, if a right one; but if\nwrong, the greater the zeal the greater the danger; and therefore we ought\nto consider whether I shall or shall not do as you say.  For I am and\nalways have been one of those natures who must be guided by reason,\nwhatever the reason may be which upon reflection appears to me to be the\nbest; and now that this chance has befallen me, I cannot repudiate my own\nwords:  the principles which I have hitherto honoured and revered I still\nhonour, and unless we can at once find other and better principles, I am\ncertain not to agree with you; no, not even if the power of the multitude\ncould inflict many more imprisonments, confiscations, deaths, frightening\nus like children with hobgoblin terrors (compare Apol.).  What will be the\nfairest way of considering the question?  Shall I return to your old\nargument about the opinions of men?--we were saying that some of them are\nto be regarded, and others not.  Now were we right in maintaining this\nbefore I was condemned?  And has the argument which was once good now\nproved to be talk for the sake of talking--mere childish nonsense?  That is\nwhat I want to consider with your help, Crito:--whether, under my present\ncircumstances, the argument appears to be in any way different or not; and\nis to be allowed by me or disallowed.  That argument, which, as I believe,\nis maintained by many persons of authority, was to the effect, as I was\nsaying, that the opinions of some men are to be regarded, and of other men\nnot to be regarded.  Now you, Crito, are not going to die to-morrow--at\nleast, there is no human probability of this, and therefore you are\ndisinterested and not liable to be deceived by the circumstances in which\nyou are placed.  Tell me then, whether I am right in saying that some\nopinions, and the opinions of some men only, are to be valued, and that\nother opinions, and the opinions of other men, are not to be valued.  I ask\nyou whether I was right in maintaining this?\n\nCRITO:  Certainly.\n\nSOCRATES:  The good are to be regarded, and not the bad?\n\nCRITO:  Yes.\n\nSOCRATES:  And the opinions of the wise are good, and the opinions of the\nunwise are evil?\n\nCRITO:  Certainly.\n\nSOCRATES:  And what was said about another matter?  Is the pupil who\ndevotes himself to the practice of gymnastics supposed to attend to the\npraise and blame and opinion of every man, or of one man only--his\nphysician or trainer, whoever he may be?\n\nCRITO:  Of one man only.\n\nSOCRATES:  And he ought to fear the censure and welcome the praise of that\none only, and not of the many?\n\nCRITO:  Clearly so.\n\nSOCRATES:  And he ought to act and train, and eat and drink in the way\nwhich seems good to his single master who has understanding, rather than\naccording to the opinion of all other men put together?\n\nCRITO:  True.\n\nSOCRATES:  And if he disobeys and disregards the opinion and approval of\nthe one, and regards the opinion of the many who have no understanding,\nwill he not suffer evil?\n\nCRITO:  Certainly he will.\n\nSOCRATES:  And what will the evil be, whither tending and what affecting,\nin the disobedient person?\n\nCRITO:  Clearly, affecting the body; that is what is destroyed by the evil.\n\nSOCRATES:  Very good; and is not this true, Crito, of other things which we\nneed not separately enumerate?  In questions of just and unjust, fair and\nfoul, good and evil, which are the subjects of our present consultation,\nought we to follow the opinion of the many and to fear them; or the opinion\nof the one man who has understanding? ought we not to fear and reverence\nhim more than all the rest of the world:  and if we desert him shall we not\ndestroy and injure that principle in us which may be assumed to be improved\nby justice and deteriorated by injustice;--there is such a principle?\n\nCRITO:  Certainly there is, Socrates.\n\nSOCRATES:  Take a parallel instance:--if, acting under the advice of those\nwho have no understanding, we destroy that which is improved by health and\nis deteriorated by disease, would life be worth having?  And that which has\nbeen destroyed is--the body?\n\nCRITO:  Yes.\n\nSOCRATES:  Could we live, having an evil and corrupted body?\n\nCRITO:  Certainly not.\n\nSOCRATES:  And will life be worth having, if that higher part of man be\ndestroyed, which is improved by justice and depraved by injustice?  Do we\nsuppose that principle, whatever it may be in man, which has to do with\njustice and injustice, to be inferior to the body?\n\nCRITO:  Certainly not.\n\nSOCRATES:  More honourable than the body?\n\nCRITO:  Far more.\n\nSOCRATES:  Then, my friend, we must not regard what the many say of us:\nbut what he, the one man who has understanding of just and unjust, will\nsay, and what the truth will say.  And therefore you begin in error when\nyou advise that we should regard the opinion of the many about just and\nunjust, good and evil, honorable and dishonorable.--'Well,' some one will\nsay, 'but the many can kill us.'\n\nCRITO:  Yes, Socrates; that will clearly be the answer.\n\nSOCRATES:  And it is true; but still I find with surprise that the old\nargument is unshaken as ever.  And I should like to know whether I may say\nthe same of another proposition--that not life, but a good life, is to be\nchiefly valued?\n\nCRITO:  Yes, that also remains unshaken.\n\nSOCRATES:  And a good life is equivalent to a just and honorable one--that\nholds also?\n\nCRITO:  Yes, it does.\n\nSOCRATES:  From these premisses I proceed to argue the question whether I\nought or ought not to try and escape without the consent of the Athenians:\nand if I am clearly right in escaping, then I will make the attempt; but if\nnot, I will abstain.  The other considerations which you mention, of money\nand loss of character and the duty of educating one's children, are, I\nfear, only the doctrines of the multitude, who would be as ready to restore\npeople to life, if they were able, as they are to put them to death--and\nwith as little reason.  But now, since the argument has thus far prevailed,\nthe only question which remains to be considered is, whether we shall do\nrightly either in escaping or in suffering others to aid in our escape and\npaying them in money and thanks, or whether in reality we shall not do\nrightly; and if the latter, then death or any other calamity which may\nensue on my remaining here must not be allowed to enter into the\ncalculation.\n\nCRITO:  I think that you are right, Socrates; how then shall we proceed?\n\nSOCRATES:  Let us consider the matter together, and do you either refute me\nif you can, and I will be convinced; or else cease, my dear friend, from\nrepeating to me that I ought to escape against the wishes of the Athenians:\nfor I highly value your attempts to persuade me to do so, but I may not be\npersuaded against my own better judgment.  And now please to consider my\nfirst position, and try how you can best answer me.\n\nCRITO:  I will.\n\nSOCRATES:  Are we to say that we are never intentionally to do wrong, or\nthat in one way we ought and in another way we ought not to do wrong, or is\ndoing wrong always evil and dishonorable, as I was just now saying, and as\nhas been already acknowledged by us?  Are all our former admissions which\nwere made within a few days to be thrown away?  And have we, at our age,\nbeen earnestly discoursing with one another all our life long only to\ndiscover that we are no better than children?  Or, in spite of the opinion\nof the many, and in spite of consequences whether better or worse, shall we\ninsist on the truth of what was then said, that injustice is always an evil\nand dishonour to him who acts unjustly?  Shall we say so or not?\n\nCRITO:  Yes.\n\nSOCRATES:  Then we must do no wrong?\n\nCRITO:  Certainly not.\n\nSOCRATES:  Nor when injured injure in return, as the many imagine; for we\nmust injure no one at all?  (E.g. compare Rep.)\n\nCRITO:  Clearly not.\n\nSOCRATES:  Again, Crito, may we do evil?\n\nCRITO:  Surely not, Socrates.\n\nSOCRATES:  And what of doing evil in return for evil, which is the morality\nof the many--is that just or not?\n\nCRITO:  Not just.\n\nSOCRATES:  For doing evil to another is the same as injuring him?\n\nCRITO:  Very true.\n\nSOCRATES:  Then we ought not to retaliate or render evil for evil to any\none, whatever evil we may have suffered from him.  But I would have you\nconsider, Crito, whether you really mean what you are saying.  For this\nopinion has never been held, and never will be held, by any considerable\nnumber of persons; and those who are agreed and those who are not agreed\nupon this point have no common ground, and can only despise one another\nwhen they see how widely they differ.  Tell me, then, whether you agree\nwith and assent to my first principle, that neither injury nor retaliation\nnor warding off evil by evil is ever right.  And shall that be the premiss\nof our argument?  Or do you decline and dissent from this?  For so I have\never thought, and continue to think; but, if you are of another opinion,\nlet me hear what you have to say.  If, however, you remain of the same mind\nas formerly, I will proceed to the next step.\n\nCRITO:  You may proceed, for I have not changed my mind.\n\nSOCRATES:  Then I will go on to the next point, which may be put in the\nform of a question:--Ought a man to do what he admits to be right, or ought\nhe to betray the right?\n\nCRITO:  He ought to do what he thinks right.\n\nSOCRATES:  But if this is true, what is the application?  In leaving the\nprison against the will of the Athenians, do I wrong any? or rather do I\nnot wrong those whom I ought least to wrong?  Do I not desert the\nprinciples which were acknowledged by us to be just--what do you say?\n\nCRITO:  I cannot tell, Socrates, for I do not know.\n\nSOCRATES:  Then consider the matter in this way:--Imagine that I am about\nto play truant (you may call the proceeding by any name which you like),\nand the laws and the government come and interrogate me:  'Tell us,\nSocrates,' they say; 'what are you about? are you not going by an act of\nyours to overturn us--the laws, and the whole state, as far as in you lies?\nDo you imagine that a state can subsist and not be overthrown, in which the\ndecisions of law have no power, but are set aside and trampled upon by\nindividuals?'  What will be our answer, Crito, to these and the like words?\nAny one, and especially a rhetorician, will have a good deal to say on\nbehalf of the law which requires a sentence to be carried out.  He will\nargue that this law should not be set aside; and shall we reply, 'Yes; but\nthe state has injured us and given an unjust sentence.'  Suppose I say\nthat?\n\nCRITO:  Very good, Socrates.\n\nSOCRATES:  'And was that our agreement with you?' the law would answer; 'or\nwere you to abide by the sentence of the state?'  And if I were to express\nmy astonishment at their words, the law would probably add:  'Answer,\nSocrates, instead of opening your eyes--you are in the habit of asking and\nanswering questions.  Tell us,--What complaint have you to make against us\nwhich justifies you in attempting to destroy us and the state?  In the\nfirst place did we not bring you into existence?  Your father married your\nmother by our aid and begat you.  Say whether you have any objection to\nurge against those of us who regulate marriage?'  None, I should reply.\n'Or against those of us who after birth regulate the nurture and education\nof children, in which you also were trained?  Were not the laws, which have\nthe charge of education, right in commanding your father to train you in\nmusic and gymnastic?'  Right, I should reply.  'Well then, since you were\nbrought into the world and nurtured and educated by us, can you deny in the\nfirst place that you are our child and slave, as your fathers were before\nyou?  And if this is true you are not on equal terms with us; nor can you\nthink that you have a right to do to us what we are doing to you.  Would\nyou have any right to strike or revile or do any other evil to your father\nor your master, if you had one, because you have been struck or reviled by\nhim, or received some other evil at his hands?--you would not say this?\nAnd because we think right to destroy you, do you think that you have any\nright to destroy us in return, and your country as far as in you lies?\nWill you, O professor of true virtue, pretend that you are justified in\nthis?  Has a philosopher like you failed to discover that our country is\nmore to be valued and higher and holier far than mother or father or any\nancestor, and more to be regarded in the eyes of the gods and of men of\nunderstanding? also to be soothed, and gently and reverently entreated when\nangry, even more than a father, and either to be persuaded, or if not\npersuaded, to be obeyed?  And when we are punished by her, whether with\nimprisonment or stripes, the punishment is to be endured in silence; and if\nshe lead us to wounds or death in battle, thither we follow as is right;\nneither may any one yield or retreat or leave his rank, but whether in\nbattle or in a court of law, or in any other place, he must do what his\ncity and his country order him; or he must change their view of what is\njust:  and if he may do no violence to his father or mother, much less may\nhe do violence to his country.'  What answer shall we make to this, Crito?\nDo the laws speak truly, or do they not?\n\nCRITO:  I think that they do.\n\nSOCRATES:  Then the laws will say:  'Consider, Socrates, if we are speaking\ntruly that in your present attempt you are going to do us an injury.  For,\nhaving brought you into the world, and nurtured and educated you, and given\nyou and every other citizen a share in every good which we had to give, we\nfurther proclaim to any Athenian by the liberty which we allow him, that if\nhe does not like us when he has become of age and has seen the ways of the\ncity, and made our acquaintance, he may go where he pleases and take his\ngoods with him.  None of us laws will forbid him or interfere with him.\nAny one who does not like us and the city, and who wants to emigrate to a\ncolony or to any other city, may go where he likes, retaining his property.\nBut he who has experience of the manner in which we order justice and\nadminister the state, and still remains, has entered into an implied\ncontract that he will do as we command him.  And he who disobeys us is, as\nwe maintain, thrice wrong:  first, because in disobeying us he is\ndisobeying his parents; secondly, because we are the authors of his\neducation; thirdly, because he has made an agreement with us that he will\nduly obey our commands; and he neither obeys them nor convinces us that our\ncommands are unjust; and we do not rudely impose them, but give him the\nalternative of obeying or convincing us;--that is what we offer, and he\ndoes neither.\n\n'These are the sort of accusations to which, as we were saying, you,\nSocrates, will be exposed if you accomplish your intentions; you, above all\nother Athenians.'  Suppose now I ask, why I rather than anybody else? they\nwill justly retort upon me that I above all other men have acknowledged the\nagreement.  'There is clear proof,' they will say, 'Socrates, that we and\nthe city were not displeasing to you.  Of all Athenians you have been the\nmost constant resident in the city, which, as you never leave, you may be\nsupposed to love (compare Phaedr.).  For you never went out of the city\neither to see the games, except once when you went to the Isthmus, or to\nany other place unless when you were on military service; nor did you\ntravel as other men do.  Nor had you any curiosity to know other states or\ntheir laws:  your affections did not go beyond us and our state; we were\nyour especial favourites, and you acquiesced in our government of you; and\nhere in this city you begat your children, which is a proof of your\nsatisfaction.  Moreover, you might in the course of the trial, if you had\nliked, have fixed the penalty at banishment; the state which refuses to let\nyou go now would have let you go then.  But you pretended that you\npreferred death to exile (compare Apol.), and that you were not unwilling\nto die.  And now you have forgotten these fine sentiments, and pay no\nrespect to us the laws, of whom you are the destroyer; and are doing what\nonly a miserable slave would do, running away and turning your back upon\nthe compacts and agreements which you made as a citizen.  And first of all\nanswer this very question:  Are we right in saying that you agreed to be\ngoverned according to us in deed, and not in word only?  Is that true or\nnot?'  How shall we answer, Crito?  Must we not assent?\n\nCRITO:  We cannot help it, Socrates.\n\nSOCRATES:  Then will they not say:  'You, Socrates, are breaking the\ncovenants and agreements which you made with us at your leisure, not in any\nhaste or under any compulsion or deception, but after you have had seventy\nyears to think of them, during which time you were at liberty to leave the\ncity, if we were not to your mind, or if our covenants appeared to you to\nbe unfair.  You had your choice, and might have gone either to Lacedaemon\nor Crete, both which states are often praised by you for their good\ngovernment, or to some other Hellenic or foreign state.  Whereas you, above\nall other Athenians, seemed to be so fond of the state, or, in other words,\nof us her laws (and who would care about a state which has no laws?), that\nyou never stirred out of her; the halt, the blind, the maimed, were not\nmore stationary in her than you were.  And now you run away and forsake\nyour agreements.  Not so, Socrates, if you will take our advice; do not\nmake yourself ridiculous by escaping out of the city.\n\n'For just consider, if you transgress and err in this sort of way, what\ngood will you do either to yourself or to your friends?  That your friends\nwill be driven into exile and deprived of citizenship, or will lose their\nproperty, is tolerably certain; and you yourself, if you fly to one of the\nneighbouring cities, as, for example, Thebes or Megara, both of which are\nwell governed, will come to them as an enemy, Socrates, and their\ngovernment will be against you, and all patriotic citizens will cast an\nevil eye upon you as a subverter of the laws, and you will confirm in the\nminds of the judges the justice of their own condemnation of you.  For he\nwho is a corrupter of the laws is more than likely to be a corrupter of the\nyoung and foolish portion of mankind.  Will you then flee from well-ordered\ncities and virtuous men? and is existence worth having on these terms?  Or\nwill you go to them without shame, and talk to them, Socrates?  And what\nwill you say to them?  What you say here about virtue and justice and\ninstitutions and laws being the best things among men?  Would that be\ndecent of you?  Surely not.  But if you go away from well-governed states\nto Crito's friends in Thessaly, where there is great disorder and licence,\nthey will be charmed to hear the tale of your escape from prison, set off\nwith ludicrous particulars of the manner in which you were wrapped in a\ngoatskin or some other disguise, and metamorphosed as the manner is of\nrunaways; but will there be no one to remind you that in your old age you\nwere not ashamed to violate the most sacred laws from a miserable desire of\na little more life?  Perhaps not, if you keep them in a good temper; but if\nthey are out of temper you will hear many degrading things; you will live,\nbut how?--as the flatterer of all men, and the servant of all men; and\ndoing what?--eating and drinking in Thessaly, having gone abroad in order\nthat you may get a dinner.  And where will be your fine sentiments about\njustice and virtue?  Say that you wish to live for the sake of your\nchildren--you want to bring them up and educate them--will you take them\ninto Thessaly and deprive them of Athenian citizenship?  Is this the\nbenefit which you will confer upon them?  Or are you under the impression\nthat they will be better cared for and educated here if you are still\nalive, although absent from them; for your friends will take care of them?\nDo you fancy that if you are an inhabitant of Thessaly they will take care\nof them, and if you are an inhabitant of the other world that they will not\ntake care of them?  Nay; but if they who call themselves friends are good\nfor anything, they will--to be sure they will.\n\n'Listen, then, Socrates, to us who have brought you up.  Think not of life\nand children first, and of justice afterwards, but of justice first, that\nyou may be justified before the princes of the world below.  For neither\nwill you nor any that belong to you be happier or holier or juster in this\nlife, or happier in another, if you do as Crito bids.  Now you depart in\ninnocence, a sufferer and not a doer of evil; a victim, not of the laws,\nbut of men.  But if you go forth, returning evil for evil, and injury for\ninjury, breaking the covenants and agreements which you have made with us,\nand wronging those whom you ought least of all to wrong, that is to say,\nyourself, your friends, your country, and us, we shall be angry with you\nwhile you live, and our brethren, the laws in the world below, will receive\nyou as an enemy; for they will know that you have done your best to destroy\nus.  Listen, then, to us and not to Crito.'\n\nThis, dear Crito, is the voice which I seem to hear murmuring in my ears,\nlike the sound of the flute in the ears of the mystic; that voice, I say,\nis humming in my ears, and prevents me from hearing any other.  And I know\nthat anything more which you may say will be vain.  Yet speak, if you have\nanything to say.\n\nCRITO:  I have nothing to say, Socrates.\n\nSOCRATES:  Leave me then, Crito, to fulfil the will of God, and to follow\nwhither he leads.", "answers": ["Two"], "length": 6592, "dataset": "narrativeqa", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "8a46cc12564386606f3162cd88cae3ec0f868009efce1d33"}

HTML version by Al Haines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Adventure of the Devil's Foot\n\n\nBy\n\nSir Arthur Conan Doyle\n\n\n\n\nIn recording from time to time some of the curious experiences and\ninteresting recollections which I associate with my long and intimate\nfriendship with Mr. Sherlock Holmes, I have continually been faced by\ndifficulties caused by his own aversion to publicity.  To his sombre\nand cynical spirit all popular applause was always abhorrent, and\nnothing amused him more at the end of a successful case than to hand\nover the actual exposure to some orthodox official, and to listen with\na mocking smile to the general chorus of misplaced congratulation.  It\nwas indeed this attitude upon the part of my friend and certainly not\nany lack of interesting material which has caused me of late years to\nlay very few of my records before the public.  My participation in some\nof his adventures was always a privilege which entailed discretion and\nreticence upon me.\n\nIt was, then, with considerable surprise that I received a telegram\nfrom Holmes last Tuesday--he has never been known to write where a\ntelegram would serve--in the following terms:\n\nWhy not tell them of the Cornish horror--strangest case I have handled.\n\nI have no idea what backward sweep of memory had brought the matter\nfresh to his mind, or what freak had caused him to desire that I should\nrecount it; but I hasten, before another cancelling telegram may\narrive, to hunt out the notes which give me the exact details of the\ncase and to lay the narrative before my readers.\n\nIt was, then, in the spring of the year 1897 that Holmes's iron\nconstitution showed some symptoms of giving way in the face of constant\nhard work of a most exacting kind, aggravated, perhaps, by occasional\nindiscretions of his own.  In March of that year Dr. Moore Agar, of\nHarley Street, whose dramatic introduction to Holmes I may some day\nrecount, gave positive injunctions that the famous private agent lay\naside all his cases and surrender himself to complete rest if he wished\nto avert an absolute breakdown.  The state of his health was not a\nmatter in which he himself took the faintest interest, for his mental\ndetachment was absolute, but he was induced at last, on the threat of\nbeing permanently disqualified from work, to give himself a complete\nchange of scene and air.  Thus it was that in the early spring of that\nyear we found ourselves together in a small cottage near Poldhu Bay, at\nthe further extremity of the Cornish peninsula.\n\nIt was a singular spot, and one peculiarly well suited to the grim\nhumour of my patient.  From the windows of our little whitewashed\nhouse, which stood high upon a grassy headland, we looked down upon the\nwhole sinister semicircle of Mounts Bay, that old death trap of sailing\nvessels, with its fringe of black cliffs and surge-swept reefs on which\ninnumerable seamen have met their end.  With a northerly breeze it lies\nplacid and sheltered, inviting the storm-tossed craft to tack into it\nfor rest and protection.\n\nThen come the sudden swirl round of the wind, the blistering gale from\nthe south-west, the dragging anchor, the lee shore, and the last battle\nin the creaming breakers.  The wise mariner stands far out from that\nevil place.\n\nOn the land side our surroundings were as sombre as on the sea. It was\na country of rolling moors, lonely and dun-colored, with an occasional\nchurch tower to mark the site of some old-world village.  In every\ndirection upon these moors there were traces of some vanished race\nwhich had passed utterly away, and left as its sole record strange\nmonuments of stone, irregular mounds which contained the burned ashes\nof the dead, and curious earthworks which hinted at prehistoric strife.\nThe glamour and mystery of the place, with its sinister atmosphere of\nforgotten nations, appealed to the imagination of my friend, and he\nspent much of his time in long walks and solitary meditations upon the\nmoor. The ancient Cornish language had also arrested his attention, and\nhe had, I remember, conceived the idea that it was akin to the\nChaldean, and had been largely derived from the Phoenician traders in\ntin.  He had received a consignment of books upon philology and was\nsettling down to develop this thesis when suddenly, to my sorrow and to\nhis unfeigned delight, we found ourselves, even in that land of dreams,\nplunged into a problem at our very doors which was more intense, more\nengrossing, and infinitely more mysterious than any of those which had\ndriven us from London.  Our simple life and peaceful, healthy routine\nwere violently interrupted, and we were precipitated into the midst of\na series of events which caused the utmost excitement not only in\nCornwall but throughout the whole west of England. Many of my readers\nmay retain some recollection of what was called at the time \"The\nCornish Horror,\" though a most imperfect account of the matter reached\nthe London press. Now, after thirteen years, I will give the true\ndetails of this inconceivable affair to the public.\n\nI have said that scattered towers marked the villages which dotted this\npart of Cornwall.  The nearest of these was the hamlet of Tredannick\nWollas, where the cottages of a couple of hundred inhabitants clustered\nround an ancient, moss-grown church.  The vicar of the parish, Mr.\nRoundhay, was something of an archaeologist, and as such Holmes had\nmade his acquaintance. He was a middle-aged man, portly and affable,\nwith a considerable fund of local lore.  At his invitation we had taken\ntea at the vicarage and had come to know, also, Mr. Mortimer Tregennis,\nan independent gentleman, who increased the clergyman's scanty\nresources by taking rooms in his large, straggling house.  The vicar,\nbeing a bachelor, was glad to come to such an arrangement, though he\nhad little in common with his lodger, who was a thin, dark, spectacled\nman, with a stoop which gave the impression of actual, physical\ndeformity.  I remember that during our short visit we found the vicar\ngarrulous, but his lodger strangely reticent, a sad-faced,\nintrospective man, sitting with averted eyes, brooding apparently upon\nhis own affairs.\n\nThese were the two men who entered abruptly into our little\nsitting-room on Tuesday, March the 16th, shortly after our breakfast\nhour, as we were smoking together, preparatory to our daily excursion\nupon the moors.\n\n\"Mr. Holmes,\" said the vicar in an agitated voice, \"the most\nextraordinary and tragic affair has occurred during the night. It is\nthe most unheard-of business.  We can only regard it as a special\nProvidence that you should chance to be here at the time, for in all\nEngland you are the one man we need.\"\n\nI glared at the intrusive vicar with no very friendly eyes; but Holmes\ntook his pipe from his lips and sat up in his chair like an old hound\nwho hears the view-halloa.  He waved his hand to the sofa, and our\npalpitating visitor with his agitated companion sat side by side upon\nit.  Mr. Mortimer Tregennis was more self-contained than the clergyman,\nbut the twitching of his thin hands and the brightness of his dark eyes\nshowed that they shared a common emotion.\n\n\"Shall I speak or you?\" he asked of the vicar.\n\n\"Well, as you seem to have made the discovery, whatever it may be, and\nthe vicar to have had it second-hand, perhaps you had better do the\nspeaking,\" said Holmes.\n\nI glanced at the hastily clad clergyman, with the formally dressed\nlodger seated beside him, and was amused at the surprise which Holmes's\nsimple deduction had brought to their faces.\n\n\"Perhaps I had best say a few words first,\" said the vicar, \"and then\nyou can judge if you will listen to the details from Mr. Tregennis, or\nwhether we should not hasten at once to the scene of this mysterious\naffair.  I may explain, then, that our friend here spent last evening\nin the company of his two brothers, Owen and George, and of his sister\nBrenda, at their house of Tredannick Wartha, which is near the old\nstone cross upon the moor.  He left them shortly after ten o'clock,\nplaying cards round the dining-room table, in excellent health and\nspirits. This morning, being an early riser, he walked in that\ndirection before breakfast and was overtaken by the carriage of Dr.\nRichards, who explained that he had just been sent for on a most urgent\ncall to Tredannick Wartha.  Mr. Mortimer Tregennis naturally went with\nhim.  When he arrived at Tredannick Wartha he found an extraordinary\nstate of things.  His two brothers and his sister were seated round the\ntable exactly as he had left them, the cards still spread in front of\nthem and the candles burned down to their sockets.  The sister lay back\nstone-dead in her chair, while the two brothers sat on each side of her\nlaughing, shouting, and singing, the senses stricken clean out of them.\nAll three of them, the dead woman and the two demented men, retained\nupon their faces an expression of the utmost horror--a convulsion of\nterror which was dreadful to look upon.  There was no sign of the\npresence of anyone in the house, except Mrs. Porter, the old cook and\nhousekeeper, who declared that she had slept deeply and heard no sound\nduring the night.  Nothing had been stolen or disarranged, and there is\nabsolutely no explanation of what the horror can be which has\nfrightened a woman to death and two strong men out of their senses.\nThere is the situation, Mr. Holmes, in a nutshell, and if you can help\nus to clear it up you will have done a great work.\"\n\nI had hoped that in some way I could coax my companion back into the\nquiet which had been the object of our journey; but one glance at his\nintense face and contracted eyebrows told me how vain was now the\nexpectation.  He sat for some little time in silence, absorbed in the\nstrange drama which had broken in upon our peace.\n\n\"I will look into this matter,\" he said at last.  \"On the face of it,\nit would appear to be a case of a very exceptional nature. Have you\nbeen there yourself, Mr. Roundhay?\"\n\n\"No, Mr. Holmes.  Mr. Tregennis brought back the account to the\nvicarage, and I at once hurried over with him to consult you.\"\n\n\"How far is it to the house where this singular tragedy occurred?\"\n\n\"About a mile inland.\"\n\n\"Then we shall walk over together.  But before we start I must ask you\na few questions, Mr. Mortimer Tregennis.\"\n\nThe other had been silent all this time, but I had observed that his\nmore controlled excitement was even greater than the obtrusive emotion\nof the clergyman.  He sat with a pale, drawn face, his anxious gaze\nfixed upon Holmes, and his thin hands clasped convulsively together.\nHis pale lips quivered as he listened to the dreadful experience which\nhad befallen his family, and his dark eyes seemed to reflect something\nof the horror of the scene.\n\n\"Ask what you like, Mr. Holmes,\" said he eagerly.  \"It is a bad thing\nto speak of, but I will answer you the truth.\"\n\n\"Tell me about last night.\"\n\n\"Well, Mr. Holmes, I supped there, as the vicar has said, and my elder\nbrother George proposed a game of whist afterwards.  We sat down about\nnine o'clock.  It was a quarter-past ten when I moved to go.  I left\nthem all round the table, as merry as could be.\"\n\n\"Who let you out?\"\n\n\"Mrs. Porter had gone to bed, so I let myself out.  I shut the hall\ndoor behind me.  The window of the room in which they sat was closed,\nbut the blind was not drawn down.  There was no change in door or\nwindow this morning, or any reason to think that any stranger had been\nto the house.  Yet there they sat, driven clean mad with terror, and\nBrenda lying dead of fright, with her head hanging over the arm of the\nchair.  I'll never get the sight of that room out of my mind so long as\nI live.\"\n\n\"The facts, as you state them, are certainly most remarkable,\" said\nHolmes.  \"I take it that you have no theory yourself which can in any\nway account for them?\"\n\n\"It's devilish, Mr. Holmes, devilish!\" cried Mortimer Tregennis. \"It is\nnot of this world.  Something has come into that room which has dashed\nthe light of reason from their minds.  What human contrivance could do\nthat?\"\n\n\"I fear,\" said Holmes, \"that if the matter is beyond humanity it is\ncertainly beyond me.  Yet we must exhaust all natural explanations\nbefore we fall back upon such a theory as this.  As to yourself, Mr.\nTregennis, I take it you were divided in some way from your family,\nsince they lived together and you had rooms apart?\"\n\n\"That is so, Mr. Holmes, though the matter is past and done with. We\nwere a family of tin-miners at Redruth, but we sold our venture to a\ncompany, and so retired with enough to keep us.  I won't deny that\nthere was some feeling about the division of the money and it stood\nbetween us for a time, but it was all forgiven and forgotten, and we\nwere the best of friends together.\"\n\n\"Looking back at the evening which you spent together, does anything\nstand out in your memory as throwing any possible light upon the\ntragedy?  Think carefully, Mr. Tregennis, for any clue which can help\nme.\"\n\n\"There is nothing at all, sir.\"\n\n\"Your people were in their usual spirits?\"\n\n\"Never better.\"\n\n\"Were they nervous people?  Did they ever show any apprehension of\ncoming danger?\"\n\n\"Nothing of the kind.\"\n\n\"You have nothing to add then, which could assist me?\"\n\nMortimer Tregennis considered earnestly for a moment.\n\n\"There is one thing occurs to me,\" said he at last.  \"As we sat at the\ntable my back was to the window, and my brother George, he being my\npartner at cards, was facing it.  I saw him once look hard over my\nshoulder, so I turned round and looked also.  The blind was up and the\nwindow shut, but I could just make out the bushes on the lawn, and it\nseemed to me for a moment that I saw something moving among them.  I\ncouldn't even say if it was man or animal, but I just thought there was\nsomething there.  When I asked him what he was looking at, he told me\nthat he had the same feeling.  That is all that I can say.\"\n\n\"Did you not investigate?\"\n\n\"No; the matter passed as unimportant.\"\n\n\"You left them, then, without any premonition of evil?\"\n\n\"None at all.\"\n\n\"I am not clear how you came to hear the news so early this morning.\"\n\n\"I am an early riser and generally take a walk before breakfast. This\nmorning I had hardly started when the doctor in his carriage overtook\nme.  He told me that old Mrs. Porter had sent a boy down with an urgent\nmessage.  I sprang in beside him and we drove on. When we got there we\nlooked into that dreadful room.  The candles and the fire must have\nburned out hours before, and they had been sitting there in the dark\nuntil dawn had broken.  The doctor said Brenda must have been dead at\nleast six hours.  There were no signs of violence.  She just lay across\nthe arm of the chair with that look on her face.  George and Owen were\nsinging snatches of songs and gibbering like two great apes.  Oh, it\nwas awful to see!  I couldn't stand it, and the doctor was as white as\na sheet.  Indeed, he fell into a chair in a sort of faint, and we\nnearly had him on our hands as well.\"\n\n\"Remarkable--most remarkable!\" said Holmes, rising and taking his hat.\n\"I think, perhaps, we had better go down to Tredannick Wartha without\nfurther delay.  I confess that I have seldom known a case which at\nfirst sight presented a more singular problem.\"\n\n\nOur proceedings of that first morning did little to advance the\ninvestigation.  It was marked, however, at the outset by an incident\nwhich left the most sinister impression upon my mind. The approach to\nthe spot at which the tragedy occurred is down a narrow, winding,\ncountry lane.  While we made our way along it we heard the rattle of a\ncarriage coming towards us and stood aside to let it pass.  As it drove\nby us I caught a glimpse through the closed window of a horribly\ncontorted, grinning face glaring out at us.  Those staring eyes and\ngnashing teeth flashed past us like a dreadful vision.\n\n\"My brothers!\" cried Mortimer Tregennis, white to his lips. \"They are\ntaking them to Helston.\"\n\nWe looked with horror after the black carriage, lumbering upon its way.\nThen we turned our steps towards this ill-omened house in which they\nhad met their strange fate.\n\nIt was a large and bright dwelling, rather a villa than a cottage, with\na considerable garden which was already, in that Cornish air, well\nfilled with spring flowers.  Towards this garden the window of the\nsitting-room fronted, and from it, according to Mortimer Tregennis,\nmust have come that thing of evil which had by sheer horror in a single\ninstant blasted their minds.  Holmes walked slowly and thoughtfully\namong the flower-plots and along the path before we entered the porch.\nSo absorbed was he in his thoughts, I remember, that he stumbled over\nthe watering-pot, upset its contents, and deluged both our feet and the\ngarden path.  Inside the house we were met by the elderly Cornish\nhousekeeper, Mrs. Porter, who, with the aid of a young girl, looked\nafter the wants of the family.  She readily answered all Holmes's\nquestions.  She had heard nothing in the night.  Her employers had all\nbeen in excellent spirits lately, and she had never known them more\ncheerful and prosperous.  She had fainted with horror upon entering the\nroom in the morning and seeing that dreadful company round the table.\nShe had, when she recovered, thrown open the window to let the morning\nair in, and had run down to the lane, whence she sent a farm-lad for\nthe doctor.  The lady was on her bed upstairs if we cared to see her.\nIt took four strong men to get the brothers into the asylum carriage.\nShe would not herself stay in the house another day and was starting\nthat very afternoon to rejoin her family at St. Ives.\n\nWe ascended the stairs and viewed the body.  Miss Brenda Tregennis had\nbeen a very beautiful girl, though now verging upon middle age.  Her\ndark, clear-cut face was handsome, even in death, but there still\nlingered upon it something of that convulsion of horror which had been\nher last human emotion.  From her bedroom we descended to the\nsitting-room, where this strange tragedy had actually occurred.  The\ncharred ashes of the overnight fire lay in the grate.  On the table\nwere the four guttered and burned-out candles, with the cards scattered\nover its surface.  The chairs had been moved back against the walls,\nbut all else was as it had been the night before.  Holmes paced with\nlight, swift steps about the room; he sat in the various chairs,\ndrawing them up and reconstructing their positions.  He tested how much\nof the garden was visible; he examined the floor, the ceiling, and the\nfireplace; but never once did I see that sudden brightening of his eyes\nand tightening of his lips which would have told me that he saw some\ngleam of light in this utter darkness.\n\n\"Why a fire?\" he asked once.  \"Had they always a fire in this small\nroom on a spring evening?\"\n\nMortimer Tregennis explained that the night was cold and damp. For that\nreason, after his arrival, the fire was lit.  \"What are you going to do\nnow, Mr. Holmes?\" he asked.\n\nMy friend smiled and laid his hand upon my arm.  \"I think, Watson, that\nI shall resume that course of tobacco-poisoning which you have so often\nand so justly condemned,\" said he.  \"With your permission, gentlemen,\nwe will now return to our cottage, for I am not aware that any new\nfactor is likely to come to our notice here.  I will turn the facts\nover in my mind, Mr. Tregennis, and should anything occur to me I will\ncertainly communicate with you and the vicar.  In the meantime I wish\nyou both good-morning.\"\n\nIt was not until long after we were back in Poldhu Cottage that Holmes\nbroke his complete and absorbed silence.  He sat coiled in his\narmchair, his haggard and ascetic face hardly visible amid the blue\nswirl of his tobacco smoke, his black brows drawn down, his forehead\ncontracted, his eyes vacant and far away.  Finally he laid down his\npipe and sprang to his feet.\n\n\"It won't do, Watson!\" said he with a laugh.  \"Let us walk along the\ncliffs together and search for flint arrows.  We are more likely to\nfind them than clues to this problem.  To let the brain work without\nsufficient material is like racing an engine.  It racks itself to\npieces.  The sea air, sunshine, and patience, Watson--all else will\ncome.\n\n\"Now, let us calmly define our position, Watson,\" he continued as we\nskirted the cliffs together.  \"Let us get a firm grip of the very\nlittle which we DO know, so that when fresh facts arise we may be ready\nto fit them into their places.  I take it, in the first place, that\nneither of us is prepared to admit diabolical intrusions into the\naffairs of men.  Let us begin by ruling that entirely out of our minds.\nVery good.  There remain three persons who have been grievously\nstricken by some conscious or unconscious human agency.  That is firm\nground.  Now, when did this occur?  Evidently, assuming his narrative\nto be true, it was immediately after Mr. Mortimer Tregennis had left\nthe room.  That is a very important point.  The presumption is that it\nwas within a few minutes afterwards.  The cards still lay upon the\ntable. It was already past their usual hour for bed.  Yet they had not\nchanged their position or pushed back their chairs.  I repeat, then,\nthat the occurrence was immediately after his departure, and not later\nthan eleven o'clock last night.\n\n\"Our next obvious step is to check, so far as we can, the movements of\nMortimer Tregennis after he left the room.  In this there is no\ndifficulty, and they seem to be above suspicion. Knowing my methods as\nyou do, you were, of course, conscious of the somewhat clumsy water-pot\nexpedient by which I obtained a clearer impress of his foot than might\notherwise have been possible.  The wet, sandy path took it admirably.\nLast night was also wet, you will remember, and it was not\ndifficult--having obtained a sample print--to pick out his track among\nothers and to follow his movements.  He appears to have walked away\nswiftly in the direction of the vicarage.\n\n\"If, then, Mortimer Tregennis disappeared from the scene, and yet some\noutside person affected the card-players, how can we reconstruct that\nperson, and how was such an impression of horror conveyed?  Mrs. Porter\nmay be eliminated.  She is evidently harmless.  Is there any evidence\nthat someone crept up to the garden window and in some manner produced\nso terrific an effect that he drove those who saw it out of their\nsenses?  The only suggestion in this direction comes from Mortimer\nTregennis himself, who says that his brother spoke about some movement\nin the garden.  That is certainly remarkable, as the night was rainy,\ncloudy, and dark.  Anyone who had the design to alarm these people\nwould be compelled to place his very face against the glass before he\ncould be seen.  There is a three-foot flower-border outside this\nwindow, but no indication of a footmark.  It is difficult to imagine,\nthen, how an outsider could have made so terrible an impression upon\nthe company, nor have we found any possible motive for so strange and\nelaborate an attempt.  You perceive our difficulties, Watson?\"\n\n\"They are only too clear,\" I answered with conviction.\n\n\"And yet, with a little more material, we may prove that they are not\ninsurmountable,\" said Holmes.  \"I fancy that among your extensive\narchives, Watson, you may find some which were nearly as obscure.\nMeanwhile, we shall put the case aside until more accurate data are\navailable, and devote the rest of our morning to the pursuit of\nneolithic man.\"\n\nI may have commented upon my friend's power of mental detachment, but\nnever have I wondered at it more than upon that spring morning in\nCornwall when for two hours he discoursed upon celts, arrowheads, and\nshards, as lightly as if no sinister mystery were waiting for his\nsolution.  It was not until we had returned in the afternoon to our\ncottage that we found a visitor awaiting us, who soon brought our minds\nback to the matter in hand.  Neither of us needed to be told who that\nvisitor was.  The huge body, the craggy and deeply seamed face with the\nfierce eyes and hawk-like nose, the grizzled hair which nearly brushed\nour cottage ceiling, the beard--golden at the fringes and white near\nthe lips, save for the nicotine stain from his perpetual cigar--all\nthese were as well known in London as in Africa, and could only be\nassociated with the tremendous personality of Dr. Leon Sterndale, the\ngreat lion-hunter and explorer.\n\nWe had heard of his presence in the district and had once or twice\ncaught sight of his tall figure upon the moorland paths. He made no\nadvances to us, however, nor would we have dreamed of doing so to him,\nas it was well known that it was his love of seclusion which caused him\nto spend the greater part of the intervals between his journeys in a\nsmall bungalow buried in the lonely wood of Beauchamp Arriance.  Here,\namid his books and his maps, he lived an absolutely lonely life,\nattending to his own simple wants and paying little apparent heed to\nthe affairs of his neighbours.  It was a surprise to me, therefore, to\nhear him asking Holmes in an eager voice whether he had made any\nadvance in his reconstruction of this mysterious episode.  \"The county\npolice are utterly at fault,\" said he, \"but perhaps your wider\nexperience has suggested some conceivable explanation.  My only claim\nto being taken into your confidence is that during my many residences\nhere I have come to know this family of Tregennis very well--indeed,\nupon my Cornish mother's side I could call them cousins--and their\nstrange fate has naturally been a great shock to me.  I may tell you\nthat I had got as far as Plymouth upon my way to Africa, but the news\nreached me this morning, and I came straight back again to help in the\ninquiry.\"\n\nHolmes raised his eyebrows.\n\n\"Did you lose your boat through it?\"\n\n\"I will take the next.\"\n\n\"Dear me! that is friendship indeed.\"\n\n\"I tell you they were relatives.\"\n\n\"Quite so--cousins of your mother.  Was your baggage aboard the ship?\"\n\n\"Some of it, but the main part at the hotel.\"\n\n\"I see.  But surely this event could not have found its way into the\nPlymouth morning papers.\"\n\n\"No, sir; I had a telegram.\"\n\n\"Might I ask from whom?\"\n\nA shadow passed over the gaunt face of the explorer.\n\n\"You are very inquisitive, Mr. Holmes.\"\n\n\"It is my business.\"\n\nWith an effort Dr. Sterndale recovered his ruffled composure.\n\n\"I have no objection to telling you,\" he said.  \"It was Mr. Roundhay,\nthe vicar, who sent me the telegram which recalled me.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Holmes.  \"I may say in answer to your original\nquestion that I have not cleared my mind entirely on the subject of\nthis case, but that I have every hope of reaching some conclusion.  It\nwould be premature to say more.\"\n\n\"Perhaps you would not mind telling me if your suspicions point in any\nparticular direction?\"\n\n\"No, I can hardly answer that.\"\n\n\"Then I have wasted my time and need not prolong my visit.\"  The famous\ndoctor strode out of our cottage in considerable ill-humour, and within\nfive minutes Holmes had followed him.  I saw him no more until the\nevening, when he returned with a slow step and haggard face which\nassured me that he had made no great progress with his investigation.\nHe glanced at a telegram which awaited him and threw it into the grate.\n\n\"From the Plymouth hotel, Watson,\" he said.  \"I learned the name of it\nfrom the vicar, and I wired to make certain that Dr. Leon Sterndale's\naccount was true.  It appears that he did indeed spend last night\nthere, and that he has actually allowed some of his baggage to go on to\nAfrica, while he returned to be present at this investigation.  What do\nyou make of that, Watson?\"\n\n\"He is deeply interested.\"\n\n\"Deeply interested--yes.  There is a thread here which we had not yet\ngrasped and which might lead us through the tangle.  Cheer up, Watson,\nfor I am very sure that our material has not yet all come to hand.\nWhen it does we may soon leave our difficulties behind us.\"\n\nLittle did I think how soon the words of Holmes would be realized, or\nhow strange and sinister would be that new development which opened up\nan entirely fresh line of investigation.  I was shaving at my window in\nthe morning when I heard the rattle of hoofs and, looking up, saw a\ndog-cart coming at a gallop down the road.  It pulled up at our door,\nand our friend, the vicar, sprang from it and rushed up our garden\npath. Holmes was already dressed, and we hastened down to meet him.\n\nOur visitor was so excited that he could hardly articulate, but at last\nin gasps and bursts his tragic story came out of him.\n\n\"We are devil-ridden, Mr. Holmes!  My poor parish is devil-ridden!\" he\ncried.  \"Satan himself is loose in it!  We are given over into his\nhands!\"  He danced about in his agitation, a ludicrous object if it\nwere not for his ashy face and startled eyes.  Finally he shot out his\nterrible news.\n\n\"Mr. Mortimer Tregennis died during the night, and with exactly the\nsame symptoms as the rest of his family.\"\n\nHolmes sprang to his feet, all energy in an instant.\n\n\"Can you fit us both into your dog-cart?\"\n\n\"Yes, I can.\"\n\n\"Then, Watson, we will postpone our breakfast.  Mr. Roundhay, we are\nentirely at your disposal.  Hurry--hurry, before things get\ndisarranged.\"\n\nThe lodger occupied two rooms at the vicarage, which were in an angle\nby themselves, the one above the other.  Below was a large\nsitting-room; above, his bedroom.  They looked out upon a croquet lawn\nwhich came up to the windows.  We had arrived before the doctor or the\npolice, so that everything was absolutely undisturbed.  Let me describe\nexactly the scene as we saw it upon that misty March morning.  It has\nleft an impression which can never be effaced from my mind.\n\nThe atmosphere of the room was of a horrible and depressing stuffiness.\nThe servant who had first entered had thrown up the window, or it would\nhave been even more intolerable.  This might partly be due to the fact\nthat a lamp stood flaring and smoking on the centre table.  Beside it\nsat the dead man, leaning back in his chair, his thin beard projecting,\nhis spectacles pushed up on to his forehead, and his lean dark face\nturned towards the window and twisted into the same distortion of\nterror which had marked the features of his dead sister.  His limbs\nwere convulsed and his fingers contorted as though he had died in a\nvery paroxysm of fear.  He was fully clothed, though there were signs\nthat his dressing had been done in a hurry.  We had already learned\nthat his bed had been slept in, and that the tragic end had come to him\nin the early morning.\n\nOne realized the red-hot energy which underlay Holmes's phlegmatic\nexterior when one saw the sudden change which came over him from the\nmoment that he entered the fatal apartment.  In an instant he was tense\nand alert, his eyes shining, his face set, his limbs quivering with\neager activity.  He was out on the lawn, in through the window, round\nthe room, and up into the bedroom, for all the world like a dashing\nfoxhound drawing a cover.  In the bedroom he made a rapid cast around\nand ended by throwing open the window, which appeared to give him some\nfresh cause for excitement, for he leaned out of it with loud\nejaculations of interest and delight.  Then he rushed down the stair,\nout through the open window, threw himself upon his face on the lawn,\nsprang up and into the room once more, all with the energy of the\nhunter who is at the very heels of his quarry.  The lamp, which was an\nordinary standard, he examined with minute care, making certain\nmeasurements upon its bowl.  He carefully scrutinized with his lens the\ntalc shield which covered the top of the chimney and scraped off some\nashes which adhered to its upper surface, putting some of them into an\nenvelope, which he placed in his pocketbook.  Finally, just as the\ndoctor and the official police put in an appearance, he beckoned to the\nvicar and we all three went out upon the lawn.\n\n\"I am glad to say that my investigation has not been entirely barren,\"\nhe remarked.  \"I cannot remain to discuss the matter with the police,\nbut I should be exceedingly obliged, Mr. Roundhay, if you would give\nthe inspector my compliments and direct his attention to the bedroom\nwindow and to the sitting-room lamp.  Each is suggestive, and together\nthey are almost conclusive.  If the police would desire further\ninformation I shall be happy to see any of them at the cottage.  And\nnow, Watson, I think that, perhaps, we shall be better employed\nelsewhere.\"\n\nIt may be that the police resented the intrusion of an amateur, or that\nthey imagined themselves to be upon some hopeful line of investigation;\nbut it is certain that we heard nothing from them for the next two\ndays.  During this time Holmes spent some of his time smoking and\ndreaming in the cottage; but a greater portion in country walks which\nhe undertook alone, returning after many hours without remark as to\nwhere he had been.  One experiment served to show me the line of his\ninvestigation.  He had bought a lamp which was the duplicate of the one\nwhich had burned in the room of Mortimer Tregennis on the morning of\nthe tragedy.  This he filled with the same oil as that used at the\nvicarage, and he carefully timed the period which it would take to be\nexhausted. Another experiment which he made was of a more unpleasant\nnature, and one which I am not likely ever to forget.\n\n\"You will remember, Watson,\" he remarked one afternoon, \"that there is\na single common point of resemblance in the varying reports which have\nreached us.  This concerns the effect of the atmosphere of the room in\neach case upon those who had first entered it.  You will recollect that\nMortimer Tregennis, in describing the episode of his last visit to his\nbrother's house, remarked that the doctor on entering the room fell\ninto a chair? You had forgotten?  Well I can answer for it that it was\nso. Now, you will remember also that Mrs. Porter, the housekeeper, told\nus that she herself fainted upon entering the room and had afterwards\nopened the window.  In the second case--that of Mortimer Tregennis\nhimself--you cannot have forgotten the horrible stuffiness of the room\nwhen we arrived, though the servant had thrown open the window.  That\nservant, I found upon inquiry, was so ill that she had gone to her bed.\nYou will admit, Watson, that these facts are very suggestive.  In each\ncase there is evidence of a poisonous atmosphere.  In each case, also,\nthere is combustion going on in the room--in the one case a fire, in\nthe other a lamp.  The fire was needed, but the lamp was lit--as a\ncomparison of the oil consumed will show--long after it was broad\ndaylight.  Why?  Surely because there is some connection between three\nthings--the burning, the stuffy atmosphere, and, finally, the madness\nor death of those unfortunate people.  That is clear, is it not?\"\n\n\"It would appear so.\"\n\n\"At least we may accept it as a working hypothesis.  We will suppose,\nthen, that something was burned in each case which produced an\natmosphere causing strange toxic effects.  Very good. In the first\ninstance--that of the Tregennis family--this substance was placed in\nthe fire.  Now the window was shut, but the fire would naturally carry\nfumes to some extent up the chimney.  Hence one would expect the\neffects of the poison to be less than in the second case, where there\nwas less escape for the vapour.  The result seems to indicate that it\nwas so, since in the first case only the woman, who had presumably the\nmore sensitive organism, was killed, the others exhibiting that\ntemporary or permanent lunacy which is evidently the first effect of\nthe drug.  In the second case the result was complete.  The facts,\ntherefore, seem to bear out the theory of a poison which worked by\ncombustion.\n\n\"With this train of reasoning in my head I naturally looked about in\nMortimer Tregennis's room to find some remains of this substance.  The\nobvious place to look was the talc shelf or smoke-guard of the lamp.\nThere, sure enough, I perceived a number of flaky ashes, and round the\nedges a fringe of brownish powder, which had not yet been consumed.\nHalf of this I took, as you saw, and I placed it in an envelope.\"\n\n\"Why half, Holmes?\"\n\n\"It is not for me, my dear Watson, to stand in the way of the official\npolice force.  I leave them all the evidence which I found.  The poison\nstill remained upon the talc had they the wit to find it.  Now, Watson,\nwe will light our lamp; we will, however, take the precaution to open\nour window to avoid the premature decease of two deserving members of\nsociety, and you will seat yourself near that open window in an\narmchair unless, like a sensible man, you determine to have nothing to\ndo with the affair.  Oh, you will see it out, will you?  I thought I\nknew my Watson.  This chair I will place opposite yours, so that we may\nbe the same distance from the poison and face to face.  The door we\nwill leave ajar.  Each is now in a position to watch the other and to\nbring the experiment to an end should the symptoms seem alarming.  Is\nthat all clear?  Well, then, I take our powder--or what remains of\nit--from the envelope, and I lay it above the burning lamp.  So!  Now,\nWatson, let us sit down and await developments.\"\n\nThey were not long in coming.  I had hardly settled in my chair before\nI was conscious of a thick, musky odour, subtle and nauseous.  At the\nvery first whiff of it my brain and my imagination were beyond all\ncontrol.  A thick, black cloud swirled before my eyes, and my mind told\nme that in this cloud, unseen as yet, but about to spring out upon my\nappalled senses, lurked all that was vaguely horrible, all that was\nmonstrous and inconceivably wicked in the universe.  Vague shapes\nswirled and swam amid the dark cloud-bank, each a menace and a warning\nof something coming, the advent of some unspeakable dweller upon the\nthreshold, whose very shadow would blast my soul.  A freezing horror\ntook possession of me.  I felt that my hair was rising, that my eyes\nwere protruding, that my mouth was opened, and my tongue like leather.\nThe turmoil within my brain was such that something must surely snap.\nI tried to scream and was vaguely aware of some hoarse croak which was\nmy own voice, but distant and detached from myself.  At the same moment,\nin some effort of escape, I broke through that cloud of despair and had\na glimpse of Holmes's face, white, rigid, and drawn with horror--the\nvery look which I had seen upon the features of the dead.  It was that\nvision which gave me an instant of sanity and of strength.  I dashed\nfrom my chair, threw my arms round Holmes, and together we lurched\nthrough the door, and an instant afterwards had thrown ourselves down\nupon the grass plot and were lying side by side, conscious only of the\nglorious sunshine which was bursting its way through the hellish cloud\nof terror which had girt us in. Slowly it rose from our souls like the\nmists from a landscape until peace and reason had returned, and we were\nsitting upon the grass, wiping our clammy foreheads, and looking with\napprehension at each other to mark the last traces of that terrific\nexperience which we had undergone.\n\n\"Upon my word, Watson!\" said Holmes at last with an unsteady voice, \"I\nowe you both my thanks and an apology.  It was an unjustifiable\nexperiment even for one's self, and doubly so for a friend.  I am\nreally very sorry.\"\n\n\"You know,\" I answered with some emotion, for I have never seen so much\nof Holmes's heart before, \"that it is my greatest joy and privilege to\nhelp you.\"\n\nHe relapsed at once into the half-humorous, half-cynical vein which was\nhis habitual attitude to those about him.  \"It would be superfluous to\ndrive us mad, my dear Watson,\" said he.  \"A candid observer would\ncertainly declare that we were so already before we embarked upon so\nwild an experiment.  I confess that I never imagined that the effect\ncould be so sudden and so severe.\"  He dashed into the cottage, and,\nreappearing with the burning lamp held at full arm's length, he threw\nit among a bank of brambles. \"We must give the room a little time to\nclear.  I take it, Watson, that you have no longer a shadow of a doubt\nas to how these tragedies were produced?\"\n\n\"None whatever.\"\n\n\"But the cause remains as obscure as before.  Come into the arbour here\nand let us discuss it together.  That villainous stuff seems still to\nlinger round my throat.  I think we must admit that all the evidence\npoints to this man, Mortimer Tregennis, having been the criminal in the\nfirst tragedy, though he was the victim in the second one.  We must\nremember, in the first place, that there is some story of a family\nquarrel, followed by a reconciliation.  How bitter that quarrel may\nhave been, or how hollow the reconciliation we cannot tell.   When I\nthink of Mortimer Tregennis, with the foxy face and the small shrewd,\nbeady eyes behind the spectacles, he is not a man whom I should judge\nto be of a particularly forgiving disposition. Well, in the next place,\nyou will remember that this idea of someone moving in the garden, which\ntook our attention for a moment from the real cause of the tragedy,\nemanated from him.  He had a motive in misleading us.  Finally, if he\ndid not throw the substance into the fire at the moment of leaving the\nroom, who did do so?  The affair happened immediately after his\ndeparture. Had anyone else come in, the family would certainly have\nrisen from the table.  Besides, in peaceful Cornwall, visitors did not\narrive after ten o'clock at night.  We may take it, then, that all the\nevidence points to Mortimer Tregennis as the culprit.\"\n\n\"Then his own death was suicide!\"\n\n\"Well, Watson, it is on the face of it a not impossible supposition.\nThe man who had the guilt upon his soul of having brought such a fate\nupon his own family might well be driven by remorse to inflict it upon\nhimself.  There are, however, some cogent reasons against it.\nFortunately, there is one man in England who knows all about it, and I\nhave made arrangements by which we shall hear the facts this afternoon\nfrom his own lips. Ah! he is a little before his time.  Perhaps you\nwould kindly step this way, Dr. Leon Sterndale. We have been conducing\na chemical experiment indoors which has left our little room hardly fit\nfor the reception of so distinguished a visitor.\"\n\nI had heard the click of the garden gate, and now the majestic figure\nof the great African explorer appeared upon the path.  He turned in\nsome surprise towards the rustic arbour in which we sat.\n\n\"You sent for me, Mr. Holmes.  I had your note about an hour ago, and I\nhave come, though I really do not know why I should obey your summons.\"\n\n\"Perhaps we can clear the point up before we separate,\" said Holmes.\n\"Meanwhile, I am much obliged to you for your courteous acquiescence.\nYou will excuse this informal reception in the open air, but my friend\nWatson and I have nearly furnished an additional chapter to what the\npapers call the Cornish Horror, and we prefer a clear atmosphere for\nthe present.  Perhaps, since the matters which we have to discuss will\naffect you personally in a very intimate fashion, it is as well that we\nshould talk where there can be no eavesdropping.\"\n\nThe explorer took his cigar from his lips and gazed sternly at my\ncompanion.\n\n\"I am at a loss to know, sir,\" he said, \"what you can have to speak\nabout which affects me personally in a very intimate fashion.\"\n\n\"The killing of Mortimer Tregennis,\" said Holmes.\n\nFor a moment I wished that I were armed.  Sterndale's fierce face\nturned to a dusky red, his eyes glared, and the knotted, passionate\nveins started out in his forehead, while he sprang forward with\nclenched hands towards my companion.  Then he stopped, and with a\nviolent effort he resumed a cold, rigid calmness, which was, perhaps,\nmore suggestive of danger than his hot-headed outburst.\n\n\"I have lived so long among savages and beyond the law,\" said he, \"that\nI have got into the way of being a law to myself.  You would do well,\nMr. Holmes, not to forget it, for I have no desire to do you an injury.\"\n\n\"Nor have I any desire to do you an injury, Dr. Sterndale. Surely the\nclearest proof of it is that, knowing what I know, I have sent for you\nand not for the police.\"\n\nSterndale sat down with a gasp, overawed for, perhaps, the first time\nin his adventurous life.  There was a calm assurance of power in\nHolmes's manner which could not be withstood.  Our visitor stammered\nfor a moment, his great hands opening and shutting in his agitation.\n\n\"What do you mean?\" he asked at last.  \"If this is bluff upon your\npart, Mr. Holmes, you have chosen a bad man for your experiment. Let us\nhave no more beating about the bush.  What DO you mean?\"\n\n\"I will tell you,\" said Holmes, \"and the reason why I tell you is that\nI hope frankness may beget frankness.  What my next step may be will\ndepend entirely upon the nature of your own defence.\"\n\n\"My defence?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"My defence against what?\"\n\n\"Against the charge of killing Mortimer Tregennis.\"\n\nSterndale mopped his forehead with his handkerchief.  \"Upon my word,\nyou are getting on,\" said he.  \"Do all your successes depend upon this\nprodigious power of bluff?\"\n\n\"The bluff,\" said Holmes sternly, \"is upon your side, Dr. Leon\nSterndale, and not upon mine.  As a proof I will tell you some of the\nfacts upon which my conclusions are based.  Of your return from\nPlymouth, allowing much of your property to go on to Africa, I will say\nnothing save that it first informed me that you were one of the factors\nwhich had to be taken into account in reconstructing this drama--\"\n\n\"I came back--\"\n\n\"I have heard your reasons and regard them as unconvincing and\ninadequate.  We will pass that.  You came down here to ask me whom I\nsuspected.  I refused to answer you. You then went to the vicarage,\nwaited outside it for some time, and finally returned to your cottage.\"\n\n\"How do you know that?\"\n\n\"I followed you.\"\n\n\"I saw no one.\"\n\n\"That is what you may expect to see when I follow you.  You spent a\nrestless night at your cottage, and you formed certain plans, which in\nthe early morning you proceeded to put into execution. Leaving your\ndoor just as day was breaking, you filled your pocket with some reddish\ngravel that was lying heaped beside your gate.\"\n\nSterndale gave a violent start and looked at Holmes in amazement.\n\n\"You then walked swiftly for the mile which separated you from the\nvicarage.  You were wearing, I may remark, the same pair of ribbed\ntennis shoes which are at the present moment upon your feet.  At the\nvicarage you passed through the orchard and the side hedge, coming out\nunder the window of the lodger Tregennis. It was now daylight, but the\nhousehold was not yet stirring.  You drew some of the gravel from your\npocket, and you threw it up at the window above you.\"\n\nSterndale sprang to his feet.\n\n\"I believe that you are the devil himself!\" he cried.\n\nHolmes smiled at the compliment.  \"It took two, or possibly three,\nhandfuls before the lodger came to the window.  You beckoned him to\ncome down.  He dressed hurriedly and descended to his sitting-room.\nYou entered by the window.  There was an interview--a short one--during\nwhich you walked up and down the room.  Then you passed out and closed\nthe window, standing on the lawn outside smoking a cigar and watching\nwhat occurred. Finally, after the death of Tregennis, you withdrew as\nyou had come.  Now, Dr. Sterndale, how do you justify such conduct, and\nwhat were the motives for your actions?  If you prevaricate or trifle\nwith me, I give you my assurance that the matter will pass out of my\nhands forever.\"\n\nOur visitor's face had turned ashen gray as he listened to the words of\nhis accuser.  Now he sat for some time in thought with his face sunk in\nhis hands.  Then with a sudden impulsive gesture he plucked a\nphotograph from his breast-pocket and threw it on the rustic table\nbefore us.\n\n\"That is why I have done it,\" said he.\n\nIt showed the bust and face of a very beautiful woman.  Holmes stooped\nover it.\n\n\"Brenda Tregennis,\" said he.\n\n\"Yes, Brenda Tregennis,\" repeated our visitor.  \"For years I have loved\nher.  For years she has loved me.  There is the secret of that Cornish\nseclusion which people have marvelled at.  It has brought me close to\nthe one thing on earth that was dear to me. I could not marry her, for\nI have a wife who has left me for years and yet whom, by the deplorable\nlaws of England, I could not divorce.  For years Brenda waited.  For\nyears I waited.  And this is what we have waited for.\"  A terrible sob\nshook his great frame, and he clutched his throat under his brindled\nbeard.  Then with an effort he mastered himself and spoke on:\n\n\"The vicar knew.  He was in our confidence.  He would tell you that she\nwas an angel upon earth.  That was why he telegraphed to me and I\nreturned.  What was my baggage or Africa to me when I learned that such\na fate had come upon my darling?  There you have the missing clue to my\naction, Mr. Holmes.\"\n\n\"Proceed,\" said my friend.\n\nDr. Sterndale drew from his pocket a paper packet and laid it upon the\ntable.  On the outside was written \"Radix pedis diaboli\" with a red\npoison label beneath it.  He pushed it towards me.  \"I understand that\nyou are a doctor, sir.  Have you ever heard of this preparation?\"\n\n\"Devil's-foot root!  No, I have never heard of it.\"\n\n\"It is no reflection upon your professional knowledge,\" said he, \"for I\nbelieve that, save for one sample in a laboratory at Buda, there is no\nother specimen in Europe.  It has not yet found its way either into the\npharmacopoeia or into the literature of toxicology.  The root is shaped\nlike a foot, half human, half goatlike; hence the fanciful name given\nby a botanical missionary.  It is used as an ordeal poison by the\nmedicine-men in certain districts of West Africa and is kept as a\nsecret among them.  This particular specimen I obtained under very\nextraordinary circumstances in the Ubangi country.\"  He opened the\npaper as he spoke and disclosed a heap of reddish-brown, snuff-like\npowder.\n\n\"Well, sir?\" asked Holmes sternly.\n\n\"I am about to tell you, Mr. Holmes, all that actually occurred, for\nyou already know so much that it is clearly to my interest that you\nshould know all.  I have already explained the relationship in which I\nstood to the Tregennis family. For the sake of the sister I was\nfriendly with the brothers.  There was a family quarrel about money\nwhich estranged this man Mortimer, but it was supposed to be made up,\nand I afterwards met him as I did the others.  He was a sly, subtle,\nscheming man, and several things arose which gave me a suspicion of\nhim, but I had no cause for any positive quarrel.\n\n\"One day, only a couple of weeks ago, he came down to my cottage and I\nshowed him some of my African curiosities.  Among other things I\nexhibited this powder, and I told him of its strange properties, how it\nstimulates those brain centres which control the emotion of fear, and\nhow either madness or death is the fate of the unhappy native who is\nsubjected to the ordeal by the priest of his tribe.  I told him also\nhow powerless European science would be to detect it.  How he took it I\ncannot say, for I never left the room, but there is no doubt that it\nwas then, while I was opening cabinets and stooping to boxes, that he\nmanaged to abstract some of the devil's-foot root.  I well remember how\nhe plied me with questions as to the amount and the time that was\nneeded for its effect, but I little dreamed that he could have a\npersonal reason for asking.\n\n\"I thought no more of the matter until the vicar's telegram reached me\nat Plymouth.  This villain had thought that I would be at sea before\nthe news could reach me, and that I should be lost for years in Africa.\nBut I returned at once.  Of course, I could not listen to the details\nwithout feeling assured that my poison had been used.  I came round to\nsee you on the chance that some other explanation had suggested itself\nto you.  But there could be none.  I was convinced that Mortimer\nTregennis was the murderer; that for the sake of money, and with the\nidea, perhaps, that if the other members of his family were all insane\nhe would be the sole guardian of their joint property, he had used the\ndevil's-foot powder upon them, driven two of them out of their senses,\nand killed his sister Brenda, the one human being whom I have ever\nloved or who has ever loved me.  There was his crime; what was to be\nhis punishment?\n\n\"Should I appeal to the law?  Where were my proofs?  I knew that the\nfacts were true, but could I help to make a jury of countrymen believe\nso fantastic a story?  I might or I might not. But I could not afford\nto fail.  My soul cried out for revenge. I have said to you once\nbefore, Mr. Holmes, that I have spent much of my life outside the law,\nand that I have come at last to be a law to myself.  So it was even\nnow.  I determined that the fate which he had given to others should be\nshared by himself. Either that or I would do justice upon him with my\nown hand.  In all England there can be no man who sets less value upon\nhis own life than I do at the present moment.\n\n\"Now I have told you all.  You have yourself supplied the rest. I did,\nas you say, after a restless night, set off early from my cottage.  I\nforesaw the difficulty of arousing him, so I gathered some gravel from\nthe pile which you have mentioned, and I used it to throw up to his\nwindow.  He came down and admitted me through the window of the\nsitting-room.  I laid his offence before him. I told him that I had\ncome both as judge and executioner.  The wretch sank into a chair,\nparalyzed at the sight of my revolver. I lit the lamp, put the powder\nabove it, and stood outside the window, ready to carry out my threat to\nshoot him should he try to leave the room.  In five minutes he died.\nMy God! how he died!  But my heart was flint, for he endured nothing\nwhich my innocent darling had not felt before him.  There is my story,\nMr. Holmes.  Perhaps, if you loved a woman, you would have done as much\nyourself.  At any rate, I am in your hands.  You can take what steps\nyou like.  As I have already said, there is no man living who can fear\ndeath less than I do.\"\n\nHolmes sat for some little time in silence.\n\n\"What were your plans?\" he asked at last.\n\n\"I had intended to bury myself in central Africa.  My work there is but\nhalf finished.\"\n\n\"Go and do the other half,\" said Holmes.  \"I, at least, am not prepared\nto prevent you.\"\n\nDr. Sterndale raised his giant figure, bowed gravely, and walked from\nthe arbour.  Holmes lit his pipe and handed me his pouch.\n\n\"Some fumes which are not poisonous would be a welcome change,\" said\nhe.  \"I think you must agree, Watson, that it is not a case in which we\nare called upon to interfere.  Our investigation has been independent,\nand our action shall be so also.  You would not denounce the man?\"\n\n\"Certainly not,\" I answered.\n\n\"I have never loved, Watson, but if I did and if the woman I loved had\nmet such an end, I might act even as our lawless lion-hunter has done.\nWho knows?  Well, Watson, I will not offend your intelligence by\nexplaining what is obvious.  The gravel upon the window-sill was, of\ncourse, the starting-point of my research.  It was unlike anything in\nthe vicarage garden.  Only when my attention had been drawn to Dr.\nSterndale and his cottage did I find its counterpart.  The lamp shining\nin broad daylight and the remains of powder upon the shield were\nsuccessive links in a fairly obvious chain.  And now, my dear Watson, I\nthink we may dismiss the matter from our mind and go back with a clear\nconscience to the study of those Chaldean roots which are surely to be\ntraced in the Cornish branch of the great Celtic speech.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Adventure of the Devil's Foot, by \nArthur Conan Doyle", "answers": ["because of the division of proceeds from selling the family business."], "length": 10015, "dataset": "narrativeqa", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "af8f267654c2ca703d2044593d63c658c8716e66306dd65a"}

It is a story\n    which will make the heart of many readers leap with joy._\n\n    _We have rarely printed a story in this magazine that for scientific\n    interest, as well as suspense, could hold its own with this\n    particular story. We prophesy that this story will become more\n    valuable as the years go by. It certainly holds a number of\n    interesting prophecies, of which no doubt, many will come true. For\n    wealth of science, it will be hard to beat for some time to come. It\n    is one of those rare stories that will bear reading and re-reading\n    many times._\n\n    _This story has impressed us so favorably, that we hope the author\n    may be induced to write a sequel to it soon._\n\n\n\n\nForeword\n\n\nElsewhere I have set down, for whatever interest they have in this, the\n25th Century, my personal recollections of the 20th Century.\n\nNow it occurs to me that my memoirs of the 25th Century may have an\nequal interest 500 years from now--particularly in view of that unique\nperspective from which I have seen the 25th Century, entering it as I\ndid, in one leap across a gap of 492 years.\n\nThis statement requires elucidation. There are still many in the world\nwho are not familiar with my unique experience. Five centuries from now\nthere may be many more, especially if civilization is fated to endure\nany worse convulsions than those which have occurred between 1975 A.D.\nand the present time.\n\nI should state therefore, that I, Anthony Rogers, am, so far as I know,\nthe only man alive whose normal span of eighty-one years of life has\nbeen spread over a period of 573 years. To be precise, I lived the first\ntwenty-nine years of my life between 1898 and 1927; the other fifty-two\nsince 2419. The gap between these two, a period of nearly five hundred\nyears, I spent in a state of suspended animation, free from the ravages\nof katabolic processes, and without any apparent effect on my physical\nor mental faculties.\n\nWhen I began my long sleep, man had just begun his real conquest of the\nair in a sudden series of transoceanic flights in airplanes driven by\ninternal combustion motors. He had barely begun to speculate on the\npossibilities of harnessing sub-atomic forces, and had made no further\npractical penetration into the field of ethereal pulsations than the\nprimitive radio and television of that day. The United States of America\nwas the most powerful nation in the world, its political, financial,\nindustrial and scientific influence being supreme; and in the arts also\nit was rapidly climbing into leadership.\n\nI awoke to find the America I knew a total wreck--to find Americans a\nhunted race in their own land, hiding in the dense forests that covered\nthe shattered and leveled ruins of their once magnificent cities,\ndesperately preserving, and struggling to develop in their secret\nretreats, the remnants of their culture and science--and the undying\nflame of their sturdy independence.\n\nWorld domination was in the hands of Mongolians and the center of world\npower lay in inland China, with Americans one of the few races of\nmankind unsubdued--and it must be admitted in fairness to the truth, not\nworth the trouble of subduing in the eyes of the Han Airlords who ruled\nNorth America as titular tributaries of the Most Magnificent.\n\nFor they needed not the forests in which the Americans lived, nor the\nresources of the vast territories these forests covered. With the\nperfection to which they had reduced the synthetic production of\nnecessities and luxuries, their remarkable development of scientific\nprocesses and mechanical accomplishment of work, they had no economic\nneed for the forests, and no economic desire for the enslaved labor of\nan unruly race.\n\nThey had all they needed for their magnificently luxurious and degraded\nscheme of civilization, within the walls of the fifteen cities of\nsparkling glass they had flung skyward on the sites of ancient American\ncenters, into the bowels of the earth underneath them, and with\nrelatively small surrounding areas of agriculture.\n\nComplete domination of the air rendered communication between these\ncenters a matter of ease and safety. Occasional destructive raids on the\nwaste lands were considered all that was necessary to keep the \"wild\"\nAmericans on the run within the shelter of their forests, and prevent\ntheir becoming a menace to the Han civilization.\n\nBut nearly three hundred years of easily maintained security, the last\ncentury of which had been nearly sterile in scientific, social and\neconomic progress, had softened and devitalized the Hans.\n\nIt had likewise developed, beneath the protecting foliage of the forest,\nthe growth of a vigorous new American civilization, remarkable in the\nmobility and flexibility of its organization, in its conquest of almost\ninsuperable obstacles, in the development and guarding of its industrial\nand scientific resources, all in anticipation of that \"Day of Hope\" to\nwhich it had been looking forward for generations, when it would be\nstrong enough to burst from the green chrysalis of the forests, soar\ninto the upper air lanes and destroy the yellow incubus.\n\nAt the time I awoke, the \"Day of Hope\" was almost at hand. I shall not\nattempt to set forth a detailed history of the Second War of\nIndependence, for that has been recorded already by better historians\nthan I am. Instead I shall confine myself largely to the part I was\nfortunate enough to play in this struggle and in the events leading up\nto it.\n\n[Illustration: Seen upon the ultroscope viewplate, the battle looked as\nthough it were being fought in daylight, perhaps on a cloudy day, while\nthe explosions of the rockets appeared as flashes of extra brilliance.]\n\nIt all resulted from my interest in radioactive gases. During the latter\npart of 1927 my company, the American Radioactive Gas Corporation, had\nbeen keeping me busy investigating reports of unusual phenomena observed\nin certain abandoned coal mines near the Wyoming Valley, in\nPennsylvania.\n\nWith two assistants and a complete equipment of scientific instruments,\nI began the exploration of a deserted working in a mountainous district,\nwhere several weeks before, a number of mining engineers had reported\ntraces of carnotite[1] and what they believed to be radioactive gases.\nTheir report was not without foundation, it was apparent from the\noutset, for in our examination of the upper levels of the mine, our\ninstruments indicated a vigorous radioactivity.\n\n    [1] A hydrovanadate of uranium, and other metals; used as a source\n    of radium compounds.\n\nOn the morning of December 15th, we descended to one of the lowest\nlevels. To our surprise, we found no water there. Obviously it had\ndrained off through some break in the strata. We noticed too that the\nrock in the side walls of the shaft was soft, evidently due to the\nradioactivity, and pieces crumbled under foot rather easily. We made our\nway cautiously down the shaft, when suddenly the rotted timbers above us\ngave way.\n\nI jumped ahead, barely escaping the avalanche of coal and soft rock, but\nmy companions, who were several paces behind me, were buried under it,\nand undoubtedly met instant death.\n\nI was trapped. Return was impossible. With my electric torch I explored\nthe shaft to its end, but could find no other way out. The air became\nincreasingly difficult to breathe, probably from the rapid accumulation\nof the radioactive gas. In a little while my senses reeled and I lost\nconsciousness.\n\nWhen I awoke, there was a cool and refreshing circulation of air in the\nshaft. I had no thought that I had been unconscious more than a few\nhours, although it seems that the radioactive gas had kept me in a state\nof suspended animation for something like 500 years. My awakening, I\nfigured out later, had been due to some shifting of the strata which\nreopened the shaft and cleared the atmosphere in the working. This must\nhave been the case, for I was able to struggle back up the shaft over a\npile of debris, and stagger up the long incline to the mouth of the\nmine, where an entirely different world, overgrown with a vast forest\nand no visible sign of human habitation, met my eyes.\n\nI shall pass over the days of mental agony that followed in my attempt\nto grasp the meaning of it all. There were times when I felt that I was\non the verge of insanity. I roamed the unfamiliar forest like a lost\nsoul. Had it not been for the necessity of improvising traps and crude\nclubs with which to slay my food, I believe I should have gone mad.\n\nSuffice it to say, however, that I survived this psychic crisis. I shall\nbegin my narrative proper with my first contact with Americans of the\nyear 2419 A.D.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nFloating Men\n\n\nMy first glimpse of a human being of the 25th Century was obtained\nthrough a portion of woodland where the trees were thinly scattered,\nwith a dense forest beyond.\n\nI had been wandering along aimlessly, and hopelessly, musing over my\nstrange fate, when I noticed a figure that cautiously backed out of the\ndense growth across the glade. I was about to call out joyfully, but\nthere was something furtive about the figure that prevented me. The\nboy's attention (for it seemed to be a lad of fifteen or sixteen) was\ncentered tensely on the heavy growth of trees from which he had just\nemerged.\n\nHe was clad in rather tight-fitting garments entirely of green, and wore\na helmet-like cap of the same color. High around his waist he wore a\nbroad, thick belt, which bulked up in the back across the shoulders,\ninto something of the proportions of a knapsack.\n\nAs I was taking in these details, there came a vivid flash and heavy\ndetonation, like that of a hand grenade, not far to the left of him. He\nthrew up an arm and staggered a bit in a queer, gliding way; then he\nrecovered himself and slipped cautiously away from the place of the\nexplosion, crouching slightly, and still facing the denser part of the\nforest. Every few steps he would raise his arm, and point into the\nforest with something he held in his hand. Wherever he pointed there was\na terrific explosion, deeper in among the trees. It came to me then that\nhe was shooting with some form of pistol, though there was neither flash\nnor detonation from the muzzle of the weapon itself.\n\nAfter firing several times, he seemed to come to a sudden resolution,\nand turning in my general direction, leaped--to my amazement sailing\nthrough the air between the sparsely scattered trees in such a jump as I\nhad never in my life seen before. That leap must have carried him a full\nfifty feet, although at the height of his arc, he was not more than ten\nor twelve feet from the ground.\n\nWhen he alighted, his foot caught in a projecting root, and he sprawled\ngently forward. I say \"gently\" for he did not crash down as I expected\nhim to do. The only thing I could compare it with was a slow-motion\ncinema, although I had never seen one in which horizontal motions were\nregistered at normal speed and only the vertical movements were slowed\ndown.\n\nDue to my surprise, I suppose my brain did not function with its normal\nquickness, for I gazed at the prone figure for several seconds before I\nsaw the blood that oozed out from under the tight green cap. Regaining\nmy power of action, I dragged him out of sight back of the big tree. For\na few moments I busied myself in an attempt to staunch the flow of\nblood. The wound was not a deep one. My companion was more dazed than\nhurt. But what of the pursuers?\n\nI took the weapon from his grasp and examined it hurriedly. It was not\nunlike the automatic pistol to which I was accustomed, except that it\napparently fired with a button instead of a trigger. I inserted several\nfresh rounds of ammunition into its magazine from my companion's belt,\nas rapidly as I could, for I soon heard, near us, the suppressed\nconversation of his pursuers.\n\nThere followed a series of explosions round about us, but none very\nclose. They evidently had not spotted our hiding place, and were firing\nat random.\n\nI waited tensely, balancing the gun in my hand, to accustom myself to\nits weight and probable throw.\n\nThen I saw a movement in the green foliage of a tree not far away, and\nthe head and face of a man appeared. Like my companion, he was clad\nentirely in green, which made his figure difficult to distinguish. But\nhis face could be seen clearly. It was an evil face, and had murder in\nit.\n\nThat decided me. I raised the gun and fired. My aim was bad, for there\nwas no kick in the gun, as I had expected, and I hit the trunk of the\ntree several feet below him. It blew him from his perch like a crumpled\nbit of paper, and he _floated_ down to the ground, like some limp, dead\nthing, gently lowered by an invisible hand. The tree, its trunk blown\napart by the explosion, crashed down.\n\nThere followed another series of explosions around us. These guns we\nwere using made no sound in the firing, and my opponents were evidently\nas much at sea as to my position as I was to theirs. So I made no\nattempt to reply to their fire, contenting myself with keeping a sharp\nlookout in their general direction. And patience had its reward.\n\nVery soon I saw a cautious movement in the top of another tree. Exposing\nmyself as little as possible, I aimed carefully at the tree trunk and\nfired again. A shriek followed the explosion. I heard the tree crash\ndown; then a groan.\n\nThere was silence for a while. Then I heard a faint sound of boughs\nswishing. I shot three times in its direction, pressing the button as\nrapidly as I could. Branches crashed down where my shells had exploded,\nbut there was no body.\n\nThen I saw one of them. He was starting one of those amazing leaps from\nthe bough of one tree to another, about forty feet away.\n\nI threw up my gun impulsively and fired. By now I had gotten the feel of\nthe weapon, and my aim was good. I hit him. The \"bullet\" must have\npenetrated his body and exploded. For one moment I saw him flying\nthrough the air. Then the explosion, and he had vanished. He never\nfinished his leap. It was annihilation.\n\nHow many more of them there were I don't know. But this must have been\ntoo much for them. They used a final round of shells on us, all of which\nexploded harmlessly, and shortly after I heard them swishing and\ncrashing away from us through the tree tops. Not one of them descended\nto earth.\n\nNow I had time to give some attention to my companion. She was, I found,\na girl, and not a boy. Despite her bulky appearance, due to the peculiar\nbelt strapped around her body high up under the arms, she was very\nslender, and very pretty.\n\nThere was a stream not far away, from which I brought water and bathed\nher face and wound.\n\nApparently the mystery of these long leaps, the monkey-like ability to\njump from bough to bough, and of the bodies that floated gently down\ninstead of falling, lay in the belt. The thing was some sort of\nanti-gravity belt that almost balanced the weight of the wearer, thereby\ntremendously multiplying the propulsive power of the leg muscles, and\nthe lifting power of the arms.\n\nWhen the girl came to, she regarded me as curiously as I did her, and\npromptly began to quiz me. Her accent and intonation puzzled me a lot,\nbut nevertheless we were able to understand each other fairly well,\nexcept for certain words and phrases. I explained what had happened\nwhile she lay unconscious, and she thanked me simply for saving her\nlife.\n\n\"You are a strange exchange,\" she said, eying my clothing quizzically.\nEvidently she found it mirth provoking by contrast with her own neatly\nefficient garb. \"Don't you understand what I mean by 'exchange?' I mean\nah--let me see--a stranger, somebody from some other gang. What gang do\nyou belong to?\" (She pronounced it \"gan,\" with only a suspicion of a\nnasal sound.)\n\nI laughed. \"I'm not a gangster,\" I said. But she evidently did not\nunderstand this word. \"I don't belong to any gang,\" I explained, \"and\nnever did. Does everybody belong to a gang nowadays?\"\n\n\"Naturally,\" she said, frowning. \"If you don't belong to a gang, where\nand how do you live? Why have you not found and joined a gang? How do\nyou eat? Where do you get your clothing?\"\n\n\"I've been eating wild game for the past two weeks,\" I explained, \"and\nthis clothing I--er--ah--.\" I paused, wondering how I could explain that\nit must be many hundred years old.\n\nIn the end I saw I would have to tell my story as well as I could,\npiecing it together with my assumptions as to what had happened. She\nlistened patiently; incredulously at first, but with more confidence as\nI went on. When I had finished, she sat thinking for a long time.\n\n\"That's hard to believe,\" she said, \"but I believe it.\" She looked me\nover with frank interest.\n\n\"Were you married when you slipped into unconsciousness down in that\nmine?\" she asked me suddenly. I assured her I had never married. \"Well,\nthat simplifies matters,\" she continued. \"You see, if you were\ntechnically classed as a family man, I could take you back only as an\ninvited exchange and I, being unmarried, and no relation of yours,\ncouldn't do the inviting.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nThe Forest Gangs\n\n\nShe gave me a brief outline of the very peculiar social and economic\nsystem under which her people lived. At least it seemed very peculiar\nfrom my 20th Century viewpoint.\n\nI learned with amazement that exactly 492 years had passed over my head\nas I lay unconscious in the mine.\n\nWilma, for that was her name, did not profess to be a historian, and so\ncould give me only a sketchy outline of the wars that had been fought,\nand the manner in which such radical changes had come about. It seemed\nthat another war had followed the First World War, in which nearly all\nthe European nations had banded together to break the financial and\nindustrial power of America. They succeeded in their purpose, though\nthey were beaten, for the war was a terrific one, and left America, like\nthemselves, gasping, bleeding and disorganized, with only the hollow\nshell of a victory.\n\nThis opportunity had been seized by the Russian Soviets, who had made a\ncoalition with the Chinese, to sweep over all Europe and reduce it to a\nstate of chaos.\n\nAmerica, industrially geared to world production and the world trade,\ncollapsed economically, and there ensued a long period of stagnation and\ndesperate attempts at economic reconstruction. But it was impossible to\nstave off war with the Mongolians, who by now had subjugated the\nRussians, and were aiming at a world empire.\n\nIn about 2109, it seems, the conflict was finally precipitated. The\nMongolians, with overwhelming fleets of great airships, and a science\nthat far outstripped that of crippled America, swept in over the Pacific\nand Atlantic Coasts, and down from Canada, annihilating American\naircraft, armies and cities with their terrific _disintegrator_ rays.\nThese rays were projected from a machine not unlike a searchlight in\nappearance, the reflector of which, however, was not material substance,\nbut a complicated balance of interacting electronic forces. This\nresulted in a terribly destructive beam. Under its influence, material\nsubstance melted into \"nothingness\"; i. e., into electronic vibrations.\nIt destroyed all then known substances, from air to the most dense\nmetals and stone.\n\nThey settled down to the establishment of what became known as the Han\ndynasty in America, as a sort of province in their World Empire.\n\nThose were terrible days for the Americans. They were hunted like wild\nbeasts. Only those survived who finally found refuge in mountains,\ncanyons and forests. Government was at an end among them. Anarchy\nprevailed for several generations. Most would have been eager to submit\nto the Hans, even if it meant slavery. But the Hans did not want them,\nfor they themselves had marvelous machinery and scientific process by\nwhich all difficult labor was accomplished.\n\nUltimately they stopped their active search for, and annihilation of,\nthe widely scattered groups of now savage Americans. So long as they\nremained hidden in their forests, and did not venture near the great\ncities the Hans had built, little attention was paid to them.\n\nThen began the building of the new American civilization. Families and\nindividuals gathered together in clans or \"gangs\" for mutual protection.\nFor nearly a century they lived a nomadic and primitive life, moving\nfrom place to place, in desperate fear of the casual and occasional Han\nair raids, and the terrible disintegrator ray. As the frequency of these\nraids decreased, they began to stay permanently in given localities,\norganizing upon lines which in many respects were similar to those of\nthe military households of the Norman feudal barons, except that instead\nof gathering together in castles, their defense tactics necessitated a\ncertain scattering of living quarters for families and individuals. They\nlived virtually in the open air, in the forests, in green tents,\nresorting to camouflage tactics that would conceal their presence from\nair observers. They dug underground factories and laboratories, that\nthey might better be shielded from the electrical detectors of the\nHans. They tapped the radio communication lines of the Hans, with crude\ninstruments at first; better ones later on. They bent every effort\ntoward the redevelopment of science. For many generations they labored\nas unseen, unknown scholars of the Hans, picking up their knowledge\npiecemeal, as fast as they were able to.\n\nDuring the earlier part of this period, there were many deadly wars\nfought between the various gangs, and occasional courageous but\nchildishly futile attacks upon the Hans, followed by terribly punitive\nraids.\n\nBut as knowledge progressed, the sense of American brotherhood\nredeveloped. Reciprocal arrangements were made among the gangs over\nconstantly increasing areas. Trade developed to a certain extent, as\nbetween one gang and another. But the interchange of knowledge became\nmore important than that of goods, as skill in the handling of synthetic\nprocesses developed.\n\nWithin the gang, an economy was developed that was a compromise between\nindividual liberty and a military socialism. The right of private\nproperty was limited practically to personal possessions, but private\nprivileges were many, and sacredly regarded. Stimulation to achievement\nlay chiefly in the winning of various kinds of leadership and\nprerogatives, and only in a very limited degree in the hope of owning\nanything that might be classified as \"wealth,\" and nothing that might be\nclassified as \"resources.\" Resources of every description, for military\nsafety and efficiency, belonged as a matter of public interest to the\ncommunity as a whole.\n\nIn the meantime, through these many generations, the Hans had developed\na luxury economy, and with it the perfection of gilded vice and\ndegradation. The Americans were regarded as \"wild men of the woods.\" And\nsince they neither needed nor wanted the woods or the wild men, they\ntreated them as beasts, and were conscious of no human brotherhood with\nthem. As time went on, and synthetic processes of producing foods and\nmaterials were further developed, less and less ground was needed by the\nHans for the purposes of agriculture, and finally, even the working of\nmines was abandoned when it became cheaper to build up metal from\nelectronic vibrations than to dig them out of the ground.\n\nThe Han race, devitalized by its vices and luxuries, with machinery and\nscientific processes to satisfy its every want, with virtually no\nnecessity of labor, began to assume a defensive attitude toward the\nAmericans.\n\nAnd quite naturally, the Americans regarded the Hans with a deep, grim\nhatred. Conscious of individual superiority as men, knowing that\nlatterly they were outstripping the Hans in science and civilization,\nthey longed desperately for the day when they should be powerful enough\nto rise and annihilate the Yellow Blight that lay over the continent.\n\nAt the time of my awakening, the gangs were rather loosely organized,\nbut were considering the establishment of a special military force,\nwhose special business it would be to harry the Hans and bring down\ntheir air ships whenever possible without causing general alarm among\nthe Mongolians. This force was destined to become the nucleus of the\nnational force, when the Day of Retribution arrived. But that, however,\ndid not happen for ten years, and is another story.\n\n[Illustration: On the left of the illustration is a Han girl, and on the\nright is an American girl, who, like all of her race, is equipped with\nan inertron belt and a rocket gun.]\n\nWilma told me she was a member of the Wyoming Gang, which claimed the\nentire Wyoming Valley as its territory, under the leadership of Boss\nHart. Her mother and father were dead, and she was unmarried, so she was\nnot a \"family member.\" She lived in a little group of tents known as\nCamp 17, under a woman Camp Boss, with seven other girls.\n\nHer duties alternated between military or police scouting and factory\nwork. For the two-week period which would end the next day, she had been\non \"air patrol.\" This did not mean, as I first imagined, that she was\nflying, but rather that she was on the lookout for Han ships over this\noutlying section of the Wyoming territory, and had spent most of her\ntime perched in the tree tops scanning the skies. Had she seen one she\nwould have fired a \"drop flare\" several miles off to one side, which\nwould ignite when it was floating vertically toward the earth, so that\nthe direction or point from which it had been fired might not be guessed\nby the airship and bring a blasting play of the disintegrator ray in her\nvicinity. Other members of the air patrol would send up rockets on\nseeing hers, until finally a scout equipped with an ultrophone, which,\nunlike the ancient radio, operated on the ultronic ethereal vibrations,\nwould pass the warning simultaneously to the headquarters of the Wyoming\nGang and other communities within a radius of several hundred miles, not\nto mention the few American rocket ships that might be in the air, and\nwhich instantly would duck to cover either through forest clearings or\nby flattening down to earth in green fields where their coloring would\nprobably protect them from observation. The favorite American method of\npropulsion was known as \"_rocketing_.\" The _rocket_ is what I would\ndescribe, from my 20th Century comprehension of the matter, as an\nextremely powerful gas blast, atomically produced through the\nstimulation of chemical action. Scientists of today regard it as a\nchildishly simple reaction, but by that very virtue, most economical and\nefficient.\n\nBut tomorrow, she explained, she would go back to work in the cloth\nplant, where she would take charge of one of the synthetic processes by\nwhich those wonderful substitutes for woven fabrics of wool, cotton and\nsilk are produced. At the end of another two weeks, she would be back on\nmilitary duty again, perhaps at the same work, or maybe as a \"contact\nguard,\" on duty where the territory of the Wyomings merged with that of\nthe Delawares, or the \"Susquannas\" (Susquehannas) or one of the half\ndozen other \"gangs\" in that section of the country which I knew as\nPennsylvania and New York States.\n\nWilma cleared up for me the mystery of those flying leaps which she and\nher assailants had made, and explained in the following manner, how the\ninertron belt balances weight:\n\n\"_Jumpers_\" were in common use at the time I \"awoke,\" though they were\ncostly, for at that time _inertron_ had not been produced in very great\nquantity. They were very useful in the forest. They were belts,\nstrapped high under the arms, containing an amount of inertron adjusted\nto the wearer's weight and purposes. In effect they made a man weigh as\nlittle as he desired; two pounds if he liked.\n\n\"_Floaters_\" are a later development of \"_jumpers_\"--rocket motors\nencased in _inertron_ blocks and strapped to the back in such a way that\nthe wearer floats, when drifting, facing slightly downward. With his\nmotor in operation, he moves like a diver, headforemost, controlling his\ndirection by twisting his body and by movements of his outstretched arms\nand hands. Ballast weights locked in the front of the belt adjust weight\nand lift. Some men prefer a few ounces of weight in floating, using a\nslight motor thrust to overcome this. Others prefer a buoyance balance\nof a few ounces. The inadvertent dropping of weight is not a serious\nmatter. The motor thrust always can be used to descend. But as an extra\nprecaution, in case the motor should fail, for any reason, there are\nbuilt into every belt a number of detachable sections, one or more of\nwhich can be discarded to balance off any loss in weight.\n\n\"But who were your assailants,\" I asked, \"and why were you attacked?\"\n\nHer assailants, she told me, were members of an outlaw gang, referred to\nas \"Bad Bloods,\" a group which for several generations had been under\nthe domination of conscienceless leaders who tried to advance the\ninterests of their clan by tactics which their neighbors had come to\nregard as unfair, and who in consequence had been virtually boycotted.\nTheir purpose had been to slay her near the Delaware frontier, making it\nappear that the crime had been committed by Delaware scouts and thus\nembroil the Delawares and Wyomings in acts of reprisal against each\nother, or at least cause suspicions.\n\nFortunately they had not succeeded in surprising her, and she had been\nsuccessful in dodging them for some two hours before the shooting began,\nat the moment when I arrived on the scene.\n\n\"But we must not stay here talking,\" Wilma concluded. \"I have to take\nyou in, and besides I must report this attack right away. I think we had\nbetter slip over to the other side of the mountain. Whoever is on that\npost will have a phone, and I can make a direct report. But you'll have\nto have a belt. Mine alone won't help much against our combined weights,\nand there's little to be gained by jumping heavy. It's almost as bad as\nwalking.\"\n\nAfter a little search, we found one of the men I had killed, who had\nfloated down among the trees some distance away and whose belt was not\nbadly damaged. In detaching it from his body, it nearly got away from me\nand shot up in the air. Wilma caught it, however, and though it\nreinforced the lift of her own belt so that she had to hook her knee\naround a branch to hold herself down, she saved it. I climbed the tree\nand, with my weight added to hers, we floated down easily.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nLife in the 25th Century\n\n\nWe were delayed in starting for quite a while since I had to acquire a\nfew crude ideas about the technique of using these belts. I had been\nsitting down, for instance, with the belt strapped about me, enjoying an\nease similar to that of a comfortable armchair; when I stood up with a\nnatural exertion of muscular effort, I shot ten feet into the air, with\na wild instinctive thrashing of arms and legs that amused Wilma greatly.\n\nBut after some practice, I began to get the trick of gauging muscular\neffort to a minimum of vertical and a maximum of horizontal. The correct\nform, I found, was in a measure comparable to that of skating. I found,\nalso, that in forest work particularly the arms and hands could be used\nto great advantage in swinging along from branch to branch, so\nprolonging leaps almost indefinitely at times.\n\nIn going up the side of the mountain, I found that my 20th Century\nmuscles did have an advantage, in spite of lack of skill with the belt,\nand since the slopes were very sharp, and most of our leaps were upward,\nI could have distanced Wilma easily. But when we crossed the ridge and\ndescended, she outstripped me with her superior technique. Choosing the\nsteepest slopes, she would crouch in the top of a tree, and propel\nherself outward, literally diving until, with the loss of horizontal\nmomentum, she would assume a more upright position and float downward.\nIn this manner she would sometimes cover as much as a quarter of a mile\nin a single leap, while I leaped and scrambled clumsily behind,\nthoroughly enjoying the novel sensation.\n\nHalf way down the mountain, we saw another green-clad figure leap out\nabove the tree tops toward us. The three of us perched on an outcropping\nof rock from which a view for many miles around could be had, while\nWilma hastily explained her adventure and my presence to her fellow\nguard; whose name was Alan. I learned later that this was the modern\nform of Helen.\n\n\"You want to report by phone then, don't you?\" Alan took a compact\npacket about six inches square from a holster attached to her belt and\nhanded it to Wilma.\n\nSo far as I could see, it had no special receiver for the ear. Wilma\nmerely threw back a lid, as though she were opening a book, and began to\ntalk. The voice that came back from the machine was as audible as her\nown.\n\nShe was queried closely as to the attack upon her, and at considerable\nlength as to myself, and I could tell from the tone of that voice that\nits owner was not prepared to take me at my face value as readily as\nWilma had. For that matter, neither was the other girl. I could realize\nit from the suspicious glances she threw my way, when she thought my\nattention was elsewhere, and the manner in which her hand hovered\nconstantly near her gun holster.\n\nWilma was ordered to bring me in at once, and informed that another\nscout would take her place on the other side of the mountain. So she\nclosed down the lid of the phone and handed it back to Alan, who seemed\nrelieved to see us departing over the tree tops in the direction of the\ncamps.\n\nWe had covered perhaps ten miles, in what still seemed to me a\nsurprisingly easy fashion, when Wilma explained, that from here on we\nwould have to keep to the ground. We were nearing the camps, she said,\nand there was always the possibility that some small Han scoutship,\ninvisible high in the sky, might catch sight of us through a\nprojectoscope and thus find the general location of the camps.\n\nWilma took me to the Scout office, which proved to be a small building\nof irregular shape, conforming to the trees around it, and substantially\nconstructed of green sheet-like material.\n\nI was received by the assistant Scout Boss, who reported my arrival at\nonce to the historical office, and to officials he called the Psycho\nBoss and the History Boss, who came in a few minutes later. The attitude\nof all three men was at first polite but skeptical, and Wilma's ardent\nadvocacy seemed to amuse them secretly.\n\nFor the next two hours I talked, explained and answered questions. I had\nto explain, in detail, the manner of my life in the 20th Century and my\nunderstanding of customs, habits, business, science and the history of\nthat period, and about developments in the centuries that had elapsed.\nHad I been in a classroom, I would have come through the examination\nwith a very poor mark, for I was unable to give any answer to fully half\nof their questions. But before long I realized that the majority of\nthese questions were designed as traps. Objects, of whose purpose I knew\nnothing, were casually handed to me, and I was watched keenly as I\nhandled them.\n\nIn the end I could see both amazement and belief begin to show in the\nfaces of my inquisitors, and at last the Historical and Psycho Bosses\nagreed openly that they could find no flaw in my story or reactions, and\nthat unbelievable as it seemed, my story must be accepted as genuine.\n\nThey took me at once to Big Boss Hart. He was a portly man with a \"poker\nface.\" He would probably have been the successful politician even in the\n20th Century.\n\nThey gave him a brief outline of my story and a report of their\nexamination of me. He made no comment other than to nod his acceptance\nof it. Then he turned to me.\n\n\"How does it feel?\" he asked. \"Do we look funny to you?\"\n\n\"A bit strange,\" I admitted. \"But I'm beginning to lose that dazed\nfeeling, though I can see I have an awful lot to learn.\"\n\n\"Maybe we can learn some things from you, too,\" he said. \"So you fought\nin the First World War. Do you know, we have very little left in the way\nof records of the details of that war, that is, the precise conditions\nunder which it was fought, and the tactics employed. We forgot many\nthings during the Han terror, and--well, I think you might have a lot of\nideas worth thinking over for our raid masters. By the way, now that\nyou're here, and can't go back to your own century, so to speak, what do\nyou want to do? You're welcome to become one of us. Or perhaps you'd\njust like to visit with us for a while, and then look around among the\nother gangs. Maybe you'd like some of the others better. Don't make up\nyour mind now. We'll put you down as an exchange for a while. Let's see.\nYou and Bill Hearn ought to get along well together. He's Camp Boss of\nNumber 34 when he isn't acting as Raid Boss or Scout Boss. There's a\nvacancy in his camp. Stay with him and think things over as long as you\nwant to. As soon as you make up your mind to anything, let me know.\"\n\nWe all shook hands, for that was one custom that had not died out in\nfive hundred years, and I set out with Bill Hearn.\n\nBill, like all the others, was clad in green. He was a big man. That is,\nhe was about my own height, five feet eleven. This was considerably\nabove the average now, for the race had lost something in stature, it\nseemed, through the vicissitudes of five centuries. Most of the women\nwere a bit below five feet, and the men only a trifle above this height.\n\nFor a period of two weeks Bill was to confine himself to camp duties, so\nI had a good chance to familiarize myself with the community life. It\nwas not easy. There were so many marvels to absorb. I never ceased to\nwonder at the strange combination of rustic social life and feverish\nindustrial activity. At least, it was strange to me. For in my\nexperience, industrial development meant crowded cities, tenements,\npaved streets, profusion of vehicles, noise, hurrying men and women with\nstrained or dull faces, vast structures and ornate public works.\n\nHere, however, was rustic simplicity, apparently isolated families and\ngroups, living in the heart of the forest, with a quarter of a mile or\nmore between households, a total absence of crowds, no means of\nconveyance other than the belts called jumpers, almost constantly worn\nby everybody, and an occasional rocket ship, used only for longer\njourneys, and underground plants or factories that were to my mind more\nlike laboratories and engine rooms; many of them were excavations as\ndeep as mines, with well finished, lighted and comfortable interiors.\nThese people were adepts at camouflage against air observation. Not only\nwould their activity have been unsuspected by an airship passing over\nthe center of the community, but even by an enemy who might happen to\ndrop through the screen of the upper branches to the floor of the\nforest. The camps, or household structures, were all irregular in shape\nand of colors that blended with the great trees among which they were\nhidden.\n\nThere were 724 dwellings or \"camps\" among the Wyomings, located within\nan area of about fifteen square miles. The total population was 8,688,\nevery man, woman and child, whether member or \"exchange,\" being listed.\n\nThe plants were widely scattered through the territory also. Nowhere was\nanything like congestion permitted. So far as possible, families and\nindividuals were assigned to living quarters, not too far from the\nplants or offices in which their work lay.\n\nAll able-bodied men and women alternated in two-week periods between\nmilitary and industrial service, except those who were needed for\nhousehold work. Since working conditions in the plants and offices were\nideal, and everybody thus had plenty of healthy outdoor activity in\naddition, the population was sturdy and active. Laziness was regarded as\nnearly the greatest of social offenses. Hard work and general merit were\nvariously rewarded with extra privileges, advancement to positions of\nauthority, and with various items of personal equipment for convenience\nand luxury.\n\nIn leisure moments, I got great enjoyment from sitting outside the\ndwelling in which I was quartered with Bill Hearn and ten other men,\nwatching the occasional passers-by, as with leisurely, but swift\nmovements, they swung up and down the forest trail, rising from the\nground in long almost-horizontal leaps, occasionally swinging from one\nconvenient branch overhead to another before \"sliding\" back to the\nground farther on. Normal traveling pace, where these trails were\nstraight enough, was about twenty miles an hour. Such things as\nautomobiles and railroad trains (the memory of them not more than a\nmonth old in my mind) seemed inexpressibly silly and futile compared\nwith such convenience as these belts or jumpers offered.\n\nBill suggested that I wander around for several days, from plant to\nplant, to observe and study what I could. The entire community had been\napprised of my coming, my rating as an \"exchange\" reaching every\nbuilding and post in the community, by means of ultronic broadcast.\nEverywhere I was welcomed in an interested and helpful spirit.\n\nI visited the plants where ultronic vibrations were isolated from the\nether and through slow processes built up into sub-electronic,\nelectronic and atomic forms into the two great synthetic elements,\nultron and inertron. I learned something, superficially at least, of the\nprocesses of combined chemical and mechanical action through which were\nproduced the various forms of synthetic cloth. I watched the manufacture\nof the machines which were used at locations of construction to produce\nthe various forms of building materials. But I was particularly\ninterested in the munitions plants and the rocket-ship shops.\n\nUltron is a solid of great molecular density and moderate elasticity,\nwhich has the property of being 100 percent conductive to those\npulsations known as light, electricity and heat. Since it is completely\npermeable to light vibrations, it is therefore _absolutely invisible and\nnon-reflective_. Its magnetic response is almost, but not quite, 100\npercent also. It is therefore very heavy under normal conditions but\nextremely responsive to the _repellor_ or anti-gravity rays, such as the\nHans use as \"_legs_\" for their airships.\n\nInertron is the second great triumph of American research and\nexperimentation with ultronic forces. It was developed just a few years\nbefore my awakening in the abandoned mine. It is a synthetic element,\nbuilt up, through a complicated heterodyning of ultronic pulsations,\nfrom \"infra-balanced\" sub-ionic forms. It is completely inert to both\nelectric and magnetic forces in all the orders above the _ultronic_;\nthat is to say, the _sub-electronic_, the _electronic_, the _atomic_ and\nthe _molecular_. In consequence it has a number of amazing and\nvaluable properties. One of these is _the total lack of weight_. Another\nis a total lack of heat. It has no molecular vibration whatever. It\nreflects 100 percent of the heat and light impinging upon it. It does\nnot feel cold to the touch, of course, since it will not absorb the heat\nof the hand. It is a solid, very dense in molecular structure despite\nits lack of weight, of great strength and considerable elasticity. It is\na perfect shield against the disintegrator rays.\n\n[Illustration: Setting his rocket gun for a long-distance shot.]\n\nRocket guns are very simple contrivances so far as the mechanism of\nlaunching the bullet is concerned. They are simple light tubes, closed\nat the rear end, with a trigger-actuated pin for piercing the thin skin\nat the base of the cartridge. This piercing of the skin starts the\nchemical and atomic reaction. The entire cartridge leaves the tube under\nits own power, at a very easy initial velocity, just enough to insure\naccuracy of aim; so the tube does not have to be of heavy construction.\nThe bullet increases in velocity as it goes. It may be solid or\nexplosive. It may explode on contact or on time, or a combination of\nthese two.\n\nBill and I talked mostly of weapons, military tactics and strategy.\nStrangely enough he had no idea whatever of the possibilities of the\nbarrage, though the tremendous effect of a \"curtain of fire\" with such\nhigh-explosive projectiles as these modern rocket guns used was obvious\nto me. But the barrage idea, it seemed, has been lost track of\ncompletely in the air wars that followed the First World War, and in the\npeculiar guerilla tactics developed by Americans in the later period of\noperations from the ground against Han airships, and in the gang wars\nwhich, until a few generations ago I learned, had been almost\ncontinuous.\n\n\"I wonder,\" said Bill one day, \"if we couldn't work up some form of\nbarrage to spring on the Bad Bloods. The Big Boss told me today that\nhe's been in communication with the other gangs, and all are agreed that\nthe Bad Bloods might as well be wiped out for good. That attempt on\nWilma Deering's life and their evident desire to make trouble among the\ngangs, has stirred up every community east of the Alleghenies. The Boss\nsays that none of the others will object if we go after them. So I\nimagine that before long we will. Now show me again how you worked that\nbusiness in the Argonne forest. The conditions ought to be pretty much\nthe same.\"\n\nI went over it with him in detail, and gradually we worked out a\nmodified plan that would be better adapted to our more powerful weapons,\nand the use of jumpers.\n\n\"It will be easy,\" Bill exulted. \"I'll slide down and talk it over with\nthe Boss tomorrow.\"\n\nDuring the first two weeks of my stay with the Wyomings, Wilma Deering\nand I saw a great deal of each other. I naturally felt a little closer\nfriendship for her, in view of the fact that she was the first human\nbeing I saw after waking from my long sleep; her appreciation of my\nsaving her life, though I could not have done otherwise than I did in\nthat matter, and most of all my own appreciation of the fact that she\nhad not found it as difficult as the others to believe my story,\noperated in the same direction. I could easily imagine my story must\nhave sounded incredible.\n\nIt was natural enough too, that she should feel an unusual interest in\nme. In the first place, I was her personal discovery. In the second, she\nwas a girl of studious and reflective turn of mind. She never got tired\nof my stories and descriptions of the 20th Century.\n\nThe others of the community, however, seemed to find our friendship a\nbit amusing. It seemed that Wilma had a reputation for being cold toward\nthe opposite sex, and so others, not being able to appreciate some of\nher fine qualities as I did, misinterpreted her attitude, much to their\nown delight. Wilma and I, however, ignored this as much as we could.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nA Han Air Raid\n\n\nThere was a girl in Wilma's camp named Gerdi Mann, with whom Bill Hearn\nwas desperately in love, and the four of us used to go around a lot\ntogether. Gerdi was a distinct type. Whereas Wilma had the usual dark\nbrown hair and hazel eyes that marked nearly every member of the\ncommunity, Gerdi had red hair, blue eyes and very fair skin. She has\nbeen dead many years now, but I remember her vividly because she was a\nthrowback in physical appearance to a certain 20th Century type which I\nhave found very rare among modern Americans; also because the four of us\nwere engaged one day in a discussion of this very point, when I obtained\nmy first experience of a Han air raid.\n\nWe were sitting high on the side of a hill overlooking the valley that\nteemed with human activity, invisible beneath its blanket of foliage.\n\nThe other three, who knew of the Irish but vaguely and indefinitely, as\na race on the other side of the globe, which, like ourselves, had\nsucceeded in maintaining a precarious and fugitive existence in\nrebellion against the Mongolian domination of the earth, were listening\nwith interest to my theory that Gerdi's ancestors of several hundred\nyears ago must have been Irish. I explained that Gerdi was an Irish\ntype, evidently a throwback, and that her surname might well have been\nMcMann, or McMahan, and still more anciently \"mac Mathghamhain.\" They\nwere interested too in my surmise that \"Gerdi\" was the same name as that\nwhich had been \"Gerty\" or \"Gertrude\" in the 20th Century.\n\nIn the middle of our discussion, we were startled by an alarm rocket\nthat burst high in the air, far to the north, spreading a pall of red\nsmoke that drifted like a cloud. It was followed by others at scattered\npoints in the northern sky.\n\n\"A Han raid!\" Bill exclaimed in amazement. \"The first in seven years!\"\n\n\"Maybe it's just one of their ships off its course,\" I ventured.\n\n\"No,\" said Wilma in some agitation. \"That would be green rockets. Red\nmeans only one thing, Tony. They're sweeping the countryside with their\ndis beams. Can you see anything, Bill?\"\n\n\"We had better get under cover,\" Gerdi said nervously. \"The four of us\nare bunched here in the open. For all we know they may be twelve miles\nup, out of sight, yet looking at us with a projecto'.\"\n\nBill had been sweeping the horizon hastily with his glass, but\napparently saw nothing.\n\n\"We had better scatter, at that,\" he said finally. \"It's orders, you\nknow. See!\" He pointed to the valley.\n\nHere and there a tiny human figure shot for a moment above the foliage\nof the treetops.\n\n\"That's bad,\" Wilma commented, as she counted the jumpers. \"No less than\nfifteen people visible, and all clearly radiating from a central point.\nDo they want to give away our location?\"\n\nThe standard orders covering air raids were that the population was to\nscatter individually. There should be no grouping, or even pairing, in\nview of the destructiveness of the disintegrator rays. Experience of\ngenerations had proved that if this were done, and everybody remained\nhidden beneath the tree screens, the Hans would have to sweep mile after\nmile of territory, foot by foot, to catch more than a small percentage\nof the community.\n\nGerdi, however, refused to leave Bill, and Wilma developed an equal\nobstinacy against quitting my side. I was inexperienced at this sort of\nthing, she explained, quite ignoring the fact that she was too; she was\nonly thirteen or fourteen years old at the time of the last air raid.\n\nHowever, since I could not argue her out of it, we leaped together about\na quarter of a mile to the right, while Bill and Gerdi disappeared down\nthe hillside among the trees.\n\nWilma and I both wanted a point of vantage from which we might overlook\nthe valley and the sky to the north, and we found it near the top of the\nridge, where, protected from visibility by thick branches, we could look\nout between the tree trunks, and get a good view of the valley.\n\nNo more rockets went up. Except for a few of those warning red clouds,\ndrifting lazily in a blue sky, there was no visible indication of man's\npast or present existence anywhere in the sky or on the ground.\n\nThen Wilma gripped my arm and pointed. I saw it; away off in the\ndistance; looking like a phantom dirigible airship, in its coat of\nlow-visibility paint, a bare spectre.\n\n\"Seven thousand feet up,\" Wilma whispered, crouching close to me.\n\"Watch.\"\n\nThe ship was about the same shape as the great dirigibles of the 20th\nCentury that I had seen, but without the suspended control car, engines,\npropellors, rudders or elevating planes. As it loomed rapidly nearer, I\nsaw that it was wider and somewhat flatter than I had supposed.\n\nNow I could see the repellor rays that held the ship aloft, like\nsearchlight beams faintly visible in the bright daylight (and still\nfaintly visible to the human eye at night). Actually, I had been\ninformed by my instructors, there were two rays; the visible one\ngenerated by the ship's apparatus, and directed toward the ground as a\nbeam of \"carrier\" impulses; and the true repellor ray, the complement of\nthe other in one sense, induced by the action of the \"carrier\" and\nreacting in a concentrating upward direction from the mass of the earth,\nbecoming successively electronic, atomic and finally molecular, in its\nnature, according to various ratios of distance between earth mass and\n\"carrier\" source, until, in the last analysis, the ship itself actually\nis supported on an upward rushing column of air, much like a ball\ncontinuously supported on a fountain jet.\n\nThe raider neared with incredible speed. Its rays were both slanted\nastern at a sharp angle, so that it slid forward with tremendous\nmomentum.\n\nThe ship was operating two disintegrator rays, though only in a casual,\nintermittent fashion. But whenever they flashed downward with blinding\nbrilliancy, forest, rocks and ground melted instantaneously into\nnothing, where they played upon them.\n\nWhen later I inspected the scars left by these rays I found them some\nfive feet deep and thirty feet wide, the exposed surfaces being\nlava-like in texture, but of a pale, iridescent, greenish hue.\n\nNo systematic use of the rays was made by the ship, however, until it\nreached a point over the center of the valley--the center of the\ncommunity's activities. There it came to a sudden stop by shooting its\nrepellor beams sharply forward and easing them back gradually to the\nvertical, holding the ship floating and motionless. Then the work of\ndestruction began systematically.\n\nBack and forth traveled the destroying rays, ploughing parallel furrows\nfrom hillside to hillside. We gasped in dismay, Wilma and I, as time\nafter time we saw it plough through sections where we knew camps or\nplants were located.\n\n\"This is awful,\" she moaned, a terrified question in her eyes. \"How\ncould they know the location so exactly, Tony? Did you see? They were\nnever in doubt. They stalled at a predetermined spot--and--and it was\nexactly the right spot.\"\n\nWe did not talk of what might happen if the rays were turned in our\ndirection. We both knew. We would simply disintegrate in a split second\ninto mere scattered electronic vibrations. Strangely enough, it was this\nself-reliant girl of the 25th Century, who clung to me, a relatively\nprimitive man of the 20th, less familiar than she with the thought of\nthis terrifying possibility, for moral support.\n\nWe knew that many of our companions must have been whisked into absolute\nnon-existence before our eyes in these few moments. The whole thing\nparalyzed us into mental and physical immobility for I do not know how\nlong.\n\nIt couldn't have been long, however, for the rays had not ploughed more\nthan thirty of their twenty-foot furrows or so across the valley, when I\nregained control of myself, and brought Wilma to herself by shaking her\nroughly.\n\n\"How far will this rocket gun shoot, Wilma?\" I demanded, drawing my\npistol.\n\n\"It depends on your rocket, Tony. It will take even the longest range\nrocket, but you could shoot more accurately from a longer tube. But why?\nYou couldn't penetrate the shell of that ship with rocket force, even if\nyou could reach it.\"\n\nI fumbled clumsily with my rocket pouch, for I was excited. I had an\nidea I wanted to try; a \"hunch\" I called it, forgetting that Wilma could\nnot understand my ancient slang. But finally, with her help, I selected\nthe longest range explosive rocket in my pouch, and fitted it to my\npistol.\n\n\"It won't carry seven thousand feet, Tony,\" Wilma objected. But I took\naim carefully. It was another thought that I had in my mind. The\nsupporting repellor ray, I had been told, became molecular in character\nat what was called a logarithmic level of five (below that it was a\npurely electronic \"flow\" or pulsation between the source of the\n\"carrier\" and the average mass of the earth). Below that level if I\ncould project my explosive bullet into this stream where it began to\ncarry material substance upward, might it not rise with the air column,\ngathering speed and hitting the ship with enough impact to carry it\nthrough the shell? It was worth trying anyhow. Wilma became greatly\nexcited, too, when she grasped the nature of my inspiration.\n\nFeverishly I looked around for some formation of branches against which\nI could rest the pistol, for I had to aim most carefully. At last I\nfound one. Patiently I sighted on the hulk of the ship far above us,\naiming at the far side of it, at such an angle as would, so far as I\ncould estimate, bring my bullet path through the forward repellor beam.\nAt last the sights wavered across the point I sought and I pressed the\nbutton gently.\n\nFor a moment we gazed breathlessly.\n\nSuddenly the ship swung bow down, as on a pivot, and swayed like a\npendulum. Wilma screamed in her excitement.\n\n\"Oh, Tony, you hit it! You hit it! Do it again; bring it down!\"\n\nWe had only one more rocket of extreme range between us, and we dropped\nit three times in our excitement in inserting it in my gun. Then,\nforcing myself to be calm by sheer will power, while Wilma stuffed her\nlittle fist into her mouth to keep from shrieking, I sighted carefully\nagain and fired. In a flash, Wilma had grasped the hope that this\ndiscovery of mine might lead to the end of the Han domination.\n\nThe elapsed time of the rocket's invisible flight seemed an age.\n\nThen we saw the ship falling. It seemed to plunge lazily, but actually\nit fell with terrific acceleration, turning end over end, its\ndisintegrator rays, out of control, describing vast, wild arcs, and once\ncutting a gash through the forest less than two hundred feet from where\nwe stood.\n\nThe crash with which the heavy craft hit the ground reverberated from\nthe hills--the momentum of eighteen or twenty thousand tons, in a sheer\ndrop of seven thousand feet. A mangled mass of metal, it buried itself\nin the ground, with poetic justice, in the middle of the smoking,\nsemi-molten field of destruction it had been so deliberately ploughing.\n\nThe silence, the vacuity of the landscape, was oppressive, as the last\nechoes died away.\n\nThen far down the hillside, a single figure leaped exultantly above the\nfoliage screen. And in the distance another, and another.\n\nIn a moment the sky was punctured by signal rockets. One after another\nthe little red puffs became drifting clouds.\n\n\"Scatter! Scatter!\" Wilma exclaimed. \"In half an hour there'll be an\nentire Han fleet here from Nu-yok, and another from Bah-flo. They'll get\nthis instantly on their recordographs and location finders. They'll\nblast the whole valley and the country for miles beyond. Come, Tony.\nThere's no time for the gang to rally. See the signals. We've got to\njump. Oh, I'm so proud of you!\"\n\nOver the ridge we went, in long leaps toward the east, the country of\nthe Delawares.\n\nFrom time to time signal rockets puffed in the sky. Most of them were\nthe \"red warnings,\" the \"scatter\" signals. But from certain of the\nothers, which Wilma identified as Wyoming rockets, she gathered that\nwhoever was in command (we did not know whether the Boss was alive or\nnot) was ordering an ultimate rally toward the south, and so we changed\nour course.\n\nIt was a great pity, I thought, that the clan had not been equipped\nthroughout its membership with ultrophones, but Wilma explained to me,\nthat not enough of these had been built for distribution as yet,\nalthough general distribution had been contemplated within a couple of\nmonths.\n\nWe traveled far before nightfall overtook us, trying only to put as much\ndistance as possible between ourselves and the valley.\n\nWhen gathering dusk made jumping too dangerous, we sought a comfortable\nspot beneath the trees, and consumed part of our emergency rations. It\nwas the first time I had tasted the stuff--a highly nutritive synthetic\nsubstance called \"concentro,\" which was, however, a bit bitter and\nunpalatable. But as only a mouthful or so was needed, it did not matter.\n\nNeither of us had a cloak, but we were both thoroughly tired and happy,\nso we curled up together for warmth. I remember Wilma making some sleepy\nremark about our mating, as she cuddled up, as though the matter were\nall settled, and my surprise at my own instant acceptance of the idea,\nfor I had not consciously thought of her that way before. But we both\nfell asleep at once.\n\nIn the morning we found little time for love making. The practical\nproblem facing us was too great. Wilma felt that the Wyoming plan must\nbe to rally in the Susquanna territory, but she had her doubts about the\nwisdom of this plan. In my elation at my success in bringing down the\nHan ship, and my newly found interest in my charming companion, who was,\nfrom my viewpoint of another century, at once more highly civilized and\nyet more primitive than myself, I had forgotten the ominous fact that\nthe Han ship I had destroyed must have known the exact location of the\nWyoming Works.\n\nThis meant, to Wilma's logical mind, either that the Hans had perfected\nnew instruments as yet unknown to us, or that somewhere, among the\nWyomings or some other nearby gang, there were traitors so degraded as\nto commit that unthinkable act of trafficking in information with the\nHans. In either contingency, she argued, other Han raids would follow,\nand since the Susquannas had a highly developed organization and more\nthan usually productive plants, the next raid might be expected to\nstrike them.\n\nBut at any rate it was clearly our business to get in touch with the\nother fugitives as quickly as possible, so in spite of muscles that were\nsore from the excessive leaping of the day before, we continued on our\nway.\n\nWe traveled for only a couple of hours when we saw a multi-colored\nrocket in the sky, some ten miles ahead of us.\n\n\"Bear to the left, Tony,\" Wilma said, \"and listen for the whistle.\"\n\n\"Why?\" I asked.\n\n\"Haven't they given you the rocket code yet?\" she replied. \"That's what\nthe green, followed by yellow and purple means; to concentrate five\nmiles east of the rocket position. You know the rocket position itself\nmight draw a play of disintegrator beams.\"\n\nIt did not take us long to reach the neighborhood of the indicated\nrallying, though we were now traveling beneath the trees, with but an\noccasional leap to a top branch to see if any more rocket smoke was\nfloating above. And soon we heard a distant whistle.\n\nWe found about half the Gang already there, in a spot where the trees\nmet high above a little stream. The Big Boss and Raid Bosses were busy\nreorganizing the remnants.\n\nWe reported to Boss Hart at once. He was silent, but interested, when he\nheard our story.\n\n\"You two stick close to me,\" he said, adding grimly, \"I'm going back to\nthe valley at once with a hundred picked men, and I'll need you.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nSetting the Trap\n\n\nInside of fifteen minutes we were on our way. A certain amount of\ncaution was sacrificed for the sake of speed, and the men leaped away\neither across the forest top, or over open spaces of ground, but\nconcentration was forbidden. The Big Boss named the spot on the hillside\nas the rallying point.\n\n\"We'll have to take a chance on being seen, so long as we don't group,\"\nhe declared, \"at least until within five miles of the rallying spot.\nFrom then on I want every man to disappear from sight and to travel\nunder cover. And keep your ultrophones open, and tuned on\nten-four-seven-six.\"\n\nWilma and I had received our battle equipment from the Gear boss. It\nconsisted of a long-gun, a hand-gun, with a special case of ammunition\nconstructed of inertron, which made the load weigh but a few ounces, and\na short sword. This gear we strapped over each other's shoulders, on top\nof our jumping belts. In addition, we each received an ultrophone, and a\nlight inertron blanket rolled into a cylinder about six inches long by\ntwo or three in diameter. This fabric was exceedingly thin and light,\nbut it had considerable warmth, because of the mixture of inertron in\nits composition.\n\n[Illustration: The Han raider neared with incredible speed. Its rays\nwere both slanted astern at a sharp angle, so that it slid forward with\ntremendous momentum.... Whenever the disintegrator rays flashed downward\nwith blinding brilliancy, forest, rocks and ground melted\ninstantaneously into nothing, where they played upon them.]\n\n\"This looks like business,\" Wilma remarked to me with sparkling eyes.\n(And I might mention a curious thing here. The word \"business\" had\nsurvived from the 20th Century American vocabulary, but not with any\nmeaning of \"industry\" or \"trade,\" for such things being purely community\nactivities were spoken of as \"work\" and \"clearing.\" Business simply\nmeant fighting, and that was all.)\n\n\"Did you bring all this equipment from the valley?\" I asked the Gear\nBoss.\n\n\"No,\" he said. \"There was no time to gather anything. All this stuff we\ncleared from the Susquannas a few hours ago. I was with the Boss on the\nway down, and he had me jump on ahead and arrange it. But you two had\nbetter be moving. He's beckoning you now.\"\n\nHart was about to call us on our phones when we looked up. As soon as we\ndid so, he leaped away, waving us to follow closely.\n\nHe was a powerful man, and he darted ahead in long, swift, low leaps up\nthe banks of the stream, which followed a fairly straight course at this\npoint. By extending ourselves, however, Wilma and I were able to catch\nup to him.\n\nAs we gradually synchronized our leaps with his, he outlined to us,\nbetween the grunts that accompanied each leap, his plan of action.\n\n\"We have to start the big business--unh--sooner or later,\" he said.\n\"And if--unh--the Hans have found any way of locating our\npositions--unh--it's time to start now, although the Council of\nBosses--unh--had intended waiting a few years until enough rocket ships\nhave been--unh--built. But no matter what the sacrifice--unh--we can't\nafford to let them get us on the run--unh--. We'll set a trap for the\nyellow devils in the--unh--valley if they come back for their\nwreckage--unh--and if they don't, we'll go rocketing for some of their\nliners--unh--on the Nu-yok, Clee-lan, Si-ka-ga course. We can\nuse--unh--that idea of yours of shooting up the repellor--unh--beams.\nWant you to give us a demonstration.\"\n\nWith further admonition to follow him closely, he increased his pace,\nand Wilma and I were taxed to our utmost to keep up with him. It was\nonly in ascending the slopes that my tougher muscles overbalanced his\ngreater skill, and I was able to set the pace for him, as I had for\nWilma.\n\nWe slept in greater comfort that night, under our inertron blankets, and\nwere off with the dawn, leaping cautiously to the top of the ridge\noverlooking the valley which Wilma and I had left.\n\nThe Boss scanned the sky with his ultroscope, patiently taking some\nfifteen minutes to the task, and then swung his phone into use, calling\nthe roll and giving the men their instructions.\n\nHis first order was for us all to slip our ear and chest discs into\npermanent position.\n\nThese ultrophones were quite different from the one used by Wilma's\ncompanion scout the day I saved her from the vicious attack of the\nbandit Gang. That one was contained entirely in a small pocket case.\nThese, with which we were now equipped, consisted of a pair of ear\ndiscs, each a separate and self-contained receiving set. They slipped\ninto little pockets over our ears in the fabric helmets we wore, and\nshut out virtually all extraneous sounds. The chest discs were likewise\nself-contained sending sets, strapped to the chest a few inches below\nthe neck and actuated by the vibrations from the vocal cords through the\nbody tissues. The total range of these sets was about eighteen miles.\nReception was remarkably clear, quite free from the static that so\nmarked the 20th Century radios, and of a strength in direct proportion\nto the distance of the speaker.\n\nThe Boss' set was triple powered, so that his orders would cut in on any\nlocal conversations, which were indulged in, however, with great\nrestraint, and only for the purpose of maintaining contacts.\n\nI marveled at the efficiency of this modern method of battle\ncommunication in contrast to the clumsy signaling devices of more\nancient times; and also at other military contrasts in which the 20th\nand 25th Century methods were the reverse of each other in efficiency.\nThese modern Americans, for instance, knew little of hand to hand\nfighting, and nothing, naturally, of trench warfare. Of barrages they\nwere quite ignorant, although they possessed weapons of terrific power.\nAnd until my recent flash of inspiration, no one among them, apparently,\nhad ever thought of the scheme of shooting a rocket into a repellor beam\nand letting the beam itself hurl it upward into the most vital part of\nthe Han ship.\n\nHart patiently placed his men, first giving his instructions to the\ncampmasters, and then remaining silent, while they placed the\nindividuals.\n\nIn the end, the hundred men were ringed about the valley, on the\nhillsides and tops, each in a position from which he had a good view of\nthe wreckage of the Han ship. But not a man had come in view, so far as\nI could see, in the whole process.\n\nThe Boss explained to me that it was his idea that he, Wilma and I\nshould investigate the wreck. If Han ships should appear in the sky, we\nwould leap for the hillsides.\n\nI suggested to him to have the men set up their long-guns trained on an\nimaginary circle surrounding the wreck. He busied himself with this\nafter the three of us leaped down to the Han ship, serving as a target\nhimself, while he called on the men individually to aim their pieces and\nlock them in position.\n\nIn the meantime Wilma and I climbed into the wreckage, but did not find\nmuch. Practically all of the instruments and machinery had been twisted\nout of all recognizable shape, or utterly destroyed by the ship's\ndisintegrator rays which apparently had continued to operate in the\nmidst of its warped remains for some moments after the crash.\n\nIt was unpleasant work searching the mangled bodies of the crew. But it\nhad to be done. The Han clothing, I observed, was quite different from\nthat of the Americans, and in many respects more like the garb to which\nI had been accustomed in the earlier part of my life. It was made of\nsynthetic fabrics like silks, loose and comfortable trousers of knee\nlength, and sleeveless shirts.\n\nNo protection, except that against drafts, was needed, Wilma explained\nto me, for the Han cities were entirely enclosed, with splendid\narrangements for ventilation and heating. These arrangements of course\nwere equally adequate in their airships. The Hans, indeed, had quite a\ndistaste for unshaded daylight, since their lighting apparatus diffused\na controlled amount of violet rays, making the unmodified sunlight\nunnecessary for health, and undesirable for comfort. Since the Hans did\nnot have the secret of inertron, none of them wore anti-gravity belts.\nYet in spite of the fact that they had to bear their own full weights at\nall times, they were physically far inferior to the Americans, for they\nlived lives of degenerative physical inertia, having machinery of every\ndescription for the performance of all labor, and convenient conveyances\nfor any movement of more than a few steps.\n\nEven from the twisted wreckage of this ship I could see that seats,\nchairs and couches played an extremely important part in their scheme of\nexistence.\n\nBut none of the bodies were overweight. They seemed to have been the\nbodies of men in good health, but muscularly much underdeveloped. Wilma\nexplained to me that they had mastered the science of gland control, and\nof course dietetics, to the point where men and women among them not\nuncommonly reached the age of a hundred years with arteries and general\nhealth in splendid condition.\n\nI did not have time to study the ship and its contents as carefully as I\nwould have liked, however. Time pressed, and it was our business to\ndiscover some clue to the deadly accuracy with which the ship had\nspotted the Wyoming Works.\n\nThe Boss had hardly finished his arrangements for the ring barrage, when\none of the scouts on an eminence to the north, announced the approach of\nseven Han ships, spread out in a great semi-circle.\n\nHart leaped for the hillside, calling to us to do likewise, but Wilma\nand I had raised the flaps of our helmets and switched off our\n\"speakers\" for conversation between ourselves, and by the time we\ndiscovered what had happened, the ships were clearly visible, so fast\nwere they approaching.\n\n\"Jump!\" we heard the Boss order, \"Deering to the north. Rogers to the\neast.\"\n\nBut Wilma looked at me meaningly and pointed to where the twisted plates\nof the ship, projecting from the ground, offered a shelter.\n\n\"Too late, Boss,\" she said. \"They'd see us. Besides I think there's\nsomething here we ought to look at. It's probably their magnetic graph.\"\n\n\"You're signing your death warrant,\" Hart warned.\n\n\"We'll risk it,\" said Wilma and I together.\n\n\"Good for you,\" replied the Boss. \"Take command then, Rogers, for the\npresent. Do you all know his voice, boys?\"\n\nA chorus of assent rang in our ears, and I began to do some fast\nthinking as the girl and I ducked into the twisted mass of metal.\n\n\"Wilma, hunt for that record,\" I said, knowing that by the simple\nprocess of talking I could keep the entire command continuously informed\nas to the situation. \"On the hillsides, keep your guns trained on the\ncircles and stand by. On the hilltops, how many of you are there? Speak\nin rotation from Bald Knob around to the east, north, west.\"\n\nIn turn the men called their names. There were twenty of them.\n\nI assigned them by name to cover the various Han ships, numbering the\nlatter from left to right.\n\n\"Train your rockets on their repellor rays about three-quarters of the\nway up, between ships and ground. Aim is more important than elevation.\nFollow those rays with your aim continuously. Shoot when I tell you, not\nbefore. Deering has the record. The Hans probably have not seen us, or\nat least think there are but two of us in the valley, since they're\nsettling without opening up disintegrators. Any opinions?\"\n\nMy ear discs remained silent.\n\n\"Deering and I remain here until they land and debark. Stand by and keep\nalert.\"\n\nRapidly and easily the largest of the Han ships settled to the earth.\nThree scouted sharply to the south, rising to a higher level. The others\nfloated motionless about a thousand feet above.\n\nPeeping through a small fissure between two plates, I saw the vast hulk\nof the ship come to rest full on the line of our prospective ring\nbarrage. A door clanged open a couple of feet from the ground, and one\nby one the crew emerged.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nThe \"Wyoming Massacre\"\n\n\n\"They're coming out of the ship.\" I spoke quietly, with my hand over\nmy mouth, for fear they might hear me. \"One--two--three--four,\nfive--six--seven--eight--nine. That seems to be all. Who knows how\nmany men a ship like that is likely to carry?\"\n\n\"About ten, if there are no passengers,\" replied one of my men, probably\none of those on the hillside.\n\n\"How are they armed?\" I asked.\n\n\"Just knives,\" came the reply. \"They never permit hand-rays on the\nships. Afraid of accidents. Have a ruling against it.\"\n\n\"Leave them to us then,\" I said, for I had a hastily formed plan in my\nmind. \"You, on the hillsides, take the ships above. Abandon the ring\ntarget. Divide up in training on those repellor rays. You, on the\nhilltops, all train on the repellors of the ships to the south. Shoot at\nthe word, but not before.\n\n\"Wilma, crawl over to your left where you can make a straight leap for\nthe door in that ship. These men are all walking around the wreck in a\nbunch. When they're on the far side, I'll give the word and you leap\nthrough that door in one bound. I'll follow. Maybe we won't be seen.\nWe'll overpower the guard inside, but don't shoot. We may escape being\nseen by both this crew and ships above. They can't see over this wreck.\"\n\nIt was so easy that it seemed too good to be true. The Hans who had\nemerged from the ship walked round the wreckage lazily, talking in\nguttural tones, keenly interested in the wreck, but quite unsuspicious.\n\nAt last they were on the far side. In a moment they would be picking\ntheir way into the wreck.\n\n\"Wilma, leap!\" I almost whispered the order.\n\nThe distance between Wilma's hiding place and the door in the side of\nthe Han ship was not more than fifteen feet. She was already crouched\nwith her feet braced against a metal beam. Taking the lift of that\nwonderful inertron belt into her calculation, she dove headforemost,\nlike a green projectile, through the door. I followed in a split second,\nmore clumsily, but no less speedily, bruising my shoulder painfully, as\nI ricocheted from the edge of the opening and brought up sliding against\nthe unconscious girl; for she evidently had hit her head against the\npartition within the ship into which she had crashed.\n\nWe had made some noise within the ship. Shuffling footsteps were\napproaching down a well lit gangway.\n\n\"Any signs we have been observed?\" I asked my men on the hillsides.\n\n\"Not yet,\" I heard the Boss reply. \"Ships overhead still standing. No\nbeams have been broken out. Men on ground absorbed in wreck. Most of\nthem have crawled into it out of sight.\"\n\n\"Good,\" I said quickly. \"Deering hit her head. Knocked out. One or more\nmembers of the crew approaching. We're not discovered yet. I'll take\ncare of them. Stand a bit longer, but be ready.\"\n\nI think my last words must have been heard by the man who was\napproaching, for he stopped suddenly.\n\nI crouched at the far side of the compartment, motionless. I would not\ndraw my sword if there were only one of them. He would be a weakling, I\nfigured, and I should easily overcome him with my bare hands.\n\nApparently reassured at the absence of any further sound, a man came\naround a sort of bulkhead--and I leaped.\n\nI swung my legs up in front of me as I did so, catching him full in the\nstomach and knocked him cold.\n\nI ran forward along the keel gangway, searching for the control room. I\nfound it well up in the nose of the ship. And it was deserted. What\ncould I do to jam the controls of the ships that would not register on\nthe recording instruments of the other ships? I gazed at the mass of\ncontrols. Levers and wheels galore. In the center of the compartment, on\na massively braced universal joint mounting, was what I took for the\nrepellor generator. A dial on it glowed and a faint hum came from within\nits shielding metallic case. But I had no time to study it.\n\nAbove all else, I was afraid that some automatic telephone apparatus\nexisted in the room, through which I might be heard on the other ships.\nThe risk of trying to jam the controls was too great. I abandoned the\nidea and withdrew softly. I would have to take a chance that there was\nno other member of the crew aboard.\n\nI ran back to the entrance compartment. Wilma still lay where she had\nslumped down. I heard the voices of the Hans approaching. It was time to\nact. The next few seconds would tell whether the ships in the air would\ntry or be able to melt us into nothingness. I spoke.\n\n\"Are you boys all ready?\" I asked, creeping to a position opposite the\ndoor and drawing my hand-gun.\n\nAgain there was a chorus of assent.\n\n\"Then on the count of three, shoot up those repellor rays--all of\nthem--and for God's sake, don't miss.\" And I counted.\n\nI think my \"three\" was a bit weak. I know it took all the courage I had\nto utter it.\n\nFor an agonizing instant nothing happened, except that the landing party\nfrom the ship strolled into my range of vision.\n\nThen startled, they turned their eyes upward. For an instant they stood\nfrozen with horror at whatever they saw.\n\nOne hurled his knife at me. It grazed my cheek. Then a couple of them\nmade a break for the doorway. The rest followed. But I fired pointblank\nwith my hand-gun, pressing the button as fast as I could and aiming at\ntheir feet to make sure my explosive rockets would make contact and do\ntheir work.\n\nThe detonations of my rockets were deafening. The spot on which the Hans\nstood flashed into a blinding glare. Then there was nothing there except\ntheir torn and mutilated corpses. They had been fairly bunched, and I\ngot them all.\n\nI ran to the door, expecting any instant to be hurled into infinity by\nthe sweep of a disintegrator ray.\n\nSome eighth of a mile away I saw one of the ships crash to earth. A\ndisintegrator ray came into my line of vision, wavered uncertainly for a\nmoment and then began to sweep directly toward the ship in which I\nstood. But it never reached it. Suddenly, like a light switched off, it\nshot to one side, and a moment later another vast hulk crashed to earth.\nI looked out, then stepped out on the ground.\n\nThe only Han ships in the sky were two of the scouts to the south which\nwere hanging perpendicularly, and sagging slowly down. The others must\nhave crashed down while I was deafened by the sound of the explosion of\nmy own rockets.\n\nSomebody hit the other repellor ray of one of the two remaining ships\nand it fell out of sight beyond a hilltop. The other, farther away,\ndrifted down diagonally, its disintegrator ray playing viciously over\nthe ground below it.\n\nI shouted with exultation and relief.\n\n\"Take back the command, Boss!\" I yelled.\n\nHis commands, sending out jumpers in pursuit of the descending ship,\nrang in my ears, but I paid no attention to them. I leaped back into the\ncompartment of the Han ship and knelt beside my Wilma. Her padded helmet\nhad absorbed much of the blow, I thought; otherwise, her skull might\nhave been fractured.\n\n\"Oh, my head!\" she groaned, coming to as I lifted her gently in my arms\nand strode out in the open with her. \"We must have won, dearest, did\nwe?\"\n\n\"We most certainly did,\" I reassured her. \"All but one crashed and that\none is drifting down toward the south; we've captured this one we're in\nintact. There was only one member of the crew aboard when we dove in.\"\n\n[Illustration: As the American leaped, he swung his legs up in front of\nhim, catching the Han full in the stomach.]\n\nLess than an hour afterward the Big Boss ordered the outfit to tune in\nultrophones on three-twenty-three to pick up a translated broadcast of\nthe Han intelligence office in Nu-yok from the Susquanna station. It\nwas in the form of a public warning and news item, and read as follows:\n\n\"This is Public Intelligence Office, Nu-yok, broadcasting warning to\nnavigators of private ships, and news of public interest. The squadron\nof seven ships, which left Nu-yok this morning to investigate the recent\ndestruction of the GK-984 in the Wyoming Valley, has been destroyed by a\nseries of mysterious explosions similar to those which wrecked the\nGK-984.\n\n\"The phones, viewplates, and all other signaling devices of five of the\nseven ships ceased operating suddenly at approximately the same moment,\nabout seven-four-nine.\" (According to the Han system of reckoning time,\nseven and forty-nine one hundredths after midnight.) \"After violent\ndisturbances the location finders went out of operation. Electroactivity\nregisters applied to the territory of the Wyoming Valley remain dead.\n\n\"The Intelligence Office has no indication of the kind of disaster which\novertook the squadron except certain evidences of explosive phenomena\nsimilar to those in the case of the GK-984, which recently went dead\nwhile beaming the valley in a systematic effort to wipe out the works\nand camps of the tribesmen. The Office considers, as obvious, the\ndeduction that the tribesmen have developed a new, and as yet\nundetermined, technique of attack on airships, and has recommended to\nthe Heaven-Born that immediate and unlimited authority be given the\nNavigation Intelligence Division to make an investigation of this\ntechnique and develop a defense against it.\n\n\"In the meantime it urges that private navigators avoid this territory\nin particular, and in general hold as closely as possible to the\nofficial inter-city routes, which now are being patrolled by the entire\nforce of the Military Office, which is beaming the routes generously to\na width of ten miles. The Military Office reports that it is at present\nconsidering no retaliatory raids against the tribesmen. With the\nNavigation Intelligence Division, it holds that unless further evidence\nof the nature of the disaster is developed in the near future, the\npublic interest will be better served, and at smaller cost of life, by a\nscientific research than by attempts at retaliation, which may bring\ndestruction on all ships engaging therein. So unless further evidence\nactually is developed, or the Heaven-Born orders to the contrary, the\nMilitary will hold to a defensive policy.\n\n\"Unofficial intimations from Lo-Tan are to the effect that the\nHeaven-Council has the matter under consideration.\n\n\"The Navigation Intelligence Office permits the broadcast of the\nfollowing condensation of its detailed observations:\n\n\"The squadron proceeded to a position above the Wyoming Valley where\nthe wreck of the GK-984 was known to be, from the record of its location\nfinder before it went dead recently. There the bottom projectoscope\nrelays of all ships registered the wreck of the GK-984. Teleprojectoscope\nviews of the wreck and the bowl of the valley showed no evidence of the\npresence of tribesmen. Neither ship registers nor base registers showed\nany indication of electroactivity except from the squadron itself. On\norders from the Base Squadron Commander, the LD-248, LK-745 and LG-25\nscouted southward at 3,000 feet. The GK-43, GK-981 and GK-220 stood\nabove at 2,500 feet, and the GK-18 landed to permit personal inspection\nof the wreck by the science committee. The party debarked, leaving one\nman on board in the control cabin. He set all projectoscopes at\nuniversal focus except RB-3,\" (this meant the third projectoscope from\nthe bow of the ship, on the right-hand side of the lower deck) \"with\nwhich he followed the landing group as it walked around the wreck.\n\n\"The first abnormal phenomenon recorded by any of the instruments at\nBase was that relayed automatically from projectoscope RB-4 of the\nGK-18, which as the party disappeared from view in back of the wreck,\nrecorded two green missiles of roughly cylindrical shape, projected from\nthe wreckage into the landing compartment of the ship. At such close\nrange these were not clearly defined, owing to the universal focus at\nwhich the projectoscope was set. The Base Captain of GK-18 at once\nordered the man in the control room to investigate, and saw him leave\nthe control room in compliance with this order. An instant later\nconfused sounds reached the control-room electrophone, such as might be\nmade by a man falling heavily, and footsteps reapproached the control\nroom, a figure entering and leaving the control room hurriedly. The Base\nCaptain now believes, and the stills of the photorecord support his\nbelief, that this was not the crew member who had been left in the\ncontrol room. Before the Base Captain could speak to him he left the\nroom, nor was any response given to the attention signal the Captain\nflashed throughout the ship.\n\n\"At this point projectoscope RB-3 of the ship now out of focus control,\ndimly showed the landing party walking back toward the ship. RB-4 showed\nit more clearly. Then on both these instruments, a number of blinding\nexplosives in rapid succession were seen and the electrophone relays\nregistered terrific concussions; the ship's electronic apparatus and\nprojectoscopes apparatus went dead.\n\n\"Reports of the other ships' Base Observers and Executives, backed by\nthe photorecords, show the explosions as taking place in the midst of\nthe landing party as it returned, evidently unsuspicious, to the ship.\nThen in rapid succession they indicate that terrific explosions occurred\ninside and outside the three ships standing above close to their rep-ray\ngenerators, and all signals from these ships thereupon went dead.\n\n\"Of the three ships scouting to the south, the LD-248 suffered an\nidentical fate, at the same moment. Its records add little to the\nknowledge of the disaster. But with the LK-745 and the LG-25 it was\ndifferent.\n\n\"The relay instruments of the LK-745 indicated the destruction by an\nexplosion of the rear rep-ray generator, and that the ship hung stern\ndown for a short space, swinging like a pendulum. The forward viewplates\nand indicators did not cease functioning, but their records are chaotic,\nexcept for one projectoscope still, which shows the bowl of the valley,\nand the GK-981 falling, but no visible evidence of tribesmen. The\ncontrol-room viewplate is also a chaotic record of the ship's crew\ntumbling and falling to the rear wall. Then the forward rep-ray\ngenerator exploded, and all signals went dead.\n\n\"The fate of the LG-25 was somewhat similar, except that this ship hung\nnose down, and drifted on the wind southward as it slowly descended out\nof control.\n\n\"As its control room was shattered, verbal report from its Action\nCaptain was precluded. The record of the interior rear viewplate shows\nmembers of the crew climbing toward the rear rep-ray generator in an\nattempt to establish manual control of it, and increase the lift. The\nprojectoscope relays, swinging in wide arcs, recorded little of value\nexcept at the ends of their swings. One of these, from a machine which\nhappened to be set in telescopic focus, shows several views of great\nvalue in picturing the falls of the other ships, and all of the rear\nprojectoscope records enable the reconstruction in detail of the\npendulum and torsional movements of the ship, and its sag toward the\nearth. But none of the views showing the forest below contain any\nindication of tribesmen's presence. A final explosion put this ship out\nof commission at a height of 1,000 feet, and at a point four miles S. by\nE. of the center of the valley.\"\n\nThe message ended with a repetition of the warning to other airmen to\navoid the valley.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nIncredible Treason\n\n\nAfter receiving this report, and reassurances of support from the Big\nBosses of the neighboring Gangs, Hart determined to reestablish the\nWyoming Valley community.\n\nA careful survey of the territory showed that it was only the northern\nsections and slopes that had been \"beamed\" by the first Han ship.\n\nThe synthetic-fabrics plant had been partially wiped out, though the\nlower levels underground had not been reached by the dis ray. The forest\nscreen above it, however, had been annihilated, and it was determined to\nabandon it, after removing all usable machinery and evidences of the\nprocesses that might be of interest to the Han scientists, should they\nreturn to the valley in the future.\n\nThe ammunition plant, and the rocket-ship plant, which had just been\nabout to start operation at the time of the raid, were intact, as were\nthe other important plants.\n\nHart brought the Camboss up from the Susquanna Works, and laid out new\ncamp locations, scattering them farther to the south, and avoiding\nground which had been seared by the Han beams and the immediate\nlocations of the Han wrecks.\n\nDuring this period, a sharp check was kept upon Han messages, for the\nphone plant had been one of the first to be put in operation, and when\nit became evident that the Hans did not intend any immediate reprisals,\nthe entire membership of the community was summoned back, and normal\nlife was resumed.\n\nWilma and I had been married the day after the destruction of the ships,\nand spent this intervening period in a delightful honeymoon, camping\nhigh in the mountains. On our return, we had a camp of our own, of\ncourse. We were assigned to location 1017. And as might be expected, we\nhad a great deal of banter over which one of us was Camp Boss. The title\nstood after my name on the Big Boss' records, and those of the Big\nCamboss, of course, but Wilma airily held that this meant nothing at\nall--and generally succeeded in making me admit it whenever she chose.\n\nI found myself a full-fledged member of the Gang now, for I had elected\nto search no farther for a permanent alliance, much as I would have\nliked to familiarize myself with this 25th Century life in other\nsections of the country. The Wyomings had a high morale, and had\nprospered under the rule of Big Boss Hart for many years. But many of\nthe gangs, I found, were badly organized, lacked strong hands in\nauthority, and were rife with intrigue. On the whole, I thought I would\nbe wise to stay with a group which had already proved its friendliness,\nand in which I seemed to have prospects of advancement. Under these\nmodern social and economic conditions, the kind of individual freedom to\nwhich I had been accustomed in the 20th Century was impossible. I would\nhave been as much of a nonentity in every phase of human relationship by\nattempting to avoid alliances, as any man of the 20th Century would have\nbeen politically, who aligned himself with no political party.\n\nThis entire modern life, it appeared to me, judging from my ancient\nviewpoint, was organized along what I called \"political\" lines. And in\nthis connection, it amused me to notice how universal had become the use\nof the word \"boss.\" The leader, the person in charge or authority over\nanything, was a \"boss.\" There was as little formality in his relations\nwith his followers as there was in the case of the 20th Century\npolitical boss, and the same high respect paid him by his followers as\nwell as the same high consideration by him of their interests. He was\njust as much of an autocrat, and just as much dependent upon the general\npopularity of his actions for the ability to maintain his autocracy.\n\nThe sub-boss who could not command the loyalty of his followers was as\nquickly deposed, either by them or by his superiors, as the ancient ward\nleader of the 20th Century who lost control of his votes.\n\nAs society was organized in the 20th Century, I do not believe the\nsystem could have worked in anything but politics. I tremble to think\nwhat would have happened, had the attempt been made to handle the A. E.\nF. this way during the First World War, instead of by that rigid\nmilitary discipline and complete assumption of the individual as a mere\nstandardized cog in the machine.\n\nBut owing to the centuries of desperate suffering the people had endured\nat the hands of the Hans, there developed a spirit of self-sacrifice and\nconsideration for the common good that made the scheme applicable and\nefficient in all forms of human co-operation.\n\nI have a little heresy about all this, however. My associates regard the\nthought with as much horror as many worthy people of the 20th Century\nfelt in regard to any heretical suggestion that the original outline of\ngovernment as laid down in the First Constitution did not apply as well\nto 20th Century conditions as to those of the early 19th.\n\nIn later years, I felt that there was a certain softening of moral fiber\namong the people, since the Hans had been finally destroyed with all\ntheir works; and Americans have developed a new luxury economy. I have\nseen signs of the reawakening of greed, of selfishness. The eternal\ncycle seems to be at work. I fear that slowly, though surely, private\nwealth is reappearing, codes of inflexibility are developing; they will\nbe followed by corruption, degradation; and in the end some cataclysmic\nevent will end this era and usher in a new one.\n\nAll this, however, is wandering afar from my story, which concerns our\nearly battles against the Hans, and not our more modern problems of\nself-control.\n\nOur victory over the seven Han ships had set the country ablaze. The\nsecret had been carefully communicated to the other gangs, and the\ncountry was agog from one end to the other. There was feverish activity\nin the ammunition plants, and the hunting of stray Han ships became an\nenthusiastic sport. The results were disastrous to our hereditary\nenemies.\n\nFrom the Pacific Coast came the report of a great transpacific liner of\n75,000 tons \"lift\" being brought to earth from a position of\ninvisibility above the clouds. A dozen Sacramentos had caught the hazy\noutlines of its rep rays approaching them, head-on, in the twilight,\nlike ghostly pillars reaching into the sky. They had fired rockets into\nit with ease, whereas they would have had difficulty in hitting it if it\nhad been moving at right angles to their position. They got one rep ray.\nThe other was not strong enough to hold it up. It floated to earth, nose\ndown, and since it was unarmed and unarmored, they had no difficulty in\nshooting it to pieces and massacring its crew and passengers. It seemed\nbarbarous to me. But then I did not have centuries of bitter persecution\nin my blood.\n\nFrom the Jersey Beaches we received news of the destruction of a\nNu-yok-A-lan-a liner. The Sand-snipers, practically invisible in their\nsand-colored clothing, and half buried along the beaches, lay in wait\nfor days, risking the play of dis beams along the route, and finally\nregistering four hits within a week. The Hans discontinued their service\nalong this route, and as evidence that they were badly shaken by our\nsuccess, sent no raiders down the Beaches.\n\nIt was a few weeks later that Big Boss Hart sent for me.\n\n\"Tony,\" he said, \"There are two things I want to talk to you about. One\nof them will become public property in a few days, I think. We aren't\ngoing to get any more Han ships by shooting up their repellor rays\nunless we use much larger rockets. They are wise to us now. They're\nputting armor of great thickness in the hulls of their ships below the\nrep-ray machines. Near Bah-flo this morning a party of Eries shot one\nwithout success. The explosions staggered her, but did not penetrate. As\nnear as we can gather from their reports, their laboratories have\ndeveloped a new alloy of great tensile strength and elasticity which\nnevertheless lets the rep rays through like a sieve. Our reports\nindicate that the Eries' rockets bounced off harmlessly. Most of the\nparty was wiped out as the dis rays went into action on them.\n\n\"This is going to mean real business for all of the gangs before long.\nThe Big Bosses have just held a national ultrophone council. It was\ndecided that America must organize on a national basis. The first move\nis to develop sectional organization by Zones. I have been made\nSuperboss of the Mid-Atlantic Zone.\n\n\"We're in for it now. The Hans are sure to launch reprisal expeditions.\nIf we're to save the race we must keep them away from our camps and\nplants. I'm thinking of developing a permanent field force, along the\nlines of the regular armies of the 20th Century you told me about. Its\nbusiness will be twofold: to carry the warfare as much as possible to\nthe Hans, and to serve as a decoy, to keep their attention from our\nplants. I'm going to need your help in this.\n\n\"The other thing I wanted to talk to you about is this: Amazing and\nimpossible as it seems, there is a group, or perhaps an entire gang,\nsomewhere among us, that is betraying us to the Hans. It may be the Bad\nBloods, or it may be one of those gangs who live near one of the Han\ncities. You know, a hundred and fifteen or twenty years ago there were\ncertain of these people's ancestors who actually degraded themselves by\nmating with the Hans, sometimes even serving them as slaves, in the days\nbefore they brought all their service machinery to perfection.\n\n\"There is such a gang, called the Nagras, up near Bah-flo, and another\nin Mid-Jersey that men call the Pineys. But I hardly suspect the Pineys.\nThere is little intelligence among them. They wouldn't have the\ninformation to give the Hans, nor would they be capable of imparting it.\nThey're absolute savages.\"\n\n\"Just what evidence is there that anybody has been clearing information\nto the Hans?\" I asked.\n\n\"Well,\" he replied, \"first of all there was that raid upon us. That\nfirst Han ship knew the location of our plants exactly. You remember it\nfloated directly into position above the valley and began a systematic\nbeaming. Then, the Hans quite obviously have learned that we are picking\nup their electrophone waves, for they've gone back to their old, but\nextremely accurate, system of directional control. But we've been\ngetting them for the past week by installing automatic re-broadcast\nunits along the scar paths. This is what the Americans called those\nstrips of country directly under the regular ship routes of the Hans,\nwho as a matter of precaution frequently blasted them with their dis\nbeams to prevent the growth of foliage which might give shelter to the\nAmericans. But they've been beaming those paths so hard, it looks as\nthough they even had information of this strategy. And in addition,\nthey've been using code. Finally, we've picked up three of their\nmessages in which they discuss, with some nervousness, the existence of\nour 'mysterious' ultrophone.\"\n\n\"But they still have no knowledge of the nature and control of ultronic\nactivity?\" I asked.\n\n\"No,\" said the Big Boss thoughtfully, \"they don't seem to have a bit of\ninformation about it.\"\n\n\"Then it's quite clear,\" I ventured, \"that whoever is 'clearing' us to\nthem is doing it piecemeal. It sounds like a bit of occasional barter,\nrather than an out-and-out alliance. They're holding back as much\ninformation as possible for future bartering, perhaps.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Hart said, \"and it isn't information the Hans are giving in\nreturn, but some form of goods, or privilege. The trick would be to\nlocate the goods. I guess I'll have to make a personal trip around among\nthe Big Bosses.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nThe Han City\n\n\nThis conversation set me thinking. All of the Han electrophone\ninter-communication had been an open record to the Americans for a good\nmany years, and the Hans were just finding it out. For centuries they\nhad not regarded us as any sort of a menace. Unquestionably it had never\noccurred to them to secrete their own records. Somewhere in Nu-yok or\nBah-flo, or possibly in Lo-Tan itself, the record of this traitorous\ntransaction would be more or less openly filed. If we could only get at\nit! I wondered if a raid might not be possible.\n\nBill Hearn and I talked it over with our Han-affairs Boss and his\nexperts. There ensued several days of research, in which the Han records\nof the entire decade were scanned and analyzed. In the end they picked\nout a mass of detail, and fitted it together into a very definite\npicture of the great central filing office of the Hans in Nu-yok, where\nthe entire mass of official records was kept, constantly available for\ninstant projectoscoping to any of the city's offices, and of the system\nby which the information was filed.\n\nThe attempt began to look feasible, though Hart instantly turned the\nidea down when I first presented it to him. It was unthinkable, he said.\nSheer suicide. But in the end I persuaded him.\n\n\"I will need,\" I said, \"Blash, who is thoroughly familiar with the Han\nlibrary system; Bert Gaunt, who for years has specialized on their\nmilitary offices; Bill Barker, the ray specialist, and the best swooper\npilot we have.\" _Swoopers_ are one-man and two-man ships, developed by\nthe Americans, with skeleton backbones of inertron (during the war\npainted green for invisibility against the green forests below) and\n\"bellies\" of clear ultron.\n\n\"That will be Mort Gibbons,\" said Hart. \"We've only got three swoopers\nleft, Tony, but I'll risk one of them if you and the others will\nvoluntarily risk your existences. But mind, I won't urge or order one of\nyou to go. I'll spread the word to every Plant Boss at once to give you\nanything and everything you need in the way of equipment.\"\n\nWhen I told Wilma of the plan, I expected her to raise violent and\ntearful objections, but she didn't. She was made of far sterner stuff\nthan the women of the 20th Century. Not that she couldn't weep as\ncopiously or be just as whimsical on occasion; but she wouldn't weep for\nthe same reasons.\n\nShe just gave me an unfathomable look, in which there seemed to be a bit\nof pride, and asked eagerly for the details. I confess I was somewhat\ndisappointed that she could so courageously risk my loss, even though I\nwas amazed at her fortitude. But later I was to learn how little I knew\nher then.\n\nWe were ready to slide off at dawn the next morning. I had kissed Wilma\ngood-bye at our camp, and after a final conference over our plans, we\nboarded our craft and gently glided away over the tree tops on a course,\nwhich, after crossing three routes of the Han ships, would take us out\nover the Atlantic, off the Jersey coast, whence we would come up on\nNu-yok from the ocean.\n\nTwice we had to nose down and lie motionless on the ground near a route\nwhile Han ships passed. Those were tense moments. Had the green back of\nour ship been observed, we would have been disintegrated in a second.\nBut it wasn't.\n\nOnce over the water, however, we climbed in a great spiral, ten miles in\ndiameter, until our altimeter registered ten miles. Here Gibbons shut\noff his rocket motor, and we floated, far above the level of the\nAtlantic liners, whose course was well to the north of us anyhow, and\nwaited for nightfall.\n\nThen Gibbons turned from his control long enough to grin at me.\n\n\"I have a surprise for you, Tony,\" he said, throwing back the lid of\nwhat I had supposed was a big supply case. And with a sigh of relief,\nWilma stepped out of the case.\n\n\"If you 'go into zero' (a common expression of the day for being\nannihilated by the disintegrator ray), you don't think I'm going to let\nyou go alone, do you, Tony? I couldn't believe my ears last night when\nyou spoke of going without me, until I realized that you are still five\nhundred years behind the times in lots of ways. Don't you know, dear\nheart, that you offered me the greatest insult a husband could give a\nwife? You didn't, of course.\"\n\nThe others, it seemed, had all been in on the secret, and now they would\nhave kidded me unmercifully, except that Wilma's eyes blazed\ndangerously.\n\nAt nightfall, we maneuvered to a position directly above the city. This\ntook some time and calculation on the part of Bill Barker, who explained\nto me that he had to determine our point by ultronic bearings. The\nslightest resort to an electronic instrument, he feared, might be\ndetected by our enemies' locators. In fact, we did not dare bring our\nswooper any lower than five miles for fear that its capacity might be\nreflected in their instruments.\n\nFinally, however, he succeeded in locating above the central tower of\nthe city.\n\n\"If my calculations are as much as ten feet off,\" he remarked with\nconfidence, \"I'll eat the tower. Now the rest is up to you, Mort. See\nwhat you can do to hold her steady. No--here, watch this indicator--the\nred beam, not the green one. See--if you keep it exactly centered on the\nneedle, you're O.K. The width of the beam represents seventeen feet. The\ntower platform is fifty feet square, so we've got a good margin to work\non.\"\n\nFor several moments we watched as Gibbons bent over his levers,\nconstantly adjusting them with deft touches of his fingers. After a bit\nof wavering, the beam remained centered on the needle.\n\n\"Now,\" I said, \"let's drop.\"\n\nI opened the trap and looked down, but quickly shut it again when I felt\nthe air rushing out of the ship into the rarefied atmosphere in a\ntorrent. Gibbons literally yelled a protest from his instrument board.\n\n\"I forgot,\" I mumbled. \"Silly of me. Of course, we'll have to drop out\nof compartment.\"\n\nThe compartment, to which I referred, was similar to those in some of\nthe 20th Century submarines. We all entered it. There was barely room\nfor us to stand, shoulder to shoulder. With some struggles, we got into\nour special air helmets and adjusted the pressure. At our signal,\nGibbons exhausted the air in the compartment, pumping it into the body\nof the ship, and as the little signal light flashed, Wilma threw open\nthe hatch.\n\nSetting the ultron-wire reel, I climbed through, and began to slide down\ngently.\n\nWe all had our belts on, of course, adjusted to a weight balance of but\na few ounces. And the five-mile reel of ultron wire that was to be our\nguide, was of gossamer fineness, though, anyway, I believe it would have\nlifted the full weight of the five of us, so strong and tough was this\ninvisible metal. As an extra precaution, since the wire was of the\npurest metal, and therefore totally invisible, even in daylight, we all\nhad our belts hooked on small rings that slid down the wire.\n\nI went down with the end of the wire. Wilma followed a few feet above\nme, then Barker, Gaunt and Blash. Gibbons, of course, stayed behind to\nhold the ship in position and control the paying out of the line. We all\nhad our ultrophones in place inside our air helmets, and so could\nconverse with one another and with Gibbons. But at Wilma's suggestion,\nalthough we would have liked to let the Big Boss listen in, we kept them\nadjusted to short-range work, for fear that those who had been clearing\nwith the Hans, and against whom we were on a raid for evidence, might\nalso pick up our conversation. We had no fear that the Hans would hear\nus. In fact, we had the added advantage that, even after we landed, we\ncould converse freely without danger of their hearing our voices through\nour air helmets.\n\nFor a while I could see nothing below but utter darkness. Then I\nrealized, from the feel of the air as much as from anything, that we\nwere sinking through a cloud layer. We passed through two more cloud\nlayers before anything was visible to us.\n\nThen there came under my gaze, about two miles below, one of the most\nbeautiful sights I have ever seen; the soft, yet brilliant, radiance of\nthe great Han city of Nu-yok. Every foot of its structural members\nseemed to glow with a wonderful incandescence, tower piled up on tower,\nand all built on the vast base-mass of the city, which, so I had been\ntold, sheered upward from the surface of the rivers to a height of 728\nlevels.\n\nThe city, I noticed with some surprise, did not cover anything like the\nsame area as the New York of the 20th Century. It occupied, as a matter\nof fact, only the lower half of Manhattan Island, with one section\nstraddling the East River, and spreading out sufficiently over what once\nhad been Brooklyn, to provide berths for the great liners and other air\ncraft.\n\nStraight beneath my feet was a tiny dark patch. It seemed the only spot\nin the entire city that was not aflame with radiance. This was the\ncentral tower, in the top floors of which were housed the vast library\nof record files and the main projectoscope plant.\n\n\"You can shoot the wire now,\" I ultrophoned Gibbons, and let go the\nlittle weighted knob. It dropped like a plummet, and we followed with\nconsiderable speed, but braking our descent with gloved hands\nsufficiently to see whether the knob, on which a faint light glowed as a\nsignal for ourselves, might be observed by any Han guard or night\nprowler. Apparently it was not, and we again shot down with accelerated\nspeed.\n\nWe landed on the roof of the tower without any mishap, and fortunately\nfor our plan, in darkness. Since there was nothing above it on which it\nwould have been worth while to shed illumination, or from which there\nwas any need to observe it, the Hans had neglected to light the tower\nroof, or indeed to occupy it at all. This was the reason we had selected\nit as our landing place.\n\nAs soon as Gibbons had our word, he extinguished the knob light, and the\nknob, as well as the wire, became totally invisible. At our ultrophoned\nword, he would light it again.\n\n\"No gun play now,\" I warned. \"Swords only, and then only if absolutely\nnecessary.\"\n\nClosely bunched, and treading as lightly as only inertron-belted people\ncould, we made our way cautiously through a door and down an inclined\nplane to the floor below, where Gaunt and Blash assured us the military\noffices were located.\n\nTwice Barker cautioned us to stop as we were about to pass in front of\nmirror-like \"windows\" in the passage wall, and flattening ourselves to\nthe floor, we crawled past them.\n\n\"Projectoscopes,\" he said. \"Probably on automatic record only, at this\ntime of night. Still, we don't want to leave any records for them to\nstudy after we're gone.\"\n\n\"Were you ever here before?\" I asked.\n\n\"No,\" he replied, \"but I haven't been studying their electrophone\ncommunications for seven years without being able to recognize these\nmachines when I run across them.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nThe Fight in the Tower\n\n\nSo far we had not laid eyes on a Han. The tower seemed deserted. Blash\nand Gaunt, however, assured me that there would be at least one man on\n\"duty\" in the military offices, though he would probably be asleep, and\ntwo or three in the library proper and the projectoscope plant.\n\n\"We've got to put them out of commission,\" I said. \"Did you bring the\n'dope' cans, Wilma?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she said, \"two for each. Here,\" and she distributed them.\n\nWe were now two levels below the roof, and at the point where we were to\nseparate.\n\nI did not want to let Wilma out of my sight, but it was necessary.\n\nAccording to our plan, Barker was to make his way to the projectoscope\nplant, Blash and I to the library, and Wilma and Gaunt to the military\noffice.\n\nBlash and I traversed a long corridor, and paused at the great arched\ndoorway of the library. Cautiously we peered in. Seated at three great\nswitchboards were library operatives. Occasionally one of them would\nreach lazily for a lever, or sleepily push a button, as little numbered\nlights winked on and off. They were answering calls for electrograph and\nviewplate records on all sorts of subjects from all sections of the\ncity.\n\nI apprised my companions of the situation.\n\n\"Better wait a bit,\" Blash added. \"The calls will lessen shortly.\"\n\nWilma reported an officer in the military office sound asleep.\n\n\"Give him the can, then,\" I said.\n\nBarker was to do nothing more than keep watch in the projectoscope\nplant, and a few moments later he reported himself well concealed, with\na splendid view of the floor.\n\n\"I think we can take a chance now,\" Blash said to me, and at my nod, he\nopened the lid of his dope can. Of course, the fumes did not affect us,\nthrough our helmets. They were absolutely without odor or visibility,\nand in a few seconds the librarians were unconscious. We stepped into\nthe room.\n\nThere ensued considerable cautious observation and experiment on the\npart of Gaunt, working from the military office, and Blash in the\nlibrary; while Wilma and I, with drawn swords and sharply attuned\nmicrophones, stood guard, and occasionally patrolled nearby corridors.\n\n\"I hear something approaching,\" Wilma said after a bit, with excitement\nin her voice. \"It's a soft, gliding sound.\"\n\n\"That's an elevator somewhere,\" Barker cut in from the projectoscope\nfloor. \"Can you locate it? I can't hear it.\"\n\n\"It's to the east of me,\" she replied.\n\n\"And to my west,\" said I, faintly catching it. \"It's between us, Wilma,\nand nearer you than me. Be careful. Have you got any information yet,\nBlash and Gaunt?\"\n\n\"Getting it now,\" one of them replied. \"Give us two minutes more.\"\n\n\"Keep at it then,\" I said. \"We'll guard.\"\n\nThe soft, gliding sound ceased.\n\n\"I think it's very close to me,\" Wilma almost whispered. \"Come closer,\nTony. I have a feeling something is going to happen. I've never known my\nnerves to get taut like this without reason.\"\n\nIn some alarm, I launched myself down the corridor in a great leap\ntoward the intersection whence I knew I could see her.\n\nIn the middle of my leap my ultrophone registered her gasp of alarm. The\nnext instant I glided to a stop at the intersection to see Wilma backing\ntoward the door of the military office, her sword red with blood, and an\ninert form on the corridor floor. Two other Hans were circling to either\nside of her with wicked-looking knives, while a third evidently a high\nofficer, judging by the resplendence of his garb tugged desperately to\nget an electrophone instrument out of a bulky pocket. If he ever gave\nthe alarm, there was no telling what might happen to us.\n\nI was at least seventy feet away, but I crouched low and sprang with\nevery bit of strength in my legs. It would be more correct to say that I\ndived, for I reached the fellow head on, with no attempt to draw my legs\nbeneath me.\n\nSome instinct must have warned him, for he turned suddenly as I hurtled\nclose to him. But by this time I had sunk close to the floor, and had\nstiffened myself rigidly, lest a dragging knee or foot might just\nprevent my reaching him. I brought my blade upward and over. It was a\nvicious slash that laid him open, bisecting him from groin to chin, and\nhis dead body toppled down on me, as I slid to a tangled stop.\n\nThe other two startled, turned. Wilma leaped at one and struck him down\nwith a side slash. I looked up at this instant, and the dazed fear on\nhis face at the length of her leap registered vividly. The Hans knew\nnothing of our inertron belts, it seemed, and these leaps and dives of\nours filled them with terror.\n\nAs I rose to my feet, a gory mess, Wilma, with a poise and speed which I\nfound time to admire even in this crisis, again leaped. This time she\ndove head first as I had done and, with a beautifully executed thrust,\nran the last Han through the throat.\n\nUncertainly, she scrambled to her feet, staggered queerly, and then sank\ngently prone on the corridor. She had fainted.\n\nAt this juncture, Blash and Gaunt reported with elation that they had\nthe record we wanted.\n\n\"Back to the roof, everybody!\" I ordered, as I picked Wilma up in my\narms. With her inertron belt, she felt as light as a feather.\n\nGaunt joined me at once from the military office, and at the\nintersection of the corridor, we came upon Blash waiting for us. Barker,\nhowever, was not in evidence.\n\n\"Where are you, Barker?\" I called.\n\n\"Go ahead,\" he replied. \"I'll be with you on the roof at once.\"\n\nWe came out in the open without any further mishap, and I instructed\nGibbons in the ship to light the knob on the end of the ultron wire. It\nflashed dully a few feet away from us. Just how he had maneuvered the\nship to keep our end of the line in position, without its swinging in a\ntremendous arc, I have never been able to understand. Had not the night\nbeen an unusually still one, he could not have checked the initial\npendulum-like movements. As it was, there was considerable air current\nat certain of the levels, and in different directions too. But Gibbons\nwas an expert of rare ability and sensitivity in the handling of a\nrocket ship, and he managed, with the aid of his delicate instruments,\nto sense the drifts almost before they affected the fine ultron wire,\nand to neutralize them with little shifts in the position of the ship.\n\nBlash and Gaunt fastened their rings to the wire, and I hooked my own\nand Wilma's on, too. But on looking around, I found Barker was still\nmissing.\n\n\"Barker, come!\" I called. \"We're waiting.\"\n\n\"Coming!\" he replied, and indeed, at that instant, his figure appeared\nup the ramp. He chuckled as he fastened his ring to the wire, and said\nsomething about a little surprise he had left for the Hans.\n\n\"Don't reel in the wire more than a few hundred feet,\" I instructed\nGibbons. \"It will take too long to wind it in. We'll float up, and when\nwe're aboard, we can drop it.\"\n\nIn order to float up, we had to dispense with a pound or two of weight\napiece. We hurled our swords from us, and kicked off our shoes as\nGibbons reeled up the line a bit, and then letting go of the wire, began\nto hum upward on our rings with increasing velocity.\n\nThe rush of air brought Wilma to, and I hastily explained to her that we\nhad been successful. Receding far below us now, I could see our dully\nshining knob swinging to and fro in an ever widening arc, as it crossed\nand recrossed the black square of the tower roof. As an extra\nprecaution, I ordered Gibbons to shut off the light, and to show one\nfrom the belly of the ship, for so great was our speed now, that I began\nto fear we would have difficulty in checking ourselves. We were\nliterally falling upward, and with terrific acceleration.\n\nFortunately, we had several minutes in which to solve this difficulty,\nwhich none of us, strangely enough, had foreseen. It was Gibbons who\nfound the answer.\n\n\"You'll be all right if all of you grab the wire tight when I give the\nword,\" he said. \"First I'll start reeling it in at full speed. You won't\nget much of a jar, and then I'll decrease its speed again gradually, and\nits weight will hold you back. Are you ready? One--two--three!\"\n\nWe all grabbed tightly with our gloved hands as he gave the word. We\nmust have been rising a good bit faster than he figured, however, for it\nwrenched our arms considerably, and the maneuver set up a sickening\npendulum motion.\n\nFor a while all we could do was swing there in an arc that may have been\na quarter of a mile across, about three and a half miles above the city,\nand still more than a mile from our ship.\n\nGibbons skilfully took up the slack as our momentum pulled up the line.\nThen at last we had ourselves under control again, and continued our\nupward journey, checking our speed somewhat with our gloves.\n\nThere was not one of us who did not breathe a big sigh of relief when we\nscrambled through the hatch safely into the ship again, cast off the\nultron line and slammed the trap shut.\n\nLittle realizing that we had a still more terrible experience to go\nthrough, we discussed the information Blash and Gaunt had between them\nextracted from the Han records, and the advisability of ultrophoning\nHart at once.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nThe Walls of Hell\n\n\nThe traitors were, it seemed, a degenerate gang of Americans, located a\nfew miles north of Nu-yok on the wooded banks of the Hudson, the\nSinsings. They had exchanged scraps of information to the Hans in return\nfor several old repellor-ray machines, and the privilege of tuning in on\nthe Han electronic power broadcast for their operation, provided their\nships agreed to subject themselves to the orders of the Han traffic\noffice, while aloft.\n\nThe rest wanted to ultrophone their news at once, since there was always\ndanger that we might never get back to the gang with it.\n\nI objected, however. The Sinsings would be likely to pick up our\nmessage. Even if we used the directional projector, they might have\nscouts out to the west and south in the big inter-gang stretches of\ncountry. They would flee to Nu-yok and escape the punishment they\nmerited. It seemed to be vitally important that they should not, for the\nsake of example to other weak groups among the American gangs, as well\nas to prevent a crisis in which they might clear more vital information\nto the enemy.\n\n\"Out to sea again,\" I ordered Gibbons. \"They'll be less likely to look\nfor us in that direction.\"\n\n\"Easy, Boss, easy,\" he replied. \"Wait until we get up a mile or two\nmore. They must have discovered evidences of our raid by now, and their\ndis-ray wall may go in operation any moment.\"\n\nEven as he spoke, the ship lurched downward and to one side.\n\n\"There it is!\" he shouted. \"Hang on, everybody. We're going to nose\nstraight up!\" And he flipped the rocket-motor control wide open.\n\nLooking through one of the rear ports, I could see a nebulous, luminous\nring, and on all sides the atmosphere took on a faint iridescence.\n\nWe were almost over the destructive range of the disintegrator-ray wall,\na hollow cylinder of annihilation shooting upward from a solid ring of\ngenerators surrounding the city. It was the main defense system of the\nHans, which had never been used except in periodic tests. They may or\nmay not have suspected that an American rocket ship was within the\ncylinder; probably they had turned on their generators more as a\nprecaution to prevent any reaching a position above the city.\n\nBut even at our present great height, we were in great danger. It was a\nquestion how much we might have been harmed by the rays themselves, for\ntheir effective range was not much more than seven or eight miles. The\ngreater danger lay in the terrific downward rush of air within the\ncylinder to replace that which was being burned into nothingness by the\ncontinual play of the disintegrators. The air fell into the cylinder\nwith the force of a gale. It would be rushing toward the wall from the\noutside with terrific force also, but, naturally, the effect was\nintensified on the interior.\n\nOur ship vibrated and trembled. We had only one chance of escape--to\nfight our way well above the current. To drift down with it meant\nultimately, and inevitably, to be sucked into the destruction wall at\nsome lower level.\n\nBut very gradually and jerkily our upward movement, as shown on the\nindicators, began to increase, and after an hour of desperate struggle\nwe were free of the maelstrom and into the rarefied upper levels. The\nterror beneath us was now invisible through several layers of cloud\nformations.\n\nGibbons brought the ship back to an even keel, and drove her eastward\ninto one of the most brilliantly gorgeous sunrises I have ever seen.\n\nWe described a great circle to the south and west, in a long easy dive,\nfor he had cut out his rocket motors to save them as much as possible.\nWe had drawn terrifically on their fuel reserves in our battle with the\nelements. For the moment, the atmosphere below cleared, and we could see\nthe Jersey coast far beneath, like a great map.\n\n\"We're not through yet,\" remarked Gibbons suddenly, pointing at his\nperiscope, and adjusting it to telescopic focus. \"A Han ship, and a\n'drop ship' at that--and he's seen us. If he whips that beam of his on\nus, we're done.\"\n\nI gazed, fascinated, at the viewplate. What I saw was a cigar-shaped\nship not dissimilar to our own in design, and from the proportional size\nof its ports, of about the same size as our swoopers. We learned later\nthat they carried crews, for the most part of not more than three or\nfour men. They had streamline hulls and tails that embodied\nuniversal-jointed double fish-tail rudders. In operation they rose to\ngreat heights on their powerful repellor rays, then gathered speed\neither by a straight nose dive, or an inclined dive in which they\nsometimes used the repellor ray slanted at a sharp angle. He was already\nabove us, though several miles to the north. He could, of course, try to\nget on our tail and \"spear\" us with his beam as he dropped at us from a\ngreat height.\n\nSuddenly his beam blazed forth in a blinding flash, whipping downward\nslowly to our right. He went through a peculiar corkscrew-like\nevolution, evidently maneuvering to bring his beam to bear on us with a\nspiral motion.\n\nGibbons instantly sent our ship into a series of evolutions that must\nhave looked like those of a frightened hen. Alternately, he used the\nforward and the reverse rocket blasts, and in varying degree. We\nfluttered, we shot suddenly to right and left, and dropped like a\nplummet in uncertain movements. But all the time the Han scout dropped\ntoward us, determinedly whipping the air around us with his beam. Once\nit sliced across beneath us, not more than a hundred feet, and we\ndropped with a jar into the pocket formed by the destruction of the air.\n\nHe had dropped to within a mile of us, and was coming with the speed of\na projectile, when the end came. Gibbons always swore it was sheer luck.\nMaybe it was, but I like pilots who are lucky that way.\n\nIn the midst of a dizzy, fluttering maneuver of our own, with the Han\nship enlarging to our gaze with terrifying rapidity, and its beam slowly\nslicing toward us in what looked like certain destruction within the\nsecond, I saw Gibbons' fingers flick at the lever of his rocket gun and\na split second later the Han ship flew apart like a clay pigeon.\n\nWe staggered, and fluttered crazily for several moments while Gibbons\nstruggled to bring our ship into balance, and a section of about four\nsquare feet in the side of the ship near the stern slowly crumbled like\nrusted metal. His beam actually had touched us, but our explosive rocket\nhad got him a thousandth of a second sooner.\n\nPart of our rudder had been annihilated, and our motor damaged. But we\nwere able to swoop gently back across Jersey, fortunately crossing the\nship lanes without sighting any more Han craft, and finally settling to\nrest in the little glade beneath the trees, near Hart's camp.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nThe New Boss\n\n\nWe had ultrophoned our arrival and the Big Boss himself, surrounded by\nthe Council, was on hand to welcome us and learn our news. In turn we\nwere informed that during the night a band of raiding Bad Bloods,\ndisguised under the insignia of the Altoonas, a gang some distance to\nthe west of us, had destroyed several of our camps before our people had\nrallied and driven them off. Their purpose, evidently, had been to\nembroil us with the Altoonas, but fortunately, one of our exchanges\nrecognized the Bad Blood leader, who had been slain.\n\nThe Big Boss had mobilized the full raiding force of the Gang, and was\non the point of heading an expedition for the extermination of the Bad\nBloods.\n\nI looked around the grim circle of the sub-bosses, and realized the fate\nof America, at this moment, lay in their hands. Their temper demanded\nthe immediate expenditure of our full effort in revenging ourselves for\nthis raid. But the strategic exigencies, to my mind, quite clearly\ndemanded the instant and absolute extermination of the Sinsings. It\nmight be only a matter of hours, for all we knew, before these degraded\npeople would barter clues to the American ultronic secrets to the Hans.\n\n\"How large a force have we?\" I asked Hart.\n\n\"Every man and maid who can be spared,\" he replied. \"That gives us seven\nhundred married and unmarried men, and three hundred girls, more than\nthe entire Bad Blood Gang. Every one is equipped with belts,\nultrophones, rocket guns and swords, and all fighting mad.\"\n\nI meditated how I might put the matter to these determined men, and was\nvaguely conscious that they were awaiting my words.\n\nFinally I began to speak. I do not remember to this day just what I\nsaid. I talked calmly, with due regard for their passion, but with deep\nconviction. I went over the information we had collected, point by\npoint, building my case logically, and painting a lurid picture of the\ndanger impending in that half-alliance between the Sinsings and the Hans\nof Nu-yok. I became impassioned, culminating, I believe, with a vow to\nproceed single-handed against the hereditary enemies of our race, \"if\nthe Wyomings were blindly set on placing a gang feud ahead of honor and\nduty and the hopes of all America.\"\n\nAs I concluded, a great calm came over me, as of one detached. I had\nfelt much the same way during several crises in the First World War. I\ngazed from face to face, striving to read their expressions, and in a\nmood to make good my threat without any further heroics, if the decision\nwas against me.\n\nBut it was Hart who sensed the temper of the Council more quickly than I\ndid, and looked beyond it into the future.\n\nHe arose from the tree trunk on which he had been sitting.\n\n\"That settles it,\" he said, looking around the ring. \"I have felt this\nthing coming on for some time now. I'm sure the Council agrees with me\nthat there is among us a man more capable than I, to boss the Wyoming\nGang, despite his handicap of having had all too short a time in which\nto familiarize himself with our modern ways and facilities. Whatever I\ncan do to support his effective leadership, at any cost, I pledge myself\nto do.\"\n\nAs he concluded, he advanced to where I stood, and taking from his head\nthe green-crested helmet that constituted his badge of office, to my\nsurprise he placed it in my mechanically extended hand.\n\nThe roar of approval that went up from the Council members left me\ndazed. Somebody ultrophoned the news to the rest of the Gang, and even\nthough the earflaps of my helmet were turned up, I could hear the cheers\nwith which my invisible followers greeted me, from near and distant\nhillsides, camps and plants.\n\nMy first move was to make sure that the Phone Boss, in communicating\nthis news to the members of the Gang, had not re-broadcast my talk nor\nmentioned my plan of shifting the attack from the Bad Bloods to the\nSinsings. I was relieved by his assurance that he had not, for it would\nhave wrecked the whole plan. Everything depended upon our ability to\nsurprise the Sinsings.\n\nSo I pledged the Council and my companions to secrecy, and allowed it to\nbe believed that we were about to take to the air and the trees against\nthe Bad Bloods.\n\nThat outfit must have been badly scared, the way they were \"burning\" the\nether with ultrophone alibis and propaganda for the benefit of the more\ndistant gangs. It was their old game, and the only method by which they\nhad avoided extermination long ago from their immediate neighbors--these\nappeals to the spirit of American brotherhood, addressed to gangs too\nfar away to have had the sort of experience with them that had fallen to\nour lot.\n\nI chuckled. Here was another good reason for the shift in my plans. Were\nwe actually to undertake the exterminations of the Bad Bloods at once,\nit would have been a hard job to convince some of the gangs that we had\nnot been precipitate and unjustified. Jealousies and prejudices existed.\nThere were gangs which would give the benefit of the doubt to the Bad\nBloods, rather than to ourselves, and the issue was now hopelessly\nbeclouded with the clever lies that were being broadcast in an unceasing\nstream.\n\nBut the extermination of the Sinsings would be another thing. In the\nfirst place, there would be no warning of our action until it was all\nover, I hoped. In the second place, we would have indisputable proof, in\nthe form of their rep-ray ships and other paraphernalia, of their\ntraffic with the Hans; and the state of American prejudice, at the time\nof which I write held trafficking with the Hans a far more heinous thing\nthan even a vicious gang feud.\n\nI called an executive session of the Council at once. I wanted to\ninventory our military resources.\n\nI created a new office on the spot, that of \"Control Boss,\" and\nappointed Ned Garlin to the post, turning over his former responsibility\nas Plants Boss to his assistant. I needed someone, I felt, to tie in the\nrecords of the various functional activities of the campaign, and take\nover from me the task of keeping the records of them up to the minute.\n\nI received reports from the bosses of the ultrophone unit, and those of\nfood, transportation, fighting gear, chemistry, electronic activity and\nelectrophone intelligence, ultroscopes, air patrol and contact guard.\n\nMy ideas for the campaign, of course, were somewhat tinged with my 20th\nCentury experience, and I found myself faced with the task of working\nout a staff organization that was a composite of the best and most\neasily applied principles of business and military efficiency, as I knew\nthem from the viewpoint of immediate practicality.\n\nWhat I wanted was an organization that would be specialized,\nfunctionally, not as that indicated above, but from the angles of:\nintelligence as to the Sinsings' activities; intelligence as to Han\nactivities; perfection of communication with my own units; co-operation\nof field command; and perfect mobilization of emergency supplies and\nresources.\n\nIt took several hours of hard work with the Council to map out the plan.\nFirst we assigned functional experts and equipment to each \"Division\" in\naccordance with its needs. Then these in turn were reassigned by the new\nDivision Bosses to the Field Commands as needed, or as Independent or\nHeadquarters Units. The two intelligence divisions were named the White\nand the Yellow, indicating that one specialized on the American enemy\nand the other on the Mongolians.\n\nThe division in charge of our own communications, the assignment of\nultrophone frequencies and strengths, and the maintenance of operators\nand equipment, I called \"Communications.\"\n\nI named Bill Hearn to the post of Field Boss, in charge of the main or\nundetached fighting units, and to the Resources Division, I assigned all\nresponsibility for what few aircraft we had; and all transportation and\nsupply problems, I assigned to \"Resources.\" The functional bosses stayed\nwith this division.\n\nWe finally completed our organization with the assignment of liaison\nrepresentatives among the various divisions as needed.\n\nThus I had a \"Headquarters Staff\" composed of the Division Bosses who\nreported directly to Ned Garlin as Control Boss, or to Wilma as my\npersonal assistant. And each of the Division Bosses had a small staff of\nhis own.\n\nIn the final summing up of our personnel and resources, I found we had\nroughly a thousand \"troops,\" of whom some three hundred and fifty were,\nin what I called the Service Divisions, the rest being in Bill Hearn's\nField Division. This latter number, however, was cut down somewhat by\nthe assignment of numerous small units to detached service. Altogether,\nthe actual available fighting force, I figured, would number about five\nhundred, by the time we actually went into action.\n\nWe had only six small swoopers, but I had an ingenious plan in my mind,\nas the result of our little raid on Nu-yok, that would make this\nsufficient, since the reserves of inertron blocks were larger than I\nexpected to find them. The Resources Division, by packing its supply\ncases a bit tight, or by slipping in extra blocks of inertron, was able\nto reduce each to a weight of a few ounces. These easily could be\nfloated and towed by the swoopers in any quantity. Hitched to ultron\nlines, it would be a virtual impossibility for them to break loose.\n\nThe entire personnel, of course, was supplied with jumpers, and if each\nman and girl was careful to adjust balances properly, the entire number\ncould also be towed along through the air, grasping wires of ultron,\nswinging below the swoopers, or stringing out behind them.\n\nThere would be nothing tiring about this, because the strain would be no\ngreater than that of carrying a one or two pound weight in the hand,\nexcept for air friction at high speeds. But to make doubly sure that we\nshould lose none of our personnel, I gave strict orders that the belts\nand tow lines should be equipped with rings and hooks.\n\nSo great was the efficiency of the fundamental organization and\ndiscipline of the Gang, that we got under way at nightfall.\n\nOne by one the swoopers eased into the air, each followed by its long\ntrain or \"kite-tail\" of humanity and supply cases hanging lightly from\nits tow line. For convenience, the tow lines were made of an alloy of\nultron which, unlike the metal itself, is visible.\n\nAt first these \"tails\" hung downward, but as the ships swung into\nformation and headed eastward toward the Bad Blood territory, gathering\nspeed, they began to string out behind. And swinging low from each ship\non heavily weighted lines, ultroscope, ultrophone, and straight-vision\nobservers keenly scanned the countryside, while intelligence men in the\nswoopers above bent over their instrument boards and viewplates.\n\nLeaving Control Boss Ned Garlin temporarily in charge of affairs, Wilma\nand I dropped a weighted line from our ship, and slid down about half\nway to the under lookouts, that is to say, about a thousand feet. The\nsensation of floating swiftly through the air like this, in the absolute\nsecurity of one's confidence in the inertron belt, was one of\nnever-ending delight to me.\n\nWe reascended into the swooper as the expedition approached the\nterritory of the Bad Bloods, and directed the preparations for the\nbombardment. It was part of my plan to appear to carry out the attack as\noriginally planned.\n\nAbout fifteen miles from their camps our ships came to a halt and\nmaintained their positions for a while with the idling blasts of their\nrocket motors, to give the ultroscope operators a chance to make a\nthorough examination of the territory below us, for it was very\nimportant that this next step in our program should be carried out with\nall secrecy.\n\nAt length they reported the ground below us entirely clear of any\nappearance of human occupation, and a gun unit of long-range specialists\nwas lowered with a dozen rocket guns, equipped with special automatic\ndevices that the Resources Division had developed at my request, a few\nhours before our departure. These were aiming and timing devices. After\ncalculating the range, elevation and rocket charges carefully, the guns\nwere left, concealed in a ravine, and the men were hauled up into the\nship again. At the predetermined hour, those unmanned rocket guns would\nbegin automatically to bombard the Bad Bloods' hillsides, shifting their\naim and elevation slightly with each shot, as did many of our artillery\npieces in the First World War.\n\nIn the meantime, we turned south about twenty miles, and grounded,\nwaiting for the bombardment to begin before we attempted to sneak across\nthe Han ship lane. I was relying for security on the distraction that\nthe bombardment might furnish the Han observers.\n\nIt was tense work waiting, but the affair went through as planned, our\nsquadron drifting across the route high enough to enable the ships'\ntails of troops and supply cases to clear the ground.\n\nIn crossing the second ship route, out along the Beaches of Jersey, we\nwere not so successful in escaping observation. A Han ship came speeding\nalong at a very low elevation. We caught it on our electronic location\nand direction finders, and also located it with our ultroscopes, but it\ncame so fast and so low that I thought it best to remain where we had\ngrounded the second time, and lie quiet, rather than get under way and\ncross in front of it.\n\nThe point was this. While the Hans had no such devices as our\nultroscopes, with which we could see in the dark (within certain\nlimitations of course), and their electronic instruments would be\nvirtually useless in uncovering our presence, since all but natural\nelectronic activities were carefully eliminated from our apparatus,\nexcept electrophone receivers (which are not easily spotted), the Hans\ndid have some very highly sensitive sound devices which operated with\ngreat efficiency in calm weather, so far as sounds emanating from the\nair were concerned. But the \"ground roar\" greatly confused their use of\nthese instruments in the location of specific sounds floating up from\nthe surface of the earth.\n\nThis ship must have caught some slight noise of ours, however, in its\nsensitive instruments, for we heard its electronic devices go into play,\nand picked up the routine report of the noise to its Base Ship\nCommander. But from the nature of the conversation, I judged they had\nnot identified it, and were, in fact, more curious about the detonations\nthey were picking up now from the Bad Blood lands some sixty miles or so\nto the west.\n\nImmediately after this ship had shot by, we took the air again, and\nfollowing much the same route that I had taken the previous night,\nclimbed in a long semi-circle out over the ocean, swung toward the north\nand finally the west. We set our course, however, for the Sinsings' land\nnorth of Nu-yok, instead of for the city itself.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nThe Finger of Doom\n\n\nAs we crossed the Hudson River, a few miles north of the city, we\ndropped several units of the Yellow Intelligence Division, with full\ninstrumental equipment. Their apparatus cases were nicely balanced at\nonly a few ounces weight each, and the men used their chute capes to\nease their drops.\n\nWe recrossed the river a little distance above and began dropping White\nIntelligence units and a few long and short range gun units. Then we\nheld our position until we began to get reports. Gradually we ringed the\nterritory of the Sinsings, our observation units working busily and\npatiently at their locators and scopes, both aloft and aground, until\nGarlin finally turned to me with the remark:\n\n\"The map circle is complete now, Boss. We've got clear locations all the\nway around them.\"\n\n\"Let me see it,\" I replied, and studied the illuminated viewplate map,\nwith its little overlapping circles of light that indicated spots proved\nclear of the enemy by ultroscopic observation.\n\nI nodded to Bill Hearn. \"Go ahead now, Hearn,\" I said, \"and place your\nbarrage men.\"\n\nHe spoke into his ultrophone, and three of the ships began to glide in a\nwide ring around the enemy territory. Every few seconds, at the word\nfrom his Unit Boss, a gunner would drop off the wire, and slipping the\nclasp of his chute cape, drift down into the darkness below.\n\nBill formed two lines, parallel to and facing the river, and enclosing\nthe entire territory of the enemy between them. Above and below,\nstraddling the river, were two defensive lines. These latter were merely\nto hold their positions. The others were to close in toward each other,\npushing a high-explosive barrage five miles ahead of them. When the two\nbarrages met, both lines were to switch to short-vision-range barrage\nand continue to close in on any of the enemy who might have drifted\nthrough the previous curtain of fire.\n\nIn the meantime Bill kept his reserves, a picked corps of a hundred men\n(the same that had accompanied Hart and myself in our fight with the Han\nsquadron) in the air, divided about equally among the \"kite-tails\" of\nfour ships.\n\nA final roll call, by units, companies, divisions and functions,\nestablished the fact that all our forces were in position. No Han\nactivity was reported, and no Han broadcasts indicated any suspicion of\nour expedition. Nor was there any indication that the Sinsings had any\nknowledge of the fate in store for them. The idling of rep-ray\ngenerators was reported from the center of their camp, obviously those\nof the ships the Hans had given them--the price of their treason to\ntheir race.\n\nAgain I gave the word, and Hearn passed on the order to his\nsubordinates.\n\nFar below us, and several miles to the right and left, the two barrage\nlines made their appearance. From the great height to which we had\nrisen, they appeared like lines of brilliant, winking lights, and the\ndetonations were muffled by the distances into a sort of rumbling,\ndistant thunder. Hearn and his assistants were very busy: measuring,\ncalculating, and snapping out ultrophone orders to unit commanders that\nresulted in the straightening of lines and the closing of gaps in the\nbarrage.\n\nThe White Division Boss reported the utmost confusion in the Sinsing\norganization. They were, as might be expected, an inefficient, loosely\ndisciplined gang, and repeated broadcasts for help to neighboring gangs.\nIgnoring the fact that the Mongolians had not used explosives for many\ngenerations, they nevertheless jumped at the conclusion that they were\nbeing raided by the Hans. Their frantic broadcasts persisted in this\nthought, despite the nervous electrophonic inquiries of the Hans\nthemselves, to whom the sound of the battle was evidently audible, and\nwho were trying to locate the trouble.\n\nAt this point, the swooper I had sent south toward the city went into\naction as a diversion, to keep the Hans at home. Its \"kite-tail\" loaded\nwith long-range gunners, using the most highly explosive rockets we had,\nhung invisible in the darkness of the sky and bombarded the city from a\ndistance of about five miles. With an entire city to shoot at, and the\nobject of creating as much commotion therein as possible, regardless of\nactual damage, the gunners had no difficulty in hitting the mark. I\ncould see the glow of the city and the stabbing flashes of exploding\nrockets. In the end, the Hans, uncertain as to what was going on, fell\nback on a defensive policy, and shot their \"hell cylinder,\" or wall of\nupturned disintegrator rays into operation. That, of course, ended our\nbombardment of them. The rays were a perfect defense, disintegrating our\nrockets as they were reached.\n\nIf they had not sent out ships before turning on the rays, and if they\nhad none within sufficient radius already in the air, all would be well.\n\nI queried Garlin on this, but he assured me Yellow Intelligence reported\nno indications of Han ships nearer than 800 miles. This would probably\ngive us a free hand for a while, since most of their instruments\nrecorded only imperfectly or not at all, through the death wall.\n\nRequisitioning one of the viewplates of the headquarters ship, and the\nservices of an expert operator, I instructed him to focus on our lines\nbelow. I wanted a close-up of the men in action.\n\nHe began to manipulate his controls and chaotic shadows moved rapidly\nacross the plate, fading in and out of focus, until he reached an\nadjustment that gave me a picture of the forest floor, apparently 100\nfeet wide, with the intervening branches and foliage of the trees\nappearing like shadows that melted into reality a few feet above the\nground.\n\nI watched one man setting up his long-gun with skillful speed. His lips\npursed slightly as though he were whistling, as he adjusted the tall\ntripod on which the long tube was balanced. Swiftly he twirled the knobs\ncontrolling the aim and elevation of his piece. Then, lifting a belt of\nammunition from the big box, which itself looked heavy enough to break\ndown the spindly tripod, he inserted the end of it in the lock of his\ntube and touched the proper combination of buttons.\n\nThen he stepped aside, and occupied himself with peering carefully\nthrough the trees ahead. Not even a tremor shook the tube, but I knew\nthat at intervals of something less than a second, it was discharging\nsmall projectiles which, traveling under their own continuously reduced\npower, were arching into the air, to fall precisely five miles ahead and\nexplode with the force of eight-inch shells, such as we used in the\nFirst World War.\n\nAnother gunner, fifty feet to the right of him, waved a hand and called\nout something to him. Then, picking up his own tube and tripod, he\ngauged the distance between the trees ahead of him, and the height of\ntheir lowest branches, and bending forward a bit, flexed his muscles and\nleaped lightly, some twenty-five feet. Another leap took him another\ntwenty feet or so, where he began to set up his piece.\n\nI ordered my observer then to switch to the barrage itself. He got a\nclose focus on it, but this showed little except a continuous series of\nblinding flashes, which, from the viewplate, lit up the entire interior\nof the ship. An eight-hundred-foot focus proved better. I had thought\nthat some of our French and American artillery of the 20th Century had\nachieved the ultimate in mathematical precision of fire, but I had never\nseen anything to equal the accuracy of that line of terrific explosions\nas it moved steadily forward, mowing down trees as a scythe cuts grass\n(or used to 500 years ago), literally churning up the earth and the\nsplintered, blasted remains of the forest giants, to a depth of from ten\nto twenty feet.\n\nBy now the two curtains of fire were nearing each other, lines of\nvibrant, shimmering, continuous, brilliant destruction, inevitably\nsqueezing the panic-stricken Sinsings between them.\n\nEven as I watched, a group of them, who had been making a futile effort\nto get their three rep-ray machines into the air, abandoned their\nefforts, and rushed forth into the milling mob.\n\nI queried the Control Boss sharply on the futility of this attempt of\ntheirs, and learned that the Hans, apparently in doubt as to what was\ngoing on, had continued to \"play safe,\" and broken off their power\nbroadcast, after ordering all their own ships east of the Alleghenies to\nthe ground, for fear these ships they had traded to the Sinsings might\nbe used against them.\n\nAgain I turned to my viewplate, which was still focussed on the central\nsection of the Sinsing works. The confusion of the traitors was entirely\nthat of fear, for our barrage had not yet reached them.\n\nSome of them set up their long-guns and fired at random over the barrage\nline, then gave it up. They realized that they had no target to shoot\nat, no way of knowing whether our gunners were a few hundred feet or\nseveral miles beyond it.\n\nTheir ultrophone men, of whom they did not have many, stood around in\ntense attitudes, their helmet phones strapped around their ears,\nnervously fingering the tuning controls at their belts. Unquestionably\nthey must have located some of our frequencies, and overheard many of\nour reports and orders. But they were confused and disorganized. If they\nhad an Ultrophone Boss they evidently were not reporting to him in an\norganized way.\n\nThey were beginning to draw back now before our advancing fire. With\nintermittent desperation, they began to shoot over our barrage again,\nand the explosions of their rockets flashed at widely scattered points\nbeyond. A few took distance \"pot shots.\"\n\nOddly enough it was our own forces that suffered the first casualties in\nthe battle. Some of these distance shots by chance registered hits,\nwhile our men were under strict orders not to exceed their barrage\ndistances.\n\nSeen upon the ultroscope viewplate, the battle looked as though it were\nbeing fought in daylight, perhaps on a cloudy day, while the explosions\nof the rockets appeared as flashes of extra brilliance.\n\nThe two barrage lines were not more than five hundred feet apart when\nthe Sinsings resorted to tactics we had not foreseen. We noticed first\nthat they began to lighten themselves by throwing away extra equipment.\nA few of them in their excitement threw away too much, and shot suddenly\ninto the air. Then a scattering few floated up gently, followed by\nincreasing numbers, while still others, preserving a weight balance,\njumped toward the closing barrages and leaped high, hoping to clear\nthem. Some succeeded. We saw others blown about like leaves in a\nwindstorm, to crumple and drift slowly down, or else to fall into the\nbarrage, their belts blown from their bodies.\n\nHowever, it was not part of our plan to allow a single one of them to\nescape and find his way to the Hans. I quickly passed the word to Bill\nHearn to have the alternate men in his line raise their barrages and\nheard him bark out a mathematical formula to the Unit Bosses.\n\nWe backed off our ships as the explosions climbed into the air in\nstagger formation until they reached a height of three miles. I don't\nbelieve any of the Sinsings who tried to float away to freedom\nsucceeded.\n\nBut we did know later, that a few who leaped the barrage got away and\nultimately reached Nu-yok.\n\nIt was those who managed to jump the barrage who gave us the most\ntrouble. With half of our long-guns turned aloft, I foresaw we would not\nhave enough to establish successive ground barrages and so ordered the\nbarrage back two miles, from which positions our \"curtains\" began to\nclose in again, this time, however, gauged to explode, not on contact,\nbut thirty feet in the air. This left little chance for the Sinsings to\nleap either over or under it.\n\nGradually, the two barrages approached each other until they finally\nmet, and in the grey dawn the battle ended.\n\nOur own casualties amounted to forty-seven men in the ground forces,\neighteen of whom had been slain in hand to hand fighting with the few of\nthe enemy who managed to reach our lines, and sixty-two in the crew and\n\"kite-tail\" force of swooper No. 4, which had been located by one of\nthe enemy's ultroscopes and brought down with long-gun fire.\n\nSince nearly every member of the Sinsing Gang had, so far as we knew,\nbeen killed, we considered the raid a great success.\n\nIt had, however, a far greater significance than this. To all of us who\ntook part in the expedition, the effectiveness of our barrage tactics\ndefinitely established a confidence in our ability to overcome the Hans.\n\nAs I pointed out to Wilma:\n\n\"It has been my belief all along, dear, that the American explosive\nrocket is a far more efficient weapon than the disintegrator ray of the\nHans, once we can train all our gangs to use it systematically and in\nco-ordinated fashion. As a weapon in the hands of a single individual,\nshooting at a mark in direct line of vision, the rocket-gun is inferior\nin destructive power to the dis ray, except as its range may be a little\ngreater. The trouble is that to date it has been used only as we used\nour rifles and shot guns in the 20th Century. The possibilities of its\nuse as artillery, in laying barrages that advance along the ground, or\nclimb into the air, are tremendous.\n\n\"The dis ray inevitably reveals its source of emanation. The rocket gun\ndoes not. The dis ray can reach its target only in a straight line. The\nrocket may be made to travel in an arc, over intervening obstacles, to\nan unseen target.\n\n\"Nor must we forget that our ultronists now are promising us a perfect\nshield against the dis ray in inertron.\"\n\n\"I tremble though, Tony dear, when I think of the horrors that are ahead\nof us. The Hans are clever. They will develop defenses against our new\ntactics. And they are sure to mass against us not only the full force of\ntheir power in America, but the united forces of the World Empire. They\nare a cowardly race in one sense, but clever as the very Devils in Hell,\nand inheritors of a calm, ruthless, vicious persistency.\"\n\n\"Nevertheless,\" I prophesied, \"the Finger of Doom points squarely at\nthem today, and unless you and I are killed in the struggle, we shall\nlive to see America blast the Yellow Blight from the face of the Earth.\"\n\n\nTHE END.\n\n\n\n\nTranscriber's Note:\n\n    This etext was produced from _Amazing Stories_ August 1928.\n    Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\n    copyright on this publication was renewed.

FREIGHT YARDS\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">They hop a freight train.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">14\tCREDITS (OVER EXISTING PHOTOS)\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">The CREDITS run over black and white photos of the Chicago they are leaving behind. Pigs roam the gutters. Street urchins smoke cigar butts under a stairway. A blind man hawks stale bread. Dirty children play around a dripping hydrant. Laundry hangs out to dry on tenement fire escapes. Police look for a thief under a bridge. Irish gangs stare at the camera, curious how they will look. The CREDITS end.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">15\tEXT.

And your hair is light. You're not a soft, greasy guy that puts bay rum on every night.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">I love it when you've been drinking.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">You're not greasy, Bill. You have any idea what that means?\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">Kind of.\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">They share the boxcar with a crowd of other HARVEST HANDS. Ursula is among them, also dressed like a man. Bill gestures out at the landscape.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">Look at all that space. Oweee! We should've done this a long time ago. It's just us and the road now, Abby.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">We're all still together, though. That's all I care about.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">16\tEXT. JERKWATER\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">The train slows down to take on water. The hands jump off. Each carries his \"bindle\"-- a blanket and a few personal effects wrapped in canvas. TOUGHS with ax handles are on hand to greet them.\nThe harvesters speak a Babel of tongues, from German to Uzbek to Swedish. Only English is rare. Some retain odd bits of their national costumes, they are pathetic figures, lonely and dignified and so far from home. Others, in split shoes and sockless feet, are tramps. Most are honest workers, though, here to escape the summer heat in the factories of the East.

Give me a chance and I'm going to dance!\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Bill struts around with a Napoleonic air, in a white Panama hat and gaiters, taking in the vista. Under his arm he carries a sword cane with a pearl handle. It pleases him, in this small way, to set himself apart from the rest of toiling humanity. He wants it known that he was born to greater things.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">17\tNEW ANGLE\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Bill comes upon a BIG MAN whose face is covered with blood.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">Good, very good.

Who're you?\nThe Tough hits Bill across the head with his ax handle.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">TOUGH\n<P ID=\"dia\">Name is Morrison.\nBill looks around to see whether Abby has seen this. She hasn't. He walks dizzily off down the tracks.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">18\tNEW ANGLE\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">He takes Abby by the arm.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">What happened to your ear?\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">Nothing.\nShe is a sultry beauty--emancipated, full of bright hopes and a zest for life. Her costume does not fool the men. Wherever she goes they ogle her insolently.\n<b>EXT. WAGONS\n</b>The FOREMEN of the surrounding farms wait by their wagons to carry the workers off. A flag pole is planted by each wagon. Those who do not speak English negotiate their wages on a blackboard.\nBENSON, a leathery man of fifty, bellows through a megaphone. In the background a NEWCOMER to the harvest talks with a VETERAN.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BENSON\n<P ID=\"dia\">Shockers! Four more and I'm leaving.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">How much you paying?\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BENSON\n<P ID=\"dia\">Man can make three dollars a day, he wants to work.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">Who're you kidding?\nBill mills around. They have no choice but to accept his offer.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BENSON\n<P ID=\"dia\">Sackers!\nAbby steps up.

Bill climbs up ahead of the women. Anger makes him extremely polite.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">You don't need to say it like that.\nBenson ignores this remark but dislikes Bill from the first.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">20\tEXT. PLAINS\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Benson's wagons roll across the plains toward the Razumihin, a \"bonanza\" or wheat ranch of spectacular dimensions, its name spelled out in whitewashed rocks on the side of a hill.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">21\tEXT. BONANZA GATES (NEAR SIGN)\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">The wagons pass under a large arch, set in the middle of nowhere, like the gates to a vanished kingdom. Goats peer down from on top.\nBill looks at Abby and raises his eyebrows.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">22\tEXT. BELVEDERE\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">At the center of the bonanza, amid a tawny sea of grain, stands a gay Victorian house, three stories tall. Where most farm houses stand more sensibly on low ground, protected from the elements, \"The Belvedere\" occupies the highest ridge around, commanding the view and esteem of all.\nFiligrees of gingerbread adorn the eaves. Cottonwood saplings, six feet high, have recently been planted in the front. Peacocks fuss about the yard. There is a lawn swing and a flagpole, used like a ship's mast for signaling distant parts of the bonanza. A wind generator supplies electric power.\nA white picket fence surrounds the house, though its purpose is unclear; where the prairie leaves off and the yard begins is impossible to tell.\nBison drift over the hills like boats on the ocean. Bill shouts at the nearest one.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">Yo, Beevo!\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">23\tTIGHT ON CHUCK\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">CHUCK ARTUNOV, the owner--a man of great reserve and dignity, still a bachelor--stands on the front porch of the Belvedere high above, observing the new arrivals.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">24\tEXT. DORMITORY\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Benson drops the hands off at the dormitory, a hundred yards below, a plain clapboard building with a ceiling of exposed joists. Ursula sees Chuck watching them.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">URSULA\n<P ID=\"dia\">Whose place is that?\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BENSON\n<P ID=\"dia\">The owner's. Don't none of you go up around his place. First one that does is fired. I'm warning you right now.\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">In the warm July weather most of the hands forsake the dorm to spread their bedrolls around a strawpile or in the hayloft of the nearby barn.\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Abby and Bill slip off to share a cigarette. Ursula tags behind.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">25\tEXT. ROCK\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Bill lifts a big rock. Abby applauds. Ursula kneels down behind\nhim. Abby pushes him over backwards.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">26\tEXT. BARN\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Ursula gasps as Abby tumbles off the roof of the barn and falls through the air screaming:\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">Urs!\nShe lands in a straw pile.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">27\tTIGHT ON ABBY AND BILL\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Bill takes Abby by the hands, spins her around until she is thoroughly dizzy, then grasps her across the chest.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">Ready?\nShe giggles her consent. He crushes her in a bear hug until she is just on the verge of passing out, then lets her go. She sinks to the grass, in a daze of sweet intoxication.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">28\tEXT. LANTERN - NIGHT\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Bill looks deeply into Abby's eyes by the light of a lantern that night. They have made a shallow cut on their thumbs and press them together mixing their blood like children.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">You're all I've got, Abby. No, really, everything I ever had is a complete piece of garbage except you.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">I know.\nThey laugh. He bends to kiss her. She pulls away.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">Sometimes I think you don't like men.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">As individuals? Very seldom.\nShe kisses him lovingly.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">29\tEXT. WHEAT FIELDS - DAWN\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">The sun peers over the horizon. The wheat makes a sound like a waterfall. It stretches for as far as the eye can see. A PREACHER has come out, in a cassock and surplice, to offer prayers of thanksgiving.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">PREACHER\n<P ID=\"dia\">\"... that your days may be multiplied, and the days of your children, in the land which the Lord swore unto your fathers to give them, as the days of' heaven upon the earth.\"\nThe harvesters spit and rub their hands as they wait for the dew to burn off. They have slept in their coats. The dawn has a raw edge, even in summer.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">30\tTIGHT ON WHEAT\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Chuck looks to see if the wheat is ready to harvest. He shakes the heads; they make a sound like paper. He snaps off a handful, rolls them between his palms, blows away the chaff and pinches the kernels that remain to make sure they have grown properly hard.\nTiny sounds are magnified in the early morning stillness:\ngrasshoppers snapping through the air, a cough, a distant hawk.\nHe pops the kernels into his mouth, chews them up, and rolls the wad around in his mouth. Satisfied, he spits it out and gives a nod. The Preacher begins a prayer of thanksgiving. Two ACOLYTES flank him, one with a smoking censer, the other with a crucifix.\nAll repeat the \"Amen.\" Benson makes a tugging signal with his arm. A Case tractor--forty tons of iron, steam-driven, as big and as powerful as a locomotive--blasts its whistle. This is the moment they have been waiting all year for.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">31\tOTHER FIELDS - SERIES OF ANGLES\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">A SIGNALMAN with two hand flags passes the message on from the crest of a nearby hill. In the far-flung fields of the bonanza other tractors answer as other crews set to work.\nAbby and Bill join in, Bill reaping the wheat with a mowing machine called a binder, Abby propping the bound sheaves together to make bunches or \"shocks.\"\nA cloud of chaff rises over the field, melting the sun down to a cold red bulb.\nAbby is well turned out, in a boater and string tie, as though she were planning any moment to leave for a picnic.\nBill, too, dresses with an eye to flashy fashion: Tight dark trousers, a silk handkerchief stuck in the back pocket with a copy of the Police Gazette, low-top calfskin boots with high heels and pointed toes, a shirt with ruffled cuffs, and a big signet ring. While at work he wears a white smock over all this to keep the chaff off. It gives him the air more of a researcher than a worker.\nThe harvesters itch madly as the chaff gets into their clothes. The shocks, full of briars, cut their hands; smut and rust make the cuts sting like fire. Nobody talks. From time to time they raise a chant.\nUrsula, plucking chickens by the cookhouse--a shack on wheels-- steals a key chain from an unwatched coat.\nBenson follows the reapers around the field in a buggy. He keeps their hours, chides loafers, checks the horses, etc. The harvesters are city people. Few of them are trained to farming. Most--Abby and Bill are no exception--have contempt for it and anybody dull enough to practice it. Tight control is therefore exercised to see that the machines are not damaged. \nWhere the others loaf whenever Benson's back is turned, Bill works like a demon, as a point of pride.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">32\tCHUCK AND BENSON\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Lightning shivers through the clouds along the horizon. Chuck looks concerned. Benson consults a windsock.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BENSON\n<P ID=\"dia\">Should miss us.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHUCK\n<P ID=\"dia\">They must be having trouble over there, though.\nAbby, passing by, lifts her hat to wipe her face. As she does her hair falls out of the crown. Women are rare in the harvest fields. One so beautiful is unprecedented.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHUCK\n<P ID=\"dia\">I didn't know we had any women on.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BENSON\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(surprised)\n<P ID=\"dia\">I thought she was a boy. Should I get rid of her?\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHUCK\n<P ID=\"dia\">No.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">33\tMONTAGE\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">A COOK stands on the horizon waving a white flag at the end of a fishing pole. Ursula bounds through the wheat blowing a horn.\nBenson consults the large clock strapped to the back of his buggy, then fires a smoke pistol in the air.\nTheir faces black with chaff, the hands fall out in silence. They shuffle across the field toward the cookhouse, keeping their feet close to the ground to avoid being spiked by the stubble.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">34\tEXT. COOKHOUSE - STUBBLE FIELD IN B.G.\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">The COOKS, Orientals in homburgs, serve from planks thrown across sawhorses. The hands cuff and push each other around as they wash up. The water, brought up fresh in wagons from the wells, makes them gasp. An ice wagon and a fire truck are parked nearby.\nMost sit on the ground to eat, under awnings or beach umbrellas dotted around the field like toadstools. The Belvedere is visible miles away on the horizon.\nBill is carrying Abby's lunch to her when a loutish DUTCH MAN makes a crack.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">DUTCHMAN\n<P ID=\"dia\">Your sister keep you warm at night?\nBill throws a plate of stew at him and they are quickly in a fight. No fists are used, just food. The others pull them apart. Bill storms away, flicking mashed potatoes off his shirt.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">35\tEXT. GRAIN WAGON - STUBBLE FIELD IN B.G.\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Bill and Abby sit by themselves in the shade of a grain wagon. Demoralized, Abby soaks her hands in a pail of bran water. Bill inspects them anxiously. They are swollen and cracked from the morning's work.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">I ran a stubble under my nail.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">Didn't you ever learn how to take care of yourself? I told you to keep the gloves on. What can I do if you don't listen?\nBill presses her wrists against his cheek, ashamed that he can do nothing to shield her from such indignities. In the b.g. a MAN with a fungo bat hits flies to SOME MEN with baseball gloves.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">You can't keep on like this.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY \n<P ID=\"dia\">What else can we do?\nShe nods at the others.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">Anyway, if they can, I can too.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">That bunch? Don't compare yourself to them.\nShe flexes her fingers. They seem lame.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">You drop off this weak. I can make enough for us both. It was a crime to bring you out here. Somebody like you.\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(pause)\n<P ID=\"dia\">Right now, what I'm doing, I'm just dragging you down.\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(pause)\n<P ID=\"dia\">Maybe you should go back to Chicago. We've got enough for a ticket, and I can send you what I make.\nHe seems a little surprised when she does not reject this idea out of hand. Perhaps he fears that if she ever did go back, he might never see her again.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">What's the matter?\nShe begins to cry. He takes her in his arms.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">I know how you feel, honey. Things won't always be this way. I promise.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">36\tABBY AND BILL - CHUCK'S POV\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">The men knock out their pipes as Benson's whistle summons them back to their stations.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BENSON\n<P ID=\"dia\">Tick tockl Tick tock! Nothing moving but the clock!\nBill pulls Abby to her feet. He sees the Dutchman he fought with and shoots him the finger.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">You better be careful.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">Of him? He's just a. sack of shit.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">Stop it! He's liable to see you.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL \n<P ID=\"dia\">I want him to. He's the one better be careful.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">37\tTIGHT ON CHUCK\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Chuck looks on. Something about her captivates hint, not so much her beauty--which only makes her seem beyond his reach--as the way she takes it utterly for granted.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">38\tMONTAGE (DISSOLVES)\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">The work goes on through the afternoon. The pace is stern and incessant, and for a reason: a storm could rise at any moment and sweep the crops flat, or a dry wind shrivel them up. A series of dissolves gives the sense of many days passing.\nIany moment and sweep the crops flat, or a dry wind shrivel them up.Animals--snakes and gophers, rabbits and foxes--dart through the field into the deep of the wheat, not realizing their sanctuary is growing ever smaller as the reapers make their rounds. The moment will come when they will every one be killed with rakes and flails.\nThe wheat changes colors in the wind, like velvet. As the sun drops toward the horizon a dew sets, making the straw hard to cut. Benson fires his pistol. A vine of smoke sinks lazily through the sky. As the workers move off, the fields grow vast and inhospitable.\nOil wells can be seen here and there amid the grain.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">39\tEXT. ABBY'S ROW\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Bill helps Abby finish up a row. Thousands of shocks stretch out in the distance. Benson comes up behind her, making a spray of the stalks that she missed.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BENSON\n<P ID=\"dia\">You must've passed over a dozen bushels here. I'm docking you three dollars.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">What're you talking about? That's not fair.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BENSON\n<P ID=\"dia\">Then leave. You're fired.\nAbby is speechless. Bill squeezes the small rubber ball which he carries around to improve his grip and swallows his pride.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">Wait a minute.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BENSON\n<P ID=\"dia\">You want to stay?\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(pause)\n<P ID=\"dia\">Then shut up and get back to work.\nBenson leaves. Abby covers Bill's embarrassment.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">I guess he meant it.\nShe turns her back to him and goes about picking up the sheaf Benson threw down.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">He did. Ask him. If you can't sing or dance, what do you do in this world? You might as well forget it.\nIsing or dance, what do you do this world?

BELVEDERE - DOCTOR'S WAGON - DUSK\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">A physician's wagon stands in front of the Belvedere.\nBill hunts nervously through it for medicine to soothe Abby's \nhands. Not knowing quite what to look for, he sniffs whatever \ncatches his eye. \nSuddenly the front door opens and Chuck steps out with a DOCTOR, a stooped old man in a black frock coat. Bill, surprised, crouches behind the wheel. As they draw closer their conversation becomes faintly audible.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHUCK (o.s.)\n<P ID=\"dia\">How long you give it?\nDOCTOR (o.s.)\nCould be next month. Could be a year.

SEPARATOR - SERIES OF ANGLESI\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Sixty foot belts connect the tractors to the separating machines, huge rattletrap devices that shell the wheat out at deafening volume. Benson tosses bundles down the hissing maw, squirts oil into the gears, tightens belts, chews out a MAN who's sliced a hand on the driveshaft, etc. \nBill works on the straw pile at the back of the machine, in a soft rain of chaff, spreading it out with a pitchfork. \nUrsula helps stoke the tractor with coal and water. When nothing is required of her she sneaks off to burrow in the straw. \nGingerbread on the eaves of the tractors gives them a Victorian appearance. Tall flags mark their position in the field.\nAbby moves quickly, without a moment's rest, sewing up the\nsacks of grain as they are measured out at the bottom of\nthe separator.

At a table beside it, McLean computes the yield.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">McLEAN\n<P ID=\"dia\">This must be wrong.

Isn't he soon to die, leaving a vast inheritance that will otherwise go to waste?\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">You know I love you, don't  you?\nABBY Yes.\nAbby guesses what is going through his mind, and it shocks her.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">Oh, Bill!\nHe takes her into his arms, full of emotion.I\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">What else can we really do?

BELVEDERE - DUSKU\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">On their way home they pass the Belvedere. A single light\nburns on the second floor. Abby picks cornflowers to put\nin her hair. Bill runs his hand down her back.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">Why're you touching me that way?\nHe shrugs. Muffled by the walls of the house, above the cries of the peafowl, they can faintly hear Chuck singing to himself.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">He's singing.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">He can't be too sick if he's singing to himself.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">He might be singing to God.\nThey look at each other and smile.

SEPARATOR, LAST SHEAVES, RATS\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Work goes on the next day. As they near the last sheaves of unthreshed grain, hundreds of rats burst out of hiding.

Still, I wanted to make something of myself. I mean, guys look at\nyou across a desk, you know what they're thinking. So I went in\nthe mill. Couldn't wait to get in there. Begin at seven, got to have a smile on your face. Didn't work out, though. No matter what you do, sometimes\nthings just don't go right. It gets to you after a while.

I really believed when I was growing up that somehow I would. I worked like a bastard in that mill. I felt all right about it, though.

You aren't so big. Where do they learn how to?\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">They're so darling! Can you eat them?\nChuck nods. Abby snaps the mushrooms off flush at the ground.

I must be.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">Why? On account of something I've done?\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHUCK\n<P ID=\"dia\">Because you're so beautiful.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">What a nice thing to say. Look, I hit it.

SWING\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Bill sits in a swing and plays a clarinet. The music flows out across the fields like a night breeze from the city.

RIDGE - DAWN\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">They are on a ridge opposite the Belvedere looking at the heavens through Chuck's telescope. Abby tingles with a sense of wonder.

FATHER'S GRAVE - NIGHT\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Nearby the grave of Chuck's father stands in helpless witness to Abby's deception.

We see no sign of Chuck's mother.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">101\tEXT. PLOWED FIELD - FLASHBACK\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">A plow folds back the earth. The roots of the prairie grass twang like harp strings.\nThe plowing done, his father sows the seed. Poverty requires that for a harrow he drag a tree branch in back of his ox.

I could make you happy, too, I think-if only you'd trust me.\nThe camera settles on Ursula, playing with a dog on a seesaw Chuck\nhas built her, then begins to move again, to a long shot of Chuck and \nAbby on the ridge by the telescope. Chuck is proposing.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">108\tEXT. DORM\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Abby has told him of the proposal. Bill broods over an unlit cigarette.

You cold?\nAbby is shivering. Bill takes off his jacket and slips it over her shoulders.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL \n<P ID=\"dia\">What're you thinking?\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">We've never done anything like this.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">Who'd know but you and me?\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">Nobody.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">That's it, Ab. That's all that matters, isn't it?  \n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">You talk like it was all right. It would be a crime.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">But to give him what he wants more than anything? Two, threeI\nmonths of sunshine? He'll never get to enjoy his money anyway.\nWhat're you talking about? We'd be showing him the first good\ntimes of his life.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">Maybe you're right.\nAt each hint of consent from Abby, Bill feels he must press on.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">You know what they're going to stick on his tombstone? \"Born\nlike a fool, worked like a mule.\" Two lines.\nAbby cannot say the proposal is devoid of principle. The idea of easing Chuck's imminent death gives them just the shade of a good motive. This would be a trade.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">What makes you think we're just talking about a couple of months?U\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">Listen, the man's got one foot on a banana peel and the other\non a roller skate.

We're in quicksand, though. We stand around, it's\ngoing to suck us down like everybody else.\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(pause)\n<P ID=\"dia\">Somewhere along the line you have to make a sacrifice. Lots of people want to sit back and take a piece without doing nothing. \nHe waits to see how she will respond. Half of him wants her to turn him down flat. Abby is bewildered. \n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">Have I ever complained? Have I said anything that would make\nyou think...\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">You don't have to. I hate it when I see you stooped over and\nthem looking at your ass like you were a whore. I personally\nfeel ashamed! I want to take a .45 and let somebody have it.\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(pause)\n<P ID=\"dia\">We got to look on the bright side of this, Ab. Year from\ntoday we got a Chinese butler and no shit from anybody.\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(pause)\n<P ID=\"dia\">Some people need more'n they have, some have more'n they need. It's\njust a matter of getting us all together.\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(pause)\n<P ID=\"dia\">I don't even know if I believe what I'm saying, though.

RIVER BANK\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">The wedding takes place along the river. The Preacher has come back with his ACOLYTES. A chest of drawers serves as the altar. Benson is the best man--a joyless one. Ursula bounces around in a beautiful gown, looking for the first time like a young woman. The BAND practically outnumbers the guests: ELDERS from the local Mennonites, the MAYORS of a few surrounding towns decked out in sashes and medals, etc.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">112\tTIGHT ON ABBY AND BILL\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Bill kisses the bride on the cheek. Each believes she is going through with this for the other's sake. They whisper back and forth.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">You know what this means, don't you?\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(he nods)\n<P ID=\"dia\">We won't ever let each other down, will we?\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">I love you more than ever.

The wind moans in the rafter\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">No. But I wish I were.\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(pause)\n<P ID=\"dia\">Listen. It sounds like the ocean.\nThey smile at each other.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">116\tEXT. BELVEDERE - DUSKI\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Bill watches the lights go out in the Belvedere. A lump rises to his throat. How exactly did this happen? He sets his jaw, vowing not to give way to weakness or jealousy. This is the price they have to pay for a lasting\nhappiness.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">117\tTIGHT ON ABBY, CHUCK, ETC.\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">The next morning the newlyweds set off on their honeymoon. \nChuck tells Bill to move his things from the dorm into the Belvedere.\nAbby, a basket of cucumbers under her arm, waves goodbye, angling her wrist so that Bill and Ursula can see the diamond bracelet Chuck has given her.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">118\tEXT. PRAIRIEI\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">They steer out across the prairie in a1912 Overland auto. Ursula runs after them, slaps the back fender and hops around on one foot, pretending the other was run over. Abby laughs. She knows this stunt.\nWhen they are gone Ursula turns fiercely on Bill.U\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">URSULA\n<P ID=\"dia\">I hate you.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">What for? Don't be any more of a pain in the neck than you gotta\nbe, okay?\nShe swings at him with her fist. He pushes her away._\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">You think I like this? I'm doing it for her!\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">URSULA\n<P ID=\"dia\">You scum.\nBill slaps her.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">Still think so?\nShe throws a rock at him and runs off. He catches her, repenting of his meanness.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">I know you can't understand this, but there's nothing I want except good things for Abby and you. Go ahead and hit me back.\nShe hesitates a second, then slaps him as hard as she can. Blood glistens on his lip. He does not say a word in protest. She looks at the wound, horrified, then throws her arms tight around him.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">119\tEXT.

Together they make a little story.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY (o.s.)\n<P ID=\"dia\">We saw grizzly bears and a boar.

He minds his business and isn't full of baloney.\nChuck turns to Abby and, for nearly the first time, smiles.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHUCK\n<P ID=\"dia\">He's funny.\nBill holds a plate up for Abby to see. Limoges china. Abby rolls her eyes and spits out a cherry pit.

He can do a duck. Show them.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">Stand back. Get the women and children someplace safe.\nChuck, feeling it would be wrong not to enter the spirit of the occasion, does his imitation. The likeness is astonishing.

Bill drums on the table with his spoon.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">You saw how modest he was?\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">How'd you get along so long without a woman?\nChuck shrugs.

The rabbit jumps out of the way.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">Don't you ever behave that way at table!\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(to Chuck)\n<P ID=\"dia\">She's adopted. I had nothing to do with her upbringing. I'd trade her off for a yellow dog.\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(to Ursula)\n<P ID=\"dia\">Now eat. You want to starve to death?\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">URSULA\n<P ID=\"dia\">That's what you'd like.\nAbby, overcome with impatience, throws her food to the dogs. Ursula catches a grasshopper and holds it out to Chuck.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">URSULA\n<P ID=\"dia\">You give me a quarter to eat this hopper?\nChuck does not reply. She pops it into her mouth anyway, enjoying his look of shock. Bill throws down his fork.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">All right, okay, nobody's hungry anymore. What's the worst thing you ever did, Chuck? Besides missing church and that kind of stuff.\nChuck thinks about this.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHUCK\n<P ID=\"dia\">Once I turned a man out in the middle of winter, without a cent of pay. For  all I know he froze.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">If you went that far, he must've deserved it. What else?\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHUCK\n<P ID=\"dia\">He didn't. I fired him out of resentment.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">Well, you're the boss, right? That's how it works. Got to make decisions on the spot. Anyway, this guy-what's his name?--if I know his kind, which I do, he's probably doing okay for himself, got a hand in\nsomebody else's pocket for a change. Is that all?\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHUCK\n<P ID=\"dia\">All I can think of right now. How about yourself?\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(to Abby)\n<P ID=\"dia\">He wants to know. I'm not going to count setting Blackie's \non fire either. He had it coming.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL (con't)\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(pause)\n<P ID=\"dia\">Once I punched a guy while he was asleep.\nChuck looks surprised. Bill glances at Abby, worried that he might have said too much.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">I was just kidding. Actually a guy I know did, though.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">Maybe he did it to you.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">Yeah. I think so.\nChuck gets up to ring for Miss Carter. Bill looks him up and down. Chuck, though older, is physically more imposing.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">URSULA\n<P ID=\"dia\">Can I have the rabbit?\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">Get serious. I can win money with him.\nShe licks his ear. He laughs.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">URSULA\n<P ID=\"dia\">I want that bunny.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">You still believe in Santa Claus.\nBill closes his eyes as he feels the soft fur of the rabbit.

Here's your pay. Bill takes the envelope Chuck holds out. Then, in a spasm of conscience, he gives it back. \n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHUCK\n<P ID=\"dia\">hat's the matter?\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">I got no right to.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHUCK\n<P ID=\"dia\">Why?\nBill is momentarily at a loss for words.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">I haven't worked hard enough to deserve it. I been goofing off.I\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHUCK\n<P ID=\"dia\">Don't be silly.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">Give it to charity or something.\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(pause)\n<P ID=\"dia\">Don't worry. I always know to look out for myself, because ifI\nI don't, who will? See what I'm driving at?\nChuck sees a sense of honor at work in Bill here, and\nthough he considers the gesture misguided and a little\ngrand, admires him for it.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">129\tEXT. BASESU\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">They play a game with big lace pillows for bases. The\nrules are unintelligible.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">130\tNEW ANGLE\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Bill is expert at throwing knives. As the others watch, he goes into a big windup and pins a playing card to the side of the house.U\nEveryone seems happy and congenial. They have reached some kind of plateau. Chuck's ignorance of the ruse does not cause the others to treat him with less respect. They seem themselves almost to have forgotten it. \n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">131\tBILL AND ABBY'S POV - LATERU\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Benson collects the bases, a job he doubtless feels is beneath him.\nThe Doctor's wagon, unmistakable even at such a great distance, thunders away from the Belvedere.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">132\tTIGHT ON BILL AND ABBYU\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Bill and Abby, waiting for Chuck to join them for a swim,U\nlook questioningly at each other.S\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">133\tEXT.

Abby wades in the shallows with a parasol.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">134\tTIGHT ON ABBY AND URSULA - LATER\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Abby is teaching Ursula how to kiss.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">Too like a mule.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">URSULA\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(trying again)\n<P ID=\"dia\">What about that?\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">It's got to be--how should I say?-- more relaxed.\nThey laugh and kiss again.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">135\tNEW ANGLE\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Farther up the slope Bill and Chuck wring out their bathing suits. Bill, thinking of the Doctor's visit, puts a hand on Chuck's shoulder. This time Chuck does not stiffen or ease it off.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">You okay?\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHUCK\n<P ID=\"dia\">Sure. Why?\nBill shrugs, beaming with admiration for this man who does not burden others with his secrets.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">I appreciate everything you've done for Abby. I really do. You've given her all the things she always deserved. I got to admit you have.\nChuck looks off, embarrassed but oddly pleased. Bill snatches up a handful of weeds and smells them.\n<b>.\n</b></p><p><p ID=\"slug\">136\tCRANE SHOT\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Returning home they portray the movements of the sun, earth and moon \nrelative to each other. Abby is the sun and keeps up a steady pace across \nthe prairie.\nChuck, the earth, circles her at a trot, giving instructions. Bill, with the \nmost strenuous role of all--the moon-- runs around Chuck while he circles Abby.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">137\tEXT. PRAIRIE - SERIES OF ANGLES\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">They play golf on the infinite fairway of the prairie. Bill and Abby make a team against Chuck and Ursula. Nightingales call out like mermaids from the sea.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">You liking it here?\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(she nods)\n<P ID=\"dia\">Feel good?\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(she nods)\n<P ID=\"dia\">Feels good to feel good.\nHe smiles, satisfied that he has done well by her, and lets a new ball slip down his pant leg to replace the one he played.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">138\tNEW ANGLE\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Ursula, meanwhile, grinds Abby's ball into the dirt with the heel of her boot. She winks at Chuck. Chuck smiles back.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHUCK\n<P ID=\"dia\">What's your mother like?\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">URSULA\n<P ID=\"dia\">Her? Like somebody that just got hit on the head. She used to pray for me. Rosary, the stations, everything. \"Hey, Ma,\" I tell her, \"I ain't crippled.\" They don't know, though. They say you're in trouble. They don't know.\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(pause)\n<P ID=\"dia\">My dad, the same way. Thought the world owed him a living. He drowned in Lake Michigan.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">139\tEXT. BELVEDERE\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">They walk home. Bill stays behind to work on his strokes. Ursula sends the dogs after the balls.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">You shag them, not those dogs. They might choke or run off with them.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">URSULA\n<P ID=\"dia\">Who made you the boss? Shag them yourself.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">Listen, some day all this is going to be mine. Or half is. Somebody like that, you want to get on his good side, not give him a lot of gas. You want to do what he says.\nHe steps off a few paces of his future kingdom and draws a deep breath.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">This reminds me of where I came from. I left when I was six. That's when I met your sister.\nHe looks at the land with a new sense of reverence. He snatches up a handful of grass and rolls it between his palms.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">I can't wait to go back to Chicago, bring them down for a visit. Blackie and them. There's a lot of satisfaction in showing up people who thought you'd never amount to anything.\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(pause)\n<P ID=\"dia\">I'd really like to see this place run right. I got a lot of ideas I'd like to try out.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">140\tBILL'S POV AND TIGHT ON BILL\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">In the distance he sees Chuck put his arm on Abby's waist and whisper something in her ear. This intimacy rubs him the wrong way. He gives his clubs to Ursula and starts after them.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">141\tINT. KITCHEN\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Bill finds them in the kitchen. Chuck goes into the other room to look for something. Abby lifts the cigarette out of Bill's mouth, takes a drag and does a French inhale. Bill kisses her.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">Nobody's all bad, are they?\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">I met a few I was wrong on, then.\nSuddenly they hear Chuck's footsteps. They pull back just in time, Abby returning the cigarette to him behind her back. They chat as though nothing had happened.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">I have a headache. I probably should've worn a hat.\nAbby rolls her eyes at this improvisation. No sooner does Chuck turn his back than Bill's hand darts out to touch her breast. He snatches it away a moment before Chuck turns back.\nTogether they walk into the living room.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">You ever see anybody out here?\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHUCK\n<P ID=\"dia\">Not after harvest.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">How often do you get into town?\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHUCK\n<P ID=\"dia\">Once or twice a year.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">You're kidding. He must be kidding.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHUCK\n<P ID=\"dia\">Why do I need to?\nBill catches Abby's eyes. He frowns at the idea of being cooped up with this Mormon all winter.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">Relaxation. Look at the girls. Opportunity to see how other folks live.\nChuck looks at him blankly. None of these reasons seems to carry\nmuch weight for him. Bill turns to Abby.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">Somebody is nuts. I don't know whether it's him or me, but somebody is definitely nuts.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">Why don't I fix tea?\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">Maybe I should help you.\nHe follows her back into the kitchen, where he starts to kiss her. She pushes him away and turns to making the tea.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">You're worse than an Airedale.\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(raising her voice)\n<P ID=\"dia\">You want jasmine or mint?\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHUCK (o.s.)\n<P ID=\"dia\">Mint.\nBill lifts up the back of her dress and looks under it, testing the breadth of his license. She slaps it back down. He lifts it again, standing on his right to. She glowers at him.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">Don't do that.\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(calling to Chuck)\n<P ID=\"dia\">How much sugar?\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">Why not? I'm just seeing what kind of material it's made of.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHUCK (o.s.)\n<P ID=\"dia\">One spoonful.\nBill walks around absentmindedly, inspecting Chuck's things, stealing whatever catches his fancy. A book, a paperweight, a bell--things he does not really want and has no use for. His conscience is clear, however; the sacrifices they are making excuse these little sins.\nAs Chuck walks in, Bill has pocketed a candlestick.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">Where's the candlestick?\nChuck shrugs. Bill gives Abby a cold look and goes outside.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHUCK\n<P ID=\"dia\">He's a strange one.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(nodding)\n<P ID=\"dia\">Once he named his shoes like they were pets. It was a joke, I guess.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">142\tEXT. WELL\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Bill drops the candlestick down the well, stands for a moment, then punches the bucket with his fist. He looks up. Benson has seen him.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">143\tEXT. SAPLINGS AGAINST WINDOW - NIGHT\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Outside the saplings thrash in the wind.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">144\tINT. BEDROOM - NIGHT\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Abby wakes up with a gasp.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHUCK\n<P ID=\"dia\">What's the matter?\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">I had a dream.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHUCK\n<P ID=\"dia\">What about?\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(pause)\n<P ID=\"dia\">Was something after you?\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">I forgot it already.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">145\tAERIAL SHOT (STOCK)\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">The camera falls through the clouds as though in a lost fragment of Abby's dreams.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">146\tEXT. BARN\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Benson sulks by the barn. Chuck approaches him.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHUCK\n<P ID=\"dia\">You come down here a lot, don't you? Always when you're mad. You never change.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BENSON\n<P ID=\"dia\">It might not be my place to say this, sir, but I don't think they're honest people.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHUCK\n<P ID=\"dia\">He gets on your nerves, doesn't he? He always has.\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(cutting in)\n<P ID=\"dia\">Now don't say something you're going to regret.\n<b>.\n</b></p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BENSON\n<P ID=\"dia\">Why should I regret it? I think they're a pair of scam artists,\nsir. Let me tell you what I've seen, and you judge for yourself.\nChuck, who of course has seen the same things and more, raises a hand to silence him.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHUCK\n<P ID=\"dia\">Maybe you'd be happier taking over the north end till spring. I don't say this in anger. We've been together a long time, and I've always felt about you like, well, close. It just might work out better is all. Less friction.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BENSON\n<P ID=\"dia\">Don't believe me, then. You shouldn't. But why not check it out, sir? Hire a detective in Chicago. It won't cost much. What's there to lose?\nChuck's brow darkens as Benson goes on. For a moment we glimpse the anger that would be unleashed if ever he woke up. Somewhere he already knows the truth but refuses to acknowledge it.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHUCK\n<P ID=\"dia\">You're talking about my wife.\nAnd so Chuck, too, becomes an accomplice in the scheme.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BENSON\n<P ID=\"dia\">Maybe I better pack my things.\nBenson turns and walks off. Chuck watches him go, ashamed at himself. What has this man done but a friend's duty?\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">147\tINT. MASTER BEDROOM\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Abby sits at the dresser in the master bedroom. Bill walks in through the door and tries Chuck's hat on for size.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">What're you doing in here?\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">Just walked in through the door, like any other white man.\nOn the bureau he finds a pistol. He aims it out the window. All this will soon be theirs!\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">Smith and Wesson. You ought to see one of these plow into a watermelon.\nShe holds a hairbrush out for him to see. He looks it over and  gives it back without comment. He finds a stain on the tabletop.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">Somebody's been staining this fake inlay with a water glass. Actually I don't blame them.\nHe walks around trying out more of Chuck's appurtenances. Abby, caught up, models a shawl before an imaginary mirror. She blows a kiss at herself.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">Don't say I did that.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">The bed should be over next to the window. Where the view is.\nBill is already making plans for life after Chuck's demise.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">Maybe we build on a balcony.\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(pause)\n<P ID=\"dia\">First the birds go.\nThe peacocks are crowing outside. They burst out laughing. Bill checks the mussed bedsheets.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">That doesn't concern you.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">Why not?\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(no reply)\n<P ID=\"dia\">Look, I know you've got urges. It wouldn't be right if you didn't.\nAbby stands up, angry.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">You think I enjoy it?\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">Lower your voice.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">You act like it's harder on you than me! I never want to talk\nabout this again.\nBill, consoled, holds an eyelet blouse against the light.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">I bet he enjoys looking at you in this.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">I thought you liked it.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">He likes it, too, is what I'm saying.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">Well, it's the style.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">I see.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">What do you want me to wear in this heat? A blanket?\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">That's your problem.\nAbby puts on her wedding bracelet and admires it. Bill softens at the sight of her beauty, properly adorned.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">I told you someday we'd be living in style. When this whole thing is over I'm going to buy you a necklace with diamonds as big as that.\nHe holds out the tip of his little finger. They laugh, as though they suddenly felt the absurdity of all this make-believe.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">You're cute. Maybe a shade too cute.\nShe touches his face sympathetically, as though to say that she knows the pain this was causing him.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">This is terrible for us both. \n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHUCK (o.s.)\n<P ID=\"dia\">Abby?\nThey jump as Chuck calls up from downstairs.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">Down in a minute.\nShe kisses Bill.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">148\tEXT. BACK DOOR OF BELVEDERE\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Bill sneaks out the back door of' the Belvedere, only to find Benson drinking at the well. They look at each other in silence for a moment. Benson's horse stands beside him, a suitcase fixed to the saddle.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BENSON\n<P ID=\"dia\">I know what you're doing.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">What're you talking about?\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BENSON\n<P ID=\"dia\">That boy's like a son to me. Don't you forget it. I know what you're doing.\nBenson gets on his horse, turns and rides off. Miss Carter waves goodbye from the side of the house. She and Bill exchange a look.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">149\tEXT. FRONT PORCH\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Bill finds the others around front. Abby lolls in the hammock writing in her diary and eating a peach. Ursula plays the guitar.\nLittle by little the newcomers have done the house over from the austere structure that it was. Living room furniture has been moved out onto the front lawn and there arranged as though by a child. Goats sleep on the divan. Archery targets hang from the side of the house. The porch is covered with a striped awning, bird cages and twirls of bunting. Everywhere an atmosphere of drunken ease prevails.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">Nice fall day.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">URSULA\n<P ID=\"dia\">Wish I'd said that.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(to Abby)\n<P ID=\"dia\">Watcha doing?\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">Eating a green peach. 'Spect to die any minute.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">Listen, I had a great idea. Let's spend Christmas in Chicago. Break\nup the old routine. Rhino's never been to a baseball game or a horse\nrace. I know guys one month off the boat that have. Don't even\nspeak the English language, but they eat it right up.\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(pause)\n<P ID=\"dia\">You're just a young guy, Rhino; you oughta be running around\nraising hell. No offense to the little woman.\nHe bows apologetically to Abby. She pinches a dead leaf off a plant.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHUCK\n<P ID=\"dia\">Abby says that in the poor section people eat cats.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">Did you, sis? Well, there's always something doing. I can't\nbegin to tell you. State and Madison? Mmmm. Lights everywhere.\nYou'd love it.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHUCK\n<P ID=\"dia\">It can be rough, though.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">Rough? Listen, you can't walk down the street without somebody\nreaching in your pocket! You've got to keep your coat like this\nand poke them away.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">Bill got shot once. The bullet's still in him.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHUCK\n<P ID=\"dia\">Really?\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">Doctor said he took it out, but I never saw it. Hurt like a bastard.\nYou got no idea how it hurt.\nSuddenly he worries this might discourage Chuck from going.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">They won't mess with you, though. Big fella like you. I can see it\nnow.\nHe offers a taste of the talk Chuck is like to provoke on the street corners.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">\"Hey, hey, hey. Who's this here, fresh out of the African Jungle,\nmoving down the sidewalk with a whowhowho, taking ten feet at a step\nand making all the virgins run for cover? Why, it's Big Rhino, the\nKing of Beasts. He walks, he talks, he sucks up chalk.\"\nBill steps back and sees, as though for the first time, how imposing Chuck really is.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">You are big, aren't you? Sunny Jim! You must've had a real moose\nfor an old lady.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">Take it easy.\nBut Chuck holds none of this against him. He knows it comes from respect.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">So what do you say?\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(pause)\n<P ID=\"dia\">What a sorry outfit! Bunch of old ladies. You better stay behind.\nYour mammas'd probably get upset.\nBut when the time comes, I'm out of here. Hit the road, Toad!\nUrsula passes the sandwiches around until there is just\none left, Miss Carter's. While the others are talking,\nshe scoops up a handful of dirt and pours it into the middle.\nBill, lighting a cigarette, notices Chuck's hand on Abby's.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">Ever seen a match burn twice?\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHUCK\n<P ID=\"dia\">No.\nBill blows out the match and touches Chuck's hand with\nthe hot ember, causing him to yank it away.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">That's old.\nChuck starts to cough. Bill looks at Abby, then whips the handkerchief out of his pocket and puts it over his nose, as though to keep from getting Chuck's germs.\nMiss Carter's face goes blank as she bites into her sandwich.\nShe jumps up and rushes back into the house. Chuck frowns.\nBill glares at Ursula, then turns to Chuck and, referring to the dead prairie grass which runs through the front yard right up to the house, continues:\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">You ever thought of putting in some fescue here? Some fescue grass?\nOf course, it might not take in this soil.\nChuck stands up and winds a stole, a long religious scarf, around his neck.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHUCK\n<P ID=\"dia\">You ready?\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">I still have a little of this sore throat. Where you going, though?\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHUCK\n<P ID=\"dia\">To kill a hog.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">What's the necktie for?\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(pause)\n<P ID=\"dia\">Or does it just come in handy?\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHUCK\n<P ID=\"dia\">Keeps the stain of guilt off.\nChuck nods goodbye and walks off, taking a stool with him. Bill sighs with admiration.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">I try and try.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">What a splendid person! I've never met anybody like him!\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">Splendid people make you nervous.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">They do! I breathe a sigh of relief when they step outside the room.\nBill puts on his boater and opens a copy of the Police Gazette. \nThey are silent for a moment. \n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">A guy ate a brick on a bet. Must of busted it up first with a hammer. Guy in New York City. Where else?\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(Jumping up)\n<P ID=\"dia\">Anybody want to bet me I can't stick this knife in that post?\nNobody takes him up on this. Abby leafs through the\nSears catalogue, her mind dancing with visions of splendor.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">150\tTIGHT ON CATALOGUE\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Pictured. in the catalogue are bath oils and corsets and feathered hats. A grasshopper is perched on the page among them, its eyes blank and dumb.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">151\tTIGHT ON ROSE\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Bill watches her run her finger slowly around the closed heart of a rose. Suddenly they both look at each other. They have heard the squeals, faint but unmistakable, of a hog being led to slaughter.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">152\tTIGHT ON STOOL - QUICK CUT\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Chuck has tied the hog's feet to the inverted legs of  the stool.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">153\tOTHER QUICK CUTS\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Ursula, off by herself, skips rope.\nA flag on the pole by the front gate snaps in the breeze. From the branch of a lone tree the hog dangles by its hocks into the mouth of a barrel.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">154\tEXT. BELVEDERE - ABBY'S POV FROM SECOND FLOOR WINDOW\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Miss Carter storms down the hill with her bags. Fed up, she is leaving the bonanza. Chuck tries in vain to appease her. She keeps walking, out the front gate and into the prairie on a straight course for the railroad tracks.\nChuck will now be alone at the Belvedere with the newcomers and no other point of reference.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">155\tEXT. CLOTHES LINE\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Later that afternoon, Bill catches sight of Abby's underthings rustling on the clothes line.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">156\tINT. STAIRS\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">That evening he watches her from behind as she climbs the stairs to join Chuck at their bedroom door. She nods goodnight, sensing the jealousy that is growing in him.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">157\tINT. MASTER BEDROOM\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Chuck looks impatiently through a drawer.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHUCK\n<P ID=\"dia\">I can't find anything around here. Last week it was my gloves; this\nweek my talc. What's going on?\nHe stands and watches Abby get ready for bed. She fills him with a deep adoration. He feels that in the tulip of her mouth at last he has found heaven.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHUCK\n<P ID=\"dia\">You're beautiful.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">You don't think my skin's too fair?\nHe comes up behind her and touches her long hair.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHUCK\n<P ID=\"dia\">You're smart, too, aren't you?\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">I know what the Magna Carta is.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHUCK\n<P ID=\"dia\">Can I help you brush it out?\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">Not right now.\nShe is cold to discourage false expectations in him--and because she feels that she at least owes Bill this. Chuck, however, assumes the fault must be his own. His naivete about women, and the world in general, protects\nthe conspirators--and protects him, too, for he glimpses enough of the truth not to want to know any more.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHUCK\n<P ID=\"dia\">What makes you so distant with me?\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">Distant? I don't mean to be.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHUCK\n<P ID=\"dia\">You know what I'm talking about,  though. You aren't that way\nwith your brother.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">158\tINT.ATTIC\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Bill, eavesdropping in the attic above them, surveys Chuck's dusty heirlooms.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHUCK (o.s.)\n<P ID=\"dia\">It must be something I'm doing. I wish you'd tell me what, though.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">159\tINT. BEDROOM\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">These gentle endearments, so rarely heard from Bill, stir her deeply. She throws herself in his arms.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">Oh, Chuck I Please forgive me. Does it mean anything that I'm\nsorry?\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHUCK\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(pleased) \n<P ID=\"dia\">But I don't blame you. Did I make it sound that way?\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">You should. You have a right to.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHUCK\n<P ID=\"dia\">It's just that sometimes I feel I don't know you well.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">You don't. It's true.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHUCK\n<P ID=\"dia\">I think you love me better than before, though.\nShe rubs her cheek against his hands. Daily she feels warmer toward him. How much of this is love, how much respect or devotion, even she cannot say.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">160\tTIGHT ON BILL - LATER - NIGHT\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">The night throbs with crickets. Bill cracks open the bedroom door. Chuck lies asleep in a shaft of moonlight next to Abby. He hesitates a moment, but a strange compulsion drives him on. He has never done anything\nso dangerous, or had so little idea why.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">161\tINT. BEDROOM - NIGHT\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Abby wakes up to find him staring her in the face. He kisses her. Chuck stirs. Abby signals they should go outside.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">162\tEXT. BELVEDERE - DAY FOR NIGHT\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">They sneak out of the Belvedere. The night is warm.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">You're no good.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">Mmmm. But I love you.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">I can't stand it any more. This is just so cruel. We're both no\ngood. I've got to get drunk with you, Bill. You know what I mean?\nDrunk.\nBill wags a bottle. The dogs, awakened, bay from the kennel. They wait a moment to see if a light will go on in the house, then dart off toward the fields. A plaster lawn dwarf seems to watch them go.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">163\tEXT. FIELDS - DAY FOR NIGHT\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">They run through the fields, hand in hand, laughing and flirting. The moon makes Abby's nightgown a ghostly white.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">We can never do this again, though. Okay? It really is too dangerous.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">This one night.\nHe toes a sodden old shoe.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">Hey, I found a shoe.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">164\tSHOE, COYOTES, SCARECROW - DAY FOR NIGHT\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">The shoe gleams in the moonlight. Coyotes yelp from the hilltops. A scarecrow spreads its arms against the sky. The waving fields of wheat have given way to vast reaches of cleanly shaven stubble, stained with purple morning glories. Odd, large stakes are planted among them.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">165\tNEW ANGLE - DAY FOR NIGHT\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">You want me to spin you around?\nShe nods okay. He takes her by the hands and spins her around the way he used to--until they go reeling off, too dizzy to stand.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">166\tEXT. RIVER BANK - DAY FOR NIGHT\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">They lie by the river looking at the great dome of stars. Bill wants to believe things are the same between them as before. So does Abby--but she knows better.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">Suppose we woke up tomorrow and it was a thousand years ago. I\nmean, with all we know? Electricity, the telephone, radio, that kind of\nstuff. They'd never figure out how we came up with it all. Maybe\nthey'd kill us.\nShe looks at him, and they laugh.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">You sleepy?\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">This is the first time we slept together in a while, Bill.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">You like it?\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">Of course.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">Kiss me, then.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">It's so sweet to be able to kiss you when I want to.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">167\tNEW ANGLE\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Before the marriage his lovemaking was gentle and soft. Now it has a brutal air, as though he were asserting his right to her for the last time.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">168\tTIGHT ON ABBY - DAWN\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Dawn is breaking. Abby jumps to her feet, alarmed. They have slept too long.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">169\tEXT. BELVEDERE - DAWN\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">They have run back to the Belvedere. It seems they are safe until Chuck appears on the porch, yawning and stretching. Bill drops to the ground while Abby goes ahead.\nAbby appears at one side of the house while Bill steals around the other. Luckily, they have come up from the back.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHUCK\n<P ID=\"dia\">Abby! I've been looking all over for you. Where have you been?\nWhile she distracts Chuck, Bill slips back in the house. It has been a close call.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">Watching the ducks.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHUCK\n<P ID=\"dia\">Didn't you sleep well?\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">No.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">170\tTIGHT ON ABBY (DISSOLVE TO PAGE, THEN TO URSULA)\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Abby looks sympathetically at Chuck. Her face dissolves into a page of her diary and from there to Ursula, balancing an egg on her fingertip.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY (o.s.)\n<P ID=\"dia\">Chuck saw Ursula balance an egg. He begged her to repeat this trick,\nbut she wouldn't.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">171\tTIGHT ON CHUCK\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Chuck tries to reduplicate Ursula's feat. Abby, amused, reaches out and touches his face.\nWe wonder if, despite herself, she might be falling in love with him.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">172\tEXT. BELVEDERE\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Bill watches the Doctor walk out the front door and down the steps to his wagon. Chuck follows, smiling.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY (o.s.)\n<P ID=\"dia\">The Doctor came. Chuck looked pleased for a change.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">173\tEXT. PRAIRIE - BILL'S POV\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">The Doctor's wagon rolls off across the prairie.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY (o.s.)\n<P ID=\"dia\">Tomorrow the President passes through. Plans have changed, and he can't stop.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">174\tEXT. RAILROAD TRACKS - DUSK\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">They have come down to the railroad tracks to watch the President pass through.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">URSULA\n<P ID=\"dia\">We should have brought a flag.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">Does she have time to ride back and get it?\nAbby and Bill hold hands. Chuck by now is accustomed to such displays. They seem, however, to make Abby increasingly uncomfortable.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">175\tMOVING TRAIN - THEIR POVS\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">The train bursts past at twenty yards, its great light rolling like a lunatic eye. Bill's heart pounds with excitement. Chuck holds Abby by the waist. Ursula waves a handkerchief... They cannot make out anything specific in the windows, but there is the sense of people going more important places, getting on with the serious business of their lives - while out here they stagnate.\nDimly visible, on the back platform of the caboose, a MAN in a frock coat salutes them with his cane.\nThe train has quickly vanished into the declining sun. Everything is quiet again. Ursula rushes up the grade to collect some pennies she laid on the tracks.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">Did you see him wave?\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHUCK\n<P ID=\"dia\">He was shorter than I expected.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">How do you know it was him?\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">I saw!  He had a hat on.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">You didn't understand my question.\nThey walk back to the buggy. Ursula holds up a dead snake she found on the tracks.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">URSULA\n<P ID=\"dia\">You know what I'm going to do with this? Take it home and put it in\nvinegar.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">That was the President, shortie. Wake up.\nBill watches Chuck help Abby into the buggy. She is laughing about something or other. His hand lingers for a moment on hers. She does not brush it aside, as once she might have, but to Bill's dismay, presses\nit against her breast. Chuck seems to have breathed a hope into her that he, Bill, was never able to.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">176\tEXT. FIELDS\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Abby and Ursula race across the fields trying to fly a kite. Ursula rides a tiny Shetland pony. Just as the wind lifts the kite away, they run into Bill. He sits by himself observing a spear of grass. Abby drops off. Ursula rides off over the hill with the kite, leaving her alone with Bill.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">You look deep in thought.\nShe touches his cheek. He brushes her hand away.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">What's the matter?\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">Nothing.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">There's nothing wrong?\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">No.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY \n<P ID=\"dia\">What're you so mad about then?\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">Who said I was mad?\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">Can't I be alone once in a while without everybody getting all\nworked up? \n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">You're the only person getting worked up.\nSome buffalo appear on the crest of the next hill. Abby looks at them. They do not seem quite part of this world but mythical, like minotaurs.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">Chuck says they're good for the grass.\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(pause)\n<P ID=\"dia\">Stop giving me that look.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">You can't keep your hands off him these days.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">What're you talking about?\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">You know.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">I haven't touched him.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">How about the other night? I saw you, Abby. The other night\nby the tracks? If only you wouldn't lie! Really, there's\nsome things about you I'm never going to understand.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">I forgot. Anyway it doesn't matter. What are you doing, always trying\nto trap me?\nBill paces around, disgusted with himself and the whole situation.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">I can't stand it any more. It's just too degrading.\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(pause) \n<P ID=\"dia\">You and him. Why do I have to spell it out? I thought it would be all\nover in a month or two. Guy might go another five years. We've got to\nclear out, Abby.\nThey stare at each other in silence for a moment.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">Why stop now?\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(pause)\n<P ID=\"dia\">We've come this far.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">What?\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">You heard me.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">Why stay? Go ahead and tell me! I'm standing here.\nBill trembles with shock and anger. The buffalo cast aware glances at them.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">You want us to lose everything?\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">I'm telling you I can't stand it.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">You're weak then. What about all I've been through?\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(pause)\n<P ID=\"dia\">And what about him? It would be the worst thing we could do. Worse\nthan anything so far. It would break his heart.\nBill is silent for a moment.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">You're getting to like him, aren't you?\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">It would kill him. Leaving now would be just cruel.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">Would it? So what's it matter to somebody in his shape?\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(pause)\n<P ID=\"dia\">In fact you're just leaving us one way out.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">What're you talking about? Murdering him? Ursula comes riding over the hill, without the kite.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">You watch and see.  \n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">URSULA\n<P ID=\"dia\">I had to let it go. One of them started following me, and I threw\na rock at him. I had a bunch stored in my pocket.\nThey take off running after her.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">177\tEXT. BELVEDERE\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">As they approach the Belvedere, Bill sees Chuck standing on the front steps. Suddenly angry, he draws Abby to him and in plain view kisses her on the lips.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">He can see you!\nBill nods; he knows. Abby runs ahead, angry and alarmed.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">Don't you believe in being honest?\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">178\tNEW ANGLE\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Abby bounds up the steps. Chuck has bent his mind to understand all this as mere sibling love, but here is the greatest test so far.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">Aren't you going to kiss me?\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHUCK\n<P ID=\"dia\">Why?\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">Today's my birthday.\nChuck gives her a kiss, glad to put aside his suspicions.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">179\tTIGHT ON POINTERS, QUAIL AND PHEASANTS\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Tails level, their noses thrust high in the air, a pair of pointers prance through the high uplands grass, following a scent like sailors taking in a rope. Pheasants and quail tremble in their coveys, their eyes big with fear.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">180\tEXT. UPLANDS\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Chuck has taken Bill out bird-hunting. They wear heavy canvas leggings and carry shotguns.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">Did you ever tell Abby the buffalo help keep up the grass?\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHUCK\n<P ID=\"dia\">I think so. Why?\nBill shrugs. Chuck welcomes this opportunity to speak of his wife. He considers Bill a good friend, in fact the only person with whom he can talk about delicate matters.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHUCK\n<P ID=\"dia\">I want to get her something nice for Christmas.\nBill, who means to kill Chuck the first chance he gets, forgets this intention for a moment to give him advice.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(thoughtfully)\n<P ID=\"dia\">She likes to draw. Maybe some paints. Nothing too expensive--\nshe might want to exchange it. Maybe a coat. She likes to show\noff sometimes. She's sweet that way.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHUCK\n<P ID=\"dia\">I wish I knew how to make her happy. Nothing I do really seems to.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">That's how they are. They like to make you work for it. I couldn't\never figure out why.\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(pause)\n<P ID=\"dia\">Sometimes you can't go wrong, though. You know that one Abby showed you a picture of? Elizabeth? I took her cherry.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHUCK\n<P ID=\"dia\">I know. You told me.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">Actually, I didn't, but I could have. The point I'm making is you've got\nto understand how they operate. Get them thinking you can take it or\nleave it, you're usually okay.\nSuddenly the dogs stop rigid, on point. At Chuck's hiss they sink into the  grass.\nBill looks at Chuck's exposed back. Nobody would know. It could be made to seem like a hunting accident. He cocks the hammer of his shotgun. His heart pounds wildly. Chuck talks in a low voice to the dogs.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHUCK (o.s.)\n<P ID=\"dia\">All right, put them up, girl.\nThe dogs rise and inch toward the birds, as slowly as the minute hand of a clock. All at once the quail explode out of hiding. Bill jumps at the noise. Chuck fires twice. Two birds fall. The retriever notes where. Chuck turns around.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHUCK\n<P ID=\"dia\">Why aren't you shooting? I left you those two on the left.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">They caught me off guard.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHUCK\n<P ID=\"dia\">You have to keep your gun up.\nChuck walks ahead. The music builds a mood of tension. Bill takes a practice shot into the ground. Bill looks around. There is nobody in sight. He turns the sights on Chuck's back. It would be simple enough.\nThough only twenty feet away, he closes the gap, to make sure he does not miss.\nChuck whistles the scattered birds back to their covey. \"Pheo! Pheo!\" Soon, faint and far away, comes a reply-the sweet, pathetic whistle of the quail lost in a forest of grass. The mother bird utters a low \"all is well.\"\nOne by one, near and far, the note is taken up, and they begin to return.\nBill holds his breath. His finger moves inside the trigger guard. He only has to squeeze a fraction of an inch. Three more birds shoot out of the grass. Chuck fires. At first we think Bill has, but he cannot stoop this low. He does not have the heart. Disgusted, he throws his gun on the ground. Both barrels go off. Chuck snaps around, startled and concerned. Bill is\nshaking like a leaf.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHUCK\n<P ID=\"dia\">What's the matter? What are you so upset about?\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">They surprised me again. Chuck sends a retriever after the fallen birds, then--in an unprecedented gesture-he puts his arm over Bill's shoulder to comfort him, like an older brother.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">181\tNEW ANGLE\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">They return home, the day's kill slung over the back of a Shetland pony.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">182\tEXT. BACK YARD\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">They sit on stools in the back yard plucking the birds.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">You like to box?\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHUCK\n<P ID=\"dia\">I never have.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">Just wondering. I got a pair of gloves I brought with me.\nBill feels oddly better, as though Chuck had backed down.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHUCK\n<P ID=\"dia\">Abby bought me this at Yellowstone.\nChuck shows Bill his knife. Bill reads a name off the handle.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">That's what she calls you? 'Chickie?'\nHe gets up, his nostrils flaring with anger. Chuck thinks this indignance is on his behalf.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHUCK\n<P ID=\"dia\">Doesn't bother me. Should it?\nBill throws down the pheasant he was plucking.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHUCK\n<P ID=\"dia\">What's the matter?\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">Don't let her fool you, too. She warms up to whoever says please and thank you.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHUCK\n<P ID=\"dia\">What's the matter?\nBill, still angry at himself, considers telling him.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">You really want to know?\nHe would like Chuck to know the truth but does not want theresponsibility for revealing it. He must find out by accident.\nLuckily they are interrupted as Ursula runs up, pointing over her shoulder. A pair of three-wing airplanes sputters into view low overhead. One seems to be having engine trouble.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">183\tEXT. FIELD NEAR BELVEDERE\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">The planes set down in a nearby field. \"Toto's Flying Circus\" is emblazoned on the wings.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">184\tNEW ANGLE\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Five PEOPLE clamber out, members of a seedy vaudeville troupe. They swagger around, filthy with oil from the backwash of the props, looking more like convicts than entertainers. Their LEADER is an excitable Levantine.\n<b>LEADER\n</b>How long it take to fix? Very mooch time! Now look where you\nhab stuck us. Salaupe! You forget who I aim!\nBill, Abby and Ursula approach the aircraft with the greatest caution, like the Indians at Cortez's ships.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">185\tEXT. SCREEN - NIGHT\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">A JUGGLER and a SNAKE CHARMER perform first separately,\nthen jointly as a slap act. A DOUBLE TALKER weaves sentences of absolute nonsense. After a moment a black and white image appears over his face and he drops out of sight.\nThe troupe is putting on a show to earn its supper. ONE of them stands behind the viewers -- Abby and Bill, Chuck and Ursula -- cranking a carbide projector by hand. A silent movie appears on the screen, full of extraordinary pratfalls, disappearances and other tricks of the early\ncinema. Chuck has never seen anything remotely like this.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHUCK (o.s.)\n<P ID=\"dia\">How'd they do that? Where'd he go? There must be a wire. Etc.\nHe steps forward to inspect the screen, actually just a sheet hung along a clothesline, to see whether the image is coming from behind. Bill and Abby sit rapt as children, nostalgic for Chicago.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">186\tEXT. DINNER TABLE - NIGHT\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Ursula serves dinner. She is excited by the visitors'\ncity ways. They are bored with her, all except the\nyoungest, GEORGE, a young pilot in a white scarf.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">URSULA\n<P ID=\"dia\">We never hear a thing out here. It's like being on a boat in the\nmiddle of a lake. You see things going on, but way far away, with no voices.\n<b>GEORGE\n</b>Maybe time to clear out.\nGeorge puts his hand on hers. She snatches it away.\n<b>GEORGE\n</b>What's the matter? Aren't I your\ntype or something?\nThe Doubletalker pokes his fork into a pudding. A balloon, concealed beneath the surface, explodes to general delight. Down the table Abby and Bill chat with the Leader.\n<b>LEADER\n</b>You do not understand, sir. I am saddled with asses, yaays? I, who\nonce played the Albert Hall\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">You. hear that? He called me 'sir.'\nIn their gaiety he carelessly puts a hand on Abby's leg.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">187\tTIGHT ON CHUCK - NIGHT\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Chuck looks on from the shadows, no longer just puzzled but angry. He has watched them behave this way a dozen times before, but tonight, with other people around, he must see it more directly.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">188\tEXT. STRAW STACK - NIGHT\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">George tells Ursula a joke. She dissolves in giggles before he can finish, as though amazed at his power to dispense illusion.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">189\tINT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Chuck, alone in the darkened living room, calms himself down by breathing through a rubber mask into a respirator. Joyful noises reach him from outside.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">190\tCHUCK'S POV - NEXT MORNING\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">The next morning Chuck looks down out his bedroom window.\nThe troupe is packing to leave. Still troubled, he walks to the bed and and stands over Abby.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHUCK\n<P ID=\"dia\">What's going on, Abby?\nShe does not respond. He yanks the sheet off. She is wearing a nightgown. She looks up and frowns. This is the first time she has ever seen him this way.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHUCK\n<P ID=\"dia\">You know what I mean. Between you and Bill.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">I have no idea.....\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHUCK\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(interrupting)\n<P ID=\"dia\">Something's not right, and I want to know what.\nAbby jumps out of bed and assumes the offensive. She has no other choice.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">Say it out loud. What're you worried about? \n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(pause)\n<P ID=\"dia\">Incest?\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHUCK\n<P ID=\"dia\">It just doesn't look right. I don't know how brothers and\nsisters carry on where you come from, but...\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(interrupting)\n<P ID=\"dia\">Did you ever have a brother. Then who are you to judge? Maybe if\nyou had, you'd understand. Anyway, times have changed while you've been stuck out in this weed patch. We're\n************************line missing****************\nShe puts on a robe and walks out. Her last argument has worked best. Chuck never imagined he was in step with the times.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">191\tEXT. BELVEDERE\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Abby slips out the front door. She looks around to make sure that Chuck is not watching her, then heads off to find Bill. The vaudevillians gorge themselves on last night's leftovers, steal flowers from the flower beds,\netc. ONE sits off by himself, playing a French horn.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">192\tEXT. DORM\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">She finds Bill by the dorm throwing a switchblade in the ground, a toothbrush in his mouth.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">I have to talk to you.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">Look what I traded off those clowns. For a bushel of corn!\nShe draws him by the arm behind a wall. She is trembling with fear.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">Chuck is suspicious.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">Chickie you mean? So what?\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">Really. This is the first time he's ever been like this. I'm scared.\nAll this flatters Chuck in a way Bill does not like.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">What for? Why're you so worried what he thinks?\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">He could kill us. I want to live a long time, okay? I just got\nstarted and I like it.\nBill shrugs, as though to say he can handle whatever Chuck can dish out and a little more.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">You might take a little responsibility here. You got us into all this.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">Did I? Well, it never would've come up if you hadn't led him on.\nLed Chickie on!\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">Is that the best you can do? Knowing you it probably is.\nYou've made a mess of our lives, okay. Don't pretend it was my\nfault.\nBill combs his hair to calm himself down.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">Why's this guy still hanging on like a goddamn snapping turtle?\nBecause of you. Boy, this was a great idea. Right up there\nwith Lincoln going down to the theater, see what's on!\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">Keep your voice down.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">Don't give me that. When a guy's getting screwed, he's got a right\nto holler.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">You're such a fool!\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">What?\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">Nothing.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">I heard what you said.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">Then why'd you ask? Oh, how did I ever get mixed up with you?\nAbby, in terror of Chuck's finding out, cannot understand why Bill seems to care so little.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">You've gone sweet on him. You have, haven't you?\nAbby hesitates. Bill throws his knife away.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">I admire him. He's a good man.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">Broad shoulders. I know. Very high morals. Why can't he talk\nfaster? It's like waiting for a hen to lay an egg.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">You wouldn't understand, though. He's not like you. You don't\nknow how people feel. You only think of yourself.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">What's going on between us, Abby? Think about that. If you figure it\nout, tell me, will you? I'd appreciate it.\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(pause)\n<P ID=\"dia\">Lord, but you do come on! You talking like this, used to play\naround right under his nose. Somebody I met in a bar, remember?\nOr maybe you walked in, thought it was a church. Well, I've had\nit.I'm clearing out. You understand?\nThey look at each other for a moment.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">Go ahead.\nThis is not what he expected to hear. But now his pride requires that he face the truth and not back down.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">Okay.\nHe looks at her for a moment. He cannot be dealt with this way. He turns and walks off.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">193\tNEW ANGLE\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Ursula flirts with George. He slips a hand inside her blouse. She bats it away.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">194\tEXT. BEDROOM WINDOW\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Bill stands on the ground below the master bedroom. Chuck leans out the window above him. Peacocks roost on the balcony, beneath the telescope. The vaudevillians are loading up their planes. Abby watches from the porch.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">I'm going away for a while. They're giving me a lift.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHUCK\n<P ID=\"dia\">What for?\nHe shrugs.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">I'm wearing one of your shirts. Let me take it off for you.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHUCK\n<P ID=\"dia\">Never mind.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">I got my own. Just wasn't any clean today.\nBill takes off the shirt, drapes it over a post and walks off, hurt and angry, but with a sad dignity.\nChuck is not entirely sorry to see him go, nor is Abby; she knows that he is getting out just in time. One more episode like last night's and the fuse would hit the powder.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">195\tNEW ANGLE\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Bill gives Ursula his money.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">We get split up for any reason, you spend that on school.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">196\tEXT. PRAIRIE\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">The vaudevillians are ready to take off. Bill boards the plane which George is piloting, wondering if today's break with Abby is real or just in anger, a necessary gesture. With him he carries his only possessions, a bindle and his trick rabbit. Abby, Chuck and Ursula look on.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHUCK\n<P ID=\"dia\">What's eating him?\nAbby shrugs and walks down to Ursula.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">URSULA\n<P ID=\"dia\">Why aren't we going with him?\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">What for? To sleep in boxcars?\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">197\tAIRPLANES\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">The planes set their wheels in the furrows, rev their engines and wobble off into the sky. Ursula waves goodbye to George.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">198\tEXT. PLAINS UNDER SNOW - SERIES OF ANGLES\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Winter has come.

SLEIGH (OR ICE BOAT) - SNOW\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Chuck and Abby skim over the snow in a gaily painted sleigh (or ice boat). She is wrapped up snug in a buffalo robe, her feet on a hot brick. Pigs forage along the fences.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">200\tINT. CAVE\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">They inspect a cave with a kerosene lantern. Blocks of ice, covered with burlap and sawdust, cool shelves of preserves.\nAbby drops a stone into a dark pit. Two seconds pass before it hits the bottom.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">Probably that's the first noise down there for thousands of years.\nShe speaks as though she had done it a favor. He puts his hand on hers. She presses it against her chest.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">You ever wish you could turn your heart off for a second and\nsee what happened?\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">201\tOTHER ANGLES\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Views of backlit gems, stalactites, salamanders in their cold dark pools, hidden springs and other mysteries of nature.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY (o.s.)\n<P ID=\"dia\">Maybe nothing would.\nThey round a corner and come upon an underground waterfall. It flows out of darkness back into darkness.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">202\tINT. FORGE\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Bill, meanwhile, stands in a line of panting, sweating IMMIGRANTS.\nOn their shoulders they carry the huge barrel of a cannon. With a grunt they drive it into the fiery mouth of a forge.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">203\tEXT. CITY STREET\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Bill stands on the corner of a big city street, stamping his feet against the cold. He tries to catch a pigeon with some bread crumbs under a box propped up by a stick, but just as he pulls the string to drop the trap it darts\nout of the way.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">204\tBILL AND YOUNG GIRL\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Bill has an improvised conversation with a YOUNG GIRL who has run away from home. He asks her where she comes from, whom she belongs to, etc. She tells him of her hopes, then passes on. Bill gives her all the money in his pocket.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">205\tMONTAGE\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Enthralled, Abby surveys the wonders of Babylon and\nNineveh in a book about the Near East.\nUrsula sits with a world globe, taking a geography lesson from a traveling TUTOR.

FROZEN LAKE -NIGHT\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Abby and Chuck skate around a bonfire on a frozen prairie lake, carrying torches to guide them through the dark.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">207\tINT. CHICAGO FLOPHOUSE\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Bill sits in a cold flophouse trying to write a letter. After a moment he wads it up and throws it away.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">208\tEXT. BELVEDERE\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Abby, Ursula and Chuck are on a walk outside the Belvedere. The snow is gone. Abby's hands are stuffed in a chinchilla muff.\nAll at once they hear a distant noise like the whoops of an Indian war party. It seems mysteriously to come from every hilltop. Abby turns to Chuck with a puzzled look.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHUCK\n<P ID=\"dia\">Prairie chickens. That means winter's broken.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">Really? Where are they?\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHUCK\n<P ID=\"dia\">You hardly ever see them.\nThey stand and listen to the birds. There is a sense of the earth stirring back to life. Abby breathes in with a wild joy and hugs Chuck tightly by the waist.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">209\tEXT. TENEMENT HALLWAY\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Bill is talking with a FRIEND in the hallway of a tenement.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">I can't seem to get my mind on anything. I thought, when I came\noff that place, boy, they'd better get all the women out of town that day, you know? Somewhere safe. But you know what I do? I sleep, nothing but\nsleep.\nA PANHANDLER approaches them with a hard-luck story.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">FRIEND\n<P ID=\"dia\">Okay, here's a quarter, but give me some entertainment, okay?\nNot this old song and dance.\nWhile the Panhandler performs, Bill looks around.\nTwo POLICEMEN have appeared in the entryway talking with the LANDLADY. Bill edges out the back door and down the steps, as though they might be after him.\nHe walks briskly down the alley without looking back.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">210\tTIGHT ON CHUCK (DISSOLVE TO DIARY)\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Chuck holds a handful of seed under his nose. His heart stirs at the dark, mellow smell.\nInto this dissolves an image of Abby writing in her diary.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">211\tEXT. FIELD\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Chuck swings a barometer round and round, checking the weather. Two Case tractors pitch across a field like boats on a rolling sea. Long plumes of smoke wind off behind them. Each tows a fourteen-gang plow. A third\ntractor follows, putting in the seed.\nUrsula chases a flock of blackbirds off with a big rattle.\nEvery acre of ground for as far as the eye can see is under cultivation.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY (o.s.)\n<P ID=\"dia\">They put in the wheat the other day. This will be the biggest\nyear ever. There was a scare\nwhen a locust turned up. Luckily it wasn't the bad kind.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">212\tNEW ANGLE\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">The plows have turned up a hibernating locust. Chuck stands by the tractor, inspecting it under a magnifying glass. The creature nestles like a fossil in the black earth.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY (o.s.)\n<P ID=\"dia\">They sleep in the ground for seventeen years, then crawl up\naround the end of May and spend a week flying around before they die.\nChuck kicks up the dirt around the plow, looking for others. Benson, back from exile, looks concerned.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHUCK\n<P ID=\"dia\">Nothing to worry about. Just shows the land is good.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">213\tSERIES OF ANGLES\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Various wonders of the prairie:  a charred tree, a huge mastodon bone, a flowering bush, a pelican, the rusted hulk of an ancient machine, etc.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY (o.s.)\n<P ID=\"dia\">How strange this new world is! You walk out in the morning\nsometimes to find a lake rippling where the day before solid land\nwas.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">214\tEXT. STONE BOAT\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Chuck has laid out the outline of a 50-foot boat in whitewashed stones. He walks around the imaginary deck showing Abby where the cabins will be.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY (o.s.)\n<P ID=\"dia\">Chuck wants to build a boat and take us off to Java, which he's\nnever seen.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">215\tEXT. FIELDS\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Ursula goes out to the fields with an organist named JOEY\nwhom Chuck has hired to play for the crops. He and Ursula\nseem to hit it off.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY (o.s.)\n<P ID=\"dia\">Last month he brought in a kid to play the organ. He claims it\nhelps the crops grow. Personally I doubt it.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">216\tEXT. MIDDLE OF FIELDS\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">They have brought an organ out into the middle of the fields. Ursula pumps up the bellows. Joey sits in front of the keyboard and shoots his cuffs.\nHis fingers strike the keys.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">217\tCLOUDS, CLOSEUPS OF PLANTS - TIME LAPSE PHOTOGRAPHY (STOCK)\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Clouds build in huge toadstools. Thunder rolls across the\nplains. A rain begins to fall. The music seems to work a magic on the crops, to draw them forth. The seeds germinate in the darkness of the\nsoil. Water finds its way down. Roots, tiny hairs at\nfirst, spread and grow.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">218\tDOLLS, TIGHT ANGLES ON THEIR FACES\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Rude dolls fixed at the ends of pointed sticks--agricultural fetishes that Chuck's father brought with him from the Old World--stand around the field to join in aiding the crops.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">219\tEXT. BELVEDERE\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Flags and bunting adorn the porch for Independence Day. Ursula sets off some fireworks.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY (o.s.)\n<P ID=\"dia\">Time has flown, and once again harvest is near.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">220\tEXT. GREEN FIELDS(TRIFFIDS)\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">The bald earth has, as though by a mystery, become a sheet of grain, its green already fading to gold. The music dies away, replaced by the whirr of summer crickets.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY (o.s.)\n<P ID=\"dia\">It will be a year that we have been here.\nThe camera holds and holds on the fields until in their vacant depths, we begin to sense the presence of a deep malevolence, still biding its time but growing every minute.\nSeagulls--like strange emissaries from another world--glide back and forth over the fields in search of grasshoppers.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">221\tINT. LANTERN - NIGHT\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Ursula takes curling irons from the chimney of a lantern where she has set them to heat, and applies them to Abby hair.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">URSULA\n<P ID=\"dia\">Suppose I never fall in love, Abby?\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">Don't be silly. Everybody does. What do you think all those songs\nare about? You need to be careful, though, and not throw it away.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">URSULA\n<P ID=\"dia\">Throw what away?\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">You know, your chances. It's too hard to explain to a little\nsquirrel like you.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">URSULA\n<P ID=\"dia\">That sounded just like Bill. Don't you miss him?\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">Sometimes.\nFrom her tone, however, we sense that she finds it easier with him gone.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">222\tINT. MASTER BEDROOM\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Abby whispers something to Chuck in bed that evening.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHUCK\n<P ID=\"dia\">You ever said that to anybody else?\nShe giggles.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHUCK\n<P ID=\"dia\">You're lying, aren't you? Well, go right on lying.\nThe camera moves to the window, beneath the eave. Outside, peacocks strut back and forth.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">223\tEXT. MUDDY ROAD\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Bill rides an Indian motorcycle along a muddy road back to the bonanza. His rabbit is strapped to the back. He stops for a moment to look at the new fields.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">224\tEXT. BELVEDERE - BILL'S POV\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Abby sings to herself as she beats out a carpet. Bill appears on the ridge behind her. Hope leaves him like a ghost. She looks happily settled into a new life with Chuck. All at once she turns around.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">Bill!\nShe rushes up and embraces him, but her warmth just seems a tease to Bill. She is different. She looks different. The tutors and tailors Chuck has brought in over the winter have given her more polish. Her hair is nicely\ncoiffed. Where she used to dress in cotton shirtwaists, she wears crinolines now.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">How's everybody been?\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">Including me? Okay. Gee, you look good.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">Thanks. And Chuck?\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">Still the same.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">Actually I didn't mean it that way.\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(pause)\n<P ID=\"dia\">I came back to help out with the harvest.\nHe feels humiliated at not having a stronger excuse. But he loves her. He aches with love. He hoped their last fight was just another storm in the romance. Evidently it was more.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">I thought about you a lot. Wrote you a letter, but it was no good, so I tore it up.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">How'd you come?\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">Train.\nHe looks her up and down.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">Nice dress.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">I'm glad you like it.\nHe admires her garden. His familiar cockiness vanishes as little by little he sees the old feeling is not there.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">This is new, too.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">The daffodils were already here,  but I put in the rest. You\nreally do like them?\nAt a shriek from Ursula, Bill turns around. She runs into his arms, and covers him with kisses.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">URSULA\n<P ID=\"dia\">I've missed you! I thought about you every day. You should've written. Did Abby show you what she got?\nAbby scowls at Ursula. With no choice but to show him, she opens the top button of her blouse and draws out a diamond necklace.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(apologetically)\n<P ID=\"dia\">For Christmas.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">URSULA\n<P ID=\"dia\">Plus a music box. He spoils her. Why don't they spoil me, too?\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(whispering)\n<P ID=\"dia\">You oughta be glad you didn't have to spend the winter. You\nwould've gone crazy.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">225\tTIGHT ON ABBY\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">The winter's peace is gone. Abby is sick with fear. Now that she loves Chuck, too, she can never again be honest with Bill. The truth of her feelings would crush him. Moreover, there's no telling how he might react. He could ruin everything, even get them killed.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">226\tEXT. BEDROOM WINDOW\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Chuck looks on from behind the bedroom window.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">227\tEXT. DINNER TABLE\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">They dine in awkward silence. Benson has joined them.\nAbby, for all her winter's polish, still eats with the back of her knife.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHUCK\n<P ID=\"dia\">How was Chicago?\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">Great.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">How's everybody doing?\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">Okay.\nThey are silent for a moment. Bill senses that nobody except Ursula is really glad to see him back.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">How's Blackie?\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">Still hasn't wised up. Know what I mean? He asked how you were\ndoing, though.\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(pause)\n<P ID=\"dia\">I told him. Ran into Sam, too. He'd been in a fight.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">Oh yeah?\nBill can see that her interest is only polite. He knows that he should turn around and leave, but he cannot. The sight of him with his confidence gone is painful to behold.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">His nose was like this.\nHe pushes his nose to one side. Ursula and Abby laugh.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">228\tEXT. STOCK POND\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Bill plants willow slips in the soft earth by the stock pond. Ursula orders a dog around.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">URSULA\n<P ID=\"dia\">Look at this dog mind me. Sit! You've got to say it like hitting a nail.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">Has she asked you anything about me?\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">URSULA\n<P ID=\"dia\">No.\nUrsula flirts with him, running the shoots along his back.\nShe waits to see what he will do. He gets up and after a short chase catches her. He holds her at arm's length for a moment, then kisses her.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">URSULA\n<P ID=\"dia\">What'd you do that for?\nBill wonders himself. To get revenge on Abby? He touches her breast.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">URSULA\n<P ID=\"dia\">Don't.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">Why not?\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">URSULA\n<P ID=\"dia\">Cause there's nothing there.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">I can be the judge of that.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">URSULA\n<P ID=\"dia\">Then ask first.\nHe kisses her neck.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">Nobody has to know but us  chickens.\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(pause)\n<P ID=\"dia\">What do I have to say to convince you? You tell me, I'll say it.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">URSULA\n<P ID=\"dia\">What makes you think I would?\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">Nothing.\nShe giggles and kisses him back. But guilt has caught up with him. He cannot go ahead.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">URSULA\n<P ID=\"dia\">What's the matter?\nNo reply.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">URSULA \n<P ID=\"dia\">Maybe it would be wrong.\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(disappointed)\n<P ID=\"dia\">You still love her, don't you?\nBill hums a rock off toward the horizon.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">I should've gone in the church, like my father was after me to.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">229\tBILL'S POV - OUTSIDE THE BELVEDERE - NIGHT\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Chuck and Abby sit in their cozy living room playing Parcheesi. The sound of their voices is muffled. The camera draws back to reveal Bill outside the window, watching.\nShe is comfortable with Chuck now. Apparently, he has lost his place in her heart. He wants to rush in and drag her away.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">230\tEXT. BEDROOM WINDOW - NIGHT\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Later that night he stands under the bedroom window and wonders at the meaning of the shadows that flicker across the ceiling. After a moment he withdraws into the darkness.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">231\tEXT. SMALL PRAIRIE TOWN (DUCK LAKE)\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Bill has brought Abby into a nearby town to make some purchases. Dressed in a chauffeur's gown and goggles, he sits against the fender of the Overland watching her move from store to store. Ursula is with her.\nThe TOWNSPEOPLE all speak German. Their peasant costumes are freely mixed with Western dress. The signs are old German script. Two MEN carry a huge bulb through the street, to put atop a church.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">232\tOVERLAND AUTO\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Abby walks up with Ursula.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">URSULA\n<P ID=\"dia\">Listen, I'm going to stay and go back with the laundry wagon.\nAbby looks at Bill, then nods okay. Ursula runs off. Bill opens the door, and she gets in.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">233\tEXT. ROAD OUTSIDE TOWN (DUCK LAKE)\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">They are stopped on the road a hundred yards outside the town.\nAbby smokes as Bill checks the radiator. Something in his behavior leads us to suspect he may have staged this stop.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">How you been doing?\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">Me? Fine.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">We don't talk so much these days.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">I know.\nShe knows what he wants. She cannot give it anymore.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">I said a lot of stupid things before I went off.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(politely)\n<P ID=\"dia\">I forgot about it already.\nBill, trying his best to make peace with her, cannot help seeing that she would like to keep things as they are--and not because she harbors any grudge.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">You've forgiven me?\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">There was nothing to forgive.\nHe holds a bottle of liquor out to her.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">What're you worried about?\nShe takes a swig. He laughs. She laughs back.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">So how'm I doing with you?\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">Fine.\nHe takes her hand and holds it like a trapped bird.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">What's happened?\nShe shrugs, disengaging her hand to brush aside her hair. She is painfully aware of his suffering but doesn't have the heart to tell him how it all is.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">I probably ought to leave. I will.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">Already? You just got here.\nShe hasn't really contradicted him. He leans forward as though to kiss her. She lets him. She wishes that she could give herself to him, but she doesn't know what is right. Then, a sudden impulse of panic, she gets up and backs away.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">Where you going?\nHe reaches out to catch her. She breaks away and starts to run. He walks quickly after her, cutting off any escape toward the town.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">Why'd you have to come back?\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">I'm not going to hurt you. I only want to talk with you.\nShe stops and hides her face in her hands. He gently pulls them away.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">I didn't come back to make trouble for you. I guess we were fooling\neach other to think it could last. I mean, What was I offering youanyhow? A ride to the bottom. Looking at you now, in the right  clothes and everything, I see how crazy I was and--well, I understand. It's okay. I sort of cut my own throat, actually.\nHer eyes close and her legs give in. Bill lets her go and backs off a step in surprise. She sinks to the ground, as though in a trance.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">234\tTIGHT ON BILL\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Bill, taken by surprise, goes up and kneels down beside her. He looks to see that she is okay. He picks a fox-tail out of her hair. Her dress has worked up toward her knees. He pulls it back down. He wants to caress \nher face but hesitates.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">How'd we let it happen, Abby? We were so happy once. Why didn't we starve? I love you so much. What have1 done? You're so beautiful. What have I done?\nHe touches his lips for a fraction of a second to hers, notices another car approaching down the road. He picks her up like a doll and carries her back to the Overland.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">235\tEXT. BELVEDERE - CHUCK'S POV\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">They have arrived back at the Belvedere.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">I'm sorry.\nShe touches his face in a surge of sympathy. What has she done to him? He kisses her neck and leads her toward the front door.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">236\tCRANE TO CHUCK\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">The camera rises to the uppermost story of the Belvedere. Chuck has seen them. Hot tears leap to his eyes. Before Bill left for the winter he often observed such intimacies between them. Now it all looks different.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">237\tCHUCK'S POVS (HIGH ANGLES)\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">He looks around at his estate--his barn, his auto, his great house and his granary. None of them is any consolation now. Far a moment it seems to him as though he lived here in some time long past.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">238\tINT. BEDROOM\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Abby notices Chuck watching her outside the bedroom door.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">You want something from me?\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHUCK\n<P ID=\"dia\">No.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">Will you hand me that magazine?\nHe gives her the magazine she wants.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">What's the matter?\nHe seems for a moment to consider telling her, then shrugs and goes downstairs.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">239\tINT. LIVING ROOM\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">He stumbles into a bird cage but hardly notices. The jostled birds raise a fuss.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">240\tEXT. FRONT PORCH\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">He runs into Bill on the front porch.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">I've been looking for you. I have to take off again, real soon here, and...\nChuck puts a hand on Bill's shoulder, stopping him. They look at each other for a moment, then he passes on. Bill seems puzzled.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">241\tEXT. FIELDS\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Chuck walks out into the deep of his fields. The wheat, a warm dry gold, is almost ready to take in. He sits down and rests his head against a \nfurrow, powerless to think. The wind makes a song in the infinitude of sweet clicking heads.\nHe puts his hands over his heart and breathes in gasps, with the dumb honesty of a wounded animal. He could not himself quite say what it is that he knows.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">242\tEXT. BONANZA - SERIES OF ANGLES\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Late that afternoon disaster strikes as a swarm of locusts sweeps down on the bonanza. We do not see where they come from. They seem to appear out of nowhere, unnoticed. Ursula works in the kitchen, Bill by the barn. Chuck lies asleep in the field, Abby upstairs in bed.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">243\tANIMALS ON BONANZA\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">The animals sense it first. The buffalo move off in a mass. The horses become uncontrollable. One runs around the barn in a panic. Bill watches it, puzzled.\nTwo peacocks have a fight.\nA dog in the treadmill races in vain to escape, driving the machine to a feverish pitch. The shadow of a giant cloud licks over the hills.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">244\tEXT. FIELDS\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Everything seems normal in the fields.\nThen, as you listen, a strange new sound begins to rise from them, a wild sea-like singing. As the camera moves over the fields and down into the wheat it swells in a crescendo until...\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">245\tTIGHT ON LOCUSTS\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Suddenly we see them up close, devouring the stalks in a fever, the noise of their jaws magnified a thousand times.\nThey slip into the Belvedere, under the sash and wainscoting, turning up first in places it would seem they could never get into: a jewelry case, the back of a radio, the works of a music box, a bottle with a miniature ship inside, etc.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">246\tEXTREME CLOSEUPS\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Their eyes are dumb and implacable. They seem to have a whole hidden life of their own.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">247\tINT. KITCHEN\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Little by little they gather in numbers. Ursula first sees one on the drainboard. She swats it with a newspaper. Others sprout up. One by one she picks them up with a tongs and drops them into the stove. This method\nis too slow. She begins to use her fingers. She moves with a quick, nervous energy, even as she understands this is futile. At last claustro-phobia seizes her. She spins around with a shriek, lashing out at everything in sight.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">248\tINT. MASTER BEDROOM\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">In the bedroom overhead, Abby wakes up from one nightmare into another. She jumps out of bed and goes to the window. The locusts pelt against the pane like shot. She throws the bolt. Suddenly a crack shoots through the glass. She jumps back and watches in horror as a sliver of the pane falls in. They are free to enter.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">249\tSERIES OF ANGLES\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Suddenly they are everywhere: on the clothesline, in the pantry, in hats and shoes and the seams of clothing. Not a nook or cranny is safe from penetration.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">250\tTIGHT ON CHUCK - SLOW MOTION\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Chuck, asleep in the deep of the wheat, bolts up in slow motion. His hair is seething with them.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">251\tEXT. BONANZA - FURTHER ANGLES\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Panic hits the bonanza. Workers tie string around their pant cuffs to keep the insects from crawling up their legs, then rush out to the fields with gongs, rattles, pot lids, scarecrows on sticks, drums and horns and \nother noisemakers to scare them off.\nSome pray. Others run around like madmen, stamping and yelling, ignored by the gathering host. A couple get into a fistfight.\nA storm flag is run up the flagpole. A tractor blasts out an S.O.S. The peacocks huddle under the stoop.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">252\tTIGHT ON CHUCK\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Chuck gives Benson his orders.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHUCK\n<P ID=\"dia\">Offer fifty cents a bushel for them. Get out the reapers.\nSee what you can harvest.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">253\tHIGH DOWN ANGLE\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">The locusts snap through the air. Bill, swatting at them with a shovel, stops to gag. One has flown into his mouth.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">254\tTIGHT ON GEARS\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">They jam up the gears of the machinery with the crush of their bodies.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">255\tINT. MASTER BEDROOM\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Abby throws a sheet over herself, but they get in under it. She thrashes around madly, then with a cry goes limp.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">256\tCHUCK AND BENSON\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Benson reports back to Chuck. A team of horses races by, nearly bowling them over.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BENSON\n<P ID=\"dia\">We can't get the machines out. They're jamming up the gears.\nThere's a good chance they'll pass on south, though. Unless...\nunless a wind comes up.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHUCK\n<P ID=\"dia\">What happens then?\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BENSON\n<P ID=\"dia\">They'll set down and walk in.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">257\tSIGNS OF DAMAGE\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">The locusts devour not just the crops but every organic thing: pitchfork handles, linens on the clothesline, leather traces, flowers in the window boxes, etc. Soon a large area of wheat is eaten down to stubble.\nBill looks away from a tree for a second. When he turns back it has been stripped to a wintry bareness.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">258\tEXT. WIND GENERATOR, OTHER ANGLES\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">The vanes of the wind generator begin gently to stir. Little by little the wind picks up. A dust devil spins across the yard. The grass lists by the well. A power line moans.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">259\tEXT. FIELDS\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">As the sun dips below the horizon, the locusts pour in like a living river, walking along the ground like a procession of Army ants. The roar of their wings is deafening. The air hisses and pops with their electric frenzy.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">260\tSTOCK AND MATTE SHOTS - SUNSET\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">And these are but the advance elements of a main force which looms like a silver cloud on the horizon.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">261\tEXT. BONFIRE - NIGHT\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">WORKERS dump bushels of the insects into a bonfire. A MAN with an abacus keeps track of what each is owed.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">262\tSAME FIELDS - NIGHT\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">The wind has picked up. Chuck, Bill and Abby have come out to the fields with a dozen WORKERS to investigate the extent of the damage. The insects buzz around blindly in the light of their lanterns, which they carry Japanese-fashion at the ends of cane poles.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">263\tTIGHT ON CHUCK - NIGHT\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Chuck inspects the grain.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHUCK\n<P ID=\"dia\">There's nothing we can do but wait. They're either going to take it all or they're not.\nHe covers his face with his hands. The others shy back at this display of grief, startling in one so formal. Their jostled lanterns cast a dance of lights.\nBill, moved to real sympathy, takes him by the shoulders.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">Come on. They might still lift. Hey, I've seen a wind like this lay\ndown and die. Don't give up now.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHUCK\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(ignoring him)\n<P ID=\"dia\">We could at least make sure they don't get the people on south.\nHe breaks open the mantle of his lantern, still unsure what he should do. Some of the flaming kerosene splashes onto the crops nearby, setting them ablaze. Bill drops his rattle and swats the fire out with his coat.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">What're you doing? Watch it! What're you, crazy? There's\nstill a chance, don't you see?\nChuck goes to his horse. Bill grabs him by the sleeve. Does he really mean to set the fields on fire? Chuck pushes him aside. Bill, frantic, turns to the others for support.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">Stop him, or it's all going up.\nThey, however, are too uncertain of their ground to intervene. Chuck turns on Bill.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHUCK\n<P ID=\"dia\">What does it matter to you?\nChuck slings fire out of the broken lantern onto the crops next to Bill -- a sudden, hostile gesture that catches them all by surprise. Independent of his will, the truth is forcing its way up, like a great blind fish from the bottom of the sea.\nHe slings the fire out again. A patch lands on Bill's pantleg. Bill slaps it out.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">What's got into you?\nThey stare at each other. Bill backs off like a cat, sensing Chuck knows the truth, but at a loss to understand how he could.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHUCK\n<P ID=\"dia\">Why do you care? I gave my life for this land.\nChuck walks towards him. Suddenly Bill turns and takes off running. Chuck swings at him with the lantern. Bill escapes behind the building wall of flame that springs up between them.\nThe whirr of the locusts stops for a moment--they seem at times to have a collective mind--then, just as mysteriously, resumes.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">Stop, Chuck!\nChuck leaps on his horse. She tries to drag him off but is thrown aside and almost trampled underfoot. Now the others join in, trying to knock away the lantern or catch his stirrup. He eludes them and rides off after Bill,  leaving a slash of flame behind him in the grain. They tear off their coats to swat it out, in vain--already it stretches a hundred yards.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">264\tBILL\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Bill runs through the night, still carrying his lantern. Chuck bears down on him. Abby chases along behind him, screaming for him to stop.\nBill realizes the lantern is giving his position away He blows it out and vanishes from sight. All we can see is the thundering horseman, sowing fire.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">265\tCRANE SHOT\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">With a rough idea where Bill is, Chuck begins to lay a ring of fire around him, fifty yards in diameter.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">266\tBILL AND ABBY INSIDE RING\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Abby spots Bill against the flames. She rushes up, gasping. They have been caught inside the ring.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">What're you doing? This is a bad place to talk\nHe throws his coat over Abby's head, picks her up by the waist and crashes through the flame. They have to shout to make themselves understood. The locusts roar like a cyclone.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">Did you see that? He was trying to burn me. What's got into him?\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">He knows. He must.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">A whole year's work. All wasted! These bugs, once they make up\ntheir minds...\nBill stalls. The fire races toward them through the wheat. They appear as silhouettes against it.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">I need to get out of here. I think you probably should, too.  \n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(pause)\n<P ID=\"dia\">Hell of a life. Damned if you do and damned if you don't.\nHe leaves. Abby wonders if she ought to run after him.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY  \n<P ID=\"dia\">Bill!\nBut this moment's hesitation has been too long. Already he is swallowed up in the night, her voice swept away in the roar of the flame and the locusts, who seem to wail louder now, and with a great mournfulness--like keening Arab women--as if they knew the fate shortly to envelop\nthem.\nAbby turns back. She, too, has reason to fear Chuck and must escape.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">267\tNEW ANGLE\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Benson rallies the workers.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BENSON\n<P ID=\"dia\">There's still a chance they're going to fly.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">VOICES\n<P ID=\"dia\">Get the tractor out! The pump wagon! Blankets!\nThey rush off to find equipment to fight the fire.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">268\tISOLATED ON CHUCK - NIGHT\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Chuck rides through the dark like a lone Horseman of the Apocalypse, setting his fields on fire.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">269\tEXT. PLAINS ON FIRE - SERIES OF ANGLES - NIGHT\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Tractors attempt to plow a firebreak. Mad silhouettes run back and forth, slapping at the blaze with wet gunny sacks fixed to the ends of sticks. Two dormitories burn out of control.\nUrsula throws open the barn and lets the horses out. They have raised thunder kicking at their stalls. The light above the barn door pulses erratically.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">270\tEXPLOSIONS - NIGHT (MINIATURES)\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Oil wells explode along the horizon. Huge balls of flames roll into the heavens.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">271\tEXT. BURNING PLAINS - NIGHT\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Panic spreads among the workers as the holocaust threatens to engulf them. They throw down their tools and run for their lives.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">272\tANIMALS - NIGHT\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Animals flee in all directions:  birds and deer and rabbits, pigs, buffalo and the horses from the barn. The locusts mill around crazily on the wheat stalks, backlit against the flame.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">273\tBILL - NIGHT\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Bill, fleeing on his motorbike with his rabbit, holds up\nfor a moment to watch the fire--a Biblical inferno of spectacular sweep.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">274\tEXT. BEDROOM WINDOW--TRACKING SHOT (CHUCK'S POV)--NIGHT\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">A single light burns in the Belvedere.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">275\tINT. BEDROOM - NIGHT\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Heaving with sobs, Abby throws her things into a bindle. She has lost Chuck forever. Their life is destroyed. She glances out the window. She still has time to get away, but she must hurry. She bolts for the door. Sud-\ndenly Chuck steps from the shadows, blocking her exit.\nHis face, black with soot, looks gruesome in the gas1ight. The locusts have chewed up his clothes.\nAbby is like a frightened deer. Did he see her packing?\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHUCK\n<P ID=\"dia\">You look as though you'd seen a ghost.\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(pause)\n<P ID=\"dia\">Where you going?\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(pause)\n<P ID=\"dia\">Off with him?\nThe wind cuts gaps in the death wail of the locusts. From time to time we hear the thump of an exploding well.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHUCK\n<P ID=\"dia\">He's not your brother, is he?\nHow much does he know? She edges toward the door.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">Why do you say that?\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHUCK\n<P ID=\"dia\">Come here a minute. Who are you?\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(no reply)\n<P ID=\"dia\">Where'd you come from?\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">I told you.\nHe shakes her. She quivers like a child in his grasp. She no longer has the audacity to lie.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">How long have you known?\nHe drops his eyes. Shamefully long -- and his anger is partly just at this.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHUCK\n<P ID=\"dia\">What'd you want? He punches in the shade of a lamp, extinguishing it.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHUCK\n<P ID=\"dia\">Tell me. He shoves over the chest of drawers. She does not move.\nHe tears down the drapes, already in shreds.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHUCK\n<P ID=\"dia\">This? Show me what you wanted! I would have given it all to you.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">Please, Chuck.  \n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHUCK\n<P ID=\"dia\">Please what? You're not going to tell me you're sorry, I hope..\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">But I am.\nOutside the window fires rage along half the horizon. He sits down. He wants to sob, but cannot.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHUCK\n<P ID=\"dia\">You're so wonderful. How could you do this?\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">I'm just no good. You picked me from the gutter, and this is\nhow -- I never deserved you.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHUCK\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(interrupting)\n<P ID=\"dia\">The things you told me.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">I love you, though.

Her face goes empty. He gets his razor strop from the shaving basin. She shrinks back in the corner. He looks at her for a moment, then leaves the room. \n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">276\tINT. STAIRCASE - NIGHT\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Abby pursues him down the stairs. He throws her aside.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">Where are you doing? Chuck! What are you doing?

BURNT-OUT FIELDS - DAWN\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Dawn breaks. Chuck rides over the burnt-out fields looking for Bill. The feet of his lank white mare are wrapped to the fetlock in wet burlap, to protect them from the smouldering grass. It prances warily along, without\nmaking a sound, wreathed in a mist of blue smoke. With him he carries a stool. The camera pans up to the smoke which is carrying his fortune off.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">280\tCHUCK'S POVS\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Burnt, blind deer stand and look at him in utter terror, as though they understood his intentions. The roasted corpses of sharptail grouse, coyotes and badgers lie scattered here and there. Piles of dung burn on after the grass is out.\nA peacock from the Belvedere wanders around, angry and\nperplexed.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">281\tBILL\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Bill is repairing his motorbike by a rock in the middle of the scorched landscape. The tires are soft as licorice from the heat. Suddenly, he looks up. Chuck has found him.\nHe jumps behind the handlebars and fishtails off. Chuck breaks into a gallop, rides him down, knocks him to the ground with the stool, dismounts and stamps in the spokes of the front wheel to make sure he goes no further.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">Who do you think you are? Now you've ruined it. What's got\ninto you?\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHUCK\n<P ID=\"dia\">Where you headed?\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">Why do I have to tell you? I can come and go when I like.\nThis is still a free country, last I heard.\nBill stops when he sees the stool. Chuck calmly strops the razor on his stirrup flap. There are no secrets now.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">What can I say? Too late for apologies. You've got a right\nto hate me.\nChuck puts the razor away and advances on Bill with the stool.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">I want to leave. You won't ever see me again. I already got what\nI deserve.\nThere is nothing Bill can say to appease him. This will be a fight to the death. Chuck lashes out with the stool. Bill ducks too late.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">Watch it!\nChuck comes at him again. Bill throws a punch, but Chuck blocks it and knocks him down again with the stool.\nBill reels back and cracks his head on the bicycle frame. This time he stays down. Satisfied the struggle is over, Chuck goes back to get some rope.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">282\tNEW ANGLE\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Chuck shuts his eyes to mumble a prayer of absolution--in Russian.\nBill in a panic, snaps a spoke out of the broken wheel and lays it against his sleeve.\nChuck moves in for the kill. Bill gets to his feet. He wants to run but fear makes his knees like water. Suddenly, they are face to face. Chuck swings at Bill with the stool but misses. Bill lifts the spoke above him and\ndrives it deep into Chuck's heart.\nChuck gasps. Bill seems just as shocked. Chuck sits down to determine the gravity of his injury. Blood jets rhythmically out the end of the spoke, as though from a straw. Bill circles him, unbelieving.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">Should I pull it out?\nChuck puts his finger over the end of the spoke. Blood seeps out the side of his mouth, like sap from a broken stem.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">I better get somebody.\nHe tries to catch the reins of Chuck's horse, but it shies out of reach, its conscience repelled. He looks back at Chuck in anguish.  What has he done?\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">You were my friend.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">283\tTIGHT ON BILL AND HIS POVS\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">The Belvedere is visible on the horizon. Bill hesitates\na moment, then heads back on foot to find Abby. He gives\nChuck a wide berth.\nThen, on a ridge in the distance, he spots Benson.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">Get a doctor! Fast!\nHow much did he see? Bill does not stay to find out but\ntakes off running, though not without first collecting his\nrabbit.\nBenson, meanwhile, bounds down the hill to Chuck's side.\nHis left sleeve has been burned away. The flesh beneath\nis the color of a raw steak.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">284\tCHUCK'S POVS\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Chuck sees the smoke from his fields, the burnt deer,\na circling hawk.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">285\tTIGHT ON CHUCK\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">He breathes in gulps. His eyes are blank, like a child's\nmarbles. He takes Benson's hand.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHUCK  \n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(weakly)\n<P ID=\"dia\">Wasn't his fault. Tell her...forgive them.\nThe locusts can be heard no more. The prairie makes a\nsound like the ocean. Chuck turns his back and dies.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">286\tTIGHT ON BENSON\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Benson weeps. Whether or not he understood Chuck's last\nwishes, he seems unlikely to abide by them.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">287\tEXT. BELVEDERE\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Bill finds Abby bound to the house like the figurehead\nof a ship. He cuts her loose. The ropes fall at her feet. She is free. \nThey look at each other for a moment.\nThen, in a rush of compassion for them all, she throws\nher arms around him.\nBill wonders if she is taking him back.

He took his razor. We need to hurry. He\nmight be coming back any minute.\nBill mentions nothing of his encounter. She grabs her\nbindle, Bill a handful of silverware and an umbrella.\nAfter a moment's hesitation, he puts them back.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">288\tNEW ANGLE\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">They run down to the barn, where the cars are stored.\nThe saplings in the front yard have been stripped even\nof their bark. Abby stops to look back at the Belvedere\none last time. Chuck does not want her anymore. How\ncould she expect him to?\nBill grabs her by the hand and tugs her along.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">289\tEXT. BARN\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Abby throws open the doors of the barn. Bill cranks up\nthe engine of the Overland.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">Will the cops be looking for us, too?\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">Probably.\nAbby stands in the door. She is reluctant to leave, though she \nknows they must.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">Get in.\nShe notices that Bill's lip is cut, his shirt soaked with\nblood.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">What happened to you? Where's this from?\nBill looks down. He forgot.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">Had an accident.\nShe looks at him for a moment, not quite trusting this\nexplanation. The engine catches with a noise like start-\nled poultry. Bill gets behind the wheel. Just as they\nare pulling out of the garage, Ursula runs up, black \nas coal from battling the fire all night.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">URSULA\n<P ID=\"dia\">Where you going?\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(breathless)\n<P ID=\"dia\">We got in a jam.

Bill puts his foot on\nthe gas. Benson sees they are not going to stop and fires\nat then with a pistol. Bill grabs a shotgun from a scab-\nbard under the dash and fires back. Nobody is hurt.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">What's the matter with him?\nBill shrugs. Inside he feels a great relief. They are\nfree at last.

They negotiate (in pantomime)\nwith the PROPRIETOR for a tiny steam boat moored at the\nend of the pier. When the car is not enough, Abby throws\nin her necklace.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">294\tABOARD THE BOAT\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">They board the boat and turn down stream. There is a phonograph \non board.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">295\tTIGHT ON NECKLACE\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">The necklace sparkles on the hood of the car--a hint\nthey are leaving behind evidence that could betray them.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">296\tEXT. BOAT ON RIVER - AND MOVING POVS\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">They glide along in the hush of evening. The reeds are\nfull of deer. Cranes, imprudently tame, dance on the\nsand bars.\nBill looks around in wonder. He knows these may be his\nlast days on earth. Abby throws a sounding line.\nA COUPLE from a local farm seeks privacy in the willows.\nOther BOATMEN glide past in silence. A CHILD plays a\nfiddle on the deck of a scow. HUNTERS creep along the\nshore in search of waterfowl.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">297\tEXT. CAMP - DUSK\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Bill sleeps under a tarp.

The phonograph is playing\nin the stern. Abby is back in trousers. Bill points to\na white house on the shore, an image of comfort and peace.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">I used to want a set-up like that. Something like that, I thought,\nand you'd really have it made. Now I don't care. I just wish\nwe could always live this way.\nHe sees that her mind is somewhere else. He wants to tell\nher the truth about Chuck, for intimacy's sake, but it\nwould just put more of a cloud over everything. It might\neven cause her to hate him.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">Maybe you want to write him a  letter.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">I hadn't thought of that.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">You really do love him, don't you?\nShe does not reply.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">You want to go back?\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(shaking her head)\n<P ID=\"dia\">Too late for that. I could never face him again.\nThey look at each other for a moment. He touches her face,\nto show that he does not hold it against her. She touches\nhim back. They only have each other now. They must save\nwhat moments they can.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">Guess it's you and me again.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">301\tNEW ANGLE\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">On a sudden whim, Abby takes off her wedding bracelet\nand holds it over the water.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">Watch this.\nBill is caught off guard. Before he can make a move she\nthrows it far out into the river. They laugh, without\nknowing why, at this extravagance.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">302\tEXT. SHORE .. TRACKING SHOTS\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">They gather May apples and black haws. The music from\nthe phonograph comes up full.\nThey dig clams from a sand bar in a playful way.

The damp greens\nof the wilderness envelop her.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">304\tTHEIR POV - ON CITY ON RIVER - NIGHT\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Rounding a bend in the river that night, they come upon\nthe lights of a great city. They have doused the running\nlamp. Except for a faint groaning of the trees along the\nshore, the river is silent, conveying the sounds of the\ncity to them from across a great distance -- bells, joy-\nful voices, horns, the chirping of brakes, etc.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">305\tEXT.

RIVER FRONT - DAY\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">The next morning finds them camped in a thicket on the river\nfront below a factory.\nBill wakes up, mysteriously happy. Their blankets are heavy\nwith dew. Overhead, finches tilt from branch to branch. A\nlight wind rushes through the leaves. Whatever his trou-\nbles, they seem very small to him in the great. scheme of\nthings.\nHe looks at Abby, mouthing silent words in her sleep.\nHe puts on a white scarf and starts down to the boat. The\nslope is strewn with sodden cartons, burnt bricks and burst\nmattresses, an avalanche of urban excreta.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">307\tHIS POV\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Abruptly he stops. Two POLICE OFFICERS are combing over the\nboat. They have not seen him. He edges back. Suddenly, there is yelling on the hill above them. Bill looks up. Benson is calling him to the attention of a car-load of POLICEMEN pulling up beside him. The Officers at the boat now spot him, too, and open fire. Bill darts like\na rabbit into the thicket.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">308\tTIGHT ON ABBY\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Abby bolts awake.

Can't explain now. They're here.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">Who? What're you talking about?  Stop a minute.\nHe covers her with his body as bullets zoom through the\nundergrowth. His face is close to hers. She bursts into\ntears.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BILL\n<P ID=\"dia\">Don't get shot. Look for me under that next bridge down. \nAfter dark.\nHe empties out the contents of his pockets -- a watch, a\ncouple of dollars in change, a ring -- and slaps them down\nin front of her.\nThe Police fan out along the ridge above them. He jams a\nflare pistol into his belt and kisses her goodbye--after\na moment's hesitation -- on the cheek.

MUD FLAT\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Bill runs from the thicket down to the water. The Police\nhave bunched on the other side. It seems he might be able\nto escape. Keeping low, he splashes across a mud flat.\nSuddenly he runs into a trot line that a fisherman has\nleft out overnight. The hooks bite into his thigh and\nshoulder, yanking a string of startled, thrashing catfish\nout of the water.\nHe keeps running in a panic, not realizing the line is\nstaked to the shore. All at once, he jackknifes in the\nair. The stake twangs loose. The Police now spot him \nand begin firing.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">310\tTIGHT ON ABBY\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Abby runs out of hiding, thinking at first that the Police\nmust be looking for her.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ABBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">Why're you shooting?

They\nhold up, astonished. He dashes across a sand bar for the\ndeep of the river and comparative safety. Black mud clings\nto his feet, drawing him down like a fly in molasses.\nBenson goes running out into the river ahead of the Police.\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BENSON\n<P ID=\"dia\">Leave him alone. I want him. Leave him alone.\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(firing)\n<P ID=\"dia\">There you go! There you go!\nHe shoots Bill down. Bill turns and looks at him in sur-\nprise. Benson shoots him again, point blank.\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">312\tUNDERWATER SHOT\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Bill's blood fades off quickly in the gliding water of the\nriver.

{"input": "Who does Socrates compare going against the law to?", "context": "This etext was prepared by Sue Asscher <asschers@aia.net.au>\n\n\n\n\n\nCRITO\n\nby Plato\n\n\n\n\nTranslated by Benjamin Jowett\n\n\n\n\nINTRODUCTION.\n\nThe Crito seems intended to exhibit the character of Socrates in one light\nonly, not as the philosopher, fulfilling a divine mission and trusting in\nthe will of heaven, but simply as the good citizen, who having been\nunjustly condemned is willing to give up his life in obedience to the laws\nof the state...\n\nThe days of Socrates are drawing to a close; the fatal ship has been seen\noff Sunium, as he is informed by his aged friend and contemporary Crito,\nwho visits him before the dawn has broken; he himself has been warned in a\ndream that on the third day he must depart.  Time is precious, and Crito\nhas come early in order to gain his consent to a plan of escape.  This can\nbe easily accomplished by his friends, who will incur no danger in making\nthe attempt to save him, but will be disgraced for ever if they allow him\nto perish.  He should think of his duty to his children, and not play into\nthe hands of his enemies.  Money is already provided by Crito as well as by\nSimmias and others, and he will have no difficulty in finding friends in\nThessaly and other places.\n\nSocrates is afraid that Crito is but pressing upon him the opinions of the\nmany:  whereas, all his life long he has followed the dictates of reason\nonly and the opinion of the one wise or skilled man.  There was a time when\nCrito himself had allowed the propriety of this.  And although some one\nwill say 'the many can kill us,' that makes no difference; but a good life,\nin other words, a just and honourable life, is alone to be valued.  All\nconsiderations of loss of reputation or injury to his children should be\ndismissed:  the only question is whether he would be right in attempting to\nescape.  Crito, who is a disinterested person not having the fear of death\nbefore his eyes, shall answer this for him.  Before he was condemned they\nhad often held discussions, in which they agreed that no man should either\ndo evil, or return evil for evil, or betray the right.  Are these\nprinciples to be altered because the circumstances of Socrates are altered?\nCrito admits that they remain the same.  Then is his escape consistent with\nthe maintenance of them?  To this Crito is unable or unwilling to reply.\n\nSocrates proceeds:--Suppose the Laws of Athens to come and remonstrate with\nhim:  they will ask 'Why does he seek to overturn them?' and if he replies,\n'they have injured him,' will not the Laws answer, 'Yes, but was that the\nagreement?  Has he any objection to make to them which would justify him in\noverturning them?  Was he not brought into the world and educated by their\nhelp, and are they not his parents?  He might have left Athens and gone\nwhere he pleased, but he has lived there for seventy years more constantly\nthan any other citizen.'  Thus he has clearly shown that he acknowledged\nthe agreement, which he cannot now break without dishonour to himself and\ndanger to his friends.  Even in the course of the trial he might have\nproposed exile as the penalty, but then he declared that he preferred death\nto exile.  And whither will he direct his footsteps?  In any well-ordered\nstate the Laws will consider him as an enemy.  Possibly in a land of\nmisrule like Thessaly he may be welcomed at first, and the unseemly\nnarrative of his escape will be regarded by the inhabitants as an amusing\ntale.  But if he offends them he will have to learn another sort of lesson.\nWill he continue to give lectures in virtue?  That would hardly be decent.\nAnd how will his children be the gainers if he takes them into Thessaly,\nand deprives them of Athenian citizenship?  Or if he leaves them behind,\ndoes he expect that they will be better taken care of by his friends\nbecause he is in Thessaly?  Will not true friends care for them equally\nwhether he is alive or dead?\n\nFinally, they exhort him to think of justice first, and of life and\nchildren afterwards.  He may now depart in peace and innocence, a sufferer\nand not a doer of evil.  But if he breaks agreements, and returns evil for\nevil, they will be angry with him while he lives; and their brethren the\nLaws of the world below will receive him as an enemy.  Such is the mystic\nvoice which is always murmuring in his ears.\n\nThat Socrates was not a good citizen was a charge made against him during\nhis lifetime, which has been often repeated in later ages.  The crimes of\nAlcibiades, Critias, and Charmides, who had been his pupils, were still\nrecent in the memory of the now restored democracy.  The fact that he had\nbeen neutral in the death-struggle of Athens was not likely to conciliate\npopular good-will.  Plato, writing probably in the next generation,\nundertakes the defence of his friend and master in this particular, not to\nthe Athenians of his day, but to posterity and the world at large.\n\nWhether such an incident ever really occurred as the visit of Crito and the\nproposal of escape is uncertain:  Plato could easily have invented far more\nthan that (Phaedr.); and in the selection of Crito, the aged friend, as the\nfittest person to make the proposal to Socrates, we seem to recognize the\nhand of the artist.  Whether any one who has been subjected by the laws of\nhis country to an unjust judgment is right in attempting to escape, is a\nthesis about which casuists might disagree.  Shelley (Prose Works) is of\nopinion that Socrates 'did well to die,' but not for the 'sophistical'\nreasons which Plato has put into his mouth.  And there would be no\ndifficulty in arguing that Socrates should have lived and preferred to a\nglorious death the good which he might still be able to perform.  'A\nrhetorician would have had much to say upon that point.'  It may be\nobserved however that Plato never intended to answer the question of\ncasuistry, but only to exhibit the ideal of patient virtue which refuses to\ndo the least evil in order to avoid the greatest, and to show his master\nmaintaining in death the opinions which he had professed in his life.  Not\n'the world,' but the 'one wise man,' is still the paradox of Socrates in\nhis last hours.  He must be guided by reason, although her conclusions may\nbe fatal to him.  The remarkable sentiment that the wicked can do neither\ngood nor evil is true, if taken in the sense, which he means, of moral\nevil; in his own words, 'they cannot make a man wise or foolish.'\n\nThis little dialogue is a perfect piece of dialectic, in which granting the\n'common principle,' there is no escaping from the conclusion.  It is\nanticipated at the beginning by the dream of Socrates and the parody of\nHomer.  The personification of the Laws, and of their brethren the Laws in\nthe world below, is one of the noblest and boldest figures of speech which\noccur in Plato.\n\n\nCRITO\n\nby\n\nPlato\n\nTranslated by Benjamin Jowett\n\n\nPERSONS OF THE DIALOGUE:  Socrates, Crito.\n\nSCENE:  The Prison of Socrates.\n\n\nSOCRATES:  Why have you come at this hour, Crito? it must be quite early.\n\nCRITO:  Yes, certainly.\n\nSOCRATES:  What is the exact time?\n\nCRITO:  The dawn is breaking.\n\nSOCRATES:  I wonder that the keeper of the prison would let you in.\n\nCRITO:  He knows me because I often come, Socrates; moreover.  I have done\nhim a kindness.\n\nSOCRATES:  And are you only just arrived?\n\nCRITO:  No, I came some time ago.\n\nSOCRATES:  Then why did you sit and say nothing, instead of at once\nawakening me?\n\nCRITO:  I should not have liked myself, Socrates, to be in such great\ntrouble and unrest as you are--indeed I should not:  I have been watching\nwith amazement your peaceful slumbers; and for that reason I did not awake\nyou, because I wished to minimize the pain.  I have always thought you to\nbe of a happy disposition; but never did I see anything like the easy,\ntranquil manner in which you bear this calamity.\n\nSOCRATES:  Why, Crito, when a man has reached my age he ought not to be\nrepining at the approach of death.\n\nCRITO:  And yet other old men find themselves in similar misfortunes, and\nage does not prevent them from repining.\n\nSOCRATES:  That is true.  But you have not told me why you come at this\nearly hour.\n\nCRITO:  I come to bring you a message which is sad and painful; not, as I\nbelieve, to yourself, but to all of us who are your friends, and saddest of\nall to me.\n\nSOCRATES:  What?  Has the ship come from Delos, on the arrival of which I\nam to die?\n\nCRITO:  No, the ship has not actually arrived, but she will probably be\nhere to-day, as persons who have come from Sunium tell me that they have\nleft her there; and therefore to-morrow, Socrates, will be the last day of\nyour life.\n\nSOCRATES:  Very well, Crito; if such is the will of God, I am willing; but\nmy belief is that there will be a delay of a day.\n\nCRITO:  Why do you think so?\n\nSOCRATES:  I will tell you.  I am to die on the day after the arrival of\nthe ship?\n\nCRITO:  Yes; that is what the authorities say.\n\nSOCRATES:  But I do not think that the ship will be here until to-morrow;\nthis I infer from a vision which I had last night, or rather only just now,\nwhen you fortunately allowed me to sleep.\n\nCRITO:  And what was the nature of the vision?\n\nSOCRATES:  There appeared to me the likeness of a woman, fair and comely,\nclothed in bright raiment, who called to me and said:  O Socrates,\n\n'The third day hence to fertile Phthia shalt thou go.'  (Homer, Il.)\n\nCRITO:  What a singular dream, Socrates!\n\nSOCRATES:  There can be no doubt about the meaning, Crito, I think.\n\nCRITO:  Yes; the meaning is only too clear.  But, oh! my beloved Socrates,\nlet me entreat you once more to take my advice and escape.  For if you die\nI shall not only lose a friend who can never be replaced, but there is\nanother evil:  people who do not know you and me will believe that I might\nhave saved you if I had been willing to give money, but that I did not\ncare.  Now, can there be a worse disgrace than this--that I should be\nthought to value money more than the life of a friend?  For the many will\nnot be persuaded that I wanted you to escape, and that you refused.\n\nSOCRATES:  But why, my dear Crito, should we care about the opinion of the\nmany?  Good men, and they are the only persons who are worth considering,\nwill think of these things truly as they occurred.\n\nCRITO:  But you see, Socrates, that the opinion of the many must be\nregarded, for what is now happening shows that they can do the greatest\nevil to any one who has lost their good opinion.\n\nSOCRATES:  I only wish it were so, Crito; and that the many could do the\ngreatest evil; for then they would also be able to do the greatest good--\nand what a fine thing this would be!  But in reality they can do neither;\nfor they cannot make a man either wise or foolish; and whatever they do is\nthe result of chance.\n\nCRITO:  Well, I will not dispute with you; but please to tell me, Socrates,\nwhether you are not acting out of regard to me and your other friends:  are\nyou not afraid that if you escape from prison we may get into trouble with\nthe informers for having stolen you away, and lose either the whole or a\ngreat part of our property; or that even a worse evil may happen to us?\nNow, if you fear on our account, be at ease; for in order to save you, we\nought surely to run this, or even a greater risk; be persuaded, then, and\ndo as I say.\n\nSOCRATES:  Yes, Crito, that is one fear which you mention, but by no means\nthe only one.\n\nCRITO:  Fear not--there are persons who are willing to get you out of\nprison at no great cost; and as for the informers they are far from being\nexorbitant in their demands--a little money will satisfy them.  My means,\nwhich are certainly ample, are at your service, and if you have a scruple\nabout spending all mine, here are strangers who will give you the use of\ntheirs; and one of them, Simmias the Theban, has brought a large sum of\nmoney for this very purpose; and Cebes and many others are prepared to\nspend their money in helping you to escape.  I say, therefore, do not\nhesitate on our account, and do not say, as you did in the court (compare\nApol.), that you will have a difficulty in knowing what to do with yourself\nanywhere else.  For men will love you in other places to which you may go,\nand not in Athens only; there are friends of mine in Thessaly, if you like\nto go to them, who will value and protect you, and no Thessalian will give\nyou any trouble.  Nor can I think that you are at all justified, Socrates,\nin betraying your own life when you might be saved; in acting thus you are\nplaying into the hands of your enemies, who are hurrying on your\ndestruction.  And further I should say that you are deserting your own\nchildren; for you might bring them up and educate them; instead of which\nyou go away and leave them, and they will have to take their chance; and if\nthey do not meet with the usual fate of orphans, there will be small thanks\nto you.  No man should bring children into the world who is unwilling to\npersevere to the end in their nurture and education.  But you appear to be\nchoosing the easier part, not the better and manlier, which would have been\nmore becoming in one who professes to care for virtue in all his actions,\nlike yourself.  And indeed, I am ashamed not only of you, but of us who are\nyour friends, when I reflect that the whole business will be attributed\nentirely to our want of courage.  The trial need never have come on, or\nmight have been managed differently; and this last act, or crowning folly,\nwill seem to have occurred through our negligence and cowardice, who might\nhave saved you, if we had been good for anything; and you might have saved\nyourself, for there was no difficulty at all.  See now, Socrates, how sad\nand discreditable are the consequences, both to us and you.  Make up your\nmind then, or rather have your mind already made up, for the time of\ndeliberation is over, and there is only one thing to be done, which must be\ndone this very night, and if we delay at all will be no longer practicable\nor possible; I beseech you therefore, Socrates, be persuaded by me, and do\nas I say.\n\nSOCRATES:  Dear Crito, your zeal is invaluable, if a right one; but if\nwrong, the greater the zeal the greater the danger; and therefore we ought\nto consider whether I shall or shall not do as you say.  For I am and\nalways have been one of those natures who must be guided by reason,\nwhatever the reason may be which upon reflection appears to me to be the\nbest; and now that this chance has befallen me, I cannot repudiate my own\nwords:  the principles which I have hitherto honoured and revered I still\nhonour, and unless we can at once find other and better principles, I am\ncertain not to agree with you; no, not even if the power of the multitude\ncould inflict many more imprisonments, confiscations, deaths, frightening\nus like children with hobgoblin terrors (compare Apol.).  What will be the\nfairest way of considering the question?  Shall I return to your old\nargument about the opinions of men?--we were saying that some of them are\nto be regarded, and others not.  Now were we right in maintaining this\nbefore I was condemned?  And has the argument which was once good now\nproved to be talk for the sake of talking--mere childish nonsense?  That is\nwhat I want to consider with your help, Crito:--whether, under my present\ncircumstances, the argument appears to be in any way different or not; and\nis to be allowed by me or disallowed.  That argument, which, as I believe,\nis maintained by many persons of authority, was to the effect, as I was\nsaying, that the opinions of some men are to be regarded, and of other men\nnot to be regarded.  Now you, Crito, are not going to die to-morrow--at\nleast, there is no human probability of this, and therefore you are\ndisinterested and not liable to be deceived by the circumstances in which\nyou are placed.  Tell me then, whether I am right in saying that some\nopinions, and the opinions of some men only, are to be valued, and that\nother opinions, and the opinions of other men, are not to be valued.  I ask\nyou whether I was right in maintaining this?\n\nCRITO:  Certainly.\n\nSOCRATES:  The good are to be regarded, and not the bad?\n\nCRITO:  Yes.\n\nSOCRATES:  And the opinions of the wise are good, and the opinions of the\nunwise are evil?\n\nCRITO:  Certainly.\n\nSOCRATES:  And what was said about another matter?  Is the pupil who\ndevotes himself to the practice of gymnastics supposed to attend to the\npraise and blame and opinion of every man, or of one man only--his\nphysician or trainer, whoever he may be?\n\nCRITO:  Of one man only.\n\nSOCRATES:  And he ought to fear the censure and welcome the praise of that\none only, and not of the many?\n\nCRITO:  Clearly so.\n\nSOCRATES:  And he ought to act and train, and eat and drink in the way\nwhich seems good to his single master who has understanding, rather than\naccording to the opinion of all other men put together?\n\nCRITO:  True.\n\nSOCRATES:  And if he disobeys and disregards the opinion and approval of\nthe one, and regards the opinion of the many who have no understanding,\nwill he not suffer evil?\n\nCRITO:  Certainly he will.\n\nSOCRATES:  And what will the evil be, whither tending and what affecting,\nin the disobedient person?\n\nCRITO:  Clearly, affecting the body; that is what is destroyed by the evil.\n\nSOCRATES:  Very good; and is not this true, Crito, of other things which we\nneed not separately enumerate?  In questions of just and unjust, fair and\nfoul, good and evil, which are the subjects of our present consultation,\nought we to follow the opinion of the many and to fear them; or the opinion\nof the one man who has understanding? ought we not to fear and reverence\nhim more than all the rest of the world:  and if we desert him shall we not\ndestroy and injure that principle in us which may be assumed to be improved\nby justice and deteriorated by injustice;--there is such a principle?\n\nCRITO:  Certainly there is, Socrates.\n\nSOCRATES:  Take a parallel instance:--if, acting under the advice of those\nwho have no understanding, we destroy that which is improved by health and\nis deteriorated by disease, would life be worth having?  And that which has\nbeen destroyed is--the body?\n\nCRITO:  Yes.\n\nSOCRATES:  Could we live, having an evil and corrupted body?\n\nCRITO:  Certainly not.\n\nSOCRATES:  And will life be worth having, if that higher part of man be\ndestroyed, which is improved by justice and depraved by injustice?  Do we\nsuppose that principle, whatever it may be in man, which has to do with\njustice and injustice, to be inferior to the body?\n\nCRITO:  Certainly not.\n\nSOCRATES:  More honourable than the body?\n\nCRITO:  Far more.\n\nSOCRATES:  Then, my friend, we must not regard what the many say of us:\nbut what he, the one man who has understanding of just and unjust, will\nsay, and what the truth will say.  And therefore you begin in error when\nyou advise that we should regard the opinion of the many about just and\nunjust, good and evil, honorable and dishonorable.--'Well,' some one will\nsay, 'but the many can kill us.'\n\nCRITO:  Yes, Socrates; that will clearly be the answer.\n\nSOCRATES:  And it is true; but still I find with surprise that the old\nargument is unshaken as ever.  And I should like to know whether I may say\nthe same of another proposition--that not life, but a good life, is to be\nchiefly valued?\n\nCRITO:  Yes, that also remains unshaken.\n\nSOCRATES:  And a good life is equivalent to a just and honorable one--that\nholds also?\n\nCRITO:  Yes, it does.\n\nSOCRATES:  From these premisses I proceed to argue the question whether I\nought or ought not to try and escape without the consent of the Athenians:\nand if I am clearly right in escaping, then I will make the attempt; but if\nnot, I will abstain.  The other considerations which you mention, of money\nand loss of character and the duty of educating one's children, are, I\nfear, only the doctrines of the multitude, who would be as ready to restore\npeople to life, if they were able, as they are to put them to death--and\nwith as little reason.  But now, since the argument has thus far prevailed,\nthe only question which remains to be considered is, whether we shall do\nrightly either in escaping or in suffering others to aid in our escape and\npaying them in money and thanks, or whether in reality we shall not do\nrightly; and if the latter, then death or any other calamity which may\nensue on my remaining here must not be allowed to enter into the\ncalculation.\n\nCRITO:  I think that you are right, Socrates; how then shall we proceed?\n\nSOCRATES:  Let us consider the matter together, and do you either refute me\nif you can, and I will be convinced; or else cease, my dear friend, from\nrepeating to me that I ought to escape against the wishes of the Athenians:\nfor I highly value your attempts to persuade me to do so, but I may not be\npersuaded against my own better judgment.  And now please to consider my\nfirst position, and try how you can best answer me.\n\nCRITO:  I will.\n\nSOCRATES:  Are we to say that we are never intentionally to do wrong, or\nthat in one way we ought and in another way we ought not to do wrong, or is\ndoing wrong always evil and dishonorable, as I was just now saying, and as\nhas been already acknowledged by us?  Are all our former admissions which\nwere made within a few days to be thrown away?  And have we, at our age,\nbeen earnestly discoursing with one another all our life long only to\ndiscover that we are no better than children?  Or, in spite of the opinion\nof the many, and in spite of consequences whether better or worse, shall we\ninsist on the truth of what was then said, that injustice is always an evil\nand dishonour to him who acts unjustly?  Shall we say so or not?\n\nCRITO:  Yes.\n\nSOCRATES:  Then we must do no wrong?\n\nCRITO:  Certainly not.\n\nSOCRATES:  Nor when injured injure in return, as the many imagine; for we\nmust injure no one at all?  (E.g. compare Rep.)\n\nCRITO:  Clearly not.\n\nSOCRATES:  Again, Crito, may we do evil?\n\nCRITO:  Surely not, Socrates.\n\nSOCRATES:  And what of doing evil in return for evil, which is the morality\nof the many--is that just or not?\n\nCRITO:  Not just.\n\nSOCRATES:  For doing evil to another is the same as injuring him?\n\nCRITO:  Very true.\n\nSOCRATES:  Then we ought not to retaliate or render evil for evil to any\none, whatever evil we may have suffered from him.  But I would have you\nconsider, Crito, whether you really mean what you are saying.  For this\nopinion has never been held, and never will be held, by any considerable\nnumber of persons; and those who are agreed and those who are not agreed\nupon this point have no common ground, and can only despise one another\nwhen they see how widely they differ.  Tell me, then, whether you agree\nwith and assent to my first principle, that neither injury nor retaliation\nnor warding off evil by evil is ever right.  And shall that be the premiss\nof our argument?  Or do you decline and dissent from this?  For so I have\never thought, and continue to think; but, if you are of another opinion,\nlet me hear what you have to say.  If, however, you remain of the same mind\nas formerly, I will proceed to the next step.\n\nCRITO:  You may proceed, for I have not changed my mind.\n\nSOCRATES:  Then I will go on to the next point, which may be put in the\nform of a question:--Ought a man to do what he admits to be right, or ought\nhe to betray the right?\n\nCRITO:  He ought to do what he thinks right.\n\nSOCRATES:  But if this is true, what is the application?  In leaving the\nprison against the will of the Athenians, do I wrong any? or rather do I\nnot wrong those whom I ought least to wrong?  Do I not desert the\nprinciples which were acknowledged by us to be just--what do you say?\n\nCRITO:  I cannot tell, Socrates, for I do not know.\n\nSOCRATES:  Then consider the matter in this way:--Imagine that I am about\nto play truant (you may call the proceeding by any name which you like),\nand the laws and the government come and interrogate me:  'Tell us,\nSocrates,' they say; 'what are you about? are you not going by an act of\nyours to overturn us--the laws, and the whole state, as far as in you lies?\nDo you imagine that a state can subsist and not be overthrown, in which the\ndecisions of law have no power, but are set aside and trampled upon by\nindividuals?'  What will be our answer, Crito, to these and the like words?\nAny one, and especially a rhetorician, will have a good deal to say on\nbehalf of the law which requires a sentence to be carried out.  He will\nargue that this law should not be set aside; and shall we reply, 'Yes; but\nthe state has injured us and given an unjust sentence.'  Suppose I say\nthat?\n\nCRITO:  Very good, Socrates.\n\nSOCRATES:  'And was that our agreement with you?' the law would answer; 'or\nwere you to abide by the sentence of the state?'  And if I were to express\nmy astonishment at their words, the law would probably add:  'Answer,\nSocrates, instead of opening your eyes--you are in the habit of asking and\nanswering questions.  Tell us,--What complaint have you to make against us\nwhich justifies you in attempting to destroy us and the state?  In the\nfirst place did we not bring you into existence?  Your father married your\nmother by our aid and begat you.  Say whether you have any objection to\nurge against those of us who regulate marriage?'  None, I should reply.\n'Or against those of us who after birth regulate the nurture and education\nof children, in which you also were trained?  Were not the laws, which have\nthe charge of education, right in commanding your father to train you in\nmusic and gymnastic?'  Right, I should reply.  'Well then, since you were\nbrought into the world and nurtured and educated by us, can you deny in the\nfirst place that you are our child and slave, as your fathers were before\nyou?  And if this is true you are not on equal terms with us; nor can you\nthink that you have a right to do to us what we are doing to you.  Would\nyou have any right to strike or revile or do any other evil to your father\nor your master, if you had one, because you have been struck or reviled by\nhim, or received some other evil at his hands?--you would not say this?\nAnd because we think right to destroy you, do you think that you have any\nright to destroy us in return, and your country as far as in you lies?\nWill you, O professor of true virtue, pretend that you are justified in\nthis?  Has a philosopher like you failed to discover that our country is\nmore to be valued and higher and holier far than mother or father or any\nancestor, and more to be regarded in the eyes of the gods and of men of\nunderstanding? also to be soothed, and gently and reverently entreated when\nangry, even more than a father, and either to be persuaded, or if not\npersuaded, to be obeyed?  And when we are punished by her, whether with\nimprisonment or stripes, the punishment is to be endured in silence; and if\nshe lead us to wounds or death in battle, thither we follow as is right;\nneither may any one yield or retreat or leave his rank, but whether in\nbattle or in a court of law, or in any other place, he must do what his\ncity and his country order him; or he must change their view of what is\njust:  and if he may do no violence to his father or mother, much less may\nhe do violence to his country.'  What answer shall we make to this, Crito?\nDo the laws speak truly, or do they not?\n\nCRITO:  I think that they do.\n\nSOCRATES:  Then the laws will say:  'Consider, Socrates, if we are speaking\ntruly that in your present attempt you are going to do us an injury.  For,\nhaving brought you into the world, and nurtured and educated you, and given\nyou and every other citizen a share in every good which we had to give, we\nfurther proclaim to any Athenian by the liberty which we allow him, that if\nhe does not like us when he has become of age and has seen the ways of the\ncity, and made our acquaintance, he may go where he pleases and take his\ngoods with him.  None of us laws will forbid him or interfere with him.\nAny one who does not like us and the city, and who wants to emigrate to a\ncolony or to any other city, may go where he likes, retaining his property.\nBut he who has experience of the manner in which we order justice and\nadminister the state, and still remains, has entered into an implied\ncontract that he will do as we command him.  And he who disobeys us is, as\nwe maintain, thrice wrong:  first, because in disobeying us he is\ndisobeying his parents; secondly, because we are the authors of his\neducation; thirdly, because he has made an agreement with us that he will\nduly obey our commands; and he neither obeys them nor convinces us that our\ncommands are unjust; and we do not rudely impose them, but give him the\nalternative of obeying or convincing us;--that is what we offer, and he\ndoes neither.\n\n'These are the sort of accusations to which, as we were saying, you,\nSocrates, will be exposed if you accomplish your intentions; you, above all\nother Athenians.'  Suppose now I ask, why I rather than anybody else? they\nwill justly retort upon me that I above all other men have acknowledged the\nagreement.  'There is clear proof,' they will say, 'Socrates, that we and\nthe city were not displeasing to you.  Of all Athenians you have been the\nmost constant resident in the city, which, as you never leave, you may be\nsupposed to love (compare Phaedr.).  For you never went out of the city\neither to see the games, except once when you went to the Isthmus, or to\nany other place unless when you were on military service; nor did you\ntravel as other men do.  Nor had you any curiosity to know other states or\ntheir laws:  your affections did not go beyond us and our state; we were\nyour especial favourites, and you acquiesced in our government of you; and\nhere in this city you begat your children, which is a proof of your\nsatisfaction.  Moreover, you might in the course of the trial, if you had\nliked, have fixed the penalty at banishment; the state which refuses to let\nyou go now would have let you go then.  But you pretended that you\npreferred death to exile (compare Apol.), and that you were not unwilling\nto die.  And now you have forgotten these fine sentiments, and pay no\nrespect to us the laws, of whom you are the destroyer; and are doing what\nonly a miserable slave would do, running away and turning your back upon\nthe compacts and agreements which you made as a citizen.  And first of all\nanswer this very question:  Are we right in saying that you agreed to be\ngoverned according to us in deed, and not in word only?  Is that true or\nnot?'  How shall we answer, Crito?  Must we not assent?\n\nCRITO:  We cannot help it, Socrates.\n\nSOCRATES:  Then will they not say:  'You, Socrates, are breaking the\ncovenants and agreements which you made with us at your leisure, not in any\nhaste or under any compulsion or deception, but after you have had seventy\nyears to think of them, during which time you were at liberty to leave the\ncity, if we were not to your mind, or if our covenants appeared to you to\nbe unfair.  You had your choice, and might have gone either to Lacedaemon\nor Crete, both which states are often praised by you for their good\ngovernment, or to some other Hellenic or foreign state.  Whereas you, above\nall other Athenians, seemed to be so fond of the state, or, in other words,\nof us her laws (and who would care about a state which has no laws?), that\nyou never stirred out of her; the halt, the blind, the maimed, were not\nmore stationary in her than you were.  And now you run away and forsake\nyour agreements.  Not so, Socrates, if you will take our advice; do not\nmake yourself ridiculous by escaping out of the city.\n\n'For just consider, if you transgress and err in this sort of way, what\ngood will you do either to yourself or to your friends?  That your friends\nwill be driven into exile and deprived of citizenship, or will lose their\nproperty, is tolerably certain; and you yourself, if you fly to one of the\nneighbouring cities, as, for example, Thebes or Megara, both of which are\nwell governed, will come to them as an enemy, Socrates, and their\ngovernment will be against you, and all patriotic citizens will cast an\nevil eye upon you as a subverter of the laws, and you will confirm in the\nminds of the judges the justice of their own condemnation of you.  For he\nwho is a corrupter of the laws is more than likely to be a corrupter of the\nyoung and foolish portion of mankind.  Will you then flee from well-ordered\ncities and virtuous men? and is existence worth having on these terms?  Or\nwill you go to them without shame, and talk to them, Socrates?  And what\nwill you say to them?  What you say here about virtue and justice and\ninstitutions and laws being the best things among men?  Would that be\ndecent of you?  Surely not.  But if you go away from well-governed states\nto Crito's friends in Thessaly, where there is great disorder and licence,\nthey will be charmed to hear the tale of your escape from prison, set off\nwith ludicrous particulars of the manner in which you were wrapped in a\ngoatskin or some other disguise, and metamorphosed as the manner is of\nrunaways; but will there be no one to remind you that in your old age you\nwere not ashamed to violate the most sacred laws from a miserable desire of\na little more life?  Perhaps not, if you keep them in a good temper; but if\nthey are out of temper you will hear many degrading things; you will live,\nbut how?--as the flatterer of all men, and the servant of all men; and\ndoing what?--eating and drinking in Thessaly, having gone abroad in order\nthat you may get a dinner.  And where will be your fine sentiments about\njustice and virtue?  Say that you wish to live for the sake of your\nchildren--you want to bring them up and educate them--will you take them\ninto Thessaly and deprive them of Athenian citizenship?  Is this the\nbenefit which you will confer upon them?  Or are you under the impression\nthat they will be better cared for and educated here if you are still\nalive, although absent from them; for your friends will take care of them?\nDo you fancy that if you are an inhabitant of Thessaly they will take care\nof them, and if you are an inhabitant of the other world that they will not\ntake care of them?  Nay; but if they who call themselves friends are good\nfor anything, they will--to be sure they will.\n\n'Listen, then, Socrates, to us who have brought you up.  Think not of life\nand children first, and of justice afterwards, but of justice first, that\nyou may be justified before the princes of the world below.  For neither\nwill you nor any that belong to you be happier or holier or juster in this\nlife, or happier in another, if you do as Crito bids.  Now you depart in\ninnocence, a sufferer and not a doer of evil; a victim, not of the laws,\nbut of men.  But if you go forth, returning evil for evil, and injury for\ninjury, breaking the covenants and agreements which you have made with us,\nand wronging those whom you ought least of all to wrong, that is to say,\nyourself, your friends, your country, and us, we shall be angry with you\nwhile you live, and our brethren, the laws in the world below, will receive\nyou as an enemy; for they will know that you have done your best to destroy\nus.  Listen, then, to us and not to Crito.'\n\nThis, dear Crito, is the voice which I seem to hear murmuring in my ears,\nlike the sound of the flute in the ears of the mystic; that voice, I say,\nis humming in my ears, and prevents me from hearing any other.

I won’t pretend to have\ntaken his vast measure on that first occasion, but I think I had achieved\na glimpse of what the privilege of his acquaintance might mean for many\npersons in the way of charges accepted.  He had been a great experience,\nand it was this perhaps that had put me into the frame of foreseeing how\nwe should all, sooner or later, have the honour of dealing with him as a\nwhole.  Whatever impression I then received of the amount of this total,\nI had a full enough vision of the patience of the Mulvilles.  He was to\nstay all the winter: Adelaide dropped it in a tone that drew the sting\nfrom the inevitable emphasis.  These excellent people might indeed have\nbeen content to give the circle of hospitality a diameter of six months;\nbut if they didn’t say he was to stay all summer as well it was only\nbecause this was more than they ventured to hope.  I remember that at\ndinner that evening he wore slippers, new and predominantly purple, of\nsome queer carpet-stuff; but the Mulvilles were still in the stage of\nsupposing that he might be snatched from them by higher bidders.  At a\nlater time they grew, poor dears, to fear no snatching; but theirs was a\nfidelity which needed no help from competition to make them proud.\nWonderful indeed as, when all was said, you inevitably pronounced Frank\nSaltram, it was not to be overlooked that the Kent Mulvilles were in\ntheir way still more extraordinary: as striking an instance as could\neasily be encountered of the familiar truth that remarkable men find\nremarkable conveniences.\n\nThey had sent for me from Wimbledon to come out and dine, and there had\nbeen an implication in Adelaide’s note—judged by her notes alone she\nmight have been thought silly—that it was a case in which something\nmomentous was to be determined or done.  I had never known them not be in\na “state” about somebody, and I dare say I tried to be droll on this\npoint in accepting their invitation.  On finding myself in the presence\nof their latest discovery I had not at first felt irreverence droop—and,\nthank heaven, I have never been absolutely deprived of that alternative\nin Mr. Saltram’s company.  I saw, however—I hasten to declare it—that\ncompared to this specimen their other phoenixes had been birds of\ninconsiderable feather, and I afterwards took credit to myself for not\nhaving even in primal bewilderments made a mistake about the essence of\nthe man.  He had an incomparable gift; I never was blind to it—it dazzles\nme still.  It dazzles me perhaps even more in remembrance than in fact,\nfor I’m not unaware that for so rare a subject the imagination goes to\nsome expense, inserting a jewel here and there or giving a twist to a\nplume.  How the art of portraiture would rejoice in this figure if the\nart of portraiture had only the canvas!  Nature, in truth, had largely\nrounded it, and if memory, hovering about it, sometimes holds her breath,\nthis is because the voice that comes back was really golden.\n\nThough the great man was an inmate and didn’t dress, he kept dinner on\nthis occasion waiting, and the first words he uttered on coming into the\nroom were an elated announcement to Mulville that he had found out\nsomething.  Not catching the allusion and gaping doubtless a little at\nhis face, I privately asked Adelaide what he had found out.  I shall\nnever forget the look she gave me as she replied: “Everything!”  She\nreally believed it.  At that moment, at any rate, he had found out that\nthe mercy of the Mulvilles was infinite.  He had previously of course\ndiscovered, as I had myself for that matter, that their dinners were\nsoignés.  Let me not indeed, in saying this, neglect to declare that I\nshall falsify my counterfeit if I seem to hint that there was in his\nnature any ounce of calculation.  He took whatever came, but he never\nplotted for it, and no man who was so much of an absorbent can ever have\nbeen so little of a parasite.  He had a system of the universe, but he\nhad no system of sponging—that was quite hand-to-mouth.  He had fine\ngross easy senses, but it was not his good-natured appetite that wrought\nconfusion.  If he had loved us for our dinners we could have paid with\nour dinners, and it would have been a great economy of finer matter.  I\nmake free in these connexions with the plural possessive because if I was\nnever able to do what the Mulvilles did, and people with still bigger\nhouses and simpler charities, I met, first and last, every demand of\nreflexion, of emotion—particularly perhaps those of gratitude and of\nresentment.  No one, I think, paid the tribute of giving him up so often,\nand if it’s rendering honour to borrow wisdom I’ve a right to talk of my\nsacrifices.  He yielded lessons as the sea yields fish—I lived for a\nwhile on this diet.  Sometimes it almost appeared to me that his massive\nmonstrous failure—if failure after all it was—had been designed for my\nprivate recreation.  He fairly pampered my curiosity; but the history of\nthat experience would take me too far.  This is not the large canvas I\njust now spoke of, and I wouldn’t have approached him with my present\nhand had it been a question of all the features.  Frank Saltram’s\nfeatures, for artistic purposes, are verily the anecdotes that are to be\ngathered.  Their name is legion, and this is only one, of which the\ninterest is that it concerns even more closely several other persons.\nSuch episodes, as one looks back, are the little dramas that made up the\ninnumerable facets of the big drama—which is yet to be reported.\n\n\n\n\nII\n\n\nIT is furthermore remarkable that though the two stories are distinct—my\nown, as it were, and this other—they equally began, in a manner, the\nfirst night of my acquaintance with Frank Saltram, the night I came back\nfrom Wimbledon so agitated with a new sense of life that, in London, for\nthe very thrill of it, I could only walk home.  Walking and swinging my\nstick, I overtook, at Buckingham Gate, George Gravener, and George\nGravener’s story may be said to have begun with my making him, as our\npaths lay together, come home with me for a talk.  I duly remember, let\nme parenthesise, that it was still more that of another person, and also\nthat several years were to elapse before it was to extend to a second\nchapter.  I had much to say to him, none the less, about my visit to the\nMulvilles, whom he more indifferently knew, and I was at any rate so\namusing that for long afterwards he never encountered me without asking\nfor news of the old man of the sea.  I hadn’t said Mr. Saltram was old,\nand it was to be seen that he was of an age to outweather George\nGravener.  I had at that time a lodging in Ebury Street, and Gravener was\nstaying at his brother’s empty house in Eaton Square.  At Cambridge, five\nyears before, even in our devastating set, his intellectual power had\nseemed to me almost awful.  Some one had once asked me privately, with\nblanched cheeks, what it was then that after all such a mind as that left\nstanding.  “It leaves itself!” I could recollect devoutly replying.  I\ncould smile at present for this remembrance, since before we got to Ebury\nStreet I was struck with the fact that, save in the sense of being well\nset up on his legs, George Gravener had actually ceased to tower.  The\nuniverse he laid low had somehow bloomed again—the usual eminences were\nvisible.  I wondered whether he had lost his humour, or only, dreadful\nthought, had never had any—not even when I had fancied him most\nAristophanesque.  What was the need of appealing to laughter, however, I\ncould enviously enquire, where you might appeal so confidently to\nmeasurement?  Mr. Saltram’s queer figure, his thick nose and hanging lip,\nwere fresh to me: in the light of my old friend’s fine cold symmetry they\npresented mere success in amusing as the refuge of conscious ugliness.\nAlready, at hungry twenty-six, Gravener looked as blank and parliamentary\nas if he were fifty and popular.  In my scrap of a residence—he had a\nworldling’s eye for its futile conveniences, but never a comrade’s joke—I\nsounded Frank Saltram in his ears; a circumstance I mention in order to\nnote that even then I was surprised at his impatience of my enlivenment.\nAs he had never before heard of the personage it took indeed the form of\nimpatience of the preposterous Mulvilles, his relation to whom, like\nmine, had had its origin in an early, a childish intimacy with the young\nAdelaide, the fruit of multiplied ties in the previous generation.  When\nshe married Kent Mulville, who was older than Gravener and I and much\nmore amiable, I gained a friend, but Gravener practically lost one.  We\nreacted in different ways from the form taken by what he called their\ndeplorable social action—the form (the term was also his) of nasty\nsecond-rate gush.  I may have held in my ‘for intérieur’ that the good\npeople at Wimbledon were beautiful fools, but when he sniffed at them I\ncouldn’t help taking the opposite line, for I already felt that even\nshould we happen to agree it would always be for reasons that differed.\nIt came home to me that he was admirably British as, without so much as a\nsociable sneer at my bookbinder, he turned away from the serried rows of\nmy little French library.\n\n“Of course I’ve never seen the fellow, but it’s clear enough he’s a\nhumbug.”\n\n“Clear ‘enough’ is just what it isn’t,” I replied; “if it only were!”\nThat ejaculation on my part must have been the beginning of what was to\nbe later a long ache for final frivolous rest.  Gravener was profound\nenough to remark after a moment that in the first place he couldn’t be\nanything but a Dissenter, and when I answered that the very note of his\nfascination was his extraordinary speculative breadth my friend retorted\nthat there was no cad like your cultivated cad, and that I might depend\nupon discovering—since I had had the levity not already to have\nenquired—that my shining light proceeded, a generation back, from a\nMethodist cheesemonger.  I confess I was struck with his insistence, and\nI said, after reflexion: “It may be—I admit it may be; but why on earth\nare you so sure?”—asking the question mainly to lay him the trap of\nsaying that it was because the poor man didn’t dress for dinner.  He took\nan instant to circumvent my trap and come blandly out the other side.\n\n“Because the Kent Mulvilles have invented him.  They’ve an infallible\nhand for frauds.  All their geese are swans.  They were born to be duped,\nthey like it, they cry for it, they don’t know anything from anything,\nand they disgust one—luckily perhaps!—with Christian charity.”  His\nvehemence was doubtless an accident, but it might have been a strange\nforeknowledge.  I forget what protest I dropped; it was at any rate\nsomething that led him to go on after a moment: “I only ask one\nthing—it’s perfectly simple.  Is a man, in a given case, a real\ngentleman?”\n\n“A real gentleman, my dear fellow—that’s so soon said!”\n\n“Not so soon when he isn’t!  If they’ve got hold of one this time he must\nbe a great rascal!”\n\n“I might feel injured,” I answered, “if I didn’t reflect that they don’t\nrave about me.”\n\n“Don’t be too sure!  I’ll grant that he’s a gentleman,” Gravener\npresently added, “if you’ll admit that he’s a scamp.”\n\n“I don’t know which to admire most, your logic or your benevolence.”\n\nMy friend coloured at this, but he didn’t change the subject.  “Where did\nthey pick him up?”\n\n“I think they were struck with something he had published.”\n\n“I can fancy the dreary thing!”\n\n“I believe they found out he had all sorts of worries and difficulties.”\n\n“That of course wasn’t to be endured, so they jumped at the privilege of\npaying his debts!”  I professed that I knew nothing about his debts, and\nI reminded my visitor that though the dear Mulvilles were angels they\nwere neither idiots nor millionaires.  What they mainly aimed at was\nreuniting Mr. Saltram to his wife.  “I was expecting to hear he has\nbasely abandoned her,” Gravener went on, at this, “and I’m too glad you\ndon’t disappoint me.”\n\nI tried to recall exactly what Mrs. Mulville had told me.  “He didn’t\nleave her—no.  It’s she who has left him.”\n\n“Left him to us?” Gravener asked.  “The monster—many thanks!  I decline\nto take him.”\n\n“You’ll hear more about him in spite of yourself.  I can’t, no, I really\ncan’t resist the impression that he’s a big man.”  I was already\nmastering—to my shame perhaps be it said—just the tone my old friend\nleast liked.\n\n“It’s doubtless only a trifle,” he returned, “but you haven’t happened to\nmention what his reputation’s to rest on.”\n\n“Why on what I began by boring you with—his extraordinary mind.”\n\n“As exhibited in his writings?”\n\n“Possibly in his writings, but certainly in his talk, which is far and\naway the richest I ever listened to.”\n\n“And what’s it all about?”\n\n“My dear fellow, don’t ask me!  About everything!” I pursued, reminding\nmyself of poor Adelaide.  “About his ideas of things,” I then more\ncharitably added.  “You must have heard him to know what I mean—it’s\nunlike anything that ever was heard.”  I coloured, I admit, I overcharged\na little, for such a picture was an anticipation of Saltram’s later\ndevelopment and still more of my fuller acquaintance with him.  However,\nI really expressed, a little lyrically perhaps, my actual imagination of\nhim when I proceeded to declare that, in a cloud of tradition, of legend,\nhe might very well go down to posterity as the greatest of all great\ntalkers.  Before we parted George Gravener had wondered why such a row\nshould be made about a chatterbox the more and why he should be pampered\nand pensioned.  The greater the wind-bag the greater the calamity.  Out\nof proportion to everything else on earth had come to be this wagging of\nthe tongue.  We were drenched with talk—our wretched age was dying of it.\nI differed from him here sincerely, only going so far as to concede, and\ngladly, that we were drenched with sound.  It was not however the mere\nspeakers who were killing us—it was the mere stammerers.  Fine talk was\nas rare as it was refreshing—the gift of the gods themselves, the one\nstarry spangle on the ragged cloak of humanity.  How many men were there\nwho rose to this privilege, of how many masters of conversation could he\nboast the acquaintance?  Dying of talk?—why we were dying of the lack of\nit!  Bad writing wasn’t talk, as many people seemed to think, and even\ngood wasn’t always to be compared to it.  From the best talk indeed the\nbest writing had something to learn.  I fancifully added that we too\nshould peradventure be gilded by the legend, should be pointed at for\nhaving listened, for having actually heard.  Gravener, who had glanced at\nhis watch and discovered it was midnight, found to all this a retort\nbeautifully characteristic of him.\n\n“There’s one little fact to be borne in mind in the presence equally of\nthe best talk and of the worst.”  He looked, in saying this, as if he\nmeant great things, and I was sure he could only mean once more that\nneither of them mattered if a man wasn’t a real gentleman.  Perhaps it\nwas what he did mean; he deprived me however of the exultation of being\nright by putting the truth in a slightly different way.  “The only thing\nthat really counts for one’s estimate of a person is his conduct.”  He\nhad his watch still in his palm, and I reproached him with unfair play in\nhaving ascertained beforehand that it was now the hour at which I always\ngave in.  My pleasantry so far failed to mollify him that he promptly\nadded that to the rule he had just enunciated there was absolutely no\nexception.\n\n“None whatever?”\n\n“None whatever.”\n\n“Trust me then to try to be good at any price!” I laughed as I went with\nhim to the door.  “I declare I will be, if I have to be horrible!”\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\n\nIF that first night was one of the liveliest, or at any rate was the\nfreshest, of my exaltations, there was another, four years later, that\nwas one of my great discomposures.  Repetition, I well knew by this time,\nwas the secret of Saltram’s power to alienate, and of course one would\nnever have seen him at his finest if one hadn’t seen him in his remorses.\nThey set in mainly at this season and were magnificent, elemental,\norchestral.  I was quite aware that one of these atmospheric disturbances\nwas now due; but none the less, in our arduous attempt to set him on his\nfeet as a lecturer, it was impossible not to feel that two failures were\na large order, as we said, for a short course of five.  This was the\nsecond time, and it was past nine o’clock; the audience, a muster\nunprecedented and really encouraging, had fortunately the attitude of\nblandness that might have been looked for in persons whom the promise of\n(if I’m not mistaken) An Analysis of Primary Ideas had drawn to the\nneighbourhood of Upper Baker Street.  There was in those days in that\nregion a petty lecture-hall to be secured on terms as moderate as the\nfunds left at our disposal by the irrepressible question of the\nmaintenance of five small Saltrams—I include the mother—and one large\none.  By the time the Saltrams, of different sizes, were all maintained\nwe had pretty well poured out the oil that might have lubricated the\nmachinery for enabling the most original of men to appear to maintain\nthem.\n\nIt was I, the other time, who had been forced into the breach, standing\nup there for an odious lamplit moment to explain to half a dozen thin\nbenches, where earnest brows were virtuously void of anything so cynical\nas a suspicion, that we couldn’t so much as put a finger on Mr. Saltram.\nThere was nothing to plead but that our scouts had been out from the\nearly hours and that we were afraid that on one of his walks abroad—he\ntook one, for meditation, whenever he was to address such a company—some\naccident had disabled or delayed him.  The meditative walks were a\nfiction, for he never, that any one could discover, prepared anything but\na magnificent prospectus; hence his circulars and programmes, of which I\npossess an almost complete collection, are the solemn ghosts of\ngenerations never born.  I put the case, as it seemed to me, at the best;\nbut I admit I had been angry, and Kent Mulville was shocked at my want of\npublic optimism.  This time therefore I left the excuses to his more\npractised patience, only relieving myself in response to a direct appeal\nfrom a young lady next whom, in the hall, I found myself sitting.  My\nposition was an accident, but if it had been calculated the reason would\nscarce have eluded an observer of the fact that no one else in the room\nhad an approach to an appearance.  Our philosopher’s “tail” was\ndeplorably limp.  This visitor was the only person who looked at her\nease, who had come a little in the spirit of adventure.  She seemed to\ncarry amusement in her handsome young head, and her presence spoke, a\nlittle mystifyingly, of a sudden extension of Saltram’s sphere of\ninfluence.  He was doing better than we hoped, and he had chosen such an\noccasion, of all occasions, to succumb to heaven knew which of his fond\ninfirmities.  The young lady produced an impression of auburn hair and\nblack velvet, and had on her other hand a companion of obscurer type,\npresumably a waiting-maid.  She herself might perhaps have been a foreign\ncountess, and before she addressed me I had beguiled our sorry interval\nby finding in her a vague recall of the opening of some novel of Madame\nSand.  It didn’t make her more fathomable to pass in a few minutes from\nthis to the certitude that she was American; it simply engendered\ndepressing reflexions as to the possible check to contributions from\nBoston.  She asked me if, as a person apparently more initiated, I would\nrecommend further waiting, and I answered that if she considered I was on\nmy honour I would privately deprecate it.  Perhaps she didn’t; at any\nrate our talk took a turn that prolonged it till she became aware we were\nleft almost alone.  I presently ascertained she knew Mrs. Saltram, and\nthis explained in a manner the miracle.  The brotherhood of the friends\nof the husband was as nothing to the brotherhood, or perhaps I should say\nthe sisterhood, of the friends of the wife.  Like the Kent Mulvilles I\nbelonged to both fraternities, and even better than they I think I had\nsounded the abyss of Mrs. Saltram’s wrongs.  She bored me to extinction,\nand I knew but too well how she had bored her husband; but there were\nthose who stood by her, the most efficient of whom were indeed the\nhandful of poor Saltram’s backers.  They did her liberal justice, whereas\nher mere patrons and partisans had nothing but hatred for our\nphilosopher.  I’m bound to say it was we, however—we of both camps, as it\nwere—who had always done most for her.\n\nI thought my young lady looked rich—I scarcely knew why; and I hoped she\nhad put her hand in her pocket.  I soon made her out, however, not at all\na fine fanatic—she was but a generous, irresponsible enquirer.  She had\ncome to England to see her aunt, and it was at her aunt’s she had met the\ndreary lady we had all so much on our mind.  I saw she’d help to pass the\ntime when she observed that it was a pity this lady wasn’t intrinsically\nmore interesting.  That was refreshing, for it was an article of faith in\nMrs. Saltram’s circle—at least among those who scorned to know her horrid\nhusband—that she was attractive on her merits.  She was in truth a most\nordinary person, as Saltram himself would have been if he hadn’t been a\nprodigy.  The question of vulgarity had no application to him, but it was\na measure his wife kept challenging you to apply.  I hasten to add that\nthe consequences of your doing so were no sufficient reason for his\nhaving left her to starve.  “He doesn’t seem to have much force of\ncharacter,” said my young lady; at which I laughed out so loud that my\ndeparting friends looked back at me over their shoulders as if I were\nmaking a joke of their discomfiture.  My joke probably cost Saltram a\nsubscription or two, but it helped me on with my interlocutress.  “She\nsays he drinks like a fish,” she sociably continued, “and yet she allows\nthat his mind’s wonderfully clear.”  It was amusing to converse with a\npretty girl who could talk of the clearness of Saltram’s mind.  I\nexpected next to hear she had been assured he was awfully clever.  I\ntried to tell her—I had it almost on my conscience—what was the proper\nway to regard him; an effort attended perhaps more than ever on this\noccasion with the usual effect of my feeling that I wasn’t after all very\nsure of it.  She had come to-night out of high curiosity—she had wanted\nto learn this proper way for herself.  She had read some of his papers\nand hadn’t understood them; but it was at home, at her aunt’s, that her\ncuriosity had been kindled—kindled mainly by his wife’s remarkable\nstories of his want of virtue.  “I suppose they ought to have kept me\naway,” my companion dropped, “and I suppose they’d have done so if I\nhadn’t somehow got an idea that he’s fascinating.  In fact Mrs. Saltram\nherself says he is.”\n\n“So you came to see where the fascination resides?  Well, you’ve seen!”\n\nMy young lady raised fine eyebrows.  “Do you mean in his bad faith?”\n\n“In the extraordinary effects of it; his possession, that is, of some\nquality or other that condemns us in advance to forgive him the\nhumiliation, as I may call it, to which he has subjected us.”\n\n“The humiliation?”\n\n“Why mine, for instance, as one of his guarantors, before you as the\npurchaser of a ticket.”\n\nShe let her charming gay eyes rest on me.  “You don’t look humiliated a\nbit, and if you did I should let you off, disappointed as I am; for the\nmysterious quality you speak of is just the quality I came to see.”\n\n“Oh, you can’t ‘see’ it!” I cried.\n\n“How then do you get at it?”\n\n“You don’t!  You mustn’t suppose he’s good-looking,” I added.\n\n“Why his wife says he’s lovely!”\n\nMy hilarity may have struck her as excessive, but I confess it broke out\nafresh.  Had she acted only in obedience to this singular plea, so\ncharacteristic, on Mrs. Saltram’s part, of what was irritating in the\nnarrowness of that lady’s point of view?  “Mrs. Saltram,” I explained,\n“undervalues him where he’s strongest, so that, to make up for it\nperhaps, she overpraises him where he’s weak.  He’s not, assuredly,\nsuperficially attractive; he’s middle-aged, fat, featureless save for his\ngreat eyes.”\n\n“Yes, his great eyes,” said my young lady attentively.  She had evidently\nheard all about his great eyes—the beaux yeux for which alone we had\nreally done it all.\n\n“They’re tragic and splendid—lights on a dangerous coast.  But he moves\nbadly and dresses worse, and altogether he’s anything but smart.”\n\nMy companion, who appeared to reflect on this, after a moment appealed.\n“Do you call him a real gentleman?”\n\nI started slightly at the question, for I had a sense of recognising it:\nGeorge Gravener, years before, that first flushed night, had put me face\nto face with it.  It had embarrassed me then, but it didn’t embarrass me\nnow, for I had lived with it and overcome it and disposed of it.  “A real\ngentleman?  Emphatically not!”\n\nMy promptitude surprised her a little, but I quickly felt how little it\nwas to Gravener I was now talking.  “Do you say that because he’s—what do\nyou call it in England?—of humble extraction?”\n\n“Not a bit.  His father was a country school-master and his mother the\nwidow of a sexton, but that has nothing to do with it.  I say it simply\nbecause I know him well.”\n\n“But isn’t it an awful drawback?”\n\n“Awful—quite awful.”\n\n“I mean isn’t it positively fatal?”\n\n“Fatal to what?  Not to his magnificent vitality.”\n\nAgain she had a meditative moment.  “And is his magnificent vitality the\ncause of his vices?”\n\n“Your questions are formidable, but I’m glad you put them.  I was\nthinking of his noble intellect.  His vices, as you say, have been much\nexaggerated: they consist mainly after all in one comprehensive defect.”\n\n“A want of will?”\n\n“A want of dignity.”\n\n“He doesn’t recognise his obligations?”\n\n“On the contrary, he recognises them with effusion, especially in public:\nhe smiles and bows and beckons across the street to them.  But when they\npass over he turns away, and he speedily loses them in the crowd.  The\nrecognition’s purely spiritual—it isn’t in the least social.  So he\nleaves all his belongings to other people to take care of.  He accepts\nfavours, loans, sacrifices—all with nothing more deterrent than an agony\nof shame.  Fortunately we’re a little faithful band, and we do what we\ncan.”  I held my tongue about the natural children, engendered, to the\nnumber of three, in the wantonness of his youth.  I only remarked that he\ndid make efforts—often tremendous ones.  “But the efforts,” I said,\n“never come to much: the only things that come to much are the\nabandonments, the surrenders.”\n\n“And how much do they come to?”\n\n“You’re right to put it as if we had a big bill to pay, but, as I’ve told\nyou before, your questions are rather terrible.  They come, these mere\nexercises of genius, to a great sum total of poetry, of philosophy, a\nmighty mass of speculation, notation, quotation.  The genius is there,\nyou see, to meet the surrender; but there’s no genius to support the\ndefence.”\n\n“But what is there, after all, at his age, to show?”\n\n“In the way of achievement recognised and reputation established?” I\nasked.  “To ‘show’ if you will, there isn’t much, since his writing,\nmostly, isn’t as fine, isn’t certainly as showy, as his talk.  Moreover\ntwo-thirds of his work are merely colossal projects and announcements.\n‘Showing’ Frank Saltram is often a poor business,” I went on: “we\nendeavoured, you’ll have observed, to show him to-night!  However, if he\nhad lectured he’d have lectured divinely.  It would just have been his\ntalk.”\n\n“And what would his talk just have been?”\n\nI was conscious of some ineffectiveness, as well perhaps as of a little\nimpatience, as I replied: “The exhibition of a splendid intellect.”  My\nyoung lady looked not quite satisfied at this, but as I wasn’t prepared\nfor another question I hastily pursued: “The sight of a great suspended\nswinging crystal—huge lucid lustrous, a block of light—flashing back\nevery impression of life and every possibility of thought!”\n\nThis gave her something to turn over till we had passed out to the dusky\nporch of the hall, in front of which the lamps of a quiet brougham were\nalmost the only thing Saltram’s treachery hadn’t extinguished.  I went\nwith her to the door of her carriage, out of which she leaned a moment\nafter she had thanked me and taken her seat.  Her smile even in the\ndarkness was pretty.  “I do want to see that crystal!”\n\n“You’ve only to come to the next lecture.”\n\n“I go abroad in a day or two with my aunt.”\n\n“Wait over till next week,” I suggested.  “It’s quite worth it.”\n\nShe became grave.  “Not unless he really comes!”  At which the brougham\nstarted off, carrying her away too fast, fortunately for my manners, to\nallow me to exclaim “Ingratitude!”\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\n\nMRS. SALTRAM made a great affair of her right to be informed where her\nhusband had been the second evening he failed to meet his audience.  She\ncame to me to ascertain, but I couldn’t satisfy her, for in spite of my\ningenuity I remained in ignorance.  It wasn’t till much later that I\nfound this had not been the case with Kent Mulville, whose hope for the\nbest never twirled the thumbs of him more placidly than when he happened\nto know the worst.  He had known it on the occasion I speak of—that is\nimmediately after.  He was impenetrable then, but ultimately confessed.\nWhat he confessed was more than I shall now venture to make public.  It\nwas of course familiar to me that Saltram was incapable of keeping the\nengagements which, after their separation, he had entered into with\nregard to his wife, a deeply wronged, justly resentful, quite\nirreproachable and insufferable person.  She often appeared at my\nchambers to talk over his lapses; for if, as she declared, she had washed\nher hands of him, she had carefully preserved the water of this ablution,\nwhich she handed about for analysis.  She had arts of her own of exciting\none’s impatience, the most infallible of which was perhaps her assumption\nthat we were kind to her because we liked her.  In reality her personal\nfall had been a sort of social rise—since I had seen the moment when, in\nour little conscientious circle, her desolation almost made her the\nfashion.  Her voice was grating and her children ugly; moreover she hated\nthe good Mulvilles, whom I more and more loved.  They were the people who\nby doing most for her husband had in the long run done most for herself;\nand the warm confidence with which he had laid his length upon them was a\npressure gentle compared with her stiffer persuadability.  I’m bound to\nsay he didn’t criticise his benefactors, though practically he got tired\nof them; she, however, had the highest standards about eleemosynary\nforms.  She offered the odd spectacle of a spirit puffed up by\ndependence, and indeed it had introduced her to some excellent society.\nShe pitied me for not knowing certain people who aided her and whom she\ndoubtless patronised in turn for their luck in not knowing me.  I dare\nsay I should have got on with her better if she had had a ray of\nimagination—if it had occasionally seemed to occur to her to regard\nSaltram’s expressions of his nature in any other manner than as separate\nsubjects of woe.  They were all flowers of his character, pearls strung\non an endless thread; but she had a stubborn little way of challenging\nthem one after the other, as if she never suspected that he had a\ncharacter, such as it was, or that deficiencies might be organic; the\nirritating effect of a mind incapable of a generalisation.  One might\ndoubtless have overdone the idea that there was a general licence for\nsuch a man; but if this had happened it would have been through one’s\nfeeling that there could be none for such a woman.\n\nI recognised her superiority when I asked her about the aunt of the\ndisappointed young lady: it sounded like a sentence from an\nEnglish-French or other phrase-book.  She triumphed in what she told me\nand she may have triumphed still more in what she withheld.  My friend of\nthe other evening, Miss Anvoy, had but lately come to England; Lady\nCoxon, the aunt, had been established here for years in consequence of\nher marriage with the late Sir Gregory of that name.  She had a house in\nthe Regent’s Park, a Bath-chair and a fernery; and above all she had\nsympathy.  Mrs. Saltram had made her acquaintance through mutual friends.\nThis vagueness caused me to feel how much I was out of it and how large\nan independent circle Mrs. Saltram had at her command.  I should have\nbeen glad to know more about the disappointed young lady, but I felt I\nshould know most by not depriving her of her advantage, as she might have\nmysterious means of depriving me of my knowledge.  For the present,\nmoreover, this experience was stayed, Lady Coxon having in fact gone\nabroad accompanied by her niece.  The niece, besides being immensely\nclever, was an heiress, Mrs. Saltram said; the only daughter and the\nlight of the eyes of some great American merchant, a man, over there, of\nendless indulgences and dollars.  She had pretty clothes and pretty\nmanners, and she had, what was prettier still, the great thing of all.\nThe great thing of all for Mrs. Saltram was always sympathy, and she\nspoke as if during the absence of these ladies she mightn’t know where to\nturn for it.  A few months later indeed, when they had come back, her\ntone perceptibly changed: she alluded to them, on my leading her up to\nit, rather as to persons in her debt for favours received.  What had\nhappened I didn’t know, but I saw it would take only a little more or a\nlittle less to make her speak of them as thankless subjects of social\ncountenance—people for whom she had vainly tried to do something.  I\nconfess I saw how it wouldn’t be in a mere week or two that I should rid\nmyself of the image of Ruth Anvoy, in whose very name, when I learnt it,\nI found something secretly to like.  I should probably neither see her\nnor hear of her again: the knight’s widow (he had been mayor of\nClockborough) would pass away and the heiress would return to her\ninheritance.  I gathered with surprise that she had not communicated to\nhis wife the story of her attempt to hear Mr..Saltram, and I founded this\nreticence on the easy supposition that Mrs. Saltram had fatigued by\noverpressure the spring of the sympathy of which she boasted.  The girl\nat any rate would forget the small adventure, be distracted, take a\nhusband; besides which she would lack occasion to repeat her experiment.\n\nWe clung to the idea of the brilliant course, delivered without an\naccident, that, as a lecturer, would still make the paying public aware\nof our great man, but the fact remained that in the case of an\ninspiration so unequal there was treachery, there was fallacy at least,\nin the very conception of a series.  In our scrutiny of ways and means we\nwere inevitably subject to the old convention of the synopsis, the\nsyllabus, partly of course not to lose the advantage of his grand free\nhand in drawing up such things; but for myself I laughed at our playbills\neven while I stickled for them.  It was indeed amusing work to be\nscrupulous for Frank Saltram, who also at moments laughed about it, so\nfar as the comfort of a sigh so unstudied as to be cheerful might pass\nfor such a sound.  He admitted with a candour all his own that he was in\ntruth only to be depended on in the Mulvilles’ drawing-room.  “Yes,” he\nsuggestively allowed, “it’s there, I think, that I’m at my best; quite\nlate, when it gets toward eleven—and if I’ve not been too much worried.”\nWe all knew what too much worry meant; it meant too enslaved for the hour\nto the superstition of sobriety.  On the Saturdays I used to bring my\nportmanteau, so as not to have to think of eleven o’clock trains.  I had\na bold theory that as regards this temple of talk and its altars of\ncushioned chintz, its pictures and its flowers, its large fireside and\nclear lamplight, we might really arrive at something if the Mulvilles\nwould but charge for admission.  Here it was, however, that they\nshamelessly broke down; as there’s a flaw in every perfection this was\nthe inexpugnable refuge of their egotism.  They declined to make their\nsaloon a market, so that Saltram’s golden words continued the sole coin\nthat rang there.  It can have happened to no man, however, to be paid a\ngreater price than such an enchanted hush as surrounded him on his\ngreatest nights.  The most profane, on these occasions, felt a presence;\nall minor eloquence grew dumb.  Adelaide Mulville, for the pride of her\nhospitality, anxiously watched the door or stealthily poked the fire.  I\nused to call it the music-room, for we had anticipated Bayreuth.  The\nvery gates of the kingdom of light seemed to open and the horizon of\nthought to flash with the beauty of a sunrise at sea.\n\nIn the consideration of ways and means, the sittings of our little board,\nwe were always conscious of the creak of Mrs. Saltram’s shoes.  She\nhovered, she interrupted, she almost presided, the state of affairs being\nmostly such as to supply her with every incentive for enquiring what was\nto be done next.  It was the pressing pursuit of this knowledge that, in\nconcatenations of omnibuses and usually in very wet weather, led her so\noften to my door.  She thought us spiritless creatures with editors and\npublishers; but she carried matters to no great effect when she\npersonally pushed into back-shops.  She wanted all moneys to be paid to\nherself: they were otherwise liable to such strange adventures.  They\ntrickled away into the desert—they were mainly at best, alas, a slender\nstream.  The editors and the publishers were the last people to take this\nremarkable thinker at the valuation that has now pretty well come to be\nestablished.  The former were half-distraught between the desire to “cut”\nhim and the difficulty of finding a crevice for their shears; and when a\nvolume on this or that portentous subject was proposed to the latter they\nsuggested alternative titles which, as reported to our friend, brought\ninto his face the noble blank melancholy that sometimes made it handsome.\nThe title of an unwritten book didn’t after all much matter, but some\nmasterpiece of Saltram’s may have died in his bosom of the shudder with\nwhich it was then convulsed.  The ideal solution, failing the fee at Kent\nMulville’s door, would have been some system of subscription to projected\ntreatises with their non-appearance provided for—provided for, I mean, by\nthe indulgence of subscribers.  The author’s real misfortune was that\nsubscribers were so wretchedly literal.  When they tastelessly enquired\nwhy publication hadn’t ensued I was tempted to ask who in the world had\never been so published.  Nature herself had brought him out in voluminous\nform, and the money was simply a deposit on borrowing the work.\n\n\n\n\nV\n\n\nI WAS doubtless often a nuisance to my friends in those years; but there\nwere sacrifices I declined to make, and I never passed the hat to George\nGravener.  I never forgot our little discussion in Ebury Street, and I\nthink it stuck in my throat to have to treat him to the avowal I had\nfound so easy to Mss Anvoy.  It had cost me nothing to confide to this\ncharming girl, but it would have cost me much to confide to the friend of\nmy youth, that the character of the “real gentleman” wasn’t an attribute\nof the man I took such pains for.  Was this because I had already\ngeneralised to the point of perceiving that women are really the\nunfastidious sex?  I knew at any rate that Gravener, already quite in\nview but still hungry and frugal, had naturally enough more ambition than\ncharity.  He had sharp aims for stray sovereigns, being in view most from\nthe tall steeple of Clockborough.  His immediate ambition was to occupy à\nlui seul the field of vision of that smokily-seeing city, and all his\nmovements and postures were calculated for the favouring angle.  The\nmovement of the hand as to the pocket had thus to alternate gracefully\nwith the posture of the hand on the heart.  He talked to Clockborough in\nshort only less beguilingly than Frank Saltram talked to his electors;\nwith the difference to our credit, however, that we had already voted and\nthat our candidate had no antagonist but himself.  He had more than once\nbeen at Wimbledon—it was Mrs. Mulville’s work not mine—and by the time\nthe claret was served had seen the god descend.  He took more pains to\nswing his censer than I had expected, but on our way back to town he\nforestalled any little triumph I might have been so artless as to express\nby the observation that such a man was—a hundred times!—a man to use and\nnever a man to be used by.  I remember that this neat remark humiliated\nme almost as much as if virtually, in the fever of broken slumbers, I\nhadn’t often made it myself.  The difference was that on Gravener’s part\na force attached to it that could never attach to it on mine.  He was\nable to use people—he had the machinery; and the irony of Saltram’s being\nmade showy at Clockborough came out to me when he said, as if he had no\nmemory of our original talk and the idea were quite fresh to him: “I hate\nhis type, you know, but I’ll be hanged if I don’t put some of those\nthings in.  I can find a place for them: we might even find a place for\nthe fellow himself.”  I myself should have had some fear—not, I need\nscarcely say, for the “things” themselves, but for some other things very\nnear them; in fine for the rest of my eloquence.\n\nLater on I could see that the oracle of Wimbledon was not in this case so\nappropriate as he would have been had the polities of the gods only\ncoincided more exactly with those of the party.  There was a distinct\nmoment when, without saying anything more definite to me, Gravener\nentertained the idea of annexing Mr. Saltram.  Such a project was\ndelusive, for the discovery of analogies between his body of doctrine and\nthat pressed from headquarters upon Clockborough—the bottling, in a word,\nof the air of those lungs for convenient public uncorking in\ncorn-exchanges—was an experiment for which no one had the leisure.  The\nonly thing would have been to carry him massively about, paid, caged,\nclipped; to turn him on for a particular occasion in a particular\nchannel.  Frank Saltram’s channel, however, was essentially not\ncalculable, and there was no knowing what disastrous floods might have\nensued.  For what there would have been to do The Empire, the great\nnewspaper, was there to look to; but it was no new misfortune that there\nwere delicate situations in which The Empire broke down.  In fine there\nwas an instinctive apprehension that a clever young journalist\ncommissioned to report on Mr. Saltram might never come back from the\nerrand.  No one knew better than George Gravener that that was a time\nwhen prompt returns counted double.  If he therefore found our friend an\nexasperating waste of orthodoxy it was because of his being, as he said,\npoor Gravener, up in the clouds, not because he was down in the dust.\nThe man would have been, just as he was, a real enough gentleman if he\ncould have helped to put in a real gentleman.  Gravener’s great objection\nto the actual member was that he was not one.\n\nLady Coxon had a fine old house, a house with “grounds,” at Clockborough,\nwhich she had let; but after she returned from abroad I learned from Mrs.\nSaltram that the lease had fallen in and that she had gone down to resume\npossession.  I could see the faded red livery, the big square shoulders,\nthe high-walled garden of this decent abode.  As the rumble of\ndissolution grew louder the suitor would have pressed his suit, and I\nfound myself hoping the politics of the late Mayor’s widow wouldn’t be\nsuch as to admonish her to ask him to dinner; perhaps indeed I went so\nfar as to pray, they would naturally form a bar to any contact.  I tried\nto focus the many-buttoned page, in the daily airing, as he perhaps even\npushed the Bath-chair over somebody’s toes.  I was destined to hear, none\nthe less, through Mrs. Saltram—who, I afterwards learned, was in\ncorrespondence with Lady Coxon’s housekeeper—that Gravener was known to\nhave spoken of the habitation I had in my eye as the pleasantest thing at\nClockborough.  On his part, I was sure, this was the voice not of envy\nbut of experience.  The vivid scene was now peopled, and I could see him\nin the old-time garden with Miss Anvoy, who would be certain, and very\njustly, to think him good-looking.  It would be too much to describe\nmyself as troubled by this play of surmise; but I occur to remember the\nrelief, singular enough, of feeling it suddenly brushed away by an\nannoyance really much greater; an annoyance the result of its happening\nto come over me about that time with a rush that I was simply ashamed of\nFrank Saltram.  There were limits after all, and my mark at last had been\nreached.\n\nI had had my disgusts, if I may allow myself to-day such an expression;\nbut this was a supreme revolt.  Certain things cleared up in my mind,\ncertain values stood out.  It was all very well to have an unfortunate\ntemperament; there was nothing so unfortunate as to have, for practical\npurposes, nothing else.  I avoided George Gravener at this moment and\nreflected that at such a time I should do so most effectually by leaving\nEngland.  I wanted to forget Frank Saltram—that was all.  I didn’t want\nto do anything in the world to him but that.  Indignation had withered on\nthe stalk, and I felt that one could pity him as much as one ought only\nby never thinking of him again.  It wasn’t for anything he had done to\nme; it was for what he had done to the Mulvilles.  Adelaide cried about\nit for a week, and her husband, profiting by the example so signally\ngiven him of the fatal effect of a want of character, left the letter,\nthe drop too much, unanswered.  The letter, an incredible one, addressed\nby Saltram to Wimbledon during a stay with the Pudneys at Ramsgate, was\nthe central feature of the incident, which, however, had many features,\neach more painful than whichever other we compared it with.  The Pudneys\nhad behaved shockingly, but that was no excuse.  Base ingratitude, gross\nindecency—one had one’s choice only of such formulas as that the more\nthey fitted the less they gave one rest.  These are dead aches now, and I\nam under no obligation, thank heaven, to be definite about the business.\nThere are things which if I had had to tell them—well, would have stopped\nme off here altogether.\n\nI went abroad for the general election, and if I don’t know how much, on\nthe Continent, I forgot, I at least know how much I missed, him.  At a\ndistance, in a foreign land, ignoring, abjuring, unlearning him, I\ndiscovered what he had done for me.  I owed him, oh unmistakeably,\ncertain noble conceptions; I had lighted my little taper at his smoky\nlamp, and lo it continued to twinkle.  But the light it gave me just\nshowed me how much more I wanted.  I was pursued of course by letters\nfrom Mrs. Saltram which I didn’t scruple not to read, though quite aware\nher embarrassments couldn’t but be now of the gravest.  I sacrificed to\npropriety by simply putting them away, and this is how, one day as my\nabsence drew to an end, my eye, while I rummaged in my desk for another\npaper, was caught by a name on a leaf that had detached itself from the\npacket.  The allusion was to Miss Anvoy, who, it appeared, was engaged to\nbe married to Mr. George Gravener; and the news was two months old.  A\ndirect question of Mrs. Saltram’s had thus remained unanswered—she had\nenquired of me in a postscript what sort of man this aspirant to such a\nhand might be.  The great other fact about him just then was that he had\nbeen triumphantly returned for Clockborough in the interest of the party\nthat had swept the country—so that I might easily have referred Mrs.\nSaltram to the journals of the day.  Yet when I at last wrote her that I\nwas coming home and would discharge my accumulated burden by seeing her,\nI but remarked in regard to her question that she must really put it to\nMiss Anvoy.\n\n\n\n\nVI\n\n\nI HAD almost avoided the general election, but some of its consequences,\non my return, had smartly to be faced.  The season, in London, began to\nbreathe again and to flap its folded wings.  Confidence, under the new\nMinistry, was understood to be reviving, and one of the symptoms, in a\nsocial body, was a recovery of appetite.  People once more fed together,\nand it happened that, one Saturday night, at somebody’s house, I fed with\nGeorge Gravener.  When the ladies left the room I moved up to where he\nsat and begged to congratulate him.  “On my election?” he asked after a\nmoment; so that I could feign, jocosely, not to have heard of that\ntriumph and to be alluding to the rumour of a victory still more\npersonal.  I dare say I coloured however, for his political success had\nmomentarily passed out of my mind.  What was present to it was that he\nwas to marry that beautiful girl; and yet his question made me conscious\nof some discomposure—I hadn’t intended to put this before everything.  He\nhimself indeed ought gracefully to have done so, and I remember thinking\nthe whole man was in this assumption that in expressing my sense of what\nhe had won I had fixed my thoughts on his “seat.”  We straightened the\nmatter out, and he was so much lighter in hand than I had lately seen him\nthat his spirits might well have been fed from a twofold source.  He was\nso good as to say that he hoped I should soon make the acquaintance of\nMiss Anvoy, who, with her aunt, was presently coming up to town.  Lady\nCoxon, in the country, had been seriously unwell, and this had delayed\ntheir arrival.  I told him I had heard the marriage would be a splendid\none; on which, brightened and humanised by his luck, he laughed and said\n“Do you mean for her?”  When I had again explained what I meant he went\non: “Oh she’s an American, but you’d scarcely know it; unless, perhaps,”\nhe added, “by her being used to more money than most girls in England,\neven the daughters of rich men.  That wouldn’t in the least do for a\nfellow like me, you know, if it wasn’t for the great liberality of her\nfather.  He really has been most kind, and everything’s quite\nsatisfactory.”  He added that his eldest brother had taken a tremendous\nfancy to her and that during a recent visit at Coldfield she had nearly\nwon over Lady Maddock.  I gathered from something he dropped later on\nthat the free-handed gentleman beyond the seas had not made a settlement,\nbut had given a handsome present and was apparently to be looked to,\nacross the water, for other favours.  People are simplified alike by\ngreat contentments and great yearnings, and, whether or no it was\nGravener’s directness that begot my own, I seem to recall that in some\nturn taken by our talk he almost imposed it on me as an act of decorum to\nask if Miss Anvoy had also by chance expectations from her aunt.  My\nenquiry drew out that Lady Coxon, who was the oddest of women, would have\nin any contingency to act under her late husband’s will, which was odder\nstill, saddling her with a mass of queer obligations complicated with\nqueer loopholes.  There were several dreary people, Coxon cousins, old\nmaids, to whom she would have more or less to minister.  Gravener\nlaughed, without saying no, when I suggested that the young lady might\ncome in through a loophole; then suddenly, as if he suspected my turning\na lantern on him, he declared quite dryly: “That’s all rot—one’s moved by\nother springs!”\n\nA fortnight later, at Lady Coxon’s own house, I understood well enough\nthe springs one was moved by.  Gravener had spoken of me there as an old\nfriend, and I received a gracious invitation to dine.  The Knight’s widow\nwas again indisposed—she had succumbed at the eleventh hour; so that I\nfound Miss Anvoy bravely playing hostess without even Gravener’s help,\nsince, to make matters worse, he had just sent up word that the House,\nthe insatiable House, with which he supposed he had contracted for easier\nterms, positively declined to release him.  I was struck with the\ncourage, the grace and gaiety of the young lady left thus to handle the\nfauna and flora of the Regent’s Park.  I did what I could to help her to\nclassify them, after I had recovered from the confusion of seeing her\nslightly disconcerted at perceiving in the guest introduced by her\nintended the gentleman with whom she had had that talk about Frank\nSaltram.  I had at this moment my first glimpse of the fact that she was\na person who could carry a responsibility; but I leave the reader to\njudge of my sense of the aggravation, for either of us, of such a burden,\nwhen I heard the servant announce Mrs. Saltram.  From what immediately\npassed between the two ladies I gathered that the latter had been sent\nfor post-haste to fill the gap created by the absence of the mistress of\nthe house.  “Good!” I remember crying, “she’ll be put by me;” and my\napprehension was promptly justified.  Mrs. Saltram taken in to dinner,\nand taken in as a consequence of an appeal to her amiability, was Mrs.\nSaltram with a vengeance.  I asked myself what Miss Anvoy meant by doing\nsuch things, but the only answer I arrived at was that Gravener was\nverily fortunate.  She hadn’t happened to tell him of her visit to Upper\nBaker Street, but she’d certainly tell him to-morrow; not indeed that\nthis would make him like any better her having had the innocence to\ninvite such a person as Mrs. Saltram on such an occasion.  It could only\nstrike me that I had never seen a young woman put such ignorance into her\ncleverness, such freedom into her modesty; this, I think, was when, after\ndinner, she said to me frankly, with almost jubilant mirth: “Oh you don’t\nadmire Mrs. Saltram?”  Why should I?  This was truly a young person\nwithout guile.  I had briefly to consider before I could reply that my\nobjection to the lady named was the objection often uttered about people\nmet at the social board—I knew all her stories.  Then as Miss Anvoy\nremained momentarily vague I added: “Those about her husband.”\n\n“Oh yes, but there are some new ones.”\n\n“None for me.  Ah novelty would be pleasant!”\n\n“Doesn’t it appear that of late he has been particularly horrid?”\n\n“His fluctuations don’t matter”, I returned, “for at night all cats are\ngrey.  You saw the shade of this one the night we waited for him\ntogether.  What will you have?  He has no dignity.”\n\nMiss Anvoy, who had been introducing with her American distinctness,\nlooked encouragingly round at some of the combinations she had risked.\n“It’s too bad I can’t see him.”\n\n“You mean Gravener won’t let you?”\n\n“I haven’t asked him.  He lets me do everything.”\n\n“But you know he knows him and wonders what some of us see in him.”\n\n“We haven’t happened to talk of him,” the girl said.\n\n“Get him to take you some day out to see the Mulvilles.”\n\n“I thought Mr. Saltram had thrown the Mulvilles over.”\n\n“Utterly.  But that won’t prevent his being planted there again, to bloom\nlike a rose, within a month or two.”\n\nMiss Anvoy thought a moment.  Then, “I should like to see them,” she said\nwith her fostering smile.\n\n“They’re tremendously worth it.  You mustn’t miss them.”\n\n“I’ll make George take me,” she went on as Mrs. Saltram came up to\ninterrupt us.  She sniffed at this unfortunate as kindly as she had\nsmiled at me and, addressing the question to her, continued: “But the\nchance of a lecture—one of the wonderful lectures?  Isn’t there another\ncourse announced?”\n\n“Another?  There are about thirty!” I exclaimed, turning away and feeling\nMrs. Saltram’s little eyes in my back.  A few days after this I heard\nthat Gravener’s marriage was near at hand—was settled for Whitsuntide;\nbut as no invitation had reached me I had my doubts, and there presently\ncame to me in fact the report of a postponement.  Something was the\nmatter; what was the matter was supposed to be that Lady Coxon was now\ncritically ill.  I had called on her after my dinner in the Regent’s\nPark, but I had neither seen her nor seen Miss Anvoy.  I forget to-day\nthe exact order in which, at this period, sundry incidents occurred and\nthe particular stage at which it suddenly struck me, making me catch my\nbreath a little, that the progression, the acceleration, was for all the\nworld that of fine drama.  This was probably rather late in the day, and\nthe exact order doesn’t signify.  What had already occurred was some\naccident determining a more patient wait.  George Gravener, whom I met\nagain, in fact told me as much, but without signs of perturbation.  Lady\nCoxon had to be constantly attended to, and there were other good reasons\nas well.  Lady Coxon had to be so constantly attended to that on the\noccasion of a second attempt in the Regent’s Park I equally failed to\nobtain a sight of her niece.  I judged it discreet in all the conditions\nnot to make a third; but this didn’t matter, for it was through Adelaide\nMulville that the side-wind of the comedy, though I was at first\nunwitting, began to reach me.  I went to Wimbledon at times because\nSaltram was there, and I went at others because he wasn’t.  The Pudneys,\nwho had taken him to Birmingham, had already got rid of him, and we had a\nhorrible consciousness of his wandering roofless, in dishonour, about the\nsmoky Midlands, almost as the injured Lear wandered on the storm-lashed\nheath.  His room, upstairs, had been lately done up (I could hear the\ncrackle of the new chintz) and the difference only made his smirches and\nbruises, his splendid tainted genius, the more tragic.  If he wasn’t\nbarefoot in the mire he was sure to be unconventionally shod.  These were\nthe things Adelaide and I, who were old enough friends to stare at each\nother in silence, talked about when we didn’t speak.  When we spoke it\nwas only about the brilliant girl George Gravener was to marry and whom\nhe had brought out the other Sunday.  I could see that this presentation\nhad been happy, for Mrs. Mulville commemorated it after her sole fashion\nof showing confidence in a new relation.  “She likes me—she likes me”:\nher native humility exulted in that measure of success.  We all knew for\nourselves how she liked those who liked her, and as regards Ruth Anvoy\nshe was more easily won over than Lady Maddock.\n\n\n\n\nVII\n\n\nONE of the consequences, for the Mulvilles, of the sacrifices they made\nfor Frank Saltram was that they had to give up their carriage.  Adelaide\ndrove gently into London in a one-horse greenish thing, an early\nVictorian landau, hired, near at hand, imaginatively, from a broken-down\njobmaster whose wife was in consumption—a vehicle that made people turn\nround all the more when her pensioner sat beside her in a soft white hat\nand a shawl, one of the dear woman’s own.  This was his position and I\ndare say his costume when on an afternoon in July she went to return Miss\nAnvoy’s visit.  The wheel of fate had now revolved, and amid silences\ndeep and exhaustive, compunctions and condonations alike unutterable,\nSaltram was reinstated.  Was it in pride or in penance that Mrs. Mulville\nhad begun immediately to drive him about?  If he was ashamed of his\ningratitude she might have been ashamed of her forgiveness; but she was\nincorrigibly capable of liking him to be conspicuous in the landau while\nshe was in shops or with her acquaintance.  However, if he was in the\npillory for twenty minutes in the Regent’s Park—I mean at Lady Coxon’s\ndoor while his companion paid her call—it wasn’t to the further\nhumiliation of any one concerned that she presently came out for him in\nperson, not even to show either of them what a fool she was that she drew\nhim in to be introduced to the bright young American.  Her account of the\nintroduction I had in its order, but before that, very late in the\nseason, under Gravener’s auspices, I met Miss Anvoy at tea at the House\nof Commons.  The member for Clockborough had gathered a group of pretty\nladies, and the Mulvilles were not of the party.  On the great terrace,\nas I strolled off with her a little, the guest of honour immediately\nexclaimed to me: “I’ve seen him, you know—I’ve seen him!”  She told me\nabout Saltram’s call.\n\n“And how did you find him?”\n\n“Oh so strange!”\n\n“You didn’t like him?”\n\n“I can’t tell till I see him again.”\n\n“You want to do that?”\n\nShe had a pause.  “Immensely.”\n\nWe went no further; I fancied she had become aware Gravener was looking\nat us.  She turned back toward the knot of the others, and I said:\n“Dislike him as much as you will—I see you’re bitten.”\n\n“Bitten?”  I thought she coloured a little.\n\n“Oh it doesn’t matter!” I laughed; “one doesn’t die of it.”\n\n“I hope I shan’t die of anything before I’ve seen more of Mrs. Mulville.”\nI rejoiced with her over plain Adelaide, whom she pronounced the\nloveliest woman she had met in England; but before we separated I\nremarked to her that it was an act of mere humanity to warn her that if\nshe should see more of Frank Saltram—which would be likely to follow on\nany increase of acquaintance with Mrs. Mulville—she might find herself\nflattening her nose against the clear hard pane of an eternal\nquestion—that of the relative, that of the opposed, importances of virtue\nand brains.  She replied that this was surely a subject on which one took\neverything for granted; whereupon I admitted that I had perhaps expressed\nmyself ill.  What I referred to was what I had referred to the night we\nmet in Upper Baker Street—the relative importance (relative to virtue) of\nother gifts.  She asked me if I called virtue a gift—a thing handed to us\nin a parcel on our first birthday; and I declared that this very enquiry\nproved to me the problem had already caught her by the skirt.  She would\nhave help however, the same help I myself had once had, in resisting its\ntendency to make one cross.\n\n“What help do you mean?”\n\n“That of the member for Clockborough.”\n\nShe stared, smiled, then returned: “Why my idea has been to help him!”\n\nShe had helped him—I had his own word for it that at Clockborough her\nbedevilment of the voters had really put him in.  She would do so\ndoubtless again and again, though I heard the very next month that this\nfine faculty had undergone a temporary eclipse.  News of the catastrophe\nfirst came to me from Mrs. Saltram, and it was afterwards confirmed at\nWimbledon: poor Miss Anvoy was in trouble—great disasters in America had\nsuddenly summoned her home.  Her father, in New York, had suffered\nreverses, lost so much money that it was really vexatious as showing how\nmuch he had had.  It was Adelaide who told me she had gone off alone at\nless than a week’s notice.\n\n“Alone?  Gravener has permitted that?”\n\n“What will you have?  The House of Commons!”\n\nI’m afraid I cursed the House of Commons: I was so much interested.  Of\ncourse he’d follow her as soon as he was free to make her his wife; only\nshe mightn’t now be able to bring him anything like the marriage-portion\nof which he had begun by having the virtual promise.  Mrs. Mulville let\nme know what was already said: she was charming, this American girl, but\nreally these American fathers—!  What was a man to do?  Mr. Saltram,\naccording to Mrs. Mulville, was of opinion that a man was never to suffer\nhis relation to money to become a spiritual relation—he was to keep it\nexclusively material.  “Moi pas comprendre!” I commented on this; in\nrejoinder to which Adelaide, with her beautiful sympathy, explained that\nshe supposed he simply meant that the thing was to use it, don’t you\nknow? but not to think too much about it.  “To take it, but not to thank\nyou for it?” I still more profanely enquired.  For a quarter of an hour\nafterwards she wouldn’t look at me, but this didn’t prevent my asking her\nwhat had been the result, that afternoon—in the Regent’s Park, of her\ntaking our friend to see Miss Anvoy.\n\n“Oh so charming!” she answered, brightening.  “He said he recognised in\nher a nature he could absolutely trust.”\n\n“Yes, but I’m speaking of the effect on herself.”\n\nMrs. Mulville had to remount the stream.  “It was everything one could\nwish.”\n\nSomething in her tone made me laugh.  “Do you mean she gave him—a dole?”\n\n“Well, since you ask me!”\n\n“Right there on the spot?”\n\nAgain poor Adelaide faltered.  “It was to me of course she gave it.”\n\nI stared; somehow I couldn’t see the scene.  “Do you mean a sum of\nmoney?”\n\n“It was very handsome.”  Now at last she met my eyes, though I could see\nit was with an effort.  “Thirty pounds.”\n\n“Straight out of her pocket?”\n\n“Out of the drawer of a table at which she had been writing.  She just\nslipped the folded notes into my hand.  He wasn’t looking; it was while\nhe was going back to the carriage.”  “Oh,” said Adelaide reassuringly, “I\ntake care of it for him!”  The dear practical soul thought my agitation,\nfor I confess I was agitated, referred to the employment of the money.\nHer disclosure made me for a moment muse violently, and I dare say that\nduring that moment I wondered if anything else in the world makes people\nso gross as unselfishness.  I uttered, I suppose, some vague synthetic\ncry, for she went on as if she had had a glimpse of my inward amaze at\nsuch passages.  “I assure you, my dear friend, he was in one of his happy\nhours.”\n\nBut I wasn’t thinking of that.  “Truly indeed these Americans!” I said.\n“With her father in the very act, as it were, of swindling her\nbetrothed!”\n\nMrs. Mulville stared.  “Oh I suppose Mr. Anvoy has scarcely gone\nbankrupt—or whatever he has done—on purpose.  Very likely they won’t be\nable to keep it up, but there it was, and it was a very beautiful\nimpulse.”\n\n“You say Saltram was very fine?”\n\n“Beyond everything.  He surprised even me.”\n\n“And I know what you’ve enjoyed.”  After a moment I added: “Had he\nperadventure caught a glimpse of the money in the table-drawer?”\n\nAt this my companion honestly flushed.  “How can you be so cruel when you\nknow how little he calculates?”\n\n“Forgive me, I do know it.  But you tell me things that act on my nerves.\nI’m sure he hadn’t caught a glimpse of anything but some splendid idea.”\n\nMrs. Mulville brightly concurred.  “And perhaps even of her beautiful\nlistening face.”\n\n“Perhaps even!  And what was it all about?”\n\n“His talk?  It was apropos of her engagement, which I had told him about:\nthe idea of marriage, the philosophy, the poetry, the sublimity of it.”\nIt was impossible wholly to restrain one’s mirth at this, and some rude\nripple that I emitted again caused my companion to admonish me.  “It\nsounds a little stale, but you know his freshness.”\n\n“Of illustration?  Indeed I do!”\n\n“And how he has always been right on that great question.”\n\n“On what great question, dear lady, hasn’t he been right?”\n\n“Of what other great men can you equally say it?—and that he has never,\nbut never, had a deflexion?” Mrs. Mulville exultantly demanded.\n\nI tried to think of some other great man, but I had to give it up.\n“Didn’t Miss Anvoy express her satisfaction in any less diffident way\nthan by her charming present?” I was reduced to asking instead.\n\n“Oh yes, she overflowed to me on the steps while he was getting into the\ncarriage.”  These words somehow brushed up a picture of Saltram’s big\nshawled back as he hoisted himself into the green landau.  “She said she\nwasn’t disappointed,” Adelaide pursued.\n\nI turned it over.  “Did he wear his shawl?”\n\n“His shawl?”  She hadn’t even noticed.\n\n“I mean yours.”\n\n“He looked very nice, and you know he’s really clean.  Miss Anvoy used\nsuch a remarkable expression—she said his mind’s like a crystal!”\n\nI pricked up my ears.  “A crystal?”\n\n“Suspended in the moral world—swinging and shining and flashing there.\nShe’s monstrously clever, you know.”\n\nI thought again.  “Monstrously!”\n\n\n\n\nVIII\n\n\nGEORGE GRAVENER didn’t follow her, for late in September, after the House\nhad risen, I met him in a railway-carriage.  He was coming up from\nScotland and I had just quitted some relations who lived near Durham.\nThe current of travel back to London wasn’t yet strong; at any rate on\nentering the compartment I found he had had it for some time to himself.\nWe fared in company, and though he had a blue-book in his lap and the\nopen jaws of his bag threatened me with the white teeth of confused\npapers, we inevitably, we even at last sociably conversed.  I saw things\nweren’t well with him, but I asked no question till something dropped by\nhimself made, as it had made on another occasion, an absence of curiosity\ninvidious.  He mentioned that he was worried about his good old friend\nLady Coxon, who, with her niece likely to be detained some time in\nAmerica, lay seriously ill at Clockborough, much on his mind and on his\nhands.\n\n“Ah Miss Anvoy’s in America?”\n\n“Her father has got into horrid straits—has lost no end of money.”\n\nI waited, after expressing due concern, but I eventually said: “I hope\nthat raises no objection to your marriage.”\n\n“None whatever; moreover it’s my trade to meet objections.  But it may\ncreate tiresome delays, of which there have been too many, from various\ncauses, already.  Lady Coxon got very bad, then she got much better.\nThen Mr. Anvoy suddenly began to totter, and now he seems quite on his\nback.  I’m afraid he’s really in for some big reverse.  Lady Coxon’s\nworse again, awfully upset by the news from America, and she sends me\nword that she _must_ have Ruth.  How can I supply her with Ruth?  I\nhaven’t got Ruth myself!”\n\n“Surely you haven’t lost her?” I returned.\n\n“She’s everything to her wretched father.  She writes me every\npost—telling me to smooth her aunt’s pillow.  I’ve other things to\nsmooth; but the old lady, save for her servants, is really alone.  She\nwon’t receive her Coxon relations—she’s angry at so much of her money\ngoing to them.  Besides, she’s hopelessly mad,” said Gravener very\nfrankly.\n\nI don’t remember whether it was this, or what it was, that made me ask if\nshe hadn’t such an appreciation of Mrs. Saltram as might render that\nactive person of some use.\n\nHe gave me a cold glance, wanting to know what had put Mrs. Saltram into\nmy head, and I replied that she was unfortunately never out of it.  I\nhappened to remember the wonderful accounts she had given me of the\nkindness Lady Coxon had shown her.  Gravener declared this to be false;\nLady Coxon, who didn’t care for her, hadn’t seen her three times.  The\nonly foundation for it was that Miss Anvoy, who used, poor girl, to chuck\nmoney about in a manner she must now regret, had for an hour seen in the\nmiserable woman—you could never know what she’d see in people—an\ninteresting pretext for the liberality with which her nature overflowed.\nBut even Miss Anvoy was now quite tired of her.  Gravener told me more\nabout the crash in New York and the annoyance it had been to him, and we\nalso glanced here and there in other directions; but by the time we got\nto Doncaster the principal thing he had let me see was that he was\nkeeping something back.  We stopped at that station, and, at the\ncarriage-door, some one made a movement to get in.  Gravener uttered a\nsound of impatience, and I felt sure that but for this I should have had\nthe secret.  Then the intruder, for some reason, spared us his company;\nwe started afresh, and my hope of a disclosure returned.  My companion\nheld his tongue, however, and I pretended to go to sleep; in fact I\nreally dozed for discouragement.  When I reopened my eyes he was looking\nat me with an injured air.  He tossed away with some vivacity the remnant\nof a cigarette and then said: “If you’re not too sleepy I want to put you\na case.”  I answered that I’d make every effort to attend, and welcomed\nthe note of interest when he went on: “As I told you a while ago, Lady\nCoxon, poor dear, is demented.”  His tone had much behind it—was full of\npromise.  I asked if her ladyship’s misfortune were a trait of her malady\nor only of her character, and he pronounced it a product of both.  The\ncase he wanted to put to me was a matter on which it concerned him to\nhave the impression—the judgement, he might also say—of another person.\n“I mean of the average intelligent man, but you see I take what I can\nget.” There would be the technical, the strictly legal view; then there\nwould be the way the question would strike a man of the world.  He had\nlighted another cigarette while he talked, and I saw he was glad to have\nit to handle when he brought out at last, with a laugh slightly\nartificial: “In fact it’s a subject on which Miss Anvoy and I are pulling\ndifferent ways.”\n\n“And you want me to decide between you?  I decide in advance for Miss\nAnvoy.”\n\n“In advance—that’s quite right.  That’s how I decided when I proposed to\nher.  But my story will interest you only so far as your mind isn’t made\nup.”  Gravener puffed his cigarette a minute and then continued: “Are you\nfamiliar with the idea of the Endowment of Research?”\n\n“Of Research?” I was at sea a moment.\n\n“I give you Lady Coxon’s phrase.  She has it on the brain.”\n\n“She wishes to endow—?”\n\n“Some earnest and ‘loyal’ seeker,” Gravener said.  “It was a sketchy\ndesign of her late husband’s, and he handed it on to her; setting apart\nin his will a sum of money of which she was to enjoy the interest for\nlife, but of which, should she eventually see her opportunity—the matter\nwas left largely to her discretion—she would best honour his memory by\ndetermining the exemplary public use.  This sum of money, no less than\nthirteen thousand pounds, was to be called The Coxon Fund; and poor Sir\nGregory evidently proposed to himself that The Coxon Fund should cover\nhis name with glory—be universally desired and admired.  He left his wife\na full declaration of his views, so far at least as that term may be\napplied to views vitiated by a vagueness really infantine.  A little\nlearning’s a dangerous thing, and a good citizen who happens to have been\nan ass is worse for a community than bad sewerage.  He’s worst of all\nwhen he’s dead, because then he can’t be stopped.  However, such as they\nwere, the poor man’s aspirations are now in his wife’s bosom, or\nfermenting rather in her foolish brain: it lies with her to carry them\nout.  But of course she must first catch her hare.”\n\n“Her earnest loyal seeker?”\n\n“The flower that blushes unseen for want of such a pecuniary independence\nas may aid the light that’s in it to shine upon the human race.  The\nindividual, in a word, who, having the rest of the machinery, the\nspiritual, the intellectual, is most hampered in his search.”\n\n“His search for what?”\n\n“For Moral Truth.  That’s what Sir Gregory calls it.”\n\nI burst out laughing.  “Delightful munificent Sir Gregory!  It’s a\ncharming idea.”\n\n“So Miss Anvoy thinks.”\n\n“Has she a candidate for the Fund?”\n\n“Not that I know of—and she’s perfectly reasonable about it.  But Lady\nCoxon has put the matter before her, and we’ve naturally had a lot of\ntalk.”\n\n“Talk that, as you’ve so interestingly intimated, has landed you in a\ndisagreement.”\n\n“She considers there’s something in it,” Gravener said.\n\n“And you consider there’s nothing?”\n\n“It seems to me a piece of solemn twaddle—which can’t fail to be attended\nwith consequences certainly grotesque and possibly immoral.  To begin\nwith, fancy constituting an endowment without establishing a tribunal—a\nbench of competent people, of judges.”\n\n“The sole tribunal is Lady Coxon?”\n\n“And any one she chooses to invite.”\n\n“But she has invited you,” I noted.\n\n“I’m not competent—I hate the thing.  Besides, she hasn’t,” my friend\nwent on.  “The real history of the matter, I take it, is that the\ninspiration was originally Lady Coxon’s own, that she infected him with\nit, and that the flattering option left her is simply his tribute to her\nbeautiful, her aboriginal enthusiasm.  She came to England forty years\nago, a thin transcendental Bostonian, and even her odd happy frumpy\nClockborough marriage never really materialised her.  She feels indeed\nthat she has become very British—as if that, as a process, as a ‘Werden,’\nas anything but an original sign of grace, were conceivable; but it’s\nprecisely what makes her cling to the notion of the ‘Fund’—cling to it as\nto a link with the ideal.”\n\n“How can she cling if she’s dying?”\n\n“Do you mean how can she act in the matter?” Gravener asked.  “That’s\nprecisely the question.  She can’t!  As she has never yet caught her\nhare, never spied out her lucky impostor—how should she, with the life\nshe has led?—her husband’s intention has come very near lapsing.  His\nidea, to do him justice, was that it _should_ lapse if exactly the right\nperson, the perfect mixture of genius and chill penury, should fail to\nturn up.  Ah the poor dear woman’s very particular—she says there must be\nno mistake.”\n\nI found all this quite thrilling—I took it in with avidity.  “And if she\ndies without doing anything, what becomes of the money?” I demanded.\n\n“It goes back to his family, if she hasn’t made some other disposition of\nit.”\n\n“She may do that then—she may divert it?”\n\n“Her hands are not tied.  She has a grand discretion.  The proof is that\nthree months ago she offered to make the proceeds over to her niece.”\n\n“For Miss Anvoy’s own use?”\n\n“For Miss Anvoy’s own use—on the occasion of her prospective marriage.\nShe was discouraged—the earnest seeker required so earnest a search.  She\nwas afraid of making a mistake; every one she could think of seemed\neither not earnest enough or not poor enough.  On the receipt of the\nfirst bad news about Mr. Anvoy’s affairs she proposed to Ruth to make the\nsacrifice for her.  As the situation in New York got worse she repeated\nher proposal.”\n\n“Which Miss Anvoy declined?”\n\n“Except as a formal trust.”\n\n“You mean except as committing herself legally to place the money?”\n\n“On the head of the deserving object, the great man frustrated,” said\nGravener.  “She only consents to act in the spirit of Sir Gregory’s\nscheme.”\n\n“And you blame her for that?” I asked with some intensity.\n\nMy tone couldn’t have been harsh, but he coloured a little and there was\na queer light in his eye.  “My dear fellow, if I ‘blamed’ the young lady\nI’m engaged to I shouldn’t immediately say it even to so old a friend as\nyou.”  I saw that some deep discomfort, some restless desire to be sided\nwith, reassuringly, approvingly mirrored, had been at the bottom of his\ndrifting so far, and I was genuinely touched by his confidence.  It was\ninconsistent with his habits; but being troubled about a woman was not,\nfor him, a habit: that itself was an inconsistency.  George Gravener\ncould stand straight enough before any other combination of forces.  It\namused me to think that the combination he had succumbed to had an\nAmerican accent, a transcendental aunt and an insolvent father; but all\nmy old loyalty to him mustered to meet this unexpected hint that I could\nhelp him.  I saw that I could from the insincere tone in which he\npursued: “I’ve criticised her of course, I’ve contended with her, and it\nhas been great fun.”  Yet it clearly couldn’t have been such great fun as\nto make it improper for me presently to ask if Miss Anvoy had nothing at\nall settled on herself.  To this he replied that she had only a trifle\nfrom her mother—a mere four hundred a year, which was exactly why it\nwould be convenient to him that she shouldn’t decline, in the face of\nthis total change in her prospects, an accession of income which would\ndistinctly help them to marry.  When I enquired if there were no other\nway in which so rich and so affectionate an aunt could cause the weight\nof her benevolence to be felt, he answered that Lady Coxon was\naffectionate indeed, but was scarcely to be called rich.  She could let\nher project of the Fund lapse for her niece’s benefit, but she couldn’t\ndo anything else.  She had been accustomed to regard her as tremendously\nprovided for, and she was up to her eyes in promises to anxious Coxons.\nShe was a woman of an inordinate conscience, and her conscience was now a\ndistress to her, hovering round her bed in irreconcilable forms of\nresentful husbands, portionless nieces and undiscoverable philosophers.\n\nWe were by this time getting into the whirr of fleeting platforms, the\nmultiplication of lights.  “I think you’ll find,” I said with a laugh,\n“that your predicament will disappear in the very fact that the\nphilosopher _is_ undiscoverable.”\n\nHe began to gather up his papers.  “Who can set a limit to the ingenuity\nof an extravagant woman?”\n\n“Yes, after all, who indeed?” I echoed as I recalled the extravagance\ncommemorated in Adelaide’s anecdote of Miss Anvoy and the thirty pounds.\n\n\n\n\nIX\n\n\nTHE thing I had been most sensible of in that talk with George Gravener\nwas the way Saltram’s name kept out of it.  It seemed to me at the time\nthat we were quite pointedly silent about him; but afterwards it appeared\nmore probable there had been on my companion’s part no conscious\navoidance.  Later on I was sure of this, and for the best of reasons—the\nsimple reason of my perceiving more completely that, for evil as well as\nfor good, he said nothing to Gravener’s imagination.  That honest man\ndidn’t fear him—he was too much disgusted with him.  No more did I,\ndoubtless, and for very much the same reason.  I treated my friend’s\nstory as an absolute confidence; but when before Christmas, by Mrs.\nSaltram, I was informed of Lady Coxon’s death without having had news of\nMiss Anvoy’s return, I found myself taking for granted we should hear no\nmore of these nuptials, in which, as obscurely unnatural, I now saw I had\nnever _too_ disconcertedly believed.  I began to ask myself how people\nwho suited each other so little could please each other so much.  The\ncharm was some material charm, some afffinity, exquisite doubtless, yet\nsuperficial some surrender to youth and beauty and passion, to force and\ngrace and fortune, happy accidents and easy contacts.  They might dote on\neach other’s persons, but how could they know each other’s souls?  How\ncould they have the same prejudices, how could they have the same\nhorizon?  Such questions, I confess, seemed quenched but not answered\nwhen, one day in February, going out to Wimbledon, I found our young lady\nin the house.  A passion that had brought her back across the wintry\nocean was as much of a passion as was needed.  No impulse equally strong\nindeed had drawn George Gravener to America; a circumstance on which,\nhowever, I reflected only long enough to remind myself that it was none\nof my business.  Ruth Anvoy was distinctly different, and I felt that the\ndifference was not simply that of her marks of mourning.  Mrs. Mulville\ntold me soon enough what it was: it was the difference between a handsome\ngirl with large expectations and a handsome girl with only four hundred a\nyear.  This explanation indeed didn’t wholly content me, not even when I\nlearned that her mourning had a double cause—learned that poor Mr. Anvoy,\ngiving way altogether, buried under the ruins of his fortune and leaving\nnext to nothing, had died a few weeks before.\n\n“So she has come out to marry George Gravener?” I commented.  “Wouldn’t\nit have been prettier of him to have saved her the trouble?”\n\n“Hasn’t the House just met?” Adelaide replied.  “And for Mr. Gravener the\nHouse—!”  Then she added: “I gather that her having come is exactly a\nsign that the marriage is a little shaky.  If it were quite all right a\nself-respecting girl like Ruth would have waited for him over there.”\n\nI noted that they were already Ruth and Adelaide, but what I said was:\n“Do you mean she’ll have had to return to _make_ it so?”\n\n“No, I mean that she must have come out for some reason independent of\nit.”  Adelaide could only surmise, however, as yet, and there was more,\nas we found, to be revealed.  Mrs. Mulville, on hearing of her arrival,\nhad brought the young lady out in the green landau for the Sunday.  The\nCoxons were in possession of the house in Regent’s Park, and Miss Anvoy\nwas in dreary lodgings.  George Gravener had been with her when Adelaide\ncalled, but had assented graciously enough to the little visit at\nWimbledon.  The carriage, with Mr. Saltram in it but not mentioned, had\nbeen sent off on some errand from which it was to return and pick the\nladies up.  Gravener had left them together, and at the end of an hour,\non the Saturday afternoon, the party of three had driven out to\nWimbledon.  This was the girl’s second glimpse of our great man, and I\nwas interested in asking Mrs. Mulville if the impression made by the\nfirst appeared to have been confirmed.  On her replying after\nconsideration, that of course with time and opportunity it couldn’t fail\nto be, but that she was disappointed, I was sufficiently struck with her\nuse of this last word to question her further.\n\n“Do you mean you’re disappointed because you judge Miss Anvoy to be?”\n\n“Yes; I hoped for a greater effect last evening.  We had two or three\npeople, but he scarcely opened his mouth.”\n\n“He’ll be all the better to-night,” I opined after a moment.  Then I\npursued: “What particular importance do you attach to the idea of her\nbeing impressed?”\n\nAdelaide turned her mild pale eyes on me as for rebuke of my levity.\n“Why the importance of her being as happy as _we_ are!”\n\nI’m afraid that at this my levity grew.  “Oh that’s a happiness almost\ntoo great to wish a person!”  I saw she hadn’t yet in her mind what I had\nin mine, and at any rate the visitor’s actual bliss was limited to a walk\nin the garden with Kent Mulville.  Later in the afternoon I also took\none, and I saw nothing of Miss Anvoy till dinner, at which we failed of\nthe company of Saltram, who had caused it to be reported that he was\nindisposed and lying down.  This made us, most of us—for there were other\nfriends present—convey to each other in silence some of the unutterable\nthings that in those years our eyes had inevitably acquired the art of\nexpressing.  If a fine little American enquirer hadn’t been there we\nwould have expressed them otherwise, and Adelaide would have pretended\nnot to hear.  I had seen her, before the very fact, abstract herself\nnobly; and I knew that more than once, to keep it from the servants,\nmanaging, dissimulating cleverly, she had helped her husband to carry him\nbodily to his room.  Just recently he had been so wise and so deep and so\nhigh that I had begun to get nervous—to wonder if by chance there were\nsomething behind it, if he were kept straight for instance by the\nknowledge that the hated Pudneys would have more to tell us if they\nchose.  He was lying low, but unfortunately it was common wisdom with us\nin this connexion that the biggest splashes took place in the quietest\npools.  We should have had a merry life indeed if all the splashes had\nsprinkled us as refreshingly as the waters we were even then to feel\nabout our ears.  Kent Mulville had been up to his room, but had come back\nwith a face that told as few tales as I had seen it succeed in telling on\nthe evening I waited in the lecture-room with Miss Anvoy.  I said to\nmyself that our friend had gone out, but it was a comfort that the\npresence of a comparative stranger deprived us of the dreary duty of\nsuggesting to each other, in respect of his errand, edifying\npossibilities in which we didn’t ourselves believe.  At ten o’clock he\ncame into the drawing-room with his waistcoat much awry but his eyes\nsending out great signals.  It was precisely with his entrance that I\nceased to be vividly conscious of him.  I saw that the crystal, as I had\ncalled it, had begun to swing, and I had need of my immediate attention\nfor Miss Anvoy.\n\nEven when I was told afterwards that he had, as we might have said\nto-day, broken the record, the manner in which that attention had been\nrewarded relieved me of a sense of loss.  I had of course a perfect\ngeneral consciousness that something great was going on: it was a little\nlike having been etherised to hear Herr Joachim play.  The old music was\nin the air; I felt the strong pulse of thought, the sink and swell, the\nflight, the poise, the plunge; but I knew something about one of the\nlisteners that nobody else knew, and Saltram’s monologue could reach me\nonly through that medium.  To this hour I’m of no use when, as a witness,\nI’m appealed to—for they still absurdly contend about it—as to whether or\nno on that historic night he was drunk; and my position is slightly\nridiculous, for I’ve never cared to tell them what it really was I was\ntaken up with.  What I got out of it is the only morsel of the total\nexperience that is quite my own.  The others were shared, but this is\nincommunicable.  I feel that now, I’m bound to say, even in thus roughly\nevoking the occasion, and it takes something from my pride of clearness.\nHowever, I shall perhaps be as clear as is absolutely needful if I remark\nthat our young lady was too much given up to her own intensity of\nobservation to be sensible of mine.  It was plainly not the question of\nher marriage that had brought her back.  I greatly enjoyed this discovery\nand was sure that had that question alone been involved she would have\nstirred no step.  In this case doubtless Gravener would, in spite of the\nHouse of Commons, have found means to rejoin her.  It afterwards made me\nuncomfortable for her that, alone in the lodging Mrs. Mulville had put\nbefore me as dreary, she should have in any degree the air of waiting for\nher fate; so that I was presently relieved at hearing of her having gone\nto stay at Coldfield.  If she was in England at all while the engagement\nstood the only proper place for her was under Lady Maddock’s wing.  Now\nthat she was unfortunate and relatively poor, perhaps her prospective\nsister-in-law would be wholly won over.\n\nThere would be much to say, if I had space, about the way her behaviour,\nas I caught gleams of it, ministered to the image that had taken birth in\nmy mind, to my private amusement, while that other night I listened to\nGeorge Gravener in the railway-carriage.  I watched her in the light of\nthis queer possibility—a formidable thing certainly to meet—and I was\naware that it coloured, extravagantly perhaps, my interpretation of her\nvery looks and tones.  At Wimbledon for instance it had appeared to me\nshe was literally afraid of Saltram, in dread of a coercion that she had\nbegun already to feel.  I had come up to town with her the next day and\nhad been convinced that, though deeply interested, she was immensely on\nher guard.  She would show as little as possible before she should be\nready to show everything.  What this final exhibition might be on the\npart of a girl perceptibly so able to think things out I found it great\nsport to forecast.  It would have been exciting to be approached by her,\nappealed to by her for advice; but I prayed to heaven I mightn’t find\nmyself in such a predicament.  If there was really a present rigour in\nthe situation of which Gravener had sketched for me the elements, she\nwould have to get out of her difficulty by herself.  It wasn’t I who had\nlaunched her and it wasn’t I who could help her.  I didn’t fail to ask\nmyself why, since I couldn’t help her, I should think so much about her.\nIt was in part my suspense that was responsible for this; I waited\nimpatiently to see whether she wouldn’t have told Mrs. Mulville a portion\nat least of what I had learned from Gravener.  But I saw Mrs. Mulville\nwas still reduced to wonder what she had come out again for if she hadn’t\ncome as a conciliatory bride.  That she had come in some other character\nwas the only thing that fitted all the appearances.  Having for family\nreasons to spend some time that spring in the west of England, I was in a\nmanner out of earshot of the great oceanic rumble—I mean of the\ncontinuous hum of Saltram’s thought—and my uneasiness tended to keep me\nquiet.  There was something I wanted so little to have to say that my\nprudence surmounted my curiosity.  I only wondered if Ruth Anvoy talked\nover the idea of The Coxon Fund with Lady Maddock, and also somewhat why\nI didn’t hear from Wimbledon.  I had a reproachful note about something\nor other from Mrs. Saltram, but it contained no mention of Lady Coxon’s\nniece, on whom her eyes had been much less fixed since the recent\nuntoward events.\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nPOOR Adelaide’s silence was fully explained later—practically explained\nwhen in June, returning to London, I was honoured by this admirable woman\nwith an early visit.  As soon as she arrived I guessed everything, and as\nsoon as she told me that darling Ruth had been in her house nearly a\nmonth I had my question ready.  “What in the name of maidenly modesty is\nshe staying in England for?”\n\n“Because she loves me so!” cried Adelaide gaily.  But she hadn’t come to\nsee me only to tell me Miss Anvoy loved her: that was quite sufficiently\nestablished, and what was much more to the point was that Mr. Gravener\nhad now raised an objection to it.  He had protested at least against her\nbeing at Wimbledon, where in the innocence of his heart he had originally\nbrought her himself; he called on her to put an end to their engagement\nin the only proper, the only happy manner.\n\n“And why in the world doesn’t she do do?” I asked.\n\nAdelaide had a pause.  “She says you know.”\n\nThen on my also hesitating she added: “A condition he makes.”\n\n“The Coxon Fund?” I panted.\n\n“He has mentioned to her his having told you about it.”\n\n“Ah but so little!  Do you mean she has accepted the trust?”\n\n“In the most splendid spirit—as a duty about which there can be no two\nopinions.”  To which my friend added: “Of course she’s thinking of Mr.\nSaltram.”\n\nI gave a quick cry at this, which, in its violence, made my visitor turn\npale.  “How very awful!”\n\n“Awful?”\n\n“Why, to have anything to do with such an idea one’s self.”\n\n“I’m sure _you_ needn’t!” and Mrs. Mulville tossed her head.\n\n“He isn’t good enough!” I went on; to which she opposed a sound almost as\ncontentious as my own had been.  This made me, with genuine immediate\nhorror, exclaim: “You haven’t influenced her, I hope!” and my emphasis\nbrought back the blood with a rush to poor Adelaide’s face.  She declared\nwhile she blushed—for I had frightened her again—that she had never\ninfluenced anybody and that the girl had only seen and heard and judged\nfor herself.  _He_ had influenced her, if I would, as he did every one\nwho had a soul: that word, as we knew, even expressed feebly the power of\nthe things he said to haunt the mind.  How could she, Adelaide, help it\nif Miss Anvoy’s mind was haunted?  I demanded with a groan what right a\npretty girl engaged to a rising M.P. had to _have_ a mind; but the only\nexplanation my bewildered friend could give me was that she was so\nclever.  She regarded Mr. Saltram naturally as a tremendous force for\ngood.  She was intelligent enough to understand him and generous enough\nto admire.\n\n“She’s many things enough, but is she, among them, rich enough?” I\ndemanded.  “Rich enough, I mean, to sacrifice such a lot of good money?”\n\n“That’s for herself to judge.  Besides, it’s not her own money; she\ndoesn’t in the least consider it so.”\n\n“And Gravener does, if not _his_ own; and that’s the whole difficulty?”\n\n“The difficulty that brought her back, yes: she had absolutely to see her\npoor aunt’s solicitor.  It’s clear that by Lady Coxon’s will she may have\nthe money, but it’s still clearer to her conscience that the original\ncondition, definite, intensely implied on her uncle’s part, is attached\nto the use of it.  She can only take one view of it.  It’s for the\nEndowment or it’s for nothing.”\n\n“The Endowment,” I permitted myself to observe, “is a conception\nsuperficially sublime, but fundamentally ridiculous.”\n\n“Are you repeating Mr. Gravener’s words?” Adelaide asked.\n\n“Possibly, though I’ve not seen him for months.  It’s simply the way it\nstrikes me too.  It’s an old wife’s tale.  Gravener made some reference\nto the legal aspect, but such an absurdly loose arrangement has _no_\nlegal aspect.”\n\n“Ruth doesn’t insist on that,” said Mrs. Mulville; “and it’s, for her,\nexactly this technical weakness that constitutes the force of the moral\nobligation.”\n\n“Are you repeating _her_ words?” I enquired.  I forget what else Adelaide\nsaid, but she said she was magnificent.  I thought of George Gravener\nconfronted with such magnificence as that, and I asked what could have\nmade two such persons ever suppose they understood each other.  Mrs.\nMulville assured me the girl loved him as such a woman could love and\nthat she suffered as such a woman could suffer.  Nevertheless she wanted\nto see _me_.  At this I sprang up with a groan.  “Oh I’m so sorry!—when?”\nSmall though her sense of humour, I think Adelaide laughed at my\nsequence.  We discussed the day, the nearest it would be convenient I\nshould come out; but before she went I asked my visitor how long she had\nbeen acquainted with these prodigies.\n\n“For several weeks, but I was pledged to secrecy.”\n\n“And that’s why you didn’t write?”\n\n“I couldn’t very well tell you she was with me without telling you that\nno time had even yet been fixed for her marriage.  And I couldn’t very\nwell tell you as much as that without telling you what I knew of the\nreason of it.  It was not till a day or two ago,” Mrs. Mulville went on,\n“that she asked me to ask you if you wouldn’t come and see her.  Then at\nlast she spoke of your knowing about the idea of the Endowment.”\n\nI turned this over.  “Why on earth does she want to see me?”\n\n“To talk with you, naturally, about Mr. Saltram.”\n\n“As a subject for the prize?”  This was hugely obvious, and I presently\nreturned: “I think I’ll sail to-morrow for Australia.”\n\n“Well then—sail!” said Mrs. Mulville, getting up.\n\nBut I frivolously, continued.  “On Thursday at five, we said?”  The\nappointment was made definite and I enquired how, all this time, the\nunconscious candidate had carried himself.\n\n“In perfection, really, by the happiest of chances: he has positively\nbeen a dear.  And then, as to what we revere him for, in the most\nwonderful form.  His very highest—pure celestial light.  You _won’t_ do\nhim an ill turn?” Adelaide pleaded at the door.\n\n“What danger can equal for him the danger to which he’s exposed from\nhimself?” I asked.  “Look out sharp, if he has lately been too prim.\nHe’ll presently take a day off, treat us to some exhibition that will\nmake an Endowment a scandal.”\n\n“A scandal?” Mrs. Mulville dolorously echoed.\n\n“Is Miss Anvoy prepared for that?”\n\nMy visitor, for a moment, screwed her parasol into my carpet.  “He grows\nbigger every day.”\n\n“So do you!” I laughed as she went off.\n\nThat girl at Wimbledon, on the Thursday afternoon, more than justified my\napprehensions.  I recognised fully now the cause of the agitation she had\nproduced in me from the first—the faint foreknowledge that there was\nsomething very stiff I should have to do for her.  I felt more than ever\ncommitted to my fate as, standing before her in the big drawing-room\nwhere they had tactfully left us to ourselves, I tried with a smile to\nstring together the pearls of lucidity which, from her chair, she\nsuccessively tossed me.  Pale and bright, in her monotonous mourning, she\nwas an image of intelligent purpose, of the passion of duty; but I asked\nmyself whether any girl had ever had so charming an instinct as that\nwhich permitted her to laugh out, as for the joy of her difficulty, into\nthe priggish old room.  This remarkable young woman could be earnest\nwithout being solemn, and at moments when I ought doubtless to have\ncursed her obstinacy I found myself watching the unstudied play of her\neyebrows or the recurrence of a singularly intense whiteness produced by\nthe parting of her lips.  These aberrations, I hasten to add, didn’t\nprevent my learning soon enough why she had wished to see me.  Her reason\nfor this was as distinct as her beauty: it was to make me explain what I\nhad meant, on the occasion of our first meeting, by Mr. Saltram’s want of\ndignity.  It wasn’t that she couldn’t imagine, but she desired it there\nfrom my lips.  What she really desired of course was to know whether\nthere was worse about him than what she had found out for herself.  She\nhadn’t been a month so much in the house with him without discovering\nthat he wasn’t a man of monumental bronze.  He was like a jelly minus its\nmould, he had to be embanked; and that was precisely the source of her\ninterest in him and the ground of her project.  She put her project\nboldly before me: there it stood in its preposterous beauty.  She was as\nwilling to take the humorous view of it as I could be: the only\ndifference was that for her the humorous view of a thing wasn’t\nnecessarily prohibitive, wasn’t paralysing.\n\nMoreover she professed that she couldn’t discuss with me the primary\nquestion—the moral obligation: that was in her own breast.  There were\nthings she couldn’t go into—injunctions, impressions she had received.\nThey were a part of the closest intimacy of her intercourse with her\naunt, they were absolutely clear to her; and on questions of delicacy,\nthe interpretation of a fidelity, of a promise, one had always in the\nlast resort to make up one’s mind for one’s self.  It was the idea of the\napplication to the particular case, such a splendid one at last, that\ntroubled her, and she admitted that it stirred very deep things.  She\ndidn’t pretend that such a responsibility was a simple matter; if it\n_had_ been she wouldn’t have attempted to saddle me with any portion of\nit.  The Mulvilles were sympathy itself, but were they absolutely candid?\nCould they indeed be, in their position—would it even have been to be\ndesired?  Yes, she had sent for me to ask no less than that of me—whether\nthere was anything dreadful kept back.  She made no allusion whatever to\nGeorge Gravener—I thought her silence the only good taste and her gaiety\nperhaps a part of the very anxiety of that discretion, the effect of a\ndetermination that people shouldn’t know from herself that her relations\nwith the man she was to marry were strained.  All the weight, however,\nthat she left me to throw was a sufficient implication of the weight _he_\nhad thrown in vain.  Oh she knew the question of character was immense,\nand that one couldn’t entertain any plan for making merit comfortable\nwithout running the gauntlet of that terrible procession of\ninterrogation-points which, like a young ladies’ school out for a walk,\nhooked their uniform noses at the tail of governess Conduct.  But were we\nabsolutely to hold that there was never, never, never an exception,\nnever, never, never an occasion for liberal acceptance, for clever\ncharity, for suspended pedantry—for letting one side, in short,\noutbalance another?  When Miss Anvoy threw off this appeal I could have\nembraced her for so delightfully emphasising her unlikeness to Mrs.\nSaltram.  “Why not have the courage of one’s forgiveness,” she asked, “as\nwell as the enthusiasm of one’s adhesion?”\n\n“Seeing how wonderfully you’ve threshed the whole thing out,” I evasively\nreplied, “gives me an extraordinary notion of the point your enthusiasm\nhas reached.”\n\nShe considered this remark an instant with her eyes on mine, and I\ndivined that it struck her I might possibly intend it as a reference to\nsome personal subjection to our fat philosopher, to some aberration of\nsensibility, some perversion of taste.  At least I couldn’t interpret\notherwise the sudden flash that came into her face.  Such a\nmanifestation, as the result of any word of mine, embarrassed me; but\nwhile I was thinking how to reassure her the flush passed away in a smile\nof exquisite good nature.  “Oh you see one forgets so wonderfully how one\ndislikes him!” she said; and if her tone simply extinguished his strange\nfigure with the brush of its compassion, it also rings in my ear to-day\nas the purest of all our praises.  But with what quick response of fine\npity such a relegation of the man himself made me privately sigh “Ah poor\nSaltram!”  She instantly, with this, took the measure of all I didn’t\nbelieve, and it enabled her to go on: “What can one do when a person has\ngiven such a lift to one’s interest in life?”\n\n“Yes, what can one do?”  If I struck her as a little vague it was because\nI was thinking of another person.  I indulged in another inarticulate\nmurmur—“Poor George Gravener!”  What had become of the lift _he_ had\ngiven that interest?  Later on I made up my mind that she was sore and\nstricken at the appearance he presented of wanting the miserable money.\nThis was the hidden reason of her alienation.  The probable sincerity, in\nspite of the illiberality, of his scruples about the particular use of it\nunder discussion didn’t efface the ugliness of his demand that they\nshould buy a good house with it.  Then, as for _his_ alienation, he\ndidn’t, pardonably enough, grasp the lift Frank Saltram had given her\ninterest in life.  If a mere spectator could ask that last question, with\nwhat rage in his heart the man himself might!  He wasn’t, like her, I was\nto see, too proud to show me why he was disappointed.\n\n\n\n\nXI\n\n\nI WAS unable this time to stay to dinner: such at any rate was the plea\non which I took leave.  I desired in truth to get away from my young\nlady, for that obviously helped me not to pretend to satisfy her.  How\n_could_ I satisfy her?  I asked myself—how could I tell her how much had\nbeen kept back?  I didn’t even know and I certainly didn’t desire to\nknow.  My own policy had ever been to learn the least about poor\nSaltram’s weaknesses—not to learn the most.  A great deal that I had in\nfact learned had been forced upon me by his wife.  There was something\neven irritating in Miss Anvoy’s crude conscientiousness, and I wondered\nwhy, after all, she couldn’t have let him alone and been content to\nentrust George Gravener with the purchase of the good house.  I was sure\nhe would have driven a bargain, got something excellent and cheap.  I\nlaughed louder even than she, I temporised, I failed her; I told her I\nmust think over her case.  I professed a horror of responsibilities and\ntwitted her with her own extravagant passion for them.  It wasn’t really\nthat I was afraid of the scandal, the moral discredit for the Fund; what\ntroubled me most was a feeling of a different order.  Of course, as the\nbeneficiary of the Fund was to enjoy a simple life-interest, as it was\nhoped that new beneficiaries would arise and come up to new standards, it\nwouldn’t be a trifle that the first of these worthies shouldn’t have been\na striking example of the domestic virtues.  The Fund would start badly,\nas it were, and the laurel would, in some respects at least, scarcely be\ngreener from the brows of the original wearer.  That idea, however, was\nat that hour, as I have hinted, not the source of solicitude it ought\nperhaps to have been, for I felt less the irregularity of Saltram’s\ngetting the money than that of this exalted young woman’s giving it up.\nI wanted her to have it for herself, and I told her so before I went\naway.  She looked graver at this than she had looked at all, saying she\nhoped such a preference wouldn’t make me dishonest.\n\nIt made me, to begin with, very restless—made me, instead of going\nstraight to the station, fidget a little about that many-coloured Common\nwhich gives Wimbledon horizons.  There was a worry for me to work off, or\nrather keep at a distance, for I declined even to admit to myself that I\nhad, in Miss Anvoy’s phrase, been saddled with it.  What could have been\nclearer indeed than the attitude of recognising perfectly what a world of\ntrouble The Coxon Fund would in future save us, and of yet liking better\nto face a continuance of that trouble than see, and in fact contribute\nto, a deviation from attainable bliss in the life of two other persons in\nwhom I was deeply interested?  Suddenly, at the end of twenty minutes,\nthere was projected across this clearness the image of a massive\nmiddle-aged man seated on a bench under a tree, with sad far-wandering\neyes and plump white hands folded on the head of a stick—a stick I\nrecognised, a stout gold-headed staff that I had given him in devoted\ndays.  I stopped short as he turned his face to me, and it happened that\nfor some reason or other I took in as I had perhaps never done before the\nbeauty of his rich blank gaze.  It was charged with experience as the sky\nis charged with light, and I felt on the instant as if we had been\noverspanned and conjoined by the great arch of a bridge or the great dome\nof a temple.  Doubtless I was rendered peculiarly sensitive to it by\nsomething in the way I had been giving him up and sinking him.  While I\nmet it I stood there smitten, and I felt myself responding to it with a\nsort of guilty grimace.  This brought back his attention in a smile which\nexpressed for me a cheerful weary patience, a bruised noble gentleness.\nI had told Miss Anvoy that he had no dignity, but what did he seem to me,\nall unbuttoned and fatigued as he waited for me to come up, if he didn’t\nseem unconcerned with small things, didn’t seem in short majestic?  There\nwas majesty in his mere unconsciousness of our little conferences and\npuzzlements over his maintenance and his reward.\n\nAfter I had sat by him a few minutes I passed my arm over his big soft\nshoulder—wherever you touched him you found equally little firmness—and\nsaid in a tone of which the suppliance fell oddly on my own ear: “Come\nback to town with me, old friend—come back and spend the evening.”  I\nwanted to hold him, I wanted to keep him, and at Waterloo, an hour later,\nI telegraphed possessively to the Mulvilles.  When he objected, as\nregards staying all night, that he had no things, I asked him if he\nhadn’t everything of mine.  I had abstained from ordering dinner, and it\nwas too late for preliminaries at a club; so we were reduced to tea and\nfried fish at my rooms—reduced also to the transcendent.  Something had\ncome up which made me want him to feel at peace with me—and which,\nprecisely, was all the dear man himself wanted on any occasion.  I had\ntoo often had to press upon him considerations irrelevant, but it gives\nme pleasure now to think that on that particular evening I didn’t even\nmention Mrs. Saltram and the children.  Late into the night we smoked and\ntalked; old shames and old rigours fell away from us; I only let him see\nthat I was conscious of what I owed him.  He was as mild as contrition\nand as copious as faith; he was never so fine as on a shy return, and\neven better at forgiving than at being forgiven.  I dare say it was a\nsmaller matter than that famous night at Wimbledon, the night of the\nproblematical sobriety and of Miss Anvoy’s initiation; but I was as much\nin it on this occasion as I had been out of it then.  At about 1.30 he\nwas sublime.\n\nHe never, in whatever situation, rose till all other risings were over,\nand his breakfasts, at Wimbledon, had always been the principal reason\nmentioned by departing cooks.  The coast was therefore clear for me to\nreceive her when, early the next morning, to my surprise, it was\nannounced to me his wife had called.  I hesitated, after she had come up,\nabout telling her Saltram was in the house, but she herself settled the\nquestion, kept me reticent by drawing forth a sealed letter which,\nlooking at me very hard in the eyes, she placed, with a pregnant absence\nof comment, in my hand.  For a single moment there glimmered before me\nthe fond hope that Mrs. Saltram had tendered me, as it were, her\nresignation and desired to embody the act in an unsparing form.  To bring\nthis about I would have feigned any humiliation; but after my eyes had\ncaught the superscription I heard myself say with a flatness that\nbetrayed a sense of something very different from relief: “Oh the\nPudneys!”  I knew their envelopes though they didn’t know mine.  They\nalways used the kind sold at post-offices with the stamp affixed, and as\nthis letter hadn’t been posted they had wasted a penny on me.  I had seen\ntheir horrid missives to the Mulvilles, but hadn’t been in direct\ncorrespondence with them.\n\n“They enclosed it to me, to be delivered.  They doubtless explain to you\nthat they hadn’t your address.”\n\nI turned the thing over without opening it.  “Why in the world should\nthey write to me?”\n\n“Because they’ve something to tell you.  The worst,” Mrs. Saltram dryly\nadded.\n\nIt was another chapter, I felt, of the history of their lamentable\nquarrel with her husband, the episode in which, vindictively,\ndisingenuously as they themselves had behaved, one had to admit that he\nhad put himself more grossly in the wrong than at any moment of his life.\nHe had begun by insulting the matchless Mulvilles for these more specious\nprotectors, and then, according to his wont at the end of a few months,\nhad dug a still deeper ditch for his aberration than the chasm left\nyawning behind.  The chasm at Wimbledon was now blessedly closed; but the\nPudneys, across their persistent gulf, kept up the nastiest fire.  I\nnever doubted they had a strong case, and I had been from the first for\nnot defending him—reasoning that if they weren’t contradicted they’d\nperhaps subside.  This was above all what I wanted, and I so far\nprevailed that I did arrest the correspondence in time to save our little\ncircle an infliction heavier than it perhaps would have borne.  I knew,\nthat is I divined, that their allegations had gone as yet only as far as\ntheir courage, conscious as they were in their own virtue of an exposed\nplace in which Saltram could have planted a blow.  It was a question with\nthem whether a man who had himself so much to cover up would dare his\nblow; so that these vessels of rancour were in a manner afraid of each\nother.  I judged that on the day the Pudneys should cease for some reason\nor other to be afraid they would treat us to some revelation more\ndisconcerting than any of its predecessors.  As I held Mrs. Saltram’s\nletter in my hand it was distinctly communicated to me that the day had\ncome—they had ceased to be afraid.  “I don’t want to know the worst,” I\npresently declared.\n\n“You’ll have to open the letter.  It also contains an enclosure.”\n\nI felt it—it was fat and uncanny.  “Wheels within wheels!” I exclaimed.\n“There’s something for me too to deliver.”\n\n“So they tell me—to Miss Anvoy.”\n\nI stared; I felt a certain thrill.  “Why don’t they send it to her\ndirectly?”\n\nMrs. Saltram hung fire.  “Because she’s staying with Mr. and Mrs.\nMulville.”\n\n“And why should that prevent?”\n\nAgain my visitor faltered, and I began to reflect on the grotesque, the\nunconscious perversity of her action.  I was the only person save George\nGravener and the Mulvilles who was aware of Sir Gregory Coxon’s and of\nMiss Anvoy’s strange bounty.  Where could there have been a more signal\nillustration of the clumsiness of human affairs than her having\ncomplacently selected this moment to fly in the face of it?  “There’s the\nchance of their seeing her letters.  They know Mr. Pudney’s hand.”\n\nStill I didn’t understand; then it flashed upon me.  “You mean they might\nintercept it?  How can you imply anything so base?” I indignantly\ndemanded.\n\n“It’s not I—it’s Mr. Pudney!” cried Mrs. Saltram with a flush.  “It’s his\nown idea.”\n\n“Then why couldn’t he send the letter to you to be delivered?”\n\nMrs. Saltram’s embarrassment increased; she gave me another hard look.\n“You must make that out for yourself.”\n\nI made it out quickly enough.  “It’s a denunciation?”\n\n“A real lady doesn’t betray her husband!” this virtuous woman exclaimed.\n\nI burst out laughing, and I fear my laugh may have had an effect of\nimpertinence.  “Especially to Miss Anvoy, who’s so easily shocked? Why do\nsuch things concern _her_?” I asked, much at a loss.\n\n“Because she’s there, exposed to all his craft.  Mr. and Mrs. Pudney have\nbeen watching this: they feel she may be taken in.”\n\n“Thank you for all the rest of us!  What difference can it make when she\nhas lost her power to contribute?”\n\nAgain Mrs. Saltram considered; then very nobly: “There are other things\nin the world than money.”  This hadn’t occurred to her so long as the\nyoung lady had any; but she now added, with a glance at my letter, that\nMr. and Mrs. Pudney doubtless explained their motives.  “It’s all in\nkindness,” she continued as she got up.\n\n“Kindness to Miss Anvoy?  You took, on the whole, another view of\nkindness before her reverses.”\n\nMy companion smiled with some acidity “Perhaps you’re no safer than the\nMulvilles!”\n\nI didn’t want her to think that, nor that she should report to the\nPudneys that they had not been happy in their agent; and I well remember\nthat this was the moment at which I began, with considerable emotion, to\npromise myself to enjoin upon Miss Anvoy never to open any letter that\nshould come to her in one of those penny envelopes.  My emotion, and I\nfear I must add my confusion, quickly deepened; I presently should have\nbeen as glad to frighten Mrs. Saltram as to think I might by some\ndiplomacy restore the Pudneys to a quieter vigilance.\n\n“It’s best you should take _my_ view of my safety,” I at any rate soon\nresponded.  When I saw she didn’t know what I meant by this I added: “You\nmay turn out to have done, in bringing me this letter, a thing you’ll\nprofoundly regret.”  My tone had a significance which, I could see, did\nmake her uneasy, and there was a moment, after I had made two or three\nmore remarks of studiously bewildering effect, at which her eyes followed\nso hungrily the little flourish of the letter with which I emphasised\nthem that I instinctively slipped Mr. Pudney’s communication into my\npocket.  She looked, in her embarrassed annoyance, capable of grabbing it\nto send it back to him.  I felt, after she had gone, as if I had almost\ngiven her my word I wouldn’t deliver the enclosure.  The passionate\nmovement, at any rate, with which, in solitude, I transferred the whole\nthing, unopened, from my pocket to a drawer which I double-locked would\nhave amounted, for an initiated observer, to some such pledge.\n\n\n\n\nXII\n\n\nMRS. SALTRAM left me drawing my breath more quickly and indeed almost in\npain—as if I had just perilously grazed the loss of something precious.\nI didn’t quite know what it was—it had a shocking resemblance to my\nhonour.  The emotion was the livelier surely in that my pulses even yet\nvibrated to the pleasure with which, the night before, I had rallied to\nthe rare analyst, the great intellectual adventurer and pathfinder.  What\nhad dropped from me like a cumbersome garment as Saltram appeared before\nme in the afternoon on the heath was the disposition to haggle over his\nvalue.  Hang it, one had to choose, one had to put that value somewhere;\nso I would put it really high and have done with it.  Mrs. Mulville drove\nin for him at a discreet hour—the earliest she could suppose him to have\ngot up; and I learned that Miss Anvoy would also have come had she not\nbeen expecting a visit from Mr. Gravener.  I was perfectly mindful that I\nwas under bonds to see this young lady, and also that I had a letter to\nhand to her; but I took my time, I waited from day to day.  I left Mrs.\nSaltram to deal as her apprehensions should prompt with the Pudneys.  I\nknew at last what I meant—I had ceased to wince at my responsibility.  I\ngave this supreme impression of Saltram time to fade if it would; but it\ndidn’t fade, and, individually, it hasn’t faded even now.  During the\nmonth that I thus invited myself to stiffen again, Adelaide Mulville,\nperplexed by my absence, wrote to me to ask why I _was_ so stiff.  At\nthat season of the year I was usually oftener “with” them.  She also\nwrote that she feared a real estrangement had set in between Mr. Gravener\nand her sweet young friend—a state of things but half satisfactory to her\nso long as the advantage resulting to Mr. Saltram failed to disengage\nitself from the merely nebulous state.  She intimated that her sweet\nyoung friend was, if anything, a trifle too reserved; she also intimated\nthat there might now be an opening for another clever young man.  There\nnever was the slightest opening, I may here parenthesise, and of course\nthe question can’t come up to-day.  These are old frustrations now.  Ruth\nAnvoy hasn’t married, I hear, and neither have I.  During the month,\ntoward the end, I wrote to George Gravener to ask if, on a special\nerrand, I might come to see him, and his answer was to knock the very\nnext day at my door.  I saw he had immediately connected my enquiry with\nthe talk we had had in the railway-carriage, and his promptitude showed\nthat the ashes of his eagerness weren’t yet cold.  I told him there was\nsomething I felt I ought in candour to let him know—I recognised the\nobligation his friendly confidence had laid on me.\n\n“You mean Miss Anvoy has talked to you?  She has told me so herself,” he\nsaid.\n\n“It wasn’t to tell you so that I wanted to see you,” I replied; “for it\nseemed to me that such a communication would rest wholly with herself.\nIf however she did speak to you of our conversation she probably told you\nI was discouraging.”\n\n“Discouraging?”\n\n“On the subject of a present application of The Coxon Fund.”\n\n“To the case of Mr. Saltram?  My dear fellow, I don’t know what you call\ndiscouraging!” Gravener cried.\n\n“Well I thought I was, and I thought she thought I was.”\n\n“I believe she did, but such a thing’s measured by the effect.  She’s not\n‘discouraged,’” he said.\n\n“That’s her own affair.  The reason I asked you to see me was that it\nappeared to me I ought to tell you frankly that—decidedly!—I can’t\nundertake to produce that effect.  In fact I don’t want to!”\n\n“It’s very good of you, damn you!” my visitor laughed, red and really\ngrave.  Then he said: “You’d like to see that scoundrel publicly\nglorified—perched on the pedestal of a great complimentary pension?”\n\nI braced myself.  “Taking one form of public recognition with another it\nseems to me on the whole I should be able to bear it.  When I see the\ncompliments that _are_ paid right and left I ask myself why this one\nshouldn’t take its course.  This therefore is what you’re entitled to\nhave looked to me to mention to you.  I’ve some evidence that perhaps\nwould be really dissuasive, but I propose to invite Mss Anvoy to remain\nin ignorance of it.”\n\n“And to invite me to do the same?”\n\n“Oh you don’t require it—you’ve evidence enough.  I speak of a sealed\nletter that I’ve been requested to deliver to her.”\n\n“And you don’t mean to?”\n\n“There’s only one consideration that would make me,” I said.\n\nGravener’s clear handsome eyes plunged into mine a minute, but evidently\nwithout fishing up a clue to this motive—a failure by which I was almost\nwounded.  “What does the letter contain?”\n\n“It’s sealed, as I tell you, and I don’t know what it contains.”\n\n“Why is it sent through you?”\n\n“Rather than you?” I wondered how to put the thing.  “The only\nexplanation I can think of is that the person sending it may have\nimagined your relations with Miss Anvoy to be at an end—may have been\ntold this is the case by Mrs. Saltram.”\n\n“My relations with Miss Anvoy are not at an end,” poor Gravener\nstammered.\n\nAgain for an instant I thought.  “The offer I propose to make you gives\nme the right to address you a question remarkably direct.  Are you still\nengaged to Miss Anvoy?”\n\n“No, I’m not,” he slowly brought out.  “But we’re perfectly good\nfriends.”\n\n“Such good friends that you’ll again become prospective husband and wife\nif the obstacle in your path be removed?”\n\n“Removed?” he anxiously repeated.\n\n“If I send Miss Anvoy the letter I speak of she may give up her idea.”\n\n“Then for God’s sake send it!”\n\n“I’ll do so if you’re ready to assure me that her sacrifice would now\npresumably bring about your marriage.”\n\n“I’d marry her the next day!” my visitor cried.\n\n“Yes, but would she marry _you_?  What I ask of you of course is nothing\nless than your word of honour as to your conviction of this.  If you give\nit me,” I said, “I’ll engage to hand her the letter before night.”\n\nGravener took up his hat; turning it mechanically round he stood looking\na moment hard at its unruffled perfection.  Then very angrily honestly\nand gallantly, “Hand it to the devil!” he broke out; with which he\nclapped the hat on his head and left me.\n\n“Will you read it or not?” I said to Ruth Anvoy, at Wimbledon, when I had\ntold her the story of Mrs. Saltram’s visit.\n\nShe debated for a time probably of the briefest, but long enough to make\nme nervous.  “Have you brought it with you?”\n\n“No indeed.  It’s at home, locked up.”\n\nThere was another great silence, and then she said “Go back and destroy\nit.”\n\nI went back, but I didn’t destroy it till after Saltram’s death, when I\nburnt it unread.  The Pudneys approached her again pressingly, but,\nprompt as they were, The Coxon Fund had already become an operative\nbenefit and a general amaze: Mr. Saltram, while we gathered about, as it\nwere, to watch the manna descend, had begun to draw the magnificent\nincome.  He drew it as he had always drawn everything, with a grand\nabstracted gesture.  Its magnificence, alas, as all the world now knows,\nquite quenched him; it was the beginning of his decline.  It was also\nnaturally a new grievance for his wife, who began to believe in him as\nsoon as he was blighted, and who at this hour accuses us of having bribed\nhim, on the whim of a meddlesome American, to renounce his glorious\noffice, to become, as she says, like everybody else.  The very day he\nfound himself able to publish he wholly ceased to produce.  This deprived\nus, as may easily be imagined, of much of our occupation, and especially\ndeprived the Mulvilles, whose want of self-support I never measured till\nthey lost their great inmate.  They’ve no one to live on now.  Adelaide’s\nmost frequent reference to their destitution is embodied in the remark\nthat dear far-away Ruth’s intentions were doubtless good.  She and Kent\nare even yet looking for another prop, but no one presents a true sphere\nof usefulness.  They complain that people are self-sufficing.  With\nSaltram the fine type of the child of adoption was scattered, the\ngrander, the elder style.  They’ve got their carriage back, but what’s an\nempty carriage?  In short I think we were all happier as well as poorer\nbefore; even including George Gravener, who by the deaths of his brother\nand his nephew has lately become Lord Maddock.  His wife, whose fortune\nclears the property, is criminally dull; he hates being in the Upper\nHouse, and hasn’t yet had high office.  But what are these accidents,\nwhich I should perhaps apologise for mentioning, in the light of the\ngreat eventual boon promised the patient by the rate at which The Coxon\nFund must be rolling up?", "answers": ["Lady Coxon is Ruth's aunt."], "length": 22695, "dataset": "narrativeqa", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "60cacef36b194be88d2a8a4fa816324ffcb672f336197584"}

Sunday.\n\n<b>  INT. OUISHI HOUSEHOLD  TOMOKOS ROOM - NIGHT\n</b>\n  CLOSEUP on a TELEVISION SET.  Theres a baseball game on, but the sound \n  is turned completely down.  Camera PANS to show two cute high school \n  girls, MASAMI and TOMOKO.  Masami is seated on the floor at a low coffee \n  table, TEXTBOOK in front of her. Tomoko is at her desk.  There are SNACKS \n  all over the room, and its obvious there hasnt been much studying going \n  on. Masami is currently in mid-story, speaking excitedly.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMASAMI\n</b>\t\tThey say that some elementary school \n\t\tkid spent the night with his parents \n\t\tat a bed and breakfast in Izu.  The kid\n\t\twanted to go out and play with everybody, \n\t\tright, but he didnt want to miss the \n\t\tprogram he always used to watch back in \n\t\tTokyo, so he records it on the VCR in \n\t\ttheir room.  But of course the stations \n\t\tin Izu are different from the ones in \n\t\tTokyo.  In Izu, it was just an empty \n\t\tchannel, so he shouldve recorded\n\t\tnothing but static.  But when the kid \n\t\tgets back to his house and watches the \n\t\ttape, all of a sudden this woman comes \n\t\ton the screen and says--\n\n  Masami points so suddenly and dramatically at her friend that Tomoko \n  actually jumps in her seat.\n\n\t\t\t\tMASAMI (contd)\n\t\tOne week from now, you will die.\n\n  Short silence as Masami pauses, relishing the moment.\n\n\t\t\t\tMASAMI (contd)\t\n\t\tOf course the kids completely \n\t\tfreaked, and he stops the video.  \n\t\tJust then the phone rings, and when he \n\t\tpicks it up a voice says--\n\n  Her voice drops voice almost to a whisper.\n\n\t\t\t\tMASAMI (contd)\t\n\t\tYou watched it, didnt you?  That \n\t\tsame time, exactly one week later... \n\t\thes dead!\n\n  Masami laughs loudly, thoroughly enjoying her own performance.  \n  Tomoko, however, is completely silent.  She begins looking more \n  and more distressed, until finally Masami notices.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMASAMI\n</b>\t\tWhat is it, Tomoko?\n\n  Tomoko comes out of her chair and drops onto the floor next to her \n  friend.  Her words are quick, earnest.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTOMOKO\n</b>\t\tWho did you hear that story from?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMASAMI\n</b>\t\tWho?  Its just a rumor.  Everybody \n\t\tknows it.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTOMOKO\n</b>\t\tYouko told you?\t\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMASAMI\t\n</b>\t\tNo, it wasnt Youko...\n\n  Tomoko looks away, worried.  Masami slaps her on the knee, \n  laughing.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMASAMI\n</b>\t\tWhats up with you?\n\n  Tomoko speaks slowly, still looking away.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTOMOKO\n</b>\t\tThe other day, I... I watched this \n\t\tstrange video.\n<b>\t\t\n</b><b>\t\t\t\tMASAMI\n</b>\t\tWhere?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTOMOKO\t\n</b>\t\tWith Youko and them.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMASAMI\t\n</b>\t\t\t(excited) \n\t\tSo thats what Ive been hearing \n\t\tabout you doing some double-date/\n\t\tsleepover thing!  So, you and that \n\t\tguy Iwata, huh? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTOMOKO\t\n</b>\t\tNo, its not like that.  Nothing \n\t\thappened!\n\n  Their eyes meet and Tomoko half-blushes, looks away again.  Her \n  expression becomes serious as she resumes her conversation.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTOMOKO\n</b>\t\tIwata... he found this weird video.  \n\t\tEveryone was like, Whats that? so \n\t\the put it on and we all watched it.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMASAMI\n</b>\t\t\t(quietly) \n\t\tAnd?  What kind of video was it?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTOMOKO\n</b>\t\tJust... weird, I cant really explain \n\t\tit.  Anyway, right after we finished \n\t\twatching it, the phone rang.  Whoever\n\t\tit was didnt say anything, but still...\n\n  Silence.  Masami curls up on herself, thoroughly spooked.  \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMASAMI\t\n</b>\t\tJesus.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTOMOKO\n</b>  \t\tIt's cuz, you know, we'd all heard the \n\t\trumors.\n\nTomoko looks seriously over at her friend.\n\n\t\t\t\tTOMOKO (cont'd)\n\t\tThat was one week ago today.\n\n  There is a long, heavy silence as neither of them says anything.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMASAMI  \t\n</b>\t\tWaaait a minute.  Are you faking me \n\t\tout?\n\n  Tomokos face suddenly breaks into a smile. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTOMOKO\t\n</b>\t\tBusted, huh?\n\n  They both crack up laughing. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMASAMI\n</b>\t\tOh, my... I cant believe you!  \n\n  Masami reaches out, slaps her friend on the knee.\n\n\t\t\t\tMASAMI (contd)\n\t\tYoure terrible!\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTOMOKO\n</b>\t\tGotcha!\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMASAMI\t\n</b>\t\t\t(thinking) \n\t\tBut hang on... you really stayed\n\t\tthe night with Youko and Iwata, \n\t\tright?\n\n  Tomoko nods, uh-huh.  Masami dives forward, pinching her friends \n  cheeks and grinning wildly.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMASAMI\t\n</b>\t\tSo, how far did you and he get?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTOMOKO \t\n</b>\t\tOh... I cant remember.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMASAMI\t\n</b>\t\tYou cant remember, huh?\n\n  Masami laughs, then slaps Tomoko on the knee again as she remembers \n  the trick her friend played on her.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMASAMI\t\n</b>\t\tMan, you had me freaked me out. \n<b>\t\tI--\n</b>\n  Just at that moment, the phone RINGS.  They are both suddenly, \n  instantly serious.  Tomokos eyes go off in one direction and she \n  begins shaking her head, -No-.  Masami looks over her shoulder, \n  following her friends gaze.  \n\n  Tomoko is looking at the CLOCK, which currently reads 9:40.\n\n  The phone continues to ring.  Tomoko is now clutching tightly onto her \n  friend, looking panicked.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMASAMI\n</b>\t\t\t(softly) \n\t\tWas it true?\n\n  Tomoko nods her head, still holding on tightly.  Masami has to \n  forcibly disengage herself in order to stand.  The phone is downstairs, \n  so Masami opens the bedroom DOOR and races down the STAIRS.  Tomoko \n  calls out to her from behind.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTOMOKO\n</b>\t\tMasami!\n\n<b>  INT. OUISHI HOUSEHOLD  STAIRCASE - NIGHT  \n</b>\n  Tomoko and Masami run down the staircase, through the hallway towards \n  the kitchen.  Tomoko cries out again just before they reach the kitchen.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTOMOKO\t\n</b>\t\tMasami!\n\n<b>  INT. OUISHI HOUSEHOLD  KITCHEN - NIGHT  \n</b>\n  Masami has come to a halt before a PHONE mounted on the wall.  She \n  pauses, looking slowly at her friend, then back to the phone.  She \n  takes it tentatively from its cradle, answers it wordlessly.  The \n  tension continues to mount as nothing is said. Masami suddenly breaks \n  into a huge grin.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMASAMI\t\n</b>\t\tIll put her on.\n\n  Still grinning, she hands the phone to Tomoko.  Tomoko snatches it \n  quickly.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTOMOKO\n</b>\t\t\t(softly) \n\t\tYes?\n\n  She is silent for a moment, then smiling widely.  \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTOMOKO\n</b>\t\tOh, man!\n\n  She is so relieved that all the strength seeps out of her and she \n  sinks to the kitchen floor.  Masami, equally relieved, slides down \n  the wall and sits down next to her.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTOMOKO\n</b>\t\t\t(on the phone) \n\t\tYeah, Ive got a friend over now.  \n\t\tYeah.  Yeah, OK.  Bye.\n\n  Tomoko stands to place the phone back in its wall cradle, and then \n  squats back down onto the kitchen floor.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTOMOKO\t\n</b>\t\tThe games gone into overtime, so \n\t\ttheyre gonna be a little late. \n\n  They burst out laughing with relief again, and are soon both \n  clutching their stomachs.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTOMOKO\t\n</b>\t\tJeeezus, my parents...\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMASAMI\t\n</b>\t\tOh man, Im tellin everybody about \n\t\tthis tomorrow!\n\n  Tomoko shakes her head, -Dont you dare-.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMASAMI\t\n</b>\t\tIm gonna use your bathroom.  Dont \n\t\tgo anywhere.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTOMOKO\t\n</b><b>\t\tK.\n</b>\n  Masami walks out of the kitchen. Alone now, Tomoko stands and walks \n  toward the SINK, where she takes a GLASS from the DISH RACK.  She \n  then goes to the FRIDGE and sticks her face in, looking for something \n  to drink.  Suddenly there is the SOUND of people clapping and \n  cheering.  Tomoko, startled, peers her head over the refrigerator \n  door to check for the source of the sound.  \n\n  She begins walking slowly, following the sound to the DINING ROOM \n  adjacent the kitchen. \n\n<b>  INT. OUISHI HOUSEHOLD - DINING ROOM - NIGHT  \n</b>\n  The lights are off, and there is no one in the room.  Tomoko pauses a \n  moment, bathed in the garish LIGHT from the TV, which has been switched\n  on.  Playing is the same baseball game they had on the TV upstairs; the \n  same game that Tomokos parents are currently at.  The VOLUME is up \n  quite high.\n\n  A puzzled look on her face, Tomoko takes the REMOTE from the coffee \n  table and flicks the TV off.  She walks back to the kitchen.\n\n<b>  INT. OUISHI HOUSEHOLD  KITCHEN - NIGHT  \n</b>\n  A bottle of SODA that Tomoko had earlier taken from the fridge is on \n  the kitchen table.  She picks the bottle up, pours herself a drink.  \n  Before she can take a sip, however, the air around her becomes suddenly \n  charged, heavy.  Her body begins to shiver as somewhere out of sight \n  comes a popping, crackling SOUND underscored by a kind of GROANING.  \n  Trembling now, Tomoko spins around to see what she has already felt \n  lurking behind her.  She draws in her breath to scream.\n\n  The screen goes white, and fades into:\n\n<b>  CAMERA POV \n</b>\n  The screen is filled with the visage of a nervous-looking YOUNG GIRL.  \n  She is being interviewed by ASAKAWA, a female reporter seated offscreen.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tASAKAWA (O.S.)\n</b>\t\tThere seems to be a popular rumor \n\t\tgoing around about a cursed \n\t\tvideotape.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tYOUNG GIRL\t\n</b>\t\tUh-huh.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tASAKAWA (O.S.) \n</b>\t\tHave you heard what kind of video \n\t\tit might be?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tYOUNG GIRL\t\n</b>\t\tUh-huh.\n\n  The girl looks directly at the camera, her mouth dropping into an O \n  as shes suddenly overcome by a kind of stage fright.  She continues \n  staring, silently, at the camera.\n\n<b>  INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY  \n</b>\n  KOMIYA, the cameraman, has lowered his camera. We can now see that \n  the young girl being interviewed is seated at a table between two \n  friends, a SHORT-HAIRED GIRL (GIRL#2) and a LONG-HAIRED GIRL (GIRL #3).  \n  They are all dressed in the UNIFORMS of junior high school students.  \n  Opposite them sits Komiya and Asakawa, a pretty woman in her mid-\n  twenties.

Local authorities \n    identified the deceased as a 19-year old preparatory school student \n    of Tokyo, and a 16-year old Yokohama resident, a student of a \n    private all-girls high school. Because there were no external \n    injuries, police are investigating the possibility of drug-induced \n    suicide...\n\n  Just then two men walk by, a GUY IN A BUSINESS SUIT and a youngish \n  intern named OKAZAKI.  Okazaki is carrying an armload of VIDEOTAPES.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tGUY IN SUIT\n</b>\t\tOK, Okazaki, Im counting on you.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tOKAZAKI\t\n</b>\t\tYessir.\n\n  The guy in the suit pats Okazaki on the shoulder and walks off.  \n\n  Okazaki turns to walk away, spots Asakawa bent over the small table \n  and peering intently at the newspaper article.\n\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tOKAZAKI\t\n</b>\t\tMiss Asakawa?

She is panting lightly.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tASAKAWA\n</b>\t\tSorry Im late.

Asakawa and Yoichi, walking hand in hand, enter the house.\n\n<b>  INT. OUISHI HOUSEHOLD - NIGHT \n</b>\n  There are many PEOPLE milling about, speaking softly.  A MAN seated \n  at a counter is taking monetary donations from guests and entering \n  their information into a LEDGER.  Asakawa and Yoichi continue walking, \n  down a hallway.\n\n<b>  INT. OUISHI HOUSEHOLD - NIGHT \n</b>\n  Mother and son halt before the open DOOR to the main wake room, where \n  guests may show their respects to the departed.  The room is laid in \n  traditional Japanese-style tatami, a kind of woven straw mat that \n  serves as a carpet. Two GUESTS, their shoes off, are kneeling upon \n  zabuton cushions.  \n\n  Kneeling opposite the guests is KOUICHI, Asakawas father.  The two \n  guests are bowing deeply, and Kouichi bows in response.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tASAKAWA\t\n</b>\t\tDad.\n\n  Kouichi turns to see her.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKOUICHI\n</b>\t\tAh!\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tASAKAWA\n</b>\t\tHow is sis holding up?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKOUICHI\n</b>\t\tShes resting inside right now.  \n\t\tShes shaken up pretty badly, you \n\t\tknow.

Why dont you sit \n\t\there for a little while?\n\n  He grabs the young boy and seats him on a cushion next to the two guests.  \n  As the guests resume their conversation with Asakawas father, Yoichis \n  eyes wander to the ALTAR at the front of the room set up to honor the \n  deceased.  It is made of wood, and surrounded by candles, flowers, and \n  small paper lanterns.  At the center is a PICTURE of the deceased, a \n  teenage girl.  A small wooden PLAQUE reads her name: Tomoko Ouishi. It \n  is the same Tomoko from the first scene.\n\n  Yoichi continues to stare at Tomokos picture.  He makes a peculiar \n  gesture as he does so, rubbing his index finger in small circles just \n  between his eyes.\n\n<b>  INT. HALLWAY  NIGHT\n</b>\n  Asakawa walks down the hallway, looking for her aunt.  She walks until \n  finding the open doorway to the kitchen.  There are a few people in \n  there, preparing busily. Asakawa sees her AUNT, who rushes into the \n  hallway to meet her, holds her fast by the arm.  The aunt speaks in a \n  fierce, quick whisper.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tAUNT\t\t\n</b>\t\tHave you heard anything more about \n\t\tTomo-chans death?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tASAKAWA\t\n</b>\t\tNo, I...\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tAUNT\t\t\n</b>\t\tBut the police have already finished \n\t\ttheir autopsy!\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tASAKAWA\t\n</b>\t\tWell, they said there was no sign of \n\t\tfoul play.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tAUNT\t\n</b>\t\t\t(shaking her head) \n\t\tThat was no normal death.

He stops at the foot of the \n  steps, looking up-- and catches a glimpse of a pair of BARE FEET \n  running up to the second floor.  \n\n  A guarded expression on his face, Yoichi walks slowly up the \n  stairs.  \n\n<b>  INT. OUISHI HOUSEHOLD - TOMOKOS BEDROOM - NIGHT  \n</b>\n  Yoichi has wandered into Tomokos bedroom.  The lights are all off, \n  and there is an eerie feel to it.  Yoichis eyes wander about the \n  room, finally coming to rest on the TELEVISION SET.  Suddenly, he \n  hears his mothers voice from behind him.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tASAKWAWA (O.S.) \n</b>\t\tYoichi?\n\n  Yoichi turns to face her as she approaches, puts an arm around him.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tASAKAWA\t\n</b>\t\tWhat are you doing up here?  You\n\t\tshouldnt just walk into other \n\t\tpeoples rooms.\n\n  Without replying, Yoichis gaze slowly returns to the television \n  set.

The placard reads \n  that the wake is being held for a student of the Seikei School \n  for Women. \n\n  Asakawa stares at that placard, making the mental connections.  \n  She turns abruptly, walks towards a nearby TRIO of HIGH SCHOOL \n<b>  GIRLS.\n</b>\n<b>\t\t\t\tASAKAWA\t\n</b>\t\tExcuse me.

Yoshino flicks \n  a BUTTON on the control panel, scans the footage frame by frame.  He \n  stops when he gets a good close-up of the victim. \n\n  Her face is twisted into an insane rictus of fear, mouth open, eyes \n  wide and glassy.

She stares at the house, unmoving.\n\n<b>  INT. OUISHI HOUSEHOLD  KITCHEN - DAY  \n</b>\n  Asakawa stands before her SISTER RYOMI, who is seated at the kitchen \n  TABLE.  Ryomi is staring blankly away, making no sign of acknowledging \n  her sister.  The silence continues unabated, and Asakawa, pensive, \n  wanders idly into the adjoining dining room.  She takes a long look at \n  the television, the same television that had puzzled Tomoko by suddenly \n  switching itself on, sitting darkly in one corner.  Her reflection in \n  the screen looks stretched, distorted.\n\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYOMI\t(O.S.) \n</b>\t\tThey tell me that Yoichi came to \n\t\tthe funeral, too. \n\n  Asakawa steps back into the kitchen.

Asakawa walks towards it, picks \n  it up.  It is a RECEIPT from a photo shop.  The developed photos have yet \n  to be claimed.  \n\n  Asakawa senses something, spins to look over her shoulder.  Her sister \n  has crept quietly up the stairs and down the hall, and stands now in the \n  doorway to Tomokos room.  She appears not to notice what Asakawa has in \n  her hands, as her gaze has already shifted to the sliding closet door.  \n  She regards it almost druggedly.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYOMI\n</b>\t\t\t(haltingly) \n\t\tThis... this is where Tomoko died.\n\n<b>  FLASHBACK\n</b><b>\t\t\t\tRYOMI (O.S.)\n</b>\t\tTomoko!\n\n  Ryomis hands fling aside the CLOSET DOOR.

It looks very modern, \n  all wood paneling and spacious comfort.  \n\n  Her eyes rest on the TV/VCR setup at the front of the room.  Crouching \n  before the VCR now, she presses the eject button.  Nothing happens.  \n  She fingers the inside of the deck, finds it empty, then reaches behind \n  to the rear of the VCR, searching.  Again, there is nothing.  Asakawa \n  presses the power button on the television, picks up the REMOTE, and \n  takes a seat on the SOFA.  She runs through a few channels but theyre \n  all talk shows, no clues whatsoever.  She flicks the TV off and leans \n  back in the sofa, sighing.\n\n  Just then, she spies a LEDGER on the coffee table.  These things are \n  sometimes left in hotels in Japan, so that guests can write a few \n  comments about their stay for others to read.  Asakawa picks the \n  ledger up, begins thumbing through it.  She stops at a strange PICTURE\n  obviously drawn by a child, that shows three rotund, almost entirely \n  round personages.  She reads the handwritten MESSAGE.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tASAKAWA\t\n</b>\t\t\"My dad is fat.  My mom is fat.  \n\t\tThats why Im fat, too.\"\n\n  She smiles in spite of herself.  \n\n  Asakawa flips through the rest of the ledger, but theres nothing else \n  of any import.  \n\n  She tosses it back onto the coffee table and, sighing again, leans into \n  the sofa and closes her eyes.\n\n<b>  EXT. OUTDOOR CAF - DUSK  \n</b>\n  Asakawa eats silently, alone.\n\n<b>  INT. PACIFIC LAND - FRONT RECEPTION - NIGHT  \n</b>\n  Asakawa has returned to the bed and breakfast.  As she walks in the \n  door, the COUNTER CLERK rises out of his chair to greet her.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCLERK\n</b>\t\tRoom for one?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tASAKAWA\t\n</b>\t\tUm, actually Im here on business.\n\n  She passes the clerk a picture of Tomoko and her three other friends.  \n  He stares at it for a moment.\n\n\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tASAKAWA\n</b>\t\tThey would have stayed here on \n\t\tAugust 29th, all four of them.  \n\t\tIf theres any information you \n\t\tmight have...\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCLERK\n</b>\t\tUh, hang on just a minute.  \n\n  The clerk turns his back to her, begins leafing through a guest log.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCLERK\t\n</b>\t\t\t(to himself) \n\t\tAugust 29th...\n\n  While she waits, Asakawas eyes start to wander around the room.  \n  Behind the desk is a sign reading Rental Video, and a large wooden \n  BOOKSHELF filled with VIDEOTAPES. They are all in their original boxes, \n  and she lets her eyes glance over the titles.  Raiders of the Lost Ark, \n  48 Hours--\n\n  --and then, suddenly, she spies a VIDEOTAPE in a plain, unmarked \n  sleeve, tucked away in the back of the very bottom shelf.  She feels \n  the hairs on the back of her neck rise.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tASAKAWA\t\n</b>\t\tThat...\n\n  The clerk looks up.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCLERK\n</b>\t\tHmm?\n\n  Asakawa stabs a finger excitedly towards the shelf.\n\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tASAKAWA\n</b>\t\tThat!  What tape is that?\n\n  The clerk reaches out for it, grabs it.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCLERK\t\n</b>\t\tThis?  Hmm...\n\n  The clerk pulls the tape out of its SLEEVE and checks for a label.  \n  Its unmarked.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCLERK\n</b>\t\tMaybe one of the guests left it behind\n\n<b>  INT. PACIFIC LAND  COTTAGE B4 - NIGHT \n</b>\n  Asakawa flips on the TV.  Its on channel 2, and there is nothing but \n  static. She kneels down to slide the tape into the deck and pauses a \n  moment, framed in the vaguely spectral LIGHT from the television \n  screen.  Steeling her nerves, she puts the tape into the machine, picks \n  up the remote, and presses play.\n\n\n  NOTE: This next scene is entirely visual.  If you are reading this \n  translation before watching the movie, do yourself a favor; STOP \n  reading this now and watch the scene for itself.  Afterwards, you can \n  come back here to check the meaning of the Japanese characters \n  displayed.\n\n\n<b>  THE VIDEOTAPE\n</b>\n  At first it looks like nothing has happened-- then Asakawa realizes that \n  she is now viewing recorded static instead of broadcast static.  She \n  watches, waiting, but the static continues unbroken.  Asakawa looks \n  down at the remote, is about to press fast forward, when suddenly the \n  picture on the screen clears and for a moment she thinks shes looking \n  at the moon.\n\n  Its not the moon at all, she realizes.  The shape is round like a full \n  moon, but it seems to be made up of thin RIBBONS of cloud streaking \n  against a night sky.  And theres a FACE, she sees, a face hidden in \n  shadows, looking down from above.  \n\n  What is this?\n\n  The scene changes now, and Asakawa notes that the tape has that kind of \n  grainy quality one sees in 3rd or 4th generation copies.  The scene is of \n  a WOMAN brushing her long hair before an oval-shaped MIRROR.  The nerve-\n  wracking grating as if of some giant metallic insect sounds in the \n  background, but the lady doesnt seem to notice.  The mirror the lady is \n  using to brush her hair suddenly changes position from the left part of \n  the wall before which she stands, to the right.  Almost instantly the \n  mirror returns to its original position, but in that one moment in its \n  changed location we see a small FIGURE in a white GOWN.  The woman turns \n  towards where that figure stood, and smiles.\n\n  The screen next becomes a twitching, undulating impenetrable sea of the \n  kanji characters used in the Japanese language.  Asakawa can pick out \n  only two things recognizable:\n\n    local     volcanic eruption\n\n  Now the screen is awash in PEOPLE-- crawling, scrabbling, shambling \n  masses, some of them moving in reverse.  A sound like moaning accompanies \n  them.\n<b>  -\n</b>\n  A FIGURE stands upon a shore, its face shrouded.  It points accusingly, \n  not towards the screen, but at something unseen off to one side.  The \n  insect-like screeching sounds louder. \n<b>  --\n</b>\n  Close up on inhuman, alien-looking EYE.  Inside that eye a single \n  character is reflected in reverse:  SADA, meaning \"chastity.\"\n\n  The eye blinks once, twice.  The symbol remains.\n<b>  ---\n</b>\n  A long shot of an outdoor, uncovered WELL.\n<b>  ----\n</b>\n  Sudden loud, blinding STATIC as the tape ends.\n\n  Asakawa turns the TV off, looking physically drained.  She sighs shakily \n  and slumps forward, resting on her knees.  Just then, she glances at the \n  television screen.  She sees, reflected, a small FIGURE in a white gown \n  standing at the rear of the room.  Shocked, Asakawa draws in breath, \n  spins around.\n\n  The room is empty.  Asakawa runs to the sofa to collect her jacket--\n\n  --and the RINGING of the telephone stops her dead in her tracks.  Zombie-\n  like, she walks towards the telephone, picks it up wordlessly.  \n\n  From the other end comes the same metallic, insectoid SQUEAKING heard on \n  the video.  Asakawa slams the phone down and glances up at the CLOCK.  \n  Its about seven minutes after 7 P.M.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tASAKAWA\t\n</b>\t\t\t(to herself) \n\t\tOne week\n\n  Asakawa grabs her coat, pops the tape out of the deck, and runs out the \n  door.\n\n<b>  EXT. STREET  DAY\n</b>\n  It is dark and raining heavily.  Yoichi, Asakawas son, is walking to \n  school, UMBRELLA firmly in hand.  The sidewalk is quite narrow, and Yoichi \n  comes to a halt when a second PERSON comes from the opposite direction, \n  blocking his way. Yoichi slowly raises his umbrella, peers up to look at \n  this other pedestrian.  It is a MAN, a BAG slung over one shoulder.  He \n  has a beard; unusual for Japan where clean-shaven is the norm.  \n\n  The two continue looking directly at each other, neither moving nor \n  speaking.  Yoichi then walks around the persons left and continues on his\n   way.  The man resumes walking as well.\n\n  Caption-- September 14th.  Tuesday.\n\n<b>  EXT. OUTSIDE AN APARTMENT DOOR - DAY  \n</b>\n  The bearded man, whose name is RYUJI, reaches out to press the DOORBELL, \n  but the door has already opened from within.  Asakawa leans out, holding \n  the door open for him.  Neither of them speaks.  Wordlessly, Ryuji enters \n  the apartment.\n\n<b>  INT. ASAKAWAS APARTMENT - DAY  \n</b>\n  Ryuji puts his bag down, looks around the apartment.  The interior is dark, \n  ominous somehow.  He takes his JACKET off and wanders into the living room.  \n  Asakawa is in the kitchen behind him, preparing TEA.  Ryuji spies the \n  collection of FRAMED PHOTOGRAPHS in living room.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI\n</b>\t\tYoichis in elementary school \n\t\talready, is he?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tASAKAWA\t\n</b>\t\tHis first year.

On the coffee table \n  before them is a VIDEOTAPE in a plain, unmarked case.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tASAKAWA\n</b>\t\tAnd money is...?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI\n</b>\t\tIm teaching at university.\n\n  Ryuji picks up his cup of tea but stops, grimacing, before it is to his \n  lips.  He rubs his forehead as if experiencing a sudden headache.  Ryuji \n  shakes it off and quickly regains his composure.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI\n</b>\t\tAnyway.  You said that the phone rang?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tASAKAWA\n</b>\t\tThats right.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI\t\t\n</b>\t\tSo if I watch it too, that phone over \n\t\tthere--\n\n  He gestures with his mug \n\n\t\t\t\tRYUJI (contd)\n\t\t--should ring.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tASAKAWA\n</b>\t\tRyuji, four people have already \n\t\tdied.

Asakawa reaches quickly, grabs something \n  from the bookshelf behind her-- a POLAROID CAMERA.    She shoves it \n  into Ryujis hands, then turns to look down at the floor.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tASAKAWA\t\n</b>\t\tTake my picture.\n\n  Ryuji raises the camera to his eye.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI\t\t\n</b>\t\tTurn this way.\n\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tASAKAWA\t\n</b>\t\t\t(unmoving) \n\t\tHurry up and take it.\n\n  Ryuji snaps off a shot.  It comes out the other end and he takes it, \n  waits impatiently for an image to appear.  When it does, all he can \n  do is pass it wordlessly over to Asakawa.  Her face is twisted, \n  misshapen.  \n\n  Just like the picture of Tomoko and her friends.\n\n  Asakawa stares at it, horrified.  By the time she finally looks up, \n  Ryuji has already risen from his seat and slid the videotape into the \n  VCR.  Again, the screen is filled with static, only to be replaced \n  with what looks like the moon.  Asakawa slams the Polaroid on the \n  coffee table and goes outside onto the veranda.  \n\n<b>  EXT. VERANDA - DAY  \n</b>\n  Asakawa stares out at a view of the houses shaded in cloud and rain. \n  There is a knock on the glass door behind her.  A moment later, \n  Ryuji slides the door open.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI\t\t\n</b>\t\tIts over.\n\n  Asakawa re-enters her apartment.\n\n<b>  INT.

She stares at it \n  carefully, and notices...\n\n  The tape ends, filling the screen with static.  A split-second \n  afterwards, there is a KNOCK on the door and Okazaki enters, holding \n  a FILE.  Asakawa momentarily forgets about the video.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tOKAZAKI\t\n</b>\t\t\t(handing her the file)\n\t\tHeres that guest list you wanted.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tASAKAWA\t\n</b>\t\tOh, thanks.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tOKAZAKI\t\n</b>\t\tWhat are you gonna do with this?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tASAKAWA\t\n</b>\t\tUh... sorry, Im working on \n\t\tsomething personal.\n\n<b>  EXT. IN FRONT OF A TRAIN STATION - DAY  \n</b>\n  Some quick shots of a FOUNTAIN gushing water, PIGEONS flapping away \n  looking agitated.  CUT to Ryuji sitting on a BENCH.  Hes deep in \n  thought, writing in a NOTEPAD. There are multitudes of PEOPLE about \n  him, and we can hear the sounds of their coming and going.  A PAIR \n  OF LEGS attached to a woman in white dress, hose, and pumps appears, \n  heading directly for Ryuji.  Her pace is slow, rhythmical, and as \n  that pace progresses all other sounds FADE into the background, so \n  that all we can hear is the CLOMP, CLOMP as those legs walk to stand \n  just before Ryuji.  The pumps are scuffed, dirtied with grime.  \n\n  A gust of WIND rips by.  Ryuji fights the urge to look up as in his \n  ears rings the same hollowed, multi-voiced BABBLING heard on the \n  videotape.  The sound grows stronger.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI (VO)\n</b> \t\tSo, it was you.  You did it.\n\n  The babbling fades, disappears as slowly the worlds normal \n  background sounds return.  Ryuji looks up, but the woman in white \n  is nowhere to be seen.\n\n<b>  EXT. OUTSIDE RYUJIS APARTMENT  AFTERNOON\n</b>\n  Ryuji rides up on a BICYCLE.

He squats down on the tatami in \n  frontof his TV and slides the tape in.  Asakawa sits on the \n  tatami as well, but positions herself away from the TV and keeps \n  her eyes averted.  Ryuji glares over his shoulder at her.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI\n</b>\t\t\t(sternly) \n\t\tAsakawa.\n\n  She reluctantly scoots closer, looks up at the screen.  Ryuji \n  fast-forwards the tape a bit, stopping at the scene where the \n  woman is brushing her long hair before an oval mirror.  He puts \n  the video on frame-by-frame. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI\n</b>\t\tHave you ever seen this woman?\n\n  Asakawa regards the screen intently.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tASAKAWA\n</b> \t\tNo...\n\n  The tape advances to the scene where the mirror suddenly changes \n  positions.  When it does, we can again see the small figure in the \n  white gown, a figure with long black hair. When Ryuji sees this \n  his body stiffens, becomes tense.  Asakawa notices but says nothing.  \n  She also notices something else.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tASAKAWA\n</b>\t\t\t(excitedly) \n\t\tTheres something strange about \n\t\tthis shot.\n\n  She takes the remote from Ryuji, rewinds it a ways.

Ryuji turns off the TV, \n  ejects the tape from the deck.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI\t\n</b>\t\tCome on in.\n\n  Asakawa flashes a look at Ryuji and then turns her head back towards \n  the front door to see who has entered.  A cute, nervous-looking young \n  GIRL with short hair approaches slowly.  She is carrying a PLASTIC BAG \n  filled with groceries.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI\t\n</b>\t\tAsakawa, meet my student, Takano Mai.\n\n  He turns, addresses Mai.\n\n\t\t\t\tRYUJI\t(contd)\t\n\t\tThis is Asakawa, my ex-wife.\n\n  Ryuji gets up and walks conveniently away.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMAI\t\t\n</b>\t\tNice to meet you.

They leave.\n\n  Mai pouts unhappily a bit, and then breaks into a smile as an idea \n  crosses her mind.  She walks across the room to where Ryuji has set \n  up a large BLACKBOARD filled with mathematical equations.

He listens carefully, and when he hears that strange \n  something again he stops, looks at the screen.\n\n  It is paused at the scene with the figure, pointing, a CLOTH draped \n  over its head.  The figure now looks oddly like a messenger.\n\n  Ryuji and Asakawa exchange glances.  This could be it.  Ryuji flips \n  some more switches, setting the sound for super-slow mo.

It is curled into a fetal position and has its head turned \n  away.\n\n  Suddenly, the IMAGE from the video of the figure with its face \n  shrouded springs to Asakawas mind.  Just an instant, its pointing \n  visage materializes, and then disappears.  It reappears a moment \n  later, pointing more insistently now, and disappears again.  \n\n  Asakawa blinks her eyes and realizes that the futon next to hers is \n  empty.  Yoichi is nowhere to be seen.\n\n  Just then, she hears that high-pitched, metallic SQUEAKING from the \n  video.  Eyes wide with horror, she flings the sliding doors apart--\n  --and there, seated before the television, is Yoichi.\n\n  He is watching the video.\n\n  It is already at the very last scene, the shot of the outdoor well. \n  CLOSEUP on the screen now, and for just an instant we can see that \n  something is trying to claw its way out of the well.  The video cuts \n  off, and the screen fills with static.  \n\n  Shrieking, Asakawa races over to Yoichi, covers his eyes though it is \n  already too late.  She scoots over to the VCR, ejects the tape and \n  stares at it uncomprehendingly.  She is then at Yoichis side again, \n  shaking him roughly.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tASAKAWA\n</b>\t\tYoichi!

You even got \n\t\tsome, from one of the newspapers.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tYAMAMURA\t\t\n</b>\t\tLeave me the hell alone!\n\n  Mr. Yamamura strides angrily off.  Both Ryuji and Asakawa take \n  pursuit, Ryuji calling out from behind Yamamuras back.\n\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI\t\t\n</b>\t\tTell us about Shizukos daughter.  \n\t\tWho was she?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tYAMAMURA\t\n</b>\t\tI dont know!\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI\t\t\n</b>\t\tShe was there, with Shizuko. She \n\t\thad to be.\n\n  Yamamuras pace, which has become increasingly erratic, finally \n  causes him to stumble and fall.  Ryuji comes up behind him, \n  grasping him firmly.  At their touch Ryujis power awakens, and as \n  he peers into the old mans mind there is a sudden blinding\n\n<b>  FLASH\n</b>\n  The setting is a large MEETING HALL.  A number of people are seated \n  in folding chairs before a STAGE, on which are a four MEN in BUSINESS \n  SUITS and a WOMAN in a KIMONO.  A BANNER hangs above the stage, which \n  reads PUBLIC DEMONSTRATION ON THE EXISTENCE OF CLAIRVOYANCE.  \n\n<b>  FLASH\n</b>\n  Ryuji eyes widen as he realizes he is seeing Shizukos demonstration \n  before the press.  He also realizes--\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI\n</b>\t\t\t(to Yamamura)\n\t\tYou were there!\n\n<b>  FLASH\n</b>\n  YAMAMURA SHIZUKO, the woman in the kimono, is sitting at a TABLE \n  onstage. Her face is calm and expressionless.  Standing off to one \n  side and peering from behind the curtains is a young Mr. Yamamura.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI\t(O.S.) \n</b>\t\tYou stood there and watched the \n\t\tdemonstration.\n\n  CUT back to the beach.  Asakawa comes running up toward Ryuji and the \n  prone Mr. Yamamura.  Suddenly there is another\n\n<b>  FLASH\n</b>\n  Asakawa, her eyes wide, finds herself inside the scene, reliving it \n  as if she had actually been there.  She watches as Shizuko receives \n  a sealed clay POT in both hands.  Shizuko regards the pot a moment \n  and then places it gently on the table before her.  She takes a \n  calligraphy STYLUS from the table, begins writing on a thin, \n  rectangular sheet of RICE PAPER.  The members of the press talk \n  excitedly, craning their necks for a better look.\n\n  Onstage, a JUDGE holds up the phrase written by Shizuko and the \n  folded sheet of paper taken from the sealed pot.  The phrase on both \n  sheets is identical.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJUDGE\t\t\n</b>\t\tMatch.\n\n  Cameras begin FLASHING excitedly.  Shizukos features melt into a soft \n  smile. \n\n  The experiment is performed again, and again the phrase written by \n  Shizuko corresponds to the sealed sheet of paper.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJUDGE\n</b>\t\tMatch.\n\n  Again and again, Shizuko unerringly demonstrates her power to see \n  the unseen.  Finally, a bearded REPORTER explodes from his chair, \n  begins striding angrily towards the stage.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tREPORTER\t\n</b>\t\tFaker!  This is nothing but trickery, \n\t\tand the lowest form of trickery at \n\t\tthat. \n\n  The reporter stops at the foot of the stage, points his finger \n  accusingly at Shizuko.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tREPORTER\t\n</b>\t\tWhat are you trying to pull, woman?\n\n  A SECOND REPORTER sitting in the front row also rises to his feet.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tREPORTER #2\t\n</b>\t\tThats right!  Professor Ikuma, \n\t\tyoure being fooled!\n\n  By now most of the press has risen from their chairs, pointing and \n  shouting angrily. Onstage, Shizuko backs away, eyes wide and \n  frightened.  She covers both ears, trying to block out the increasing \n  din.  Professor Ikuma holds her protectively by the shoulders.  The \n  first reporter is still shouting angrily, his voice rising above the \n  others.  Suddenly, a pained look crosses his face and he collapses to \n  the floor.  The crowd, and Asakawa as well, see that the reporters \n  face is contorted into a grotesque mask of fear.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tREPORTER #3\t\n</b>\t\tWhats happened?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tREPORTER #4\t\n</b>\t\tHes dead!\n\n\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tREPORTER #5\t\n</b>\t\t\t(to Shizuko) \n\t\tWitch!\n\n  Professor Ikuma begins leading Shizuko offstage.  They stop as someone \n  unseen steps up, blocking their passage.  Shizukos eyes widen, her \n  head shaking in disbelief.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSHIZUKO\n</b>\t\tSadako?  Was it you?\n\n  CUT to Ryuji on the beach.  He looks up excitedly.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI\t\t\n</b>\t\tSadako?!\n\n  He recalls the image from the video, the alien eye with the single \n  character SADA reflected in reverse. *\n\n\n  >* The majority of girls' names in Japanese end in either -mi (\"beauty\") \n  >or -ko (\"child\").  Thus, Sadako means \"Chaste child.\"  Sadako is, of \n  >course, the mysterious daughter of Shizuko and Professor Ikuma.\n\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI\n</b>\t\tSadako killed him?  She can kill \n\t\tjust with a thought?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tYAMAMURA\t\n</b>\t\tShes... a devil spawn.\n\n  CUT back to the demonstration hall.  Sadako, her face completely hidden \n  by her long hair, runs offstage... and heads directly for Asakawa.  \n  Asakawa instinctively raises her arm, and Sadako grasps it fiercely.  \n  All the nails on Sadako hand are stripped away; her fingers are raw, \n  bloody stumps.\n\n  CUT back to the beach.  Asakawa, still caught in the throes of the \n  vision, has begun to swoon.  Finally her legs give out and she crumples \n  to the beach.  Ryuji grabs hold of her supportively.  He glances down at \n  her wrist, sees an ugly, purple BRUISE already beginning to form.  \n\n  The bruise is in the shape of five long, spindly fingers.\n\n  Mr. Yamamura slowly rises to a sitting position, and together the three \n  watch the approach of ominous, dark STORM CLOUDS.\n\n<b>  INT. MR. HAYATSUS HOUSE  DUSK\n</b>\n  Asakawa is on the phone, her voice almost frantic.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tASAKAWA\n</b>\t\tThats right.

Thats why I \n\t\tneed -you- to find out where they are.  \n\t\tEven if the professors dead, Sadako \n\t\tshould still be in her forties.  Ill \n\t\texplain it all later, but right now \n\t\tjust hurry!\n\n  Asakawa slams the phone down.  PAN to show Ryuji slumped in one corner \n  of the room, his back to the wall.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI\t\n</b>\t\tSadakos probably already dead.

He is out of breath, and speaks rapidly.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tHAYATSU\t\n</b>\t\tIts no good.

Glasses \n  rattle wildly.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI\t\n</b>\t\tFine!  Ill try searching myself!\n\n  Ryuji stands and races past Mr. Hayatsu out into the rain.  Hayatsu \n  takes pursuit, calling after him.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tHAYATSU\t\n</b>\t\tMr. Takayama!?  Mr. Takayama...\n\n  Asakawa, left alone, stares down at the tatami mats.\n\n<b>  EXT.

A \n  length of ROPE is coiled over his left shoulder.  He runs towards a \n  RENTAL CAR, passing by Asakawa who stands at a PAYPHONE, receiver in \n  hand.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tYOICHI (O.S.) \n</b>\t\tHello?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tASAKAWA\t\n</b>\t\tYoichi?  Its mommy.

He shuts the DOOR \n  just short of a slam.  CUT to Asakawa hanging up the phone.  She half-\n  runs towards the rental car and enters the passenger side, staring \n  blankly into space.  Ryuji slides into the drivers seat, buckles his \n<b>  SEATBELT.  \n</b>\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI\t\t\n</b>\t\tWhat time was it when you first \n\t\twatched the video?\n\n  Asakawa glances at her watch.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tASAKAWA\t\n</b>\t\tSeven or eight minutes past \n\t\tseven.

COUNTRY ROAD  DAY\n</b>\n  The white rental car tears past the SIGN reading Izu Pacific Land.  \n  The car continues into the LOT, screeching around corners before \n  coming to an abrupt halt.  Asakawa, her face still oddly expressionless, \n  gets out of the passenger side.  Ryuji exits as well, the hint of a \n  shudder running through him as he regards the series of rental cabins.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI\t\t\n</b>\t\t-Here-.\n\n  CUT to Asakawa and Ryuji walking up the gravel PATH towards the rental \n  cabins.  Ryuji looks back over his shoulder as both he and Asakawa stop \n  before cabin B4.  The cabin is on STILTS, its underbelly fenced off by \n  wooden LATICEWORK.  Ryuji drops most of his supplies to the ground, but \n  keeps hold of the PICK.  He raises the pick over one shoulder and begins \n  smashing away at the latticework.  When he has cleared enough space for   \n  passage, he begins picking up supplies and tossing them hastily within.  \n  When finished, he holds a hand out for Asakawa.  The two enter the \n  earthen basement.\n\n\n<b>  UNDER COTTAGE B4 - DAY  \n</b>\n  Ryuji pulls a FLASHLIGHT out, flicks it on.  The BEAM arcs outwards, \n  illuminating what looks more like an old mine shaft than a modern \n  rental cottage.  The beam halts when it suddenly encounters an old \n  STONE WELL.  The well is badly chipped on one side, and sealed off \n  with a solid-looking stone LID.  Ryuji rushes quickly towards it.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI\n</b>\t\tI knew it!  The well.\n\n  He squats down beside the well, setting the flashlight on the \n  lid.  Asakawa sinks slowly down beside him.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tASAKAWA\n</b>\t\tThe well...\n\n  Ryuji reaches out and takes Asakawas hand.  He sets their enclasped \n  hands onto the lid, and together they begin lightly tracing the \n  surface of the lid with their free hands.  Asakawa closes her eyes in \n  concentration... and suddenly, as with the incident on the beach, \n  Asakawa finds herself drawn into Ryujis psychometric VISION.\n\n<b>  FLASH\n</b>\n  The picture is black and white, grainy like old film.  A YOUNG GIRL in \n  a WHITE GOWN walks slowly towards an open well. She places her hand on \n  the LIP of the well, peers curiously down.  \n\n<b>  FLASH\n</b>\n  Asakawa looks up, her eyes wide open.\n\n<b>  FLASH\n</b><b>  \n</b>  There is now a second person in the vision, an ELDERLY MAN in an old-\n  fashioned tweed SUIT standing behind the young girl.  He suddenly \n  produces some BLADED OBJECT, and strikes the girl savagely across the \n  back of the head.  \n\n  The girl falls forward. The man drops to the ground, grabbing the girl \n  behind the knees and hoisting her limp BODY over the lip and into the \n  well.  The body falls into its depths.\n\n  Panting heavily, the man leans forward and grasps the lip of the well \n  with both hands, looking down.  He flashes a guilty look in either \n  direction, checking that his crime has gone unnoticed, and as he does \n  so Asakawa realizes that she knows this face.  The image from the \n  videotape, like a face in the moon: it had been Sadako inside the well, \n  looking up to see this man staring back down at her.\n\n  This man whose name is Professor Ikuma Heihachiro.\n\n<b>  FLASH\n</b>\n<b>\t\t\t\tASAKAWA\n</b>\t\tHer own father!\n\n  The energy seems to drain out of Asakawa in a rush, and her body \n  crumbles.  Ryuji catches hold of her.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI\t\t\n</b>\t\tIt was Ikuma who put this lid on.  \n\t\tAnd Sadakos still inside.\n\n  Ryuji stands quickly, takes hold of the crowbar.  He inserts it under \n  the lid and begins trying to pry it off, face scrunched with effort.  \n  Asakawa digs her fingers in and lends her own strength as well. Slowly,\n  the lid begins to move.  Ryuji tosses the crowbar aside and the two \n  lean the combined weight of their bodies into it.  The lid slides off, \n  dropping to the earth with a dull THUD.  Ryuji sits to one side, winded \n  with effort, as Asakawa takes hold of the flashlight.  She shines it \n  down into the well, but it only seems to intensify the gloom. What \n  WATER she can see looks fetid and brackish.  Ryuji sees her expression \n  and begins removing his JACKET.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI\n</b>\t\tIll go.\n\n  He walks off, leaving Asakawa alone.\n\n  CUT to an overhead shot of the well.  A ROPE is fastened to one side, \n  and Ryuji has already begun lowering himself down.  His eyes wander \n  overthe grime-smeared WALLS, and with a shudder he begins to pick out \n  human FINGERNAILS.  Torn loose and spattered with blood, countless \n  fingernails line the sides of the well. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI\n</b> \t\tSadako was alive!  Shed tried to \n\t\tclimb her way out.\n\n  Ryujis face twists into a grimace as if momentarily experiencing \n  Sadakosterrible agony.  He waits a moment longer before edging his \n  way down the rope again, finally SPLASHING to rest at the bottom of \n  the well.  He holds his flashlight above the brackish water, calls up \n  to Asakawa.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI\n</b>\t\tLower the buckets!\n\n  Asakawa nods and lowers two plastic BUCKETS fastened to a rope.  Ryuji \n  grabs one and scoops up a bucketful of water, tugging on the rope when \n  finished.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI\n</b>\t\tTake it up!\n\n  Asakawa hoists the bucket up to the rim of the well.  She walks a small \n  distance and tosses the contents out onto the ground.  She happens to \n  glance through the wooden lattice to the outside, and with a start \n  realizes that the sun has already started to set.  A nervous glance at \n  her WATCH later and she is back at the well, lowering the empty bucket \n  to find another full one already awaiting her.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI\n</b>\t\tTake it up!\n\n  In the well, Ryuji glances at his watch.  He looks at it for a long \n  moment, the expression on his face saying Were not going to make it.  \n  Time passes as Asakawa pulls up bucketload after bucketload, her \n  strength beginning to fade.  She half-stumbles, glances up... and is \n  shocked to realize that NIGHT has fallen.\n\n  CUT to Asakawa slowly pulling up yet another bucket, her strength \n  almost gone.  She looks at her watch and sees that it is now past \n  6:00.  She calls frantically down to Ryuji.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tASAKAWA\n</b>\t\tIts already six!\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI\n</b>\t\t\t(explosively) \n\t\tI know!  Hurry up and TAKE IT UP!!\n\n  The bucket slowly jerks into motion.  Asakawa pulls it up to the rim \n  of the well, holds it unsteadily.  She takes one faltering step and \n  falls, spilling the buckets contents onto the ground.  \n\n  CUT to Ryuji in the well, standing ready with another bucketful.\n\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI\n</b> \t\tTake it up!\n\n  Nothing happens.  \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI\n</b>\t\tAsakawa!\n\n  The bucket begins moving, even slower than before.  CUT to Asakawa, \n  her body trembling with effort. By now its all she can do to simply \n  keep her body moving.  She glances behind her, sees through the wooden \n  lattice that it is now pitch black.  A look of resignation crosses her \n  face and she releases her hold on the bucket, her body crumpling and \n  falling in on itself. \n<b>  \n</b>  CUT to the bucket splashing back into the well, narrowly missing \n  Ryuji.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI\t\n</b>\t\t\t(fuming) \n\t\tWhat the hell are you doing?  Trying \n\t\tto get me killed?\n\n  CUT back to Asakawa, her face dead.  Ryuji calls out from the well.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI (O.S.) \n</b>\t\tHey!\n\n  Asakawa falls backward onto the ground, arms splayed. CUT to the rim \n  of the well.  Ryuji pulls himself up over the rim, catches sight of \n  Asakawa.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI\n</b>\t\tAsakawa!\n\n  She lifts her head up but says nothing as Ryuji walks over to her.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI\n</b>\t\tWell change.  Youre in no condition \n\t\tto keep this up.\n\n  Asakawa suddenly springs into life.  Her voice is frantic, fearful.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tASAKAWA:\t\n</b>\t\tNo!\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI\n</b>\t\tWho do you expect to pull up these \n\t\tbuckets, then?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tASAKAWA\n</b>\t\tBut, we dont even know if its doing \n\t\tany good...\n\n  Ryuji strides forward and slaps Asakawa painfully across the cheek.  \n  He begins shaking her roughly for good measure.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI\n</b>\t\tAnd what about Yoichi, huh?  Is his\n\t\tmother not coming to pick him up \n\t\tafter all?\n\n  He releases his hold on her.  The two stare at each other a long time, \n  saying nothing.\n<b> \n</b>  CUT to an overhead shot of Asakawa being lowered into the well. CUT \n  now to Asakawa inside the well, her face and clothes covered with \n  grime, body simultaneously limp with exhaustion and tense with fright.  \n  Unable to resist the impulse, Asakawa slowly looks over her shoulder \n  and down into the well.  The dankness, the claustrophobia seeps in \n  and she draws in her breath in the first signs of panic.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI\n</b>\t\tDont look down!\n\n  She returns her gaze, cranes her neck upward.  CUT to Ryuji leaning \n  over the rim of the well, peering down at her.  For an instant, \n  everything becomes monochrome. Its not Ryuji looking down at her at \n  all; its Professor Ikuma, checking to see if shes still alive or \n  if the blow to the back of her head has finished her off.  CUT to \n  Asakawa, her eyes wide with fright.\n\n  Asakawa comes to rest at the bottom of the well.  A FLASHLIGHT hangs \n  from another rope, but its beam has almost no effect on the darkness.  \n  Asakawa crouches forward, hands moving searchingly through the water.  \n  She calls out pleadingly.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tASAKAWA\n</b>\t\tWhere are you?  Please, come out.\n\n  Asakawa straightens, unties herself from the rope.  A full bucket \n  already awaits.  She tugs on the rope and Ryuji pulls it up.  \n\n  She scoops up a second bucket, but something stops her from sending \n  it up.  Instead, she begins running her arms through the water again, \n  her voice close to tears.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tASAKAWA\n</b>\t\tPlease.  Where are you?\n\n  Asakawa continues her blind fumbling, which sends up little splashes \n  of stagnant water.  With a start, she realizes that her fingers have \n  caught something.  Seaweed?  Asakawa draws her hands close for a \n  better look... and sees that is HAIR.  A thick clump of long, black \n  hair.\n\n  Suddenly a pale, thin ARM shoots out from beneath the water, catching \n  Asakawa just below the wrist.  Asakawas ears are filled with a SOUND \n  like moaning as something slowly rises from its watery slumber.  It \n  is a GIRL, her face completely hidden by long, black hair.  CUT to a \n  shot of Asakawas face.  Far from being frightened, her features are \n  oddly placid.  She regards the fearsome thing before her with an \n  almost tender look.  Asakawa reaches out, lightly strokes that long \n  hair.  \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tASAKAWA\n</b>\t\tIts you...\n\n  She strokes the hair again, and abruptly it peels right off the head \n  with a loud SQUELCH. Revealed is not a face at all but a SKULL.  Its \n  sockets are at first menacingly empty, but then begin to ooze the \n  green SLUDGE it has pulled up from the bottom of the well.  Like a \n  mother comforting a frightened child, Asakawa pulls the skeletal \n  remains to her breast, strokes the bony head comfortingly. Her eyes \n  begin to glaze.\n\n  CUT to Ryuji racing up to the rim of the well, leaning down intently.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI\n</b>\t\tHey!  Asakawa!  Its already 10 \n\t\tminutes past seven!  We did it!\n\n  Down in the well, Asakawa continues staring blankly ahead.  Her body \n  suddenly falls forward, limp.\n\n<b>  EXT. OUTSIDE COTTAGE B4  NIGHT\n</b>\n  Three POLICE CARS are parked outside the rental cottages, crimson \n  headlights flashing.   A few COPS walk by, two of them carrying \n  something off in white PLASTIC BAGS.  CUT to Ryuji and Asakawa \n  sitting on the curb.  Asakawa is staring off at something, a BLANKET \n  draped over her shoulder.  \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tASAKAWA\t\n</b>\t\tWhy would Ikuma have killed her?  \n\t\tHis own daughter...\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI\n</b>\t\tMaybe she wasnt his daughter at all.  \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tASAKAWA\n</b>\t\tWhat?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI\n</b>\t\tMaybe her father... wasnt even human.\n\n  The two exchange glances.  Ryujis gaze falls to Asakawas WRIST, \n  which he suddenly takes and holds close to his face.  The ugly \n  bruise where Sadako had grabbed her has disappeared.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI\n</b>\t\tIts gone...  \n\n  He shakes his head, clearing his analytical mind of their ordeal.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI\n</b>\t\tEnough, already.  Its over.  Cmon.  \n\t\tIll take you home.\n\n  Ryuji stands, pulls Asakawa to her feet.\n\n<b>  EXT. OUTSIDE ASKAWAS APARTMENT - NIGHT  \n</b>\n  Ryujis white CAR pulls up into the parking lot.  He and Asakawa \n  get out, regard each other from opposite sides of the car. There is \n  a long moment where neither of them says anything.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI\t\n</b>\t\tGet some rest.  \n\n  He flashes her the slightest of grins. \n\n\t\t\t\tRYUJI (contd)\n\t\tI still have a thesis to finish. \n\n  CUT to a shot of Ryuji and Asakawa, the car creating an almost \n  metaphoric distance between them. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tASAKAWA\n</b>\t\t...thank you.\n\n  Ryuji nods silently by way of reply.  He gets into his car and \n  drives off.  Asakawa watches him go, and then walks towards the \n  entrance of her apartment.\n\n<b>  INT.

RYUJIS APARTMENT  MORNING\n</b>\n  Ryuji sits busily scribbling into a NOTEBOOK.  He stops writing a \n  moment to regard his notes while taking a sip of COFFEE.  He \n  glances over at his BLACKBOARD for confirmation when a small scowl \n  crosses his brow.  Its gone a moment later as he chuckles wryly \n  to himself.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI\n</b>\t\tThat girl...\n\n  Ryuji stands, walks over to the blackboard.  He fixes Mais little \n  prank with a single chalk stroke. \n\n<b>  EXT. ASAKAWAS APARTMENT  VERANDA  MORNING\n</b>\n  Asakawa emerges, taking in the dawn.  At first her face is calm and \n  tranquil... but her features change as the sun almost noticeably \n  darkens and a WIND begins to kick up her hair.  She now looks very \n  anxious.\n\n  Caption-- September 21st.  Tuesday.\n\n\n  NOTE: This next scene is entirely visual.

RYUJIS APARTMENT  MORNING\n</b>\n  Ryuji is busy scribbling away at his notes again.  His hand suddenly \n  ceases, eyes dancing worriedly as he hears a faint...\n\n  No.\n\n  Breath rattling fearfully in his throat, Ryuji spins around to face \n  the TELEVISION SET.  He gets out of his seat for a better look, \n  falling to his knees on the tatami. \n\n  The image that fills the screen is the last scene from the videotape; \n  the shot of the well.  \n\n  The SOUND from before comes louder now, more insistent, a metallic \n  screeching that both repulses and beckons him closer. Ryuji crawls on \n  all fours towards the SCREEN, stares at its unchanging image with \n  terrible foreboding.\n\n  There is a flash of MOTION as something shoots out of the well. A \n  hand. First one, and then another, as Sadako, still in her grimy white \n  dress, face hidden beneath long, oily strands of hair, begins slowly \n  pulling herself out.  The television screen jumps unsteadily, fills \n  with static as if barely able to contain her image.  \n\n  CUT back and forth between Ryuji, who is beginning to visibly panic, \n  and the television, which shows Sadako lurching ever closer.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI\n</b>\t\t\t(almost frantic) \n\t\tWhy?!\n\n  The TELEPHONE rings, and Ryuji spins round towards it, breath catching \n  in his throat.  He looks at the phone, over his shoulder at the \n  television, back to the phone.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI\n</b>\t\tThats it!  Asakawa...\n\n  Ryuji scrambles wildly towards the phone.  He takes the receiver but \n  is unable to do more than clutch it fearfully as his gaze is drawn \n  inexorably back to the television.  Sadakos shrouded face has filled \n  the entire screen... and then, television popping and crackling, she \n  jerks forward and emerges from the television onto the floor of \n  Ryujis apartment.  Ryuji backs away, screaming in terror.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI\n</b>\t\tAaargh!\n\n  Sadako lies prone, collapsed, hair splayed out like a drowned corpse.  \n  Only her FINGERS are active, crawling, feeling.  The TIPS of her \n  fingers are little more than bloodied stumps, not a single fingernail \n  on them.  She uses the strength in those fingers to pull herself \n  forward, coming jerkily to her feet.  The joints of her body twist \n  unnaturally, more insect-like than human.\n\n  Ryuji flings the phone aside and begins scrambling about the apartment \n  as if looking for cover.  The strength has already begun to fade from \n  his body, however, and his movements are clumsy, exaggerated. He falls \n  to the floor, panting heavily.  \n\n  Sadako turns to regard him, and for just an instant we can see beneath \n  her impenetrable shroud of hair; a single EYE burns with manic, \n  unbridled hatred.   \n\n  Its gaze meets Ryujis, and his face twists into a grimace as he \n  SCREAMS loudly.\n\n<b>  FLASH\n</b>\n<b>  EXT.

{"input": "Why does Socrates ultimately decide it is unjust to escape?", "context": "This etext was prepared by Sue Asscher <asschers@aia.net.au>\n\n\n\n\n\nCRITO\n\nby Plato\n\n\n\n\nTranslated by Benjamin Jowett\n\n\n\n\nINTRODUCTION.\n\nThe Crito seems intended to exhibit the character of Socrates in one light\nonly, not as the philosopher, fulfilling a divine mission and trusting in\nthe will of heaven, but simply as the good citizen, who having been\nunjustly condemned is willing to give up his life in obedience to the laws\nof the state...\n\nThe days of Socrates are drawing to a close; the fatal ship has been seen\noff Sunium, as he is informed by his aged friend and contemporary Crito,\nwho visits him before the dawn has broken; he himself has been warned in a\ndream that on the third day he must depart.  Time is precious, and Crito\nhas come early in order to gain his consent to a plan of escape.  This can\nbe easily accomplished by his friends, who will incur no danger in making\nthe attempt to save him, but will be disgraced for ever if they allow him\nto perish.  He should think of his duty to his children, and not play into\nthe hands of his enemies.  Money is already provided by Crito as well as by\nSimmias and others, and he will have no difficulty in finding friends in\nThessaly and other places.\n\nSocrates is afraid that Crito is but pressing upon him the opinions of the\nmany:  whereas, all his life long he has followed the dictates of reason\nonly and the opinion of the one wise or skilled man.  There was a time when\nCrito himself had allowed the propriety of this.  And although some one\nwill say 'the many can kill us,' that makes no difference; but a good life,\nin other words, a just and honourable life, is alone to be valued.  All\nconsiderations of loss of reputation or injury to his children should be\ndismissed:  the only question is whether he would be right in attempting to\nescape.  Crito, who is a disinterested person not having the fear of death\nbefore his eyes, shall answer this for him.  Before he was condemned they\nhad often held discussions, in which they agreed that no man should either\ndo evil, or return evil for evil, or betray the right.  Are these\nprinciples to be altered because the circumstances of Socrates are altered?\nCrito admits that they remain the same.  Then is his escape consistent with\nthe maintenance of them?  To this Crito is unable or unwilling to reply.\n\nSocrates proceeds:--Suppose the Laws of Athens to come and remonstrate with\nhim:  they will ask 'Why does he seek to overturn them?' and if he replies,\n'they have injured him,' will not the Laws answer, 'Yes, but was that the\nagreement?  Has he any objection to make to them which would justify him in\noverturning them?  Was he not brought into the world and educated by their\nhelp, and are they not his parents?  He might have left Athens and gone\nwhere he pleased, but he has lived there for seventy years more constantly\nthan any other citizen.'  Thus he has clearly shown that he acknowledged\nthe agreement, which he cannot now break without dishonour to himself and\ndanger to his friends.  Even in the course of the trial he might have\nproposed exile as the penalty, but then he declared that he preferred death\nto exile.  And whither will he direct his footsteps?  In any well-ordered\nstate the Laws will consider him as an enemy.  Possibly in a land of\nmisrule like Thessaly he may be welcomed at first, and the unseemly\nnarrative of his escape will be regarded by the inhabitants as an amusing\ntale.  But if he offends them he will have to learn another sort of lesson.\nWill he continue to give lectures in virtue?  That would hardly be decent.\nAnd how will his children be the gainers if he takes them into Thessaly,\nand deprives them of Athenian citizenship?  Or if he leaves them behind,\ndoes he expect that they will be better taken care of by his friends\nbecause he is in Thessaly?  Will not true friends care for them equally\nwhether he is alive or dead?\n\nFinally, they exhort him to think of justice first, and of life and\nchildren afterwards.  He may now depart in peace and innocence, a sufferer\nand not a doer of evil.  But if he breaks agreements, and returns evil for\nevil, they will be angry with him while he lives; and their brethren the\nLaws of the world below will receive him as an enemy.  Such is the mystic\nvoice which is always murmuring in his ears.\n\nThat Socrates was not a good citizen was a charge made against him during\nhis lifetime, which has been often repeated in later ages.  The crimes of\nAlcibiades, Critias, and Charmides, who had been his pupils, were still\nrecent in the memory of the now restored democracy.  The fact that he had\nbeen neutral in the death-struggle of Athens was not likely to conciliate\npopular good-will.  Plato, writing probably in the next generation,\nundertakes the defence of his friend and master in this particular, not to\nthe Athenians of his day, but to posterity and the world at large.\n\nWhether such an incident ever really occurred as the visit of Crito and the\nproposal of escape is uncertain:  Plato could easily have invented far more\nthan that (Phaedr.); and in the selection of Crito, the aged friend, as the\nfittest person to make the proposal to Socrates, we seem to recognize the\nhand of the artist.  Whether any one who has been subjected by the laws of\nhis country to an unjust judgment is right in attempting to escape, is a\nthesis about which casuists might disagree.  Shelley (Prose Works) is of\nopinion that Socrates 'did well to die,' but not for the 'sophistical'\nreasons which Plato has put into his mouth.  And there would be no\ndifficulty in arguing that Socrates should have lived and preferred to a\nglorious death the good which he might still be able to perform.  'A\nrhetorician would have had much to say upon that point.'  It may be\nobserved however that Plato never intended to answer the question of\ncasuistry, but only to exhibit the ideal of patient virtue which refuses to\ndo the least evil in order to avoid the greatest, and to show his master\nmaintaining in death the opinions which he had professed in his life.  Not\n'the world,' but the 'one wise man,' is still the paradox of Socrates in\nhis last hours.  He must be guided by reason, although her conclusions may\nbe fatal to him.  The remarkable sentiment that the wicked can do neither\ngood nor evil is true, if taken in the sense, which he means, of moral\nevil; in his own words, 'they cannot make a man wise or foolish.'\n\nThis little dialogue is a perfect piece of dialectic, in which granting the\n'common principle,' there is no escaping from the conclusion.  It is\nanticipated at the beginning by the dream of Socrates and the parody of\nHomer.  The personification of the Laws, and of their brethren the Laws in\nthe world below, is one of the noblest and boldest figures of speech which\noccur in Plato.\n\n\nCRITO\n\nby\n\nPlato\n\nTranslated by Benjamin Jowett\n\n\nPERSONS OF THE DIALOGUE:  Socrates, Crito.\n\nSCENE:  The Prison of Socrates.\n\n\nSOCRATES:  Why have you come at this hour, Crito? it must be quite early.\n\nCRITO:  Yes, certainly.\n\nSOCRATES:  What is the exact time?\n\nCRITO:  The dawn is breaking.\n\nSOCRATES:  I wonder that the keeper of the prison would let you in.\n\nCRITO:  He knows me because I often come, Socrates; moreover.  I have done\nhim a kindness.\n\nSOCRATES:  And are you only just arrived?\n\nCRITO:  No, I came some time ago.\n\nSOCRATES:  Then why did you sit and say nothing, instead of at once\nawakening me?\n\nCRITO:  I should not have liked myself, Socrates, to be in such great\ntrouble and unrest as you are--indeed I should not:  I have been watching\nwith amazement your peaceful slumbers; and for that reason I did not awake\nyou, because I wished to minimize the pain.  I have always thought you to\nbe of a happy disposition; but never did I see anything like the easy,\ntranquil manner in which you bear this calamity.\n\nSOCRATES:  Why, Crito, when a man has reached my age he ought not to be\nrepining at the approach of death.\n\nCRITO:  And yet other old men find themselves in similar misfortunes, and\nage does not prevent them from repining.\n\nSOCRATES:  That is true.  But you have not told me why you come at this\nearly hour.\n\nCRITO:  I come to bring you a message which is sad and painful; not, as I\nbelieve, to yourself, but to all of us who are your friends, and saddest of\nall to me.\n\nSOCRATES:  What?  Has the ship come from Delos, on the arrival of which I\nam to die?\n\nCRITO:  No, the ship has not actually arrived, but she will probably be\nhere to-day, as persons who have come from Sunium tell me that they have\nleft her there; and therefore to-morrow, Socrates, will be the last day of\nyour life.\n\nSOCRATES:  Very well, Crito; if such is the will of God, I am willing; but\nmy belief is that there will be a delay of a day.\n\nCRITO:  Why do you think so?\n\nSOCRATES:  I will tell you.  I am to die on the day after the arrival of\nthe ship?\n\nCRITO:  Yes; that is what the authorities say.\n\nSOCRATES:  But I do not think that the ship will be here until to-morrow;\nthis I infer from a vision which I had last night, or rather only just now,\nwhen you fortunately allowed me to sleep.\n\nCRITO:  And what was the nature of the vision?\n\nSOCRATES:  There appeared to me the likeness of a woman, fair and comely,\nclothed in bright raiment, who called to me and said:  O Socrates,\n\n'The third day hence to fertile Phthia shalt thou go.'  (Homer, Il.)\n\nCRITO:  What a singular dream, Socrates!\n\nSOCRATES:  There can be no doubt about the meaning, Crito, I think.\n\nCRITO:  Yes; the meaning is only too clear.  But, oh! my beloved Socrates,\nlet me entreat you once more to take my advice and escape.  For if you die\nI shall not only lose a friend who can never be replaced, but there is\nanother evil:  people who do not know you and me will believe that I might\nhave saved you if I had been willing to give money, but that I did not\ncare.  Now, can there be a worse disgrace than this--that I should be\nthought to value money more than the life of a friend?  For the many will\nnot be persuaded that I wanted you to escape, and that you refused.\n\nSOCRATES:  But why, my dear Crito, should we care about the opinion of the\nmany?  Good men, and they are the only persons who are worth considering,\nwill think of these things truly as they occurred.\n\nCRITO:  But you see, Socrates, that the opinion of the many must be\nregarded, for what is now happening shows that they can do the greatest\nevil to any one who has lost their good opinion.\n\nSOCRATES:  I only wish it were so, Crito; and that the many could do the\ngreatest evil; for then they would also be able to do the greatest good--\nand what a fine thing this would be!  But in reality they can do neither;\nfor they cannot make a man either wise or foolish; and whatever they do is\nthe result of chance.\n\nCRITO:  Well, I will not dispute with you; but please to tell me, Socrates,\nwhether you are not acting out of regard to me and your other friends:  are\nyou not afraid that if you escape from prison we may get into trouble with\nthe informers for having stolen you away, and lose either the whole or a\ngreat part of our property; or that even a worse evil may happen to us?\nNow, if you fear on our account, be at ease; for in order to save you, we\nought surely to run this, or even a greater risk; be persuaded, then, and\ndo as I say.\n\nSOCRATES:  Yes, Crito, that is one fear which you mention, but by no means\nthe only one.\n\nCRITO:  Fear not--there are persons who are willing to get you out of\nprison at no great cost; and as for the informers they are far from being\nexorbitant in their demands--a little money will satisfy them.  My means,\nwhich are certainly ample, are at your service, and if you have a scruple\nabout spending all mine, here are strangers who will give you the use of\ntheirs; and one of them, Simmias the Theban, has brought a large sum of\nmoney for this very purpose; and Cebes and many others are prepared to\nspend their money in helping you to escape.  I say, therefore, do not\nhesitate on our account, and do not say, as you did in the court (compare\nApol.), that you will have a difficulty in knowing what to do with yourself\nanywhere else.  For men will love you in other places to which you may go,\nand not in Athens only; there are friends of mine in Thessaly, if you like\nto go to them, who will value and protect you, and no Thessalian will give\nyou any trouble.  Nor can I think that you are at all justified, Socrates,\nin betraying your own life when you might be saved; in acting thus you are\nplaying into the hands of your enemies, who are hurrying on your\ndestruction.  And further I should say that you are deserting your own\nchildren; for you might bring them up and educate them; instead of which\nyou go away and leave them, and they will have to take their chance; and if\nthey do not meet with the usual fate of orphans, there will be small thanks\nto you.  No man should bring children into the world who is unwilling to\npersevere to the end in their nurture and education.  But you appear to be\nchoosing the easier part, not the better and manlier, which would have been\nmore becoming in one who professes to care for virtue in all his actions,\nlike yourself.  And indeed, I am ashamed not only of you, but of us who are\nyour friends, when I reflect that the whole business will be attributed\nentirely to our want of courage.  The trial need never have come on, or\nmight have been managed differently; and this last act, or crowning folly,\nwill seem to have occurred through our negligence and cowardice, who might\nhave saved you, if we had been good for anything; and you might have saved\nyourself, for there was no difficulty at all.  See now, Socrates, how sad\nand discreditable are the consequences, both to us and you.  Make up your\nmind then, or rather have your mind already made up, for the time of\ndeliberation is over, and there is only one thing to be done, which must be\ndone this very night, and if we delay at all will be no longer practicable\nor possible; I beseech you therefore, Socrates, be persuaded by me, and do\nas I say.\n\nSOCRATES:  Dear Crito, your zeal is invaluable, if a right one; but if\nwrong, the greater the zeal the greater the danger; and therefore we ought\nto consider whether I shall or shall not do as you say.  For I am and\nalways have been one of those natures who must be guided by reason,\nwhatever the reason may be which upon reflection appears to me to be the\nbest; and now that this chance has befallen me, I cannot repudiate my own\nwords:  the principles which I have hitherto honoured and revered I still\nhonour, and unless we can at once find other and better principles, I am\ncertain not to agree with you; no, not even if the power of the multitude\ncould inflict many more imprisonments, confiscations, deaths, frightening\nus like children with hobgoblin terrors (compare Apol.).  What will be the\nfairest way of considering the question?  Shall I return to your old\nargument about the opinions of men?--we were saying that some of them are\nto be regarded, and others not.  Now were we right in maintaining this\nbefore I was condemned?  And has the argument which was once good now\nproved to be talk for the sake of talking--mere childish nonsense?  That is\nwhat I want to consider with your help, Crito:--whether, under my present\ncircumstances, the argument appears to be in any way different or not; and\nis to be allowed by me or disallowed.  That argument, which, as I believe,\nis maintained by many persons of authority, was to the effect, as I was\nsaying, that the opinions of some men are to be regarded, and of other men\nnot to be regarded.  Now you, Crito, are not going to die to-morrow--at\nleast, there is no human probability of this, and therefore you are\ndisinterested and not liable to be deceived by the circumstances in which\nyou are placed.  Tell me then, whether I am right in saying that some\nopinions, and the opinions of some men only, are to be valued, and that\nother opinions, and the opinions of other men, are not to be valued.  I ask\nyou whether I was right in maintaining this?\n\nCRITO:  Certainly.\n\nSOCRATES:  The good are to be regarded, and not the bad?\n\nCRITO:  Yes.\n\nSOCRATES:  And the opinions of the wise are good, and the opinions of the\nunwise are evil?\n\nCRITO:  Certainly.\n\nSOCRATES:  And what was said about another matter?  Is the pupil who\ndevotes himself to the practice of gymnastics supposed to attend to the\npraise and blame and opinion of every man, or of one man only--his\nphysician or trainer, whoever he may be?\n\nCRITO:  Of one man only.\n\nSOCRATES:  And he ought to fear the censure and welcome the praise of that\none only, and not of the many?\n\nCRITO:  Clearly so.\n\nSOCRATES:  And he ought to act and train, and eat and drink in the way\nwhich seems good to his single master who has understanding, rather than\naccording to the opinion of all other men put together?\n\nCRITO:  True.\n\nSOCRATES:  And if he disobeys and disregards the opinion and approval of\nthe one, and regards the opinion of the many who have no understanding,\nwill he not suffer evil?\n\nCRITO:  Certainly he will.\n\nSOCRATES:  And what will the evil be, whither tending and what affecting,\nin the disobedient person?\n\nCRITO:  Clearly, affecting the body; that is what is destroyed by the evil.\n\nSOCRATES:  Very good; and is not this true, Crito, of other things which we\nneed not separately enumerate?  In questions of just and unjust, fair and\nfoul, good and evil, which are the subjects of our present consultation,\nought we to follow the opinion of the many and to fear them; or the opinion\nof the one man who has understanding? ought we not to fear and reverence\nhim more than all the rest of the world:  and if we desert him shall we not\ndestroy and injure that principle in us which may be assumed to be improved\nby justice and deteriorated by injustice;--there is such a principle?\n\nCRITO:  Certainly there is, Socrates.\n\nSOCRATES:  Take a parallel instance:--if, acting under the advice of those\nwho have no understanding, we destroy that which is improved by health and\nis deteriorated by disease, would life be worth having?  And that which has\nbeen destroyed is--the body?\n\nCRITO:  Yes.\n\nSOCRATES:  Could we live, having an evil and corrupted body?\n\nCRITO:  Certainly not.\n\nSOCRATES:  And will life be worth having, if that higher part of man be\ndestroyed, which is improved by justice and depraved by injustice?  Do we\nsuppose that principle, whatever it may be in man, which has to do with\njustice and injustice, to be inferior to the body?\n\nCRITO:  Certainly not.\n\nSOCRATES:  More honourable than the body?\n\nCRITO:  Far more.\n\nSOCRATES:  Then, my friend, we must not regard what the many say of us:\nbut what he, the one man who has understanding of just and unjust, will\nsay, and what the truth will say.  And therefore you begin in error when\nyou advise that we should regard the opinion of the many about just and\nunjust, good and evil, honorable and dishonorable.--'Well,' some one will\nsay, 'but the many can kill us.'\n\nCRITO:  Yes, Socrates; that will clearly be the answer.\n\nSOCRATES:  And it is true; but still I find with surprise that the old\nargument is unshaken as ever.  And I should like to know whether I may say\nthe same of another proposition--that not life, but a good life, is to be\nchiefly valued?\n\nCRITO:  Yes, that also remains unshaken.\n\nSOCRATES:  And a good life is equivalent to a just and honorable one--that\nholds also?\n\nCRITO:  Yes, it does.\n\nSOCRATES:  From these premisses I proceed to argue the question whether I\nought or ought not to try and escape without the consent of the Athenians:\nand if I am clearly right in escaping, then I will make the attempt; but if\nnot, I will abstain.  The other considerations which you mention, of money\nand loss of character and the duty of educating one's children, are, I\nfear, only the doctrines of the multitude, who would be as ready to restore\npeople to life, if they were able, as they are to put them to death--and\nwith as little reason.  But now, since the argument has thus far prevailed,\nthe only question which remains to be considered is, whether we shall do\nrightly either in escaping or in suffering others to aid in our escape and\npaying them in money and thanks, or whether in reality we shall not do\nrightly; and if the latter, then death or any other calamity which may\nensue on my remaining here must not be allowed to enter into the\ncalculation.\n\nCRITO:  I think that you are right, Socrates; how then shall we proceed?\n\nSOCRATES:  Let us consider the matter together, and do you either refute me\nif you can, and I will be convinced; or else cease, my dear friend, from\nrepeating to me that I ought to escape against the wishes of the Athenians:\nfor I highly value your attempts to persuade me to do so, but I may not be\npersuaded against my own better judgment.  And now please to consider my\nfirst position, and try how you can best answer me.\n\nCRITO:  I will.\n\nSOCRATES:  Are we to say that we are never intentionally to do wrong, or\nthat in one way we ought and in another way we ought not to do wrong, or is\ndoing wrong always evil and dishonorable, as I was just now saying, and as\nhas been already acknowledged by us?  Are all our former admissions which\nwere made within a few days to be thrown away?  And have we, at our age,\nbeen earnestly discoursing with one another all our life long only to\ndiscover that we are no better than children?  Or, in spite of the opinion\nof the many, and in spite of consequences whether better or worse, shall we\ninsist on the truth of what was then said, that injustice is always an evil\nand dishonour to him who acts unjustly?  Shall we say so or not?\n\nCRITO:  Yes.\n\nSOCRATES:  Then we must do no wrong?\n\nCRITO:  Certainly not.\n\nSOCRATES:  Nor when injured injure in return, as the many imagine; for we\nmust injure no one at all?  (E.g. compare Rep.)\n\nCRITO:  Clearly not.\n\nSOCRATES:  Again, Crito, may we do evil?\n\nCRITO:  Surely not, Socrates.\n\nSOCRATES:  And what of doing evil in return for evil, which is the morality\nof the many--is that just or not?\n\nCRITO:  Not just.\n\nSOCRATES:  For doing evil to another is the same as injuring him?\n\nCRITO:  Very true.\n\nSOCRATES:  Then we ought not to retaliate or render evil for evil to any\none, whatever evil we may have suffered from him.  But I would have you\nconsider, Crito, whether you really mean what you are saying.  For this\nopinion has never been held, and never will be held, by any considerable\nnumber of persons; and those who are agreed and those who are not agreed\nupon this point have no common ground, and can only despise one another\nwhen they see how widely they differ.  Tell me, then, whether you agree\nwith and assent to my first principle, that neither injury nor retaliation\nnor warding off evil by evil is ever right.  And shall that be the premiss\nof our argument?  Or do you decline and dissent from this?  For so I have\never thought, and continue to think; but, if you are of another opinion,\nlet me hear what you have to say.  If, however, you remain of the same mind\nas formerly, I will proceed to the next step.\n\nCRITO:  You may proceed, for I have not changed my mind.\n\nSOCRATES:  Then I will go on to the next point, which may be put in the\nform of a question:--Ought a man to do what he admits to be right, or ought\nhe to betray the right?\n\nCRITO:  He ought to do what he thinks right.\n\nSOCRATES:  But if this is true, what is the application?  In leaving the\nprison against the will of the Athenians, do I wrong any? or rather do I\nnot wrong those whom I ought least to wrong?  Do I not desert the\nprinciples which were acknowledged by us to be just--what do you say?\n\nCRITO:  I cannot tell, Socrates, for I do not know.\n\nSOCRATES:  Then consider the matter in this way:--Imagine that I am about\nto play truant (you may call the proceeding by any name which you like),\nand the laws and the government come and interrogate me:  'Tell us,\nSocrates,' they say; 'what are you about? are you not going by an act of\nyours to overturn us--the laws, and the whole state, as far as in you lies?\nDo you imagine that a state can subsist and not be overthrown, in which the\ndecisions of law have no power, but are set aside and trampled upon by\nindividuals?'  What will be our answer, Crito, to these and the like words?\nAny one, and especially a rhetorician, will have a good deal to say on\nbehalf of the law which requires a sentence to be carried out.  He will\nargue that this law should not be set aside; and shall we reply, 'Yes; but\nthe state has injured us and given an unjust sentence.'  Suppose I say\nthat?\n\nCRITO:  Very good, Socrates.\n\nSOCRATES:  'And was that our agreement with you?' the law would answer; 'or\nwere you to abide by the sentence of the state?'  And if I were to express\nmy astonishment at their words, the law would probably add:  'Answer,\nSocrates, instead of opening your eyes--you are in the habit of asking and\nanswering questions.  Tell us,--What complaint have you to make against us\nwhich justifies you in attempting to destroy us and the state?  In the\nfirst place did we not bring you into existence?  Your father married your\nmother by our aid and begat you.  Say whether you have any objection to\nurge against those of us who regulate marriage?'  None, I should reply.\n'Or against those of us who after birth regulate the nurture and education\nof children, in which you also were trained?  Were not the laws, which have\nthe charge of education, right in commanding your father to train you in\nmusic and gymnastic?'  Right, I should reply.  'Well then, since you were\nbrought into the world and nurtured and educated by us, can you deny in the\nfirst place that you are our child and slave, as your fathers were before\nyou?  And if this is true you are not on equal terms with us; nor can you\nthink that you have a right to do to us what we are doing to you.  Would\nyou have any right to strike or revile or do any other evil to your father\nor your master, if you had one, because you have been struck or reviled by\nhim, or received some other evil at his hands?--you would not say this?\nAnd because we think right to destroy you, do you think that you have any\nright to destroy us in return, and your country as far as in you lies?\nWill you, O professor of true virtue, pretend that you are justified in\nthis?  Has a philosopher like you failed to discover that our country is\nmore to be valued and higher and holier far than mother or father or any\nancestor, and more to be regarded in the eyes of the gods and of men of\nunderstanding? also to be soothed, and gently and reverently entreated when\nangry, even more than a father, and either to be persuaded, or if not\npersuaded, to be obeyed?  And when we are punished by her, whether with\nimprisonment or stripes, the punishment is to be endured in silence; and if\nshe lead us to wounds or death in battle, thither we follow as is right;\nneither may any one yield or retreat or leave his rank, but whether in\nbattle or in a court of law, or in any other place, he must do what his\ncity and his country order him; or he must change their view of what is\njust:  and if he may do no violence to his father or mother, much less may\nhe do violence to his country.'  What answer shall we make to this, Crito?\nDo the laws speak truly, or do they not?\n\nCRITO:  I think that they do.\n\nSOCRATES:  Then the laws will say:  'Consider, Socrates, if we are speaking\ntruly that in your present attempt you are going to do us an injury.  For,\nhaving brought you into the world, and nurtured and educated you, and given\nyou and every other citizen a share in every good which we had to give, we\nfurther proclaim to any Athenian by the liberty which we allow him, that if\nhe does not like us when he has become of age and has seen the ways of the\ncity, and made our acquaintance, he may go where he pleases and take his\ngoods with him.  None of us laws will forbid him or interfere with him.\nAny one who does not like us and the city, and who wants to emigrate to a\ncolony or to any other city, may go where he likes, retaining his property.\nBut he who has experience of the manner in which we order justice and\nadminister the state, and still remains, has entered into an implied\ncontract that he will do as we command him.  And he who disobeys us is, as\nwe maintain, thrice wrong:  first, because in disobeying us he is\ndisobeying his parents; secondly, because we are the authors of his\neducation; thirdly, because he has made an agreement with us that he will\nduly obey our commands; and he neither obeys them nor convinces us that our\ncommands are unjust; and we do not rudely impose them, but give him the\nalternative of obeying or convincing us;--that is what we offer, and he\ndoes neither.\n\n'These are the sort of accusations to which, as we were saying, you,\nSocrates, will be exposed if you accomplish your intentions; you, above all\nother Athenians.'  Suppose now I ask, why I rather than anybody else? they\nwill justly retort upon me that I above all other men have acknowledged the\nagreement.  'There is clear proof,' they will say, 'Socrates, that we and\nthe city were not displeasing to you.  Of all Athenians you have been the\nmost constant resident in the city, which, as you never leave, you may be\nsupposed to love (compare Phaedr.).  For you never went out of the city\neither to see the games, except once when you went to the Isthmus, or to\nany other place unless when you were on military service; nor did you\ntravel as other men do.  Nor had you any curiosity to know other states or\ntheir laws:  your affections did not go beyond us and our state; we were\nyour especial favourites, and you acquiesced in our government of you; and\nhere in this city you begat your children, which is a proof of your\nsatisfaction.  Moreover, you might in the course of the trial, if you had\nliked, have fixed the penalty at banishment; the state which refuses to let\nyou go now would have let you go then.  But you pretended that you\npreferred death to exile (compare Apol.), and that you were not unwilling\nto die.  And now you have forgotten these fine sentiments, and pay no\nrespect to us the laws, of whom you are the destroyer; and are doing what\nonly a miserable slave would do, running away and turning your back upon\nthe compacts and agreements which you made as a citizen.  And first of all\nanswer this very question:  Are we right in saying that you agreed to be\ngoverned according to us in deed, and not in word only?  Is that true or\nnot?'  How shall we answer, Crito?  Must we not assent?\n\nCRITO:  We cannot help it, Socrates.\n\nSOCRATES:  Then will they not say:  'You, Socrates, are breaking the\ncovenants and agreements which you made with us at your leisure, not in any\nhaste or under any compulsion or deception, but after you have had seventy\nyears to think of them, during which time you were at liberty to leave the\ncity, if we were not to your mind, or if our covenants appeared to you to\nbe unfair.  You had your choice, and might have gone either to Lacedaemon\nor Crete, both which states are often praised by you for their good\ngovernment, or to some other Hellenic or foreign state.  Whereas you, above\nall other Athenians, seemed to be so fond of the state, or, in other words,\nof us her laws (and who would care about a state which has no laws?), that\nyou never stirred out of her; the halt, the blind, the maimed, were not\nmore stationary in her than you were.  And now you run away and forsake\nyour agreements.  Not so, Socrates, if you will take our advice; do not\nmake yourself ridiculous by escaping out of the city.\n\n'For just consider, if you transgress and err in this sort of way, what\ngood will you do either to yourself or to your friends?  That your friends\nwill be driven into exile and deprived of citizenship, or will lose their\nproperty, is tolerably certain; and you yourself, if you fly to one of the\nneighbouring cities, as, for example, Thebes or Megara, both of which are\nwell governed, will come to them as an enemy, Socrates, and their\ngovernment will be against you, and all patriotic citizens will cast an\nevil eye upon you as a subverter of the laws, and you will confirm in the\nminds of the judges the justice of their own condemnation of you.  For he\nwho is a corrupter of the laws is more than likely to be a corrupter of the\nyoung and foolish portion of mankind.  Will you then flee from well-ordered\ncities and virtuous men? and is existence worth having on these terms?  Or\nwill you go to them without shame, and talk to them, Socrates?  And what\nwill you say to them?  What you say here about virtue and justice and\ninstitutions and laws being the best things among men?  Would that be\ndecent of you?  Surely not.  But if you go away from well-governed states\nto Crito's friends in Thessaly, where there is great disorder and licence,\nthey will be charmed to hear the tale of your escape from prison, set off\nwith ludicrous particulars of the manner in which you were wrapped in a\ngoatskin or some other disguise, and metamorphosed as the manner is of\nrunaways; but will there be no one to remind you that in your old age you\nwere not ashamed to violate the most sacred laws from a miserable desire of\na little more life?  Perhaps not, if you keep them in a good temper; but if\nthey are out of temper you will hear many degrading things; you will live,\nbut how?--as the flatterer of all men, and the servant of all men; and\ndoing what?--eating and drinking in Thessaly, having gone abroad in order\nthat you may get a dinner.  And where will be your fine sentiments about\njustice and virtue?  Say that you wish to live for the sake of your\nchildren--you want to bring them up and educate them--will you take them\ninto Thessaly and deprive them of Athenian citizenship?  Is this the\nbenefit which you will confer upon them?  Or are you under the impression\nthat they will be better cared for and educated here if you are still\nalive, although absent from them; for your friends will take care of them?\nDo you fancy that if you are an inhabitant of Thessaly they will take care\nof them, and if you are an inhabitant of the other world that they will not\ntake care of them?  Nay; but if they who call themselves friends are good\nfor anything, they will--to be sure they will.\n\n'Listen, then, Socrates, to us who have brought you up.  Think not of life\nand children first, and of justice afterwards, but of justice first, that\nyou may be justified before the princes of the world below.  For neither\nwill you nor any that belong to you be happier or holier or juster in this\nlife, or happier in another, if you do as Crito bids.  Now you depart in\ninnocence, a sufferer and not a doer of evil; a victim, not of the laws,\nbut of men.  But if you go forth, returning evil for evil, and injury for\ninjury, breaking the covenants and agreements which you have made with us,\nand wronging those whom you ought least of all to wrong, that is to say,\nyourself, your friends, your country, and us, we shall be angry with you\nwhile you live, and our brethren, the laws in the world below, will receive\nyou as an enemy; for they will know that you have done your best to destroy\nus.  Listen, then, to us and not to Crito.'\n\nThis, dear Crito, is the voice which I seem to hear murmuring in my ears,\nlike the sound of the flute in the ears of the mystic; that voice, I say,\nis humming in my ears, and prevents me from hearing any other.  And I know\nthat anything more which you may say will be vain.  Yet speak, if you have\nanything to say.\n\nCRITO:  I have nothing to say, Socrates.\n\nSOCRATES:  Leave me then, Crito, to fulfil the will of God, and to follow\nwhither he leads.", "answers": ["Because it violates his belief in the  laws of society."], "length": 6595, "dataset": "narrativeqa", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "585ce1f974c0a35526da31a0cdc1541728ffc2df6a73b4f3"}

He's talking to DETECTIVE WILSON, an old friend of his from the force.\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">We see both inside the conversation.\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CLIFF\n<P ID=\"dia\">It's about that pimp that was shot a couple of days ago, Drexl Spivey.\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">WILSON\n<P ID=\"dia\">What about him?\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CLIFF\n<P ID=\"dia\">Well, Ted, to tell you the truth, I found out through the grapevine that it \nmight be, and I only said might be, the Drexl Spivey that was responsible \nfor that restaurant break-in on Riverdale. \n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">WILSON\n<P ID=\"dia\">Are you still working security for Foster & Langley?\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CLIFF\n<P ID=\"dia\">Yeah, and the restaurant's on my route. And you know, I stuck my nose in \nfor the company to try to put a stop to some of these break-ins. Now, while \nI have no proof, the name Drexl Spivey kept comin' up Who's case is it?\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">WILSON\n<P ID=\"dia\">McTeague.\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CLIFF\n<P ID=\"dia\">I don't know him.

When you gonna come round and see my new place?\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CLIFF\n<P ID=\"dia\">You and Robin moved?\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">WILSON\n<P ID=\"dia\">Shit, are you behind. Me and Robin got a divorce six months ago. Got myself \na new place - mirrors all over the bedroom, ceiling fans above the bed. \nGuy'd have to look as ugly as King Kong not to get laid in this place. I'm \nserious, a guy'd have to look like a gorilla.\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"right\">CUT TO:\n\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">EXT.

Alabama's amusing herself by doing cartwheels and handstands in the background.\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CLIFF\n<P ID=\"dia\">They have nothing. In fact, they think it's drug related.\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n<P ID=\"dia\">Do tell. Why drug related?\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CLIFF\n<P ID=\"dia\">Apparently, Drexl had a big toe stuck in shit like that.\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n<P ID=\"dia\">No shit?\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CLIFF\n<P ID=\"dia\">Yeah.

Drug Dealer. Somebody you don't want on your ass. Look, Clarence, \nthe more I hear about this Drexl fucker, the more I think you did the right \nthing. That guy wasn't just some wild flake.\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n<P ID=\"dia\">That's what I've been tellin' ya. The guy was like a mad dog. So the cops \naren't looking for me?\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CLIFF\n<P ID=\"dia\">Naw, until they hear something better they'll assume Drexl and Blue Lou had \na falling out. So, once you leave twon, I wouldn't worry about it.\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Clarence sticks his hand out to shake. Cliff takes it.\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n<P ID=\"dia\">Thanks a lot, Daddy.

Kiss Pops goodbye,\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Alabama runs across from where she was and throws her arms around Cliff and gives him a big smackeroo on the lips. Cliff's a little startled. Alabama's bubbling like a Fresca.\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ALABAMA\n<P ID=\"dia\">Bye, Daddy! Hope to see you again real soon.\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(mock anger)\n<P ID=\"dia\">What kind of daughterly smackeroo was that?\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ALABAMA\n<P ID=\"dia\">Oh, hush up.\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">The two get into the Mustang.\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(to Cliff)\n<P ID=\"dia\">We'll send you a postcard as soon as we get to Hollywood.\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Clarence starts the engine.

DICK'S APARTMENT - DAY\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Dick's apartment is standard issue for a young actor. Things are pretty neat and clean. A nice stereo unit sits on the shelf.

Why're leavin' Detroit?\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Clarence sits down on the hotel room bed. Alabama, wearing only a long T-shirt with a big picture of Bullwinkle on it, crawls behind him.\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n<P ID=\"dia\">Well, there's a story behind all that. I'll tell you when I see you. By the \nway, I won't be alone.

TRAILER - DAY\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">A lower-middle-class trailer park named Astro World, which has a neon sign in front of it in the shape of a planet. \n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">A big, white Chevy Nova pulls into the park. It parks by a trailer that's slightly less kept up than the others. Cliff gets out of the Chevy. He's drinking out of a fast-food soda cup as he opens the door to his trailer.\n\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">INT. TRAILER - DAY\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">He steps inside the doorway and then, before he knows it, a gun is pressed to his temple and a big hand grabs his shoulder.\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">GUN CARRIER (DARIO)\n<P ID=\"dia\">Welcome home, alchy. We're havin' a party.\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Cliff is roughly shoved into his living room. Waiting for him are four men, standing: VIRGIL, FRANKIE (young Wise-guy) LENNY (an old Wise-guy), and Tooth-pick Vic (a fireplug pitbull type).\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Sitting in Cliff's recliner is VINCENZO COCCOTTI, the Frank Nitti to Detroid mob leader Blue Lou Boyle.\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Cliff is knocked to his knees. He looks up and sees the sitting Coccotti. Dario and Lenny pick him up and roughly drop him in a chair.\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">COCCOTTI\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(to Frankie)\n<P ID=\"dia\">Tell Tooth-pick Vic to go outside and do you-know-what.\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">In Italian Frankie tells Tooth-pick Vic what Coccotti said. He nods and exits.\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Cliff's chair is moved closer to Coccotti's. Dario stands on one side of Cliff. Frankie and Lenny ransack the trailer. Virgil has a bottle of Chivas Regal in his hand, but he has yet to touch a drop.\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">COCCOTTI\n<P ID=\"dia\">Do you know who I am, Mr. Worley?\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CLIFF\n<P ID=\"dia\">I give up. Who are you?\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">COCCOTTI\n<P ID=\"dia\">I'm the Anti-Christ. You get me in a vendetta kind of mood, you will tell \nthe angels in heaven that you had never seen pure evil so singularly \npersonified as you did in the face of the man who killed you. My name is \nVincenzo Coccotti. I work as a counsel for Mr. Blue Lou Boyle, the man your \nson stole from. I hear you were once a cop so I assume you've heard od us \nbefore. Am I correct?\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CLIFF\n<P ID=\"dia\">I've heard of Blue Lou Boyle.\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">COCCOTTI\n<P ID=\"dia\">I'm glad. Hopefully that will clear up the how-full-of-shit-I-am question \nyou've been asking yourself. Now, we're gonna have a little Q and A, and, \nat the risk of sounding redundant, please make your answers genuine.\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(taking out a pack of Chesterfields)\n<P ID=\"dia\">Want a Chesterfield?\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CLIFF\n<P ID=\"dia\">No.\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">COCCOTTI\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(as he lights up)\n<P ID=\"dia\">I have a son of my own. About you boy's age. I can imagine how painful this \nmust be for you. But Clarence and that bitch-whore girlfriend of his \nbrought this all on themselves. And I implore you not to go down the road \nwith 'em. You can always take comfort in the fact that you never had a \nchoice.\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CLIFF\n<P ID=\"dia\">Look, I'd help ya if I could, but I haven't seen Clarence -\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Before Cliff can finish his sentence, Coccotti slams him hard in the nose with his fist.\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">COCCOTTI\n<P ID=\"dia\">Smarts, don't it? Gettin' slammed in the nose fucks you all up. You got \nthat pain shootin' through your brain. Your eyes fill up with water. It \nain't any kind of fun. But what I have to offer you. That's as good as it's \never gonna get, and it won't ever get that good again. We talked to your \nneighbors. They saw a Mustang, a red Mustang, Clarence's red Mustang, \nparked in front of your trailer yesterday. Mr. Worley, have you seen your \nson?\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Cliff's defeated.\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CLIFF\n<P ID=\"dia\">I've seen him.\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">COCCOTTI\n<P ID=\"dia\">Now I can't be sure of how much of what he told you. So in the chance \nyou're in the dark about some of this, let me shed some light. That whore \nyour boy hangs around with, her pimp is an associate of mine, and I don't \njust mean pimpin', in other affairs he works for me in a courier capacity. \nWell, apparently, that dirty little whore found out when we're gonna do \nsome business, 'cause your son, the cowboy and his flame, came in the room \nblastin' and didn't stop till they were pretty sure everybody was dead.\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CLIFF\n<P ID=\"dia\">What are you talkin' about?\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">COCCOTTI\n<P ID=\"dia\">I'm talkin' about a massacre. They snatched my narcotics and hightailed it \noutta there. Wouldda gotten away with it, but your son, fuckhead that he \nis, left his driver's license in a dead guy's hand. A whore hiding in the \ncommode filled in all the blanks.\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CLIFF\n<P ID=\"dia\">I don't believe you.\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">COCCOTTI\n<P ID=\"dia\">That's of minor importance. But what's of major fuckin' importance is that \nI believe you. Where did they go?\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CLIFF\n<P ID=\"dia\">On their honeymoon.\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">COCCOTTI\n<P ID=\"dia\">I'm gettin' angry askin' the same question a second time. Where did they \ngo?\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CLIFF\n<P ID=\"dia\">They didn't tell me.\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Coccotti looks at him.\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CLIFF\n<P ID=\"dia\">Now, wait a minute and listen. I haven't seen Clarence in three years. \nYesterday he shows up here with a girl, sayin' he got married. He told me \nhe needed some quick cash for a honeymoon, so he asked if he could borrow \nfive hundred dollars. I wanted to help him out so I wrote out a check. We \nwent to breakfast and that's the last I saw of him. So help me God. They \nnever thought to tell me where they were goin'. And I never thought to ask.\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Coccotti looks at him for a long moment. He then gives Virgil a look. Virgil, quick as greased lightning, grabs Cliff's hand and turns it palm up. He then whips out a butterfly knife and slices Cliff's palm open and pours Chivas Regal on the wound. Cliff screams.\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Coccotti puffs on a Chesterfield.\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Tooth-pic Vic returns to the trailer, and reports in Italian that there's nothing in the car.\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Virgil walks into the kitchen and gets a dishtowel. Cliff holds his bleeding palm in agony. Virgil hands him the dishtowel. Cliff uses it to wrap up his hand.\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">COCCOTTI\n<P ID=\"dia\">Sicilians are great liars. The best in the world. I'm a Sicilian. And my \nold man was the world heavyweight champion of Sicilian liars. And from \ngrowin' up with him I learned the pantomime. Now there are seventeen \ndifferent things a guy can do when he lies to give him away. A guy has \nseventeen pantomimes. A woman's got twenty, but a guy's got seventeen. And \nif you know 'em like ya know your own face, they beat lie detectors to \nhell. What we got here is a little game of show and tell. You don't wanna \nshow me nothin'. But you're tellin' me everything. Now I know you know \nwhere they are. So tell me, before I do some damage you won't walk away \nfrom.\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">The awful pain in Cliff's hand is being replaced by the awful pain in his heart. He looks deep into Coccotti's eyes. \n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CLIFF\n<P ID=\"dia\">Could I have one of those Chesterfields now?\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">COCCOTTI\n<P ID=\"dia\">Sure.\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Coccotti leans over and hands him a smoke.\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CLIFF\n<P ID=\"dia\">Got a match?\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Cliff reaches into his pocket and pulls out a lighter.\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CLIFF\n<P ID=\"dia\">Oh, don't bother. I got one.\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(he lights the cigarette)\n<P ID=\"dia\">So you're a Sicilian, huh?\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">COCCOTTI\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(intensly)\n<P ID=\"dia\">Uh-huh.\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CLIFF\n<P ID=\"dia\">You know I read a lot. Especially things that have to do with history. I \nfind that shit fascinating. In fact, I don't know if you know this or not, \nSicilians were spawned by niggers.\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">All the men stop what they were doing and look at Cliff, except for Tooth-pic Vic who doesn't speak English and so isn't insulted. Coccotti can't believe what he's hearing.\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">COCCOTTI\n<P ID=\"dia\">Come again?\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CLIFF\n<P ID=\"dia\">It's a fact. Sicilians have nigger blood pumpin' through their hearts. If \nyou don't believe me, look it up. You see, hundreds and hundreds of years \nago the Moors conquered Sicily. And Moors are niggers. Way back then, \nSicilians were like the wops in northern Italy. Blond hair, blue eyes. But, \nonce the Moors moved in there, they changed the whole country. They did so \nmuch fuckin' with the Sicilian women, they changed the blood-line for ever, \nfrom blond hair and blue eyes to black hair and dark skin. I find it \nabsolutely amazing to think that to this day, hundreds of years later, \nSicilians still carry that nigger gene. I'm just quotin' history. It's a \nfact. It's written. Your ancestors were niggers. Your great, great, great, \ngreat, great-grandmother was fucked by a nigger, and had a half-nigger kid. \nThat is a fact. Now tell me, am I lyin'?\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Coccotti looks at him for a moment then jumps up, whips out an automatic, grabs hold of Cliff's hair, puts the barrel to his temple, and pumps three bullets through Cliff's head.\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">He pushes the body violently aside. Coccotti pauses. Unable to express his feelings and frustrated by the blood in his hands, he simply drops his weapon, and turns to his men.\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">COCCOTTI\n<P ID=\"dia\">I haven't killed anybody since 1974.

So, because he was such \na nice guy, they wanted to name the baby after him, as a sign of gratitude. \nWell, his name was Waldo, and no matter how grateful they were, even if \nI'da been a boy, they would't call me Waldo.

I hoped it would tell me where I lived but it had a \nTallahassee address on it, and I stopped somebody on the street and they \ntold me I was in Detroit. So that was no help.

How old were you \nthen?\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n<P ID=\"dia\">Five.\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">She turns the page.\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ALABAMA\n<P ID=\"dia\">Oh, you look so cute as little Elvis.\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n<P ID=\"dia\">I finally knew what I wanted when I grew up.\n\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">LATER - LIVING ROOM\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Clarence and Alabama slow dance in the middle of his room to Janis Joplin's \"Piece of My Heart\".\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n<P ID=\"dia\">You know when you sat behind me?\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ALABAMA\n<P ID=\"dia\">At the movies?\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n<P ID=\"dia\">Uh-huh, I was tryin' to think of somethin' to say to you, then I thought, \nshe doesn't want me bothering her.\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ALABAMA\n<P ID=\"dia\">What would make you think that?\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n<P ID=\"dia\">I dunno. I guess I'm just stupid.\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ALABAMA\n<P ID=\"dia\">You're not stupid. Just wrong.\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">They move to the music. Alabama softly, quietly sings some of the words to the song.\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ALABAMA\n<P ID=\"dia\">I love Janis.\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n<P ID=\"dia\">You know, a lot of people have misconceptions of how she died.\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ALABAMA\n<P ID=\"dia\">She OD'd, didn't she?\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n<P ID=\"dia\">Yeah, she OD'd. But wasn't on her last legs or anythin'. She didn't take \ntoo much. It shouldn't have killed her. There was somethin' wrong with what \nshe took.\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ALABAMA\n<P ID=\"dia\">You mean she got a bad batch?\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n<P ID=\"dia\">That's what happened. In fact, when she died, it was considered to be the \nhappiest time of her life. She'd been fucked over so much by men she didn't \ntrust them. She was havin' this relationship with this guy and he asked her \nto marry him. Now, other people had asked to marry her before, but she \ncouldn't be sure whether they really loved her or were just after her \nmoney. So, she said no. And the guy says, \"Look, I really love you, and I \nwanna prove it. So have your lawyers draw up a paper that says no matter \nwhat happens, I can never get any of your money, and I'll sign it.\" So she \ndid, and he asked her, and she said yes. And once they were engaged he told \nher a secret about himself that she never knew: he was a millionaire.\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ALABAMA\n<P ID=\"dia\">So he really loved her?\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n<P ID=\"dia\">Uh-huh.\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">They kiss.\n\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">INT. CLARENCE'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - DAY\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">It's the next day, around 1 p.m. Clarence wakes up in his bed, alone. He looks around, and no Alabama. Then he hears crying in the distance. He puts on a robe and investigates.\n\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">INT. CLARENCE'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAY\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Alabama's wearing one of Clarence's old shirts. She's curled up in a chair crying. Clarence approaches her. She tries to compose herself.\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n<P ID=\"dia\">What's wrong, sweetheart? Did I do something? What did I do?\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ALABAMA\n<P ID=\"dia\">You didn't do nothing.\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n<P ID=\"dia\">Did you hurt yourself?\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(he takes her foot)\n<P ID=\"dia\">Whatd'ya do? Step on a thumbtack?\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ALABAMA\n<P ID=\"dia\">Clarence, I've got something to tell you. I didn't just happen to be at the \ntheater. I was paid to be there.\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n<P ID=\"dia\">What are you, a theater checker? You check up on the box office girls. Make \nsure they're not rippin' the place off.\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ALABAMA\n<P ID=\"dia\">I'm not a theater checker. I'm a call girl.\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Pause.\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n<P ID=\"dia\">You're a whore?\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ALABAMA\n<P ID=\"dia\">I'm a call girl. There's a difference, ya know.\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(pause)\n<P ID=\"dia\">I don't know. Maybe there's not. That place you took me to last night, that \ncomic book place.\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n<P ID=\"dia\">\"Heroes For Sale\"?\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ALABAMA\n<P ID=\"dia\">Yeah, that one. Somebody who works there arranged to have me meet you.\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n<P ID=\"dia\">Who?\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ALABAMA\n<P ID=\"dia\">I don't know. I didn't talk with them. The plan was for me to bump into \nyou, pick you up, spend the night, and skip out after you fell asleep. I \nwas gonna write you a note and say that this was my last day in America. \nThat I was leaving on a plane this morning up to Ukraine to marry a rich \nmillionaire, and thank you for making my last day in America my best day.\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n<P ID=\"dia\">That dazzling imagination.\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ALABAMA\n<P ID=\"dia\">It's over on the TV. All it says is: \"Dear Clarence.\" I couldn't write \nanymore. I didn't not want to ever see you again. In fact, it's stupid not \nto ever see you again. Las night... I don't know... I felt... I hadn't had \nthat much fun since Girl Scouts. So I just said, \"Alabama, come clean, Let \nhim know what's what, and if he tells you to go fuck yourself then go back \nto Drexl and fuck yourself.\"\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n<P ID=\"dia\">Who and what is a Drexl?\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ALABAMA\n<P ID=\"dia\">My pimp.\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n<P ID=\"dia\">You have a pimp?\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ALABAMA\n<P ID=\"dia\">Uh-huh.\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n<P ID=\"dia\">A real live pimp?\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ALABAMA\n<P ID=\"dia\">Uh-huh.\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n<P ID=\"dia\">Is he black?\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ALABAMA\n<P ID=\"dia\">He thinks he is. He says his mother was Apache, but I suspect he's lying.\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n<P ID=\"dia\">Is he nice?\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ALABAMA\n<P ID=\"dia\">Well, I wouldn't go so far as to call him nice, but he's treated me pretty \ndecent. But I've only been there about four days. He got a little rough \nwith Arlene the other day.\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n<P ID=\"dia\">What did he do to Arlene?\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ALABAMA\n<P ID=\"dia\">Slapped her around a little. Punched her in the stomch. It was pretty \nscary.\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n<P ID=\"dia\">This motherfucker sounds charming!\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Clarence is on his feet, furious.\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n<P ID=\"dia\">Goddamn it, Alabama, you gotta get the fuck outta there! How much longer \nbefore he's slappin' you around? Punchin' you in the stomach? How the fuck \ndid you get hooked up with a douche-bag like this in the first place?\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ALABAMA\n<P ID=\"dia\">At the bus station. He said I'd be a perfect call girl. And that he knew an \nagency in California that, on his recommendation, would handle me. They \nhave a very exclusive clientele: movie stars, big businessmen, total \nwhite-collar. And all the girls in the agency get a grand a night. At least \nfive hundred. They drive Porsches, live in condos, have stockbrokers, carry \nbeepers, you know, like Nancy Allen in \"Dressed to Kill\". And when I was \nready he'd call 'em, give me a plane ticket, and send me on my way. He says \nhe makes a nice finder's fee for finding them hot prospects. But no one's \ngonna pay a grand a night for a girl who doesn't know whether to shit or \nwind her watch. So what I'm doin' for Drexl now is just sorta learnin' the \nropes. It seemed like a lotta fun, but I don't really like it much, till \nlast night. You were only my third trick, but you didn't feel like a trick. \nSince it was a secret, I just pretended I was on a date. An, um, I guess I \nwant a second date.\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n<P ID=\"dia\">Thank you. I wanna see you again too. And again, and again, and again. \nBama, I know we haven't known each other long, but my parents went together \nall throughout high school, and they still got a divorce. So, fuck it, you \nwanna marry me?\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ALABAMA\n<P ID=\"dia\">What?\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n<P ID=\"dia\">Will you be my wife?\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">When Alabama gives her answer, her voice cracks.\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ALABAMA\n<P ID=\"dia\">Yes.\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(a little surprised)\n<P ID=\"dia\">You will?\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ALABAMA\n<P ID=\"dia\">You better not be fucking teasing me.\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n<P ID=\"dia\">You better not be fuckin' teasin' me.\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">They seal it with a kiss.\n\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">LATER - THAT NIGHT\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">CLOSEUP - Alabama's wedding ring.\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">The newlyweds are snuggling up together onthe couch watching TV.

Now, I know I'm pretty, \nbut I ain't as pretty as a couple of titties.\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Clarence takes out an envelope and throws it on the table.\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n<P ID=\"dia\">I'm not eatin' 'cause I'm not hungry. I'm not sittin' 'cause I'm not \nstayin'. I'm not lookin' at the movie 'cause I saw it seven years ago. It's \n\"The Mack\" with Max Julian, Carol Speed, and Richard Pryor, written by \nBobby Poole, directed by Michael Campus, and released by Cinerama Releasing \nCompany in 1984. I'm not scared of you. I just don't like you. In that \nenvelope is some payoff money. Alabama's moving on to some greener \npastures. We're not negotiatin'. I don't like to barter.  I don't like to \ndicker. I never have fun in Tijuana. That price is non-negotiable. What's \nin that envelope is for my peace of mind. My peace of mind is worth that \nmuch. Not one penny more, not one penny more.\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">You could hear a pin drop. Once Clarence starts talking Marty goes on full alert. Drexl stops eating and the Whores stop breathing. All eyes are on Drexl. Drexl drops his chopsticks and opens the envelope. It's empty.\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">DREXL\n<P ID=\"dia\">It's empty.\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Clarence flashes a wide Cheshire cat grin that says, \"That's right, asshole.\"\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Silence.\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">DREXL\n<P ID=\"dia\">Oooooooooh weeeeeeee! This child is terrible. Marty, you know what we got \nhere? Motherfuckin' Charles Bronson. Is that who you supposed to be? Mr. \nMajestyk? Looky here, Charlie, none of this shit is necessary. I ain't got \nno hold on Alabama. I just tryin' to lend the girl a helpin' hand -\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Before Drexl finishes his sentence he picks up the card table and throws it at Clarence, catching him of guard.\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Marty comes up behind Clarence and throws his arm around his neck, putting him in a tight choke hold. \n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Clarence, with his free arm, hits Marty hard with his elbow in the solar plexus. We'll never know if that blow had any effect because at just that moment Drexl takes a flying leap and tackles the two guys.\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">All of them go crashing into the stereo unit and a couple of shelves that hold records, all of which collapse to the floor in a shower of LPs.\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Marty, who's on the bottom of the pile, hasn't let go of Clarence.\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Since Drexl's on top, he starts slamming fists into Clarence's face.\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Clarence, who's sandwiched between these two guys, can't do a whole lot about it.\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">DREXL\n<P ID=\"dia\">Ya wanna fuck with me?\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(hits Clarence)\n<P ID=\"dia\">Ya wanna fuck with me?\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(hits Clarence)\n<P ID=\"dia\">I'll show ya who you're fuckin' wit!\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">He hits Clarence hard in the face with both fists.\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Clarence, who has no leverage whatsoever, grabs hold of Drexl's face and digs his nails in. He sticks his thumb in Drexl's mouth, grabs a piece of cheek, and starts twisting.\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Marty, who's in an even worse position, can do nothing but tighten his grip aroud Clarence's neck, until Clarence feels like his eyes are going to pop out of his head.\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Drexl's face is getting torn up, but he's also biting down hard on Clarence's thumb.\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Clarence raises his head and brings it down fast, crunching Marty's face, and busting his nose.\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Marty loosens his grip around Clarence's neck. Clarence wiggles free and gets up on his knees.\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Drexl and Clarence are now on an even but awkward footing. The two are going at each other like a pair of alley cats, not aiming their punches, keeping them coming fast and furious. They're not doing much damage to each other because of their positions, it's almost like a hockey fight.\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Marty sneaks up behind Clarence and smashes him in the head with a stack of LPs. This disorients Clarence. Marty grabs him from behind and pulls him to his feet.\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Drexl socks him in the face: one, two three! Then he kicks him hard in the balls.\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Marty lets go and Clarence hits the ground like a sack of potatoes. He curls up into a fetal position and holds his balls, tears coming out of his eyes.\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Drexl's face is torn up from Clarence's nails.\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Marty has blood streaming down his face frim his nose and on to his shirt.\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">DREXL\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(to Marty)\n<P ID=\"dia\">You OK? That stupid dumb-ass didn't break your nose, did he?\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MARTY\n<P ID=\"dia\">Naw. It don't feel too good but it's alright.\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Drexl kicks Clarence, who's still on the ground hurting.\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">DREXL\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(to Clarence)\n<P ID=\"dia\">You see what you get when you fuck wit me, white boy? You're gonna walk in \nmy goddamn house, my house! Gonna come in here and tell me! Talkin' smack, \nin my house, in front of my employees. Shit! Your ass must be crazy.\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(to Marty)\n<P ID=\"dia\">I don't think that white boy's got good sense. Hey, Marty.\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(laughing)\n<P ID=\"dia\">He must of thought it was white boy day. It ain't white boy day, is it?\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MARTY\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(laughing)\n<P ID=\"dia\">Naw, man, it ain't white boy day.\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">DREXL\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(to Clarence)\n<P ID=\"dia\">Shit, man, you done fucked up again. Next time you bogart your way into a \nnigger's crib, an' get all his face, make sure you do it on white boy day.\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(hurting)\n<P ID=\"dia\">Wannabee nigger...\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">DREXL\n<P ID=\"dia\">Fuck you! My mother was Apache.\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Drexl kicks him again. Clarence curls up.\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Drexl bends down and looks for Clarence's wallet in his jacket.\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Clarence still can't do much. The kick to his balls still has him down.\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Drexl finds it and pulls it out. He flips it open to driver's license.\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">DREXL\n<P ID=\"dia\">Well, well, well, looky what we got here. Clarence Worley. Sounds almost \nlike a nigger name.\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(to Clarence)\n<P ID=\"dia\">Hey, dummy.\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">He puts his foot on Clarence's chest. Clarence's POV as he looks up.\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">DREXL\n<P ID=\"dia\">Before you bought your dumb ass through the door, I didn't know shit. I \njust chalked it up to au revoir Alabama. But, because you think you're some \nmacho motherfucker, I know who she's with. You. I know who you are, \nClarence Worley. And, I know where you live, 4900 116th  street, apartment \n48. And I'll make a million-dollar bet, Alabama's at the same address. \nMarty, take the car and go get 'er. Bring her dumb ass back here.\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">He hands Marty the driver's license. Maty goes to get the car keys and a jacket.\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">DREXL\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(to Marty)\n<P ID=\"dia\">I'll keep lover boy here entertained.\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(to Clarence)\n<P ID=\"dia\">You know the first thing I'll do when she gets here. I think I'll make her \nsuck my dick, and I'll come all in her face. I mean it ain't nuttin' new. \nShe's done it before. But I want you as a audience.\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(hollering to Marty)\n<P ID=\"dia\">Marty, what the fuck are you doin'?\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MARTY\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(off)\n<P ID=\"dia\">I'm tryin' to find my jacket.\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">DREXL\n<P ID=\"dia\">Look in the hamper. Linda's been dumpin' everybody's stray clothes there \nlately.\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">While Drexl has his attention turned to Marty, Clarence reaches into his sock and pulls out the .38. he stick the barrel between Drexl's legs. Drexl, who's standing over Clarence, looks down just in time to see Clarence pull the trigger and blow his balls to bits. Tiny spots of blood speckle Clarence's face.\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Drexl shrieks in horror and pain, and falls to the ground.\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MARTY\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(off)\n<P ID=\"dia\">What's happening?\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Marty steps into the room.\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Clarence doesn't hesitate, he shoots Marty four times in the chest.\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Two of three Hookers have run out of the front door, screaming. The other Hooker is curled up in the corner. She's too stoned to run, but stoned enough to be terrified.\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Drexl, still alive, is laying on the ground howling, holding what's left of his balls and his dick.\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Clarence points the gun at the remaining Hooker.\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n<P ID=\"dia\">Get a bag and put Alabama's thing in it!\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">She doesn't move.\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n<P ID=\"dia\">You wanna get shot? I ain't got all fuckin' day, so move it!\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">The Hooker, tears of fear ruining her mascara, grabs a suitcase from under the bed, and, on her hands and knees, pushes it along the floor to Clarence.\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Clarence takes it by the handle and wobbles over to Drexl, who's curled up like a pillbug.\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">CLOSEUP - Clarence's forgotten driver's license in Marty's bloody hand.\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Clarence puts his foot on Drexl's chest.\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(to Drexl)\n<P ID=\"dia\">Open you eyes, laughing boy.\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">He doesn't. Clarence gives him a kick.\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n<P ID=\"dia\">Open your eyes!\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">He does. It's now Drexl's POV from the floor.\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n<P ID=\"dia\">You thought it was pretty funny, didn't you?\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">He fires.\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">CLOSEUP - The bullet comes out of the gun and heads right toward us. When it reaches us, the screen goes awash in red.\n\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">INT. CLARENCE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">The front swings open and Clarence walks in. Alabama jumps off the couch and runs toward Clarence, before she reaches him he blurts out:\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n<P ID=\"dia\">I killed him.\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">She stops short.\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n<P ID=\"dia\">I've got some food in the car, I'll be right back.\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Clarence leaves. Except for the TV playing, the room is quiet. Alabama sits on the couch.\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Clarence walks back into the room with a whole bounty of take-out food. He heaps it on to the coffee table and starts to chow down.\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n<P ID=\"dia\">Help yourself. I got enough. I am fuckin' starvin'. I think I ordered one \nof everythin'.\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">He stops and looks at here.\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n<P ID=\"dia\">I am so hungry.\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">He starts eating french fries and hamburgers.\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ALABAMA\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(in a daze)\n<P ID=\"dia\">Was it him or you?\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n<P ID=\"dia\">Yeah. But to be honest, I put myself in that position. When I drove up \nthere I said to myself, \"If I can kill 'em and get away with it, I'll do \nit.\" I could. So I did.\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ALABAMA\n<P ID=\"dia\">Is this a joke?\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n<P ID=\"dia\">No joke. This is probably the best hamburger I've ever had. I'm serious, \nI've never had a hamburger taste this good.\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Alabama starts to cry. Clarence continues eating, ignoring her.\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n<P ID=\"dia\">Come on, Bama, eat something. You'll feel better.\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">She continues crying. He continues eating and ignoring her. Finally he spins on her, yelling:\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n<P ID=\"dia\">Why are you crying? He's not worth one of your tears. Would you rather it \nhad been me? Do you love him?\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(no answer)\n<P ID=\"dia\">Do you love him?\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(no answer)\n<P ID=\"dia\">Do you love him?\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">She looks at Clarence, having a hard time getting a word out.\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ALABAMA\n<P ID=\"dia\">I think what you did was...\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n<P ID=\"dia\">What?\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ALABAMA\n<P ID=\"dia\">I think what you did...\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n<P ID=\"dia\">What?\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ALABAMA\n<P ID=\"dia\">... was so romantic.\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Clarence is completely taken back. They meet in a long, passionate lovers' kiss. Their kiss breaks and slowly the world comes back to normal.\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n<P ID=\"dia\">I gotta get outta these clothes.\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">He picks up the suitcase and drops it on the table in front of them.\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ALABAMA\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(comically)\n<P ID=\"dia\">Clean clothes. There is a god,\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Clarence flips open the suitcase. Alabama's and her husband's jaws drop.\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ALABAMA\n<P ID=\"dia\">Clarence. Those aren't my clothes.\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"right\">CUT TO:\n\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">EXT. HOLLYWOOD HOLIDAY INN - DAY\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">We see the Hollywood Holiday Inn sign.

His hand reaches out of shot.\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">CLOSEUP - The reason for all the jaw dropping... the suitcase is full of cocaine!\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Clarence smiles, holding a bottle of wine.\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Alabama's watching the cable TV.\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">DICK\n<P ID=\"dia\">Holy Mary, Mother of God.\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ALABAMA\n<P ID=\"dia\">This is great, we got cable.\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(to Alabama)\n<P ID=\"dia\">Bama, you got your blade?\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Keeping her eyes on the TV, she pulls out from her purse a Swiss army knife with a tiny dinosaur on it and tosses it to Clarence. Clarence takes off the corkscrew and opens the wine.\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">He pours some wine into a couple of hotel plastic cups, a big glass for Dick, a little one for himself. He hands it to Dick. Dick takes it and drinks.\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">DICK\n<P ID=\"dia\">This shit can't be real.\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n<P ID=\"dia\">It'll get ya high.\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">He tosses the knife.\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n<P ID=\"dia\">Do you want some wine, sweetheart?\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ALABAMA\n<P ID=\"dia\">Nope. I'm not really a wine gal.\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Using the knife, Dick snorts some of the cocaine. He jumps back.\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">DICK\n<P ID=\"dia\">It's fuckin' real!\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(to Clarence)\n<P ID=\"dia\">It's fuckin' real!\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n<P ID=\"dia\">I certainly hope so.\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">DICK\n<P ID=\"dia\">You've got a helluva lotta coke there, man!\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n<P ID=\"dia\">I know.\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">DICK\n<P ID=\"dia\">Do you have any idea how much fuckin' coke you got?\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n<P ID=\"dia\">Tell me.\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">DICK\n<P ID=\"dia\">I don't know! A fuckin' lot!\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">He downs his wine. Clarence fills his glass.\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">DICK\n<P ID=\"dia\">This is Drexl's coke?\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n<P ID=\"dia\">Drexl's dead. This is Clarence's coke and Clarence can do whatever he wants \nwith it. And what Clarence wants to do is sell it. Then me and Bama are \ngonna leave on a jet plane and spend the rest of our lives spendin'. So, \nyou got my letter, have you lined up any buyers?\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">DICK\n<P ID=\"dia\">Look, Clarence, I'm not Joe Cocaine.\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Dick gulps half of his wine. Clarence fills up.\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n<P ID=\"dia\">But you're an actor. I hear these Hollywood guys have it delivered to the \nset.\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">DICK\n<P ID=\"dia\">Yeah, they do. And maybe when I start being a successful actor I'll know \nthose guys. But most of the people I know are like me. They ain't got a pot \nto piss in or a window to throw it out of. Now, if you want to sell a \nlittle bit at a time -\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n<P ID=\"dia\">No way! The whole enchilada in one shot.\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">DICK\n<P ID=\"dia\">Do you have any idea how difficult that's gonna be?\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n<P ID=\"dia\">I'm offering a half a million dollars worth of white for two hundred \nthousand. How difficult can that be?\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">DICK\n<P ID=\"dia\">It's difficult because you're sellin' it to a particular group. Big shots. \nFat cats. Guys who can use that kind of quantity. Guys who can afford two \nhundred thousand. Basically, guys I don't know. You don't know. And, more \nimportant, they don't know you. I did talk with one guy who could possibly \nhelp you.\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n<P ID=\"dia\">Is he big league?\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">DICK\n<P ID=\"dia\">He's nothing. He's in my acting class. But he works as an assistant to a \nvery powerful movie producer named Lee Donowitz. I thought Donowitz could \nbe interested in a deal like this. He could use it. He could afford it.\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n<P ID=\"dia\">What'd'ya tell 'em?\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">DICK\n<P ID=\"dia\">Hardly anything.

First you come waltzing into my life after two years. You're \nmarried. You killed a guy.\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n<P ID=\"dia\">Two guys.\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">DICK\n<P ID=\"dia\">Two guys. Now you want me to help you with some big drug deal. Fuck, \nClarence, you killed somebody and you're blowin' it off like it don't mean \nshit.\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n<P ID=\"dia\">Don't expect me to be all broken up over poor Drexl. I think he was a \nfuckin', freeloadin', parasitic scumbag, and he got exactly what he \ndeserved. I got no pity for a mad dog like that. I think I should get a \nmerit badge or somethin'.\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Dick rests his head in his hands.\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n<P ID=\"dia\">Look, buddy, I realize I'm layin' some pretty heavy shit on ya, but I need \nyou to rise to the occasion. So, drink some more wine. Get used to the \nidea, and get your friend to the phone.\n\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">EXT. LOS ANGELES ZOO - DAY\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">CLOSEUP - A black panther, the four-legged kind, paces back and forth.\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Clarence, Alabama, Dick and Elliot Blitzer are walking through the zoo. One look at Elliot and you can see what type of actor he is, a real GQ, blow-dry boy. As they walk and talk, Clarence is eating a box of animal crackers and Alabama is blowing soap bubbles.\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ELLIOT\n<P ID=\"dia\">So you guys got five hundred thousand dollars worth of cola that you're \nunloading -\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n<P ID=\"dia\">Want an animal cracker?\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ELLIOT\n<P ID=\"dia\">Yeah, OK.\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">He takes one.\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n<P ID=\"dia\">Leave the gorillas.\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ELLIOT\n<P ID=\"dia\">- that you're unloading for two hundred thousand dollars -\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n<P ID=\"dia\">Unloading? That's a helluva way to describe the bargain of a lifetime.\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">DICK\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(trying to chill him out)\n<P ID=\"dia\">Clarence...\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ELLIOT\n<P ID=\"dia\">Where did you get it?\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n<P ID=\"dia\">I grow it on my window-sill. The lights really great there and I'm up high \nenough so you can't see it from the street.\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ELLIOT\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(forcing a laugh)\n<P ID=\"dia\">Ha ha ha. No really, where does it come from?\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n<P ID=\"dia\">Coco leaves. You see, they take the leaves and mash it down until it's kind \nof a paste -\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ELLIOT\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(turning to Dick)\n<P ID=\"dia\">Look, Dick, I don't -\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(laughing)\n<P ID=\"dia\">No problem, Elliot. I'm just fuckin' wit ya, that's all. Actually, I'll \ntell you but you gotta keep it quiet. Understand, if Dick didn't assure me \nyou're good people I'd just tell ya, none of your fuckin' business. But, as \na sign of good faith, here it goes: I gotta friend in the department.\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ELLIOT\n<P ID=\"dia\">What department?\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n<P ID=\"dia\">What do you think, eightball?\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ELLIOT\n<P ID=\"dia\">The police department?\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n<P ID=\"dia\">Duh. What else would I be talking about? Now stop askin' stupid doorknob \nquestions. Well, a year and a half ago, this friend of mine got access to \nthe evidence room for an hour. He snagged this coke. But, he's a good cop \nwith a wife and a kid, so he sat on it for a year and a half until he found \na guy he could trust.\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ELLIOT\n<P ID=\"dia\">He trusts you?\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n<P ID=\"dia\">We were in Four H together. We've known each other since childhood. So, I'm \nhandling the sales part. He's my silent partner and he knows if I get \nfucked up, I won't drop dime on him.

No foolin' the first one's a tough row to hoe. Now,  \nthe second one, while it ain't no Mardi Gras, it ain't half as tough row to  \nhoe. You still feel somethin' but it's just so deluted this time around.  \nThen you completely level off on the third one. The third one's easy. It's  \ngotten to the point now I'll do it just to watch their expressions change.\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">He's tearing the motel room up in general.

Great.  \nOne less thing I gotta worry about.\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Virgil closes the case. Alabama sifts through her purse.\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">She pulls out her Swiss army knife, opens it up.

Virgil's right, she doesn't have anything to lose. Virgil's also right about his being the moment of truth. The ferocity in women that comes out at certain times, and is just here under the surface in many women all of the time, is unleashed. The absolute feeling of helplessness she felt only a moment ago has taken a one hundred and eighty degree turn into \"I'll take this motherfucker with me if it's the last thing I do\" seething hatred.\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Letting out a bloodcurling yell, she raises the knfe high above her head, then drops to her knees and plunges it deep into Virgil's right foot.\n\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">CLOSEUP - VIRGIL'S FACE\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Talk about bloodcurling yells.\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Virgil bends down and carefully pulls the knife from his foot, tears running down his face.\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">While Virgil's bent down, Alabama smashes an Elvis Presley whiskey decanter that Clarence bought her in Oklahoma over his head. It's only made of plaster, so it doesn't kill him.\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Virgil's moving toward Alabama, limping on his bad foot.\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">VIRGIL\n<P ID=\"dia\">OK, no more Mr. Nice-guy.\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Alabama picks up the hotel TV and tosses it to him. He instinctively catches it and, with his arms full of television, Alabama cold-cocks him with her fist in the nose, breaking it.\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Her eyes go straight to the door, then to the sawed-off shotgun by it. She runs to it, bends over the chair for the gun. Virgil's left foot kicks her in the back, sending her flying over the chair and smashing into the door.\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Virgil furiously throws the chair out of the way and stands over Alabama. Alabama's lying on the ground laughing. Virgil has killed a lot of people, but not one of them has ever laughed before he did it.\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">VIRGIL\n<P ID=\"dia\">What's so fuckin' funny?!!\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ALABAMA\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(laughing)\n<P ID=\"dia\">You look so ridiculous.\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">She laughs louder.

He picks her off the floor, then lifts her off the ground and throws her through the glass shower door in the bathroom.\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">VIRGIL\n<P ID=\"dia\">Laugh it up, cunt. You were in hysterics a minute ago. Why ain't you  \nlaughing now?\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Alabama, lying in the bathtub, grabs a small bottle of hotel shampoo and squeezes it out in her hand.\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Virgil reaches in the shower and grabs hold of her hair.\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Alabama rubs the shampoo in his face. He lets go of her and his hands go to his eyes.\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">VIRGIL\n<P ID=\"dia\">Oh Jesus!\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">She grabs hold of a hefty piece of broken glass and plunges it into his face.\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">VIRGIL\n<P ID=\"dia\">Oh Mary, help me!\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">The battered and bruised and bloody Alabama emerges from the shower. She's clutching a big, bloody piece of broken glass. She's vaguely reminiscent of a Tasmanian devil. Poor Virgil can't see very well, but he sees her figure coming toward him. He lets out a wild haymaker that catches her in the jaw and knocks her into the toilet.\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">He recovers almost immediately and takes the porcelain lid off the back of the toilet tank.\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Virgil whips out a .45 automatic from his shoulder holster, just as Alabama brings the lid down on his head. He's pressed up against the wall with this toilet lid hitting him. He can't get a good shot in this tight environment, but he fires anyway, hitting the floor, the all, the toilet, and the sink.\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">The toilet lid finally shatters against Virgil's head. He falls to the ground.\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Alabama goes to the medicine cabinet and whips out a big can of Final Net hairspray. She pulls a Bic lighter out of her pocket, and, just as Virgil raises his gun at her, she flicks the Bic and sends a stream of hairspray through the flame, which results in a big ball of fire that hits Virgil right in the face.\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">He fires off two shots. One hits the wall, another hits the sink pipe, sending water spraying.\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Upon getting his face fried Virgil screams and jumps up, knocking Alabama down, and runs out of the bathroom.\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Virgil collapses on the floor of the living room. Then, he sees the sawed-off laying on the ground. He crawls toward it.\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Alabama, in the bathroom, sees where he's heading. She picks up the .45 automatic and fires at him. It's empty. She's on her feet and into the room.\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">He reaches the shotgun, his hands grasp it.\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Alabama spots and picks up the bloody Swiss army knife. She takes a knife-first-running-dive at Virgil's back. She hits him.\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">He arches up, firing the sawed-off into the ceiling, dropping the gun, and sending a cloud of plaster and stucco all over the room.\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Alabama snatches the shotgun.\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Arched over on his back Virgil and Alabama make eye contact.\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">The first blast hits him in the shoulder, almost tearing his arm off. The second hits him in the knee. The third plays hell with his chest.\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Alabama then runs at him, hitting him in the head with the butt of the shotgun.\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Ever since he's been firing it's as if some other part of her brain has been functioning independently. She's been absent-mindedly saying the prayer of Saint Francis of Assisi.\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ALABAMA\n<P ID=\"dia\">Lord, make me an instrument of Thy peace;\nwhere there is hatred, let me sow love;\nwhere there is injury, pardon;\nwhere there is doubt, faith;\nwhere there is despair, hope;\nwhere there is darkness, light;\nand where there is sadness, joy.\nO Divine Master, grant that I may not\nso much seek to be consoled as to console;\nto be understood as to understand;\nto be loved as to love;\nfor it is in giving that we receive,\nit is pardoning that we are pardoned,\nand it is in dying that we are born\nto eternal life.\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Clarence, who's been hearing gunshots, bursts through the door, gun drawn, only to see Alabama, hitting a dead guy on the head, with a shotgun.\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n<P ID=\"dia\">Honey?\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">She continues. He puts his gun away.\n\n</p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n<P ID=\"dia\">Sweetheart? Cops are gonna be here any minute,\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">She continues. He takes the gun away from her, and she falls to the ground. She lies on the floor trembling, continuing with the downward swings of her arms.\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"act\">Clarence grabs the shotgun and the cocaine, and tosses Alabama over his shoulder.\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"right\">CUT TO:\n\n\n</p><p><p ID=\"slug\">EXT.

I won’t pretend to have\ntaken his vast measure on that first occasion, but I think I had achieved\na glimpse of what the privilege of his acquaintance might mean for many\npersons in the way of charges accepted.  He had been a great experience,\nand it was this perhaps that had put me into the frame of foreseeing how\nwe should all, sooner or later, have the honour of dealing with him as a\nwhole.  Whatever impression I then received of the amount of this total,\nI had a full enough vision of the patience of the Mulvilles.  He was to\nstay all the winter: Adelaide dropped it in a tone that drew the sting\nfrom the inevitable emphasis.  These excellent people might indeed have\nbeen content to give the circle of hospitality a diameter of six months;\nbut if they didn’t say he was to stay all summer as well it was only\nbecause this was more than they ventured to hope.  I remember that at\ndinner that evening he wore slippers, new and predominantly purple, of\nsome queer carpet-stuff; but the Mulvilles were still in the stage of\nsupposing that he might be snatched from them by higher bidders.  At a\nlater time they grew, poor dears, to fear no snatching; but theirs was a\nfidelity which needed no help from competition to make them proud.\nWonderful indeed as, when all was said, you inevitably pronounced Frank\nSaltram, it was not to be overlooked that the Kent Mulvilles were in\ntheir way still more extraordinary: as striking an instance as could\neasily be encountered of the familiar truth that remarkable men find\nremarkable conveniences.\n\nThey had sent for me from Wimbledon to come out and dine, and there had\nbeen an implication in Adelaide’s note—judged by her notes alone she\nmight have been thought silly—that it was a case in which something\nmomentous was to be determined or done.  I had never known them not be in\na “state” about somebody, and I dare say I tried to be droll on this\npoint in accepting their invitation.  On finding myself in the presence\nof their latest discovery I had not at first felt irreverence droop—and,\nthank heaven, I have never been absolutely deprived of that alternative\nin Mr. Saltram’s company.  I saw, however—I hasten to declare it—that\ncompared to this specimen their other phoenixes had been birds of\ninconsiderable feather, and I afterwards took credit to myself for not\nhaving even in primal bewilderments made a mistake about the essence of\nthe man.  He had an incomparable gift; I never was blind to it—it dazzles\nme still.  It dazzles me perhaps even more in remembrance than in fact,\nfor I’m not unaware that for so rare a subject the imagination goes to\nsome expense, inserting a jewel here and there or giving a twist to a\nplume.  How the art of portraiture would rejoice in this figure if the\nart of portraiture had only the canvas!  Nature, in truth, had largely\nrounded it, and if memory, hovering about it, sometimes holds her breath,\nthis is because the voice that comes back was really golden.\n\nThough the great man was an inmate and didn’t dress, he kept dinner on\nthis occasion waiting, and the first words he uttered on coming into the\nroom were an elated announcement to Mulville that he had found out\nsomething.  Not catching the allusion and gaping doubtless a little at\nhis face, I privately asked Adelaide what he had found out.  I shall\nnever forget the look she gave me as she replied: “Everything!”  She\nreally believed it.  At that moment, at any rate, he had found out that\nthe mercy of the Mulvilles was infinite.  He had previously of course\ndiscovered, as I had myself for that matter, that their dinners were\nsoignés.  Let me not indeed, in saying this, neglect to declare that I\nshall falsify my counterfeit if I seem to hint that there was in his\nnature any ounce of calculation.  He took whatever came, but he never\nplotted for it, and no man who was so much of an absorbent can ever have\nbeen so little of a parasite.  He had a system of the universe, but he\nhad no system of sponging—that was quite hand-to-mouth.  He had fine\ngross easy senses, but it was not his good-natured appetite that wrought\nconfusion.  If he had loved us for our dinners we could have paid with\nour dinners, and it would have been a great economy of finer matter.  I\nmake free in these connexions with the plural possessive because if I was\nnever able to do what the Mulvilles did, and people with still bigger\nhouses and simpler charities, I met, first and last, every demand of\nreflexion, of emotion—particularly perhaps those of gratitude and of\nresentment.  No one, I think, paid the tribute of giving him up so often,\nand if it’s rendering honour to borrow wisdom I’ve a right to talk of my\nsacrifices.  He yielded lessons as the sea yields fish—I lived for a\nwhile on this diet.  Sometimes it almost appeared to me that his massive\nmonstrous failure—if failure after all it was—had been designed for my\nprivate recreation.  He fairly pampered my curiosity; but the history of\nthat experience would take me too far.  This is not the large canvas I\njust now spoke of, and I wouldn’t have approached him with my present\nhand had it been a question of all the features.  Frank Saltram’s\nfeatures, for artistic purposes, are verily the anecdotes that are to be\ngathered.  Their name is legion, and this is only one, of which the\ninterest is that it concerns even more closely several other persons.\nSuch episodes, as one looks back, are the little dramas that made up the\ninnumerable facets of the big drama—which is yet to be reported.\n\n\n\n\nII\n\n\nIT is furthermore remarkable that though the two stories are distinct—my\nown, as it were, and this other—they equally began, in a manner, the\nfirst night of my acquaintance with Frank Saltram, the night I came back\nfrom Wimbledon so agitated with a new sense of life that, in London, for\nthe very thrill of it, I could only walk home.  Walking and swinging my\nstick, I overtook, at Buckingham Gate, George Gravener, and George\nGravener’s story may be said to have begun with my making him, as our\npaths lay together, come home with me for a talk.  I duly remember, let\nme parenthesise, that it was still more that of another person, and also\nthat several years were to elapse before it was to extend to a second\nchapter.  I had much to say to him, none the less, about my visit to the\nMulvilles, whom he more indifferently knew, and I was at any rate so\namusing that for long afterwards he never encountered me without asking\nfor news of the old man of the sea.  I hadn’t said Mr. Saltram was old,\nand it was to be seen that he was of an age to outweather George\nGravener.  I had at that time a lodging in Ebury Street, and Gravener was\nstaying at his brother’s empty house in Eaton Square.  At Cambridge, five\nyears before, even in our devastating set, his intellectual power had\nseemed to me almost awful.  Some one had once asked me privately, with\nblanched cheeks, what it was then that after all such a mind as that left\nstanding.  “It leaves itself!” I could recollect devoutly replying.  I\ncould smile at present for this remembrance, since before we got to Ebury\nStreet I was struck with the fact that, save in the sense of being well\nset up on his legs, George Gravener had actually ceased to tower.  The\nuniverse he laid low had somehow bloomed again—the usual eminences were\nvisible.  I wondered whether he had lost his humour, or only, dreadful\nthought, had never had any—not even when I had fancied him most\nAristophanesque.  What was the need of appealing to laughter, however, I\ncould enviously enquire, where you might appeal so confidently to\nmeasurement?  Mr. Saltram’s queer figure, his thick nose and hanging lip,\nwere fresh to me: in the light of my old friend’s fine cold symmetry they\npresented mere success in amusing as the refuge of conscious ugliness.\nAlready, at hungry twenty-six, Gravener looked as blank and parliamentary\nas if he were fifty and popular.  In my scrap of a residence—he had a\nworldling’s eye for its futile conveniences, but never a comrade’s joke—I\nsounded Frank Saltram in his ears; a circumstance I mention in order to\nnote that even then I was surprised at his impatience of my enlivenment.\nAs he had never before heard of the personage it took indeed the form of\nimpatience of the preposterous Mulvilles, his relation to whom, like\nmine, had had its origin in an early, a childish intimacy with the young\nAdelaide, the fruit of multiplied ties in the previous generation.  When\nshe married Kent Mulville, who was older than Gravener and I and much\nmore amiable, I gained a friend, but Gravener practically lost one.  We\nreacted in different ways from the form taken by what he called their\ndeplorable social action—the form (the term was also his) of nasty\nsecond-rate gush.  I may have held in my ‘for intérieur’ that the good\npeople at Wimbledon were beautiful fools, but when he sniffed at them I\ncouldn’t help taking the opposite line, for I already felt that even\nshould we happen to agree it would always be for reasons that differed.\nIt came home to me that he was admirably British as, without so much as a\nsociable sneer at my bookbinder, he turned away from the serried rows of\nmy little French library.\n\n“Of course I’ve never seen the fellow, but it’s clear enough he’s a\nhumbug.”\n\n“Clear ‘enough’ is just what it isn’t,” I replied; “if it only were!”\nThat ejaculation on my part must have been the beginning of what was to\nbe later a long ache for final frivolous rest.  Gravener was profound\nenough to remark after a moment that in the first place he couldn’t be\nanything but a Dissenter, and when I answered that the very note of his\nfascination was his extraordinary speculative breadth my friend retorted\nthat there was no cad like your cultivated cad, and that I might depend\nupon discovering—since I had had the levity not already to have\nenquired—that my shining light proceeded, a generation back, from a\nMethodist cheesemonger.  I confess I was struck with his insistence, and\nI said, after reflexion: “It may be—I admit it may be; but why on earth\nare you so sure?”—asking the question mainly to lay him the trap of\nsaying that it was because the poor man didn’t dress for dinner.  He took\nan instant to circumvent my trap and come blandly out the other side.\n\n“Because the Kent Mulvilles have invented him.  They’ve an infallible\nhand for frauds.  All their geese are swans.  They were born to be duped,\nthey like it, they cry for it, they don’t know anything from anything,\nand they disgust one—luckily perhaps!—with Christian charity.”  His\nvehemence was doubtless an accident, but it might have been a strange\nforeknowledge.  I forget what protest I dropped; it was at any rate\nsomething that led him to go on after a moment: “I only ask one\nthing—it’s perfectly simple.  Is a man, in a given case, a real\ngentleman?”\n\n“A real gentleman, my dear fellow—that’s so soon said!”\n\n“Not so soon when he isn’t!  If they’ve got hold of one this time he must\nbe a great rascal!”\n\n“I might feel injured,” I answered, “if I didn’t reflect that they don’t\nrave about me.”\n\n“Don’t be too sure!  I’ll grant that he’s a gentleman,” Gravener\npresently added, “if you’ll admit that he’s a scamp.”\n\n“I don’t know which to admire most, your logic or your benevolence.”\n\nMy friend coloured at this, but he didn’t change the subject.  “Where did\nthey pick him up?”\n\n“I think they were struck with something he had published.”\n\n“I can fancy the dreary thing!”\n\n“I believe they found out he had all sorts of worries and difficulties.”\n\n“That of course wasn’t to be endured, so they jumped at the privilege of\npaying his debts!”  I professed that I knew nothing about his debts, and\nI reminded my visitor that though the dear Mulvilles were angels they\nwere neither idiots nor millionaires.  What they mainly aimed at was\nreuniting Mr. Saltram to his wife.  “I was expecting to hear he has\nbasely abandoned her,” Gravener went on, at this, “and I’m too glad you\ndon’t disappoint me.”\n\nI tried to recall exactly what Mrs. Mulville had told me.  “He didn’t\nleave her—no.  It’s she who has left him.”\n\n“Left him to us?” Gravener asked.  “The monster—many thanks!  I decline\nto take him.”\n\n“You’ll hear more about him in spite of yourself.  I can’t, no, I really\ncan’t resist the impression that he’s a big man.”  I was already\nmastering—to my shame perhaps be it said—just the tone my old friend\nleast liked.\n\n“It’s doubtless only a trifle,” he returned, “but you haven’t happened to\nmention what his reputation’s to rest on.”\n\n“Why on what I began by boring you with—his extraordinary mind.”\n\n“As exhibited in his writings?”\n\n“Possibly in his writings, but certainly in his talk, which is far and\naway the richest I ever listened to.”\n\n“And what’s it all about?”\n\n“My dear fellow, don’t ask me!  About everything!” I pursued, reminding\nmyself of poor Adelaide.  “About his ideas of things,” I then more\ncharitably added.  “You must have heard him to know what I mean—it’s\nunlike anything that ever was heard.”  I coloured, I admit, I overcharged\na little, for such a picture was an anticipation of Saltram’s later\ndevelopment and still more of my fuller acquaintance with him.  However,\nI really expressed, a little lyrically perhaps, my actual imagination of\nhim when I proceeded to declare that, in a cloud of tradition, of legend,\nhe might very well go down to posterity as the greatest of all great\ntalkers.  Before we parted George Gravener had wondered why such a row\nshould be made about a chatterbox the more and why he should be pampered\nand pensioned.  The greater the wind-bag the greater the calamity.  Out\nof proportion to everything else on earth had come to be this wagging of\nthe tongue.  We were drenched with talk—our wretched age was dying of it.\nI differed from him here sincerely, only going so far as to concede, and\ngladly, that we were drenched with sound.  It was not however the mere\nspeakers who were killing us—it was the mere stammerers.  Fine talk was\nas rare as it was refreshing—the gift of the gods themselves, the one\nstarry spangle on the ragged cloak of humanity.  How many men were there\nwho rose to this privilege, of how many masters of conversation could he\nboast the acquaintance?  Dying of talk?—why we were dying of the lack of\nit!  Bad writing wasn’t talk, as many people seemed to think, and even\ngood wasn’t always to be compared to it.  From the best talk indeed the\nbest writing had something to learn.  I fancifully added that we too\nshould peradventure be gilded by the legend, should be pointed at for\nhaving listened, for having actually heard.  Gravener, who had glanced at\nhis watch and discovered it was midnight, found to all this a retort\nbeautifully characteristic of him.\n\n“There’s one little fact to be borne in mind in the presence equally of\nthe best talk and of the worst.”  He looked, in saying this, as if he\nmeant great things, and I was sure he could only mean once more that\nneither of them mattered if a man wasn’t a real gentleman.  Perhaps it\nwas what he did mean; he deprived me however of the exultation of being\nright by putting the truth in a slightly different way.  “The only thing\nthat really counts for one’s estimate of a person is his conduct.”  He\nhad his watch still in his palm, and I reproached him with unfair play in\nhaving ascertained beforehand that it was now the hour at which I always\ngave in.  My pleasantry so far failed to mollify him that he promptly\nadded that to the rule he had just enunciated there was absolutely no\nexception.\n\n“None whatever?”\n\n“None whatever.”\n\n“Trust me then to try to be good at any price!” I laughed as I went with\nhim to the door.  “I declare I will be, if I have to be horrible!”\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\n\nIF that first night was one of the liveliest, or at any rate was the\nfreshest, of my exaltations, there was another, four years later, that\nwas one of my great discomposures.  Repetition, I well knew by this time,\nwas the secret of Saltram’s power to alienate, and of course one would\nnever have seen him at his finest if one hadn’t seen him in his remorses.\nThey set in mainly at this season and were magnificent, elemental,\norchestral.  I was quite aware that one of these atmospheric disturbances\nwas now due; but none the less, in our arduous attempt to set him on his\nfeet as a lecturer, it was impossible not to feel that two failures were\na large order, as we said, for a short course of five.  This was the\nsecond time, and it was past nine o’clock; the audience, a muster\nunprecedented and really encouraging, had fortunately the attitude of\nblandness that might have been looked for in persons whom the promise of\n(if I’m not mistaken) An Analysis of Primary Ideas had drawn to the\nneighbourhood of Upper Baker Street.  There was in those days in that\nregion a petty lecture-hall to be secured on terms as moderate as the\nfunds left at our disposal by the irrepressible question of the\nmaintenance of five small Saltrams—I include the mother—and one large\none.  By the time the Saltrams, of different sizes, were all maintained\nwe had pretty well poured out the oil that might have lubricated the\nmachinery for enabling the most original of men to appear to maintain\nthem.\n\nIt was I, the other time, who had been forced into the breach, standing\nup there for an odious lamplit moment to explain to half a dozen thin\nbenches, where earnest brows were virtuously void of anything so cynical\nas a suspicion, that we couldn’t so much as put a finger on Mr. Saltram.\nThere was nothing to plead but that our scouts had been out from the\nearly hours and that we were afraid that on one of his walks abroad—he\ntook one, for meditation, whenever he was to address such a company—some\naccident had disabled or delayed him.  The meditative walks were a\nfiction, for he never, that any one could discover, prepared anything but\na magnificent prospectus; hence his circulars and programmes, of which I\npossess an almost complete collection, are the solemn ghosts of\ngenerations never born.  I put the case, as it seemed to me, at the best;\nbut I admit I had been angry, and Kent Mulville was shocked at my want of\npublic optimism.  This time therefore I left the excuses to his more\npractised patience, only relieving myself in response to a direct appeal\nfrom a young lady next whom, in the hall, I found myself sitting.  My\nposition was an accident, but if it had been calculated the reason would\nscarce have eluded an observer of the fact that no one else in the room\nhad an approach to an appearance.  Our philosopher’s “tail” was\ndeplorably limp.  This visitor was the only person who looked at her\nease, who had come a little in the spirit of adventure.  She seemed to\ncarry amusement in her handsome young head, and her presence spoke, a\nlittle mystifyingly, of a sudden extension of Saltram’s sphere of\ninfluence.  He was doing better than we hoped, and he had chosen such an\noccasion, of all occasions, to succumb to heaven knew which of his fond\ninfirmities.  The young lady produced an impression of auburn hair and\nblack velvet, and had on her other hand a companion of obscurer type,\npresumably a waiting-maid.  She herself might perhaps have been a foreign\ncountess, and before she addressed me I had beguiled our sorry interval\nby finding in her a vague recall of the opening of some novel of Madame\nSand.  It didn’t make her more fathomable to pass in a few minutes from\nthis to the certitude that she was American; it simply engendered\ndepressing reflexions as to the possible check to contributions from\nBoston.  She asked me if, as a person apparently more initiated, I would\nrecommend further waiting, and I answered that if she considered I was on\nmy honour I would privately deprecate it.  Perhaps she didn’t; at any\nrate our talk took a turn that prolonged it till she became aware we were\nleft almost alone.  I presently ascertained she knew Mrs. Saltram, and\nthis explained in a manner the miracle.  The brotherhood of the friends\nof the husband was as nothing to the brotherhood, or perhaps I should say\nthe sisterhood, of the friends of the wife.  Like the Kent Mulvilles I\nbelonged to both fraternities, and even better than they I think I had\nsounded the abyss of Mrs. Saltram’s wrongs.  She bored me to extinction,\nand I knew but too well how she had bored her husband; but there were\nthose who stood by her, the most efficient of whom were indeed the\nhandful of poor Saltram’s backers.  They did her liberal justice, whereas\nher mere patrons and partisans had nothing but hatred for our\nphilosopher.  I’m bound to say it was we, however—we of both camps, as it\nwere—who had always done most for her.\n\nI thought my young lady looked rich—I scarcely knew why; and I hoped she\nhad put her hand in her pocket.  I soon made her out, however, not at all\na fine fanatic—she was but a generous, irresponsible enquirer.  She had\ncome to England to see her aunt, and it was at her aunt’s she had met the\ndreary lady we had all so much on our mind.  I saw she’d help to pass the\ntime when she observed that it was a pity this lady wasn’t intrinsically\nmore interesting.  That was refreshing, for it was an article of faith in\nMrs. Saltram’s circle—at least among those who scorned to know her horrid\nhusband—that she was attractive on her merits.  She was in truth a most\nordinary person, as Saltram himself would have been if he hadn’t been a\nprodigy.  The question of vulgarity had no application to him, but it was\na measure his wife kept challenging you to apply.  I hasten to add that\nthe consequences of your doing so were no sufficient reason for his\nhaving left her to starve.  “He doesn’t seem to have much force of\ncharacter,” said my young lady; at which I laughed out so loud that my\ndeparting friends looked back at me over their shoulders as if I were\nmaking a joke of their discomfiture.  My joke probably cost Saltram a\nsubscription or two, but it helped me on with my interlocutress.  “She\nsays he drinks like a fish,” she sociably continued, “and yet she allows\nthat his mind’s wonderfully clear.”  It was amusing to converse with a\npretty girl who could talk of the clearness of Saltram’s mind.  I\nexpected next to hear she had been assured he was awfully clever.  I\ntried to tell her—I had it almost on my conscience—what was the proper\nway to regard him; an effort attended perhaps more than ever on this\noccasion with the usual effect of my feeling that I wasn’t after all very\nsure of it.  She had come to-night out of high curiosity—she had wanted\nto learn this proper way for herself.  She had read some of his papers\nand hadn’t understood them; but it was at home, at her aunt’s, that her\ncuriosity had been kindled—kindled mainly by his wife’s remarkable\nstories of his want of virtue.  “I suppose they ought to have kept me\naway,” my companion dropped, “and I suppose they’d have done so if I\nhadn’t somehow got an idea that he’s fascinating.  In fact Mrs. Saltram\nherself says he is.”\n\n“So you came to see where the fascination resides?  Well, you’ve seen!”\n\nMy young lady raised fine eyebrows.  “Do you mean in his bad faith?”\n\n“In the extraordinary effects of it; his possession, that is, of some\nquality or other that condemns us in advance to forgive him the\nhumiliation, as I may call it, to which he has subjected us.”\n\n“The humiliation?”\n\n“Why mine, for instance, as one of his guarantors, before you as the\npurchaser of a ticket.”\n\nShe let her charming gay eyes rest on me.  “You don’t look humiliated a\nbit, and if you did I should let you off, disappointed as I am; for the\nmysterious quality you speak of is just the quality I came to see.”\n\n“Oh, you can’t ‘see’ it!” I cried.\n\n“How then do you get at it?”\n\n“You don’t!  You mustn’t suppose he’s good-looking,” I added.\n\n“Why his wife says he’s lovely!”\n\nMy hilarity may have struck her as excessive, but I confess it broke out\nafresh.  Had she acted only in obedience to this singular plea, so\ncharacteristic, on Mrs. Saltram’s part, of what was irritating in the\nnarrowness of that lady’s point of view?  “Mrs. Saltram,” I explained,\n“undervalues him where he’s strongest, so that, to make up for it\nperhaps, she overpraises him where he’s weak.  He’s not, assuredly,\nsuperficially attractive; he’s middle-aged, fat, featureless save for his\ngreat eyes.”\n\n“Yes, his great eyes,” said my young lady attentively.  She had evidently\nheard all about his great eyes—the beaux yeux for which alone we had\nreally done it all.\n\n“They’re tragic and splendid—lights on a dangerous coast.  But he moves\nbadly and dresses worse, and altogether he’s anything but smart.”\n\nMy companion, who appeared to reflect on this, after a moment appealed.\n“Do you call him a real gentleman?”\n\nI started slightly at the question, for I had a sense of recognising it:\nGeorge Gravener, years before, that first flushed night, had put me face\nto face with it.  It had embarrassed me then, but it didn’t embarrass me\nnow, for I had lived with it and overcome it and disposed of it.  “A real\ngentleman?  Emphatically not!”\n\nMy promptitude surprised her a little, but I quickly felt how little it\nwas to Gravener I was now talking.  “Do you say that because he’s—what do\nyou call it in England?—of humble extraction?”\n\n“Not a bit.  His father was a country school-master and his mother the\nwidow of a sexton, but that has nothing to do with it.  I say it simply\nbecause I know him well.”\n\n“But isn’t it an awful drawback?”\n\n“Awful—quite awful.”\n\n“I mean isn’t it positively fatal?”\n\n“Fatal to what?  Not to his magnificent vitality.”\n\nAgain she had a meditative moment.  “And is his magnificent vitality the\ncause of his vices?”\n\n“Your questions are formidable, but I’m glad you put them.  I was\nthinking of his noble intellect.  His vices, as you say, have been much\nexaggerated: they consist mainly after all in one comprehensive defect.”\n\n“A want of will?”\n\n“A want of dignity.”\n\n“He doesn’t recognise his obligations?”\n\n“On the contrary, he recognises them with effusion, especially in public:\nhe smiles and bows and beckons across the street to them.  But when they\npass over he turns away, and he speedily loses them in the crowd.  The\nrecognition’s purely spiritual—it isn’t in the least social.  So he\nleaves all his belongings to other people to take care of.  He accepts\nfavours, loans, sacrifices—all with nothing more deterrent than an agony\nof shame.  Fortunately we’re a little faithful band, and we do what we\ncan.”  I held my tongue about the natural children, engendered, to the\nnumber of three, in the wantonness of his youth.  I only remarked that he\ndid make efforts—often tremendous ones.  “But the efforts,” I said,\n“never come to much: the only things that come to much are the\nabandonments, the surrenders.”\n\n“And how much do they come to?”\n\n“You’re right to put it as if we had a big bill to pay, but, as I’ve told\nyou before, your questions are rather terrible.  They come, these mere\nexercises of genius, to a great sum total of poetry, of philosophy, a\nmighty mass of speculation, notation, quotation.  The genius is there,\nyou see, to meet the surrender; but there’s no genius to support the\ndefence.”\n\n“But what is there, after all, at his age, to show?”\n\n“In the way of achievement recognised and reputation established?” I\nasked.  “To ‘show’ if you will, there isn’t much, since his writing,\nmostly, isn’t as fine, isn’t certainly as showy, as his talk.  Moreover\ntwo-thirds of his work are merely colossal projects and announcements.\n‘Showing’ Frank Saltram is often a poor business,” I went on: “we\nendeavoured, you’ll have observed, to show him to-night!  However, if he\nhad lectured he’d have lectured divinely.  It would just have been his\ntalk.”\n\n“And what would his talk just have been?”\n\nI was conscious of some ineffectiveness, as well perhaps as of a little\nimpatience, as I replied: “The exhibition of a splendid intellect.”  My\nyoung lady looked not quite satisfied at this, but as I wasn’t prepared\nfor another question I hastily pursued: “The sight of a great suspended\nswinging crystal—huge lucid lustrous, a block of light—flashing back\nevery impression of life and every possibility of thought!”\n\nThis gave her something to turn over till we had passed out to the dusky\nporch of the hall, in front of which the lamps of a quiet brougham were\nalmost the only thing Saltram’s treachery hadn’t extinguished.  I went\nwith her to the door of her carriage, out of which she leaned a moment\nafter she had thanked me and taken her seat.  Her smile even in the\ndarkness was pretty.  “I do want to see that crystal!”\n\n“You’ve only to come to the next lecture.”\n\n“I go abroad in a day or two with my aunt.”\n\n“Wait over till next week,” I suggested.  “It’s quite worth it.”\n\nShe became grave.  “Not unless he really comes!”  At which the brougham\nstarted off, carrying her away too fast, fortunately for my manners, to\nallow me to exclaim “Ingratitude!”\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\n\nMRS. SALTRAM made a great affair of her right to be informed where her\nhusband had been the second evening he failed to meet his audience.  She\ncame to me to ascertain, but I couldn’t satisfy her, for in spite of my\ningenuity I remained in ignorance.  It wasn’t till much later that I\nfound this had not been the case with Kent Mulville, whose hope for the\nbest never twirled the thumbs of him more placidly than when he happened\nto know the worst.  He had known it on the occasion I speak of—that is\nimmediately after.  He was impenetrable then, but ultimately confessed.\nWhat he confessed was more than I shall now venture to make public.  It\nwas of course familiar to me that Saltram was incapable of keeping the\nengagements which, after their separation, he had entered into with\nregard to his wife, a deeply wronged, justly resentful, quite\nirreproachable and insufferable person.  She often appeared at my\nchambers to talk over his lapses; for if, as she declared, she had washed\nher hands of him, she had carefully preserved the water of this ablution,\nwhich she handed about for analysis.  She had arts of her own of exciting\none’s impatience, the most infallible of which was perhaps her assumption\nthat we were kind to her because we liked her.  In reality her personal\nfall had been a sort of social rise—since I had seen the moment when, in\nour little conscientious circle, her desolation almost made her the\nfashion.  Her voice was grating and her children ugly; moreover she hated\nthe good Mulvilles, whom I more and more loved.  They were the people who\nby doing most for her husband had in the long run done most for herself;\nand the warm confidence with which he had laid his length upon them was a\npressure gentle compared with her stiffer persuadability.  I’m bound to\nsay he didn’t criticise his benefactors, though practically he got tired\nof them; she, however, had the highest standards about eleemosynary\nforms.  She offered the odd spectacle of a spirit puffed up by\ndependence, and indeed it had introduced her to some excellent society.\nShe pitied me for not knowing certain people who aided her and whom she\ndoubtless patronised in turn for their luck in not knowing me.  I dare\nsay I should have got on with her better if she had had a ray of\nimagination—if it had occasionally seemed to occur to her to regard\nSaltram’s expressions of his nature in any other manner than as separate\nsubjects of woe.  They were all flowers of his character, pearls strung\non an endless thread; but she had a stubborn little way of challenging\nthem one after the other, as if she never suspected that he had a\ncharacter, such as it was, or that deficiencies might be organic; the\nirritating effect of a mind incapable of a generalisation.  One might\ndoubtless have overdone the idea that there was a general licence for\nsuch a man; but if this had happened it would have been through one’s\nfeeling that there could be none for such a woman.\n\nI recognised her superiority when I asked her about the aunt of the\ndisappointed young lady: it sounded like a sentence from an\nEnglish-French or other phrase-book.  She triumphed in what she told me\nand she may have triumphed still more in what she withheld.  My friend of\nthe other evening, Miss Anvoy, had but lately come to England; Lady\nCoxon, the aunt, had been established here for years in consequence of\nher marriage with the late Sir Gregory of that name.  She had a house in\nthe Regent’s Park, a Bath-chair and a fernery; and above all she had\nsympathy.  Mrs. Saltram had made her acquaintance through mutual friends.\nThis vagueness caused me to feel how much I was out of it and how large\nan independent circle Mrs. Saltram had at her command.  I should have\nbeen glad to know more about the disappointed young lady, but I felt I\nshould know most by not depriving her of her advantage, as she might have\nmysterious means of depriving me of my knowledge.  For the present,\nmoreover, this experience was stayed, Lady Coxon having in fact gone\nabroad accompanied by her niece.  The niece, besides being immensely\nclever, was an heiress, Mrs. Saltram said; the only daughter and the\nlight of the eyes of some great American merchant, a man, over there, of\nendless indulgences and dollars.  She had pretty clothes and pretty\nmanners, and she had, what was prettier still, the great thing of all.\nThe great thing of all for Mrs. Saltram was always sympathy, and she\nspoke as if during the absence of these ladies she mightn’t know where to\nturn for it.  A few months later indeed, when they had come back, her\ntone perceptibly changed: she alluded to them, on my leading her up to\nit, rather as to persons in her debt for favours received.  What had\nhappened I didn’t know, but I saw it would take only a little more or a\nlittle less to make her speak of them as thankless subjects of social\ncountenance—people for whom she had vainly tried to do something.  I\nconfess I saw how it wouldn’t be in a mere week or two that I should rid\nmyself of the image of Ruth Anvoy, in whose very name, when I learnt it,\nI found something secretly to like.  I should probably neither see her\nnor hear of her again: the knight’s widow (he had been mayor of\nClockborough) would pass away and the heiress would return to her\ninheritance.  I gathered with surprise that she had not communicated to\nhis wife the story of her attempt to hear Mr..Saltram, and I founded this\nreticence on the easy supposition that Mrs. Saltram had fatigued by\noverpressure the spring of the sympathy of which she boasted.  The girl\nat any rate would forget the small adventure, be distracted, take a\nhusband; besides which she would lack occasion to repeat her experiment.\n\nWe clung to the idea of the brilliant course, delivered without an\naccident, that, as a lecturer, would still make the paying public aware\nof our great man, but the fact remained that in the case of an\ninspiration so unequal there was treachery, there was fallacy at least,\nin the very conception of a series.  In our scrutiny of ways and means we\nwere inevitably subject to the old convention of the synopsis, the\nsyllabus, partly of course not to lose the advantage of his grand free\nhand in drawing up such things; but for myself I laughed at our playbills\neven while I stickled for them.  It was indeed amusing work to be\nscrupulous for Frank Saltram, who also at moments laughed about it, so\nfar as the comfort of a sigh so unstudied as to be cheerful might pass\nfor such a sound.  He admitted with a candour all his own that he was in\ntruth only to be depended on in the Mulvilles’ drawing-room.  “Yes,” he\nsuggestively allowed, “it’s there, I think, that I’m at my best; quite\nlate, when it gets toward eleven—and if I’ve not been too much worried.”\nWe all knew what too much worry meant; it meant too enslaved for the hour\nto the superstition of sobriety.  On the Saturdays I used to bring my\nportmanteau, so as not to have to think of eleven o’clock trains.  I had\na bold theory that as regards this temple of talk and its altars of\ncushioned chintz, its pictures and its flowers, its large fireside and\nclear lamplight, we might really arrive at something if the Mulvilles\nwould but charge for admission.  Here it was, however, that they\nshamelessly broke down; as there’s a flaw in every perfection this was\nthe inexpugnable refuge of their egotism.  They declined to make their\nsaloon a market, so that Saltram’s golden words continued the sole coin\nthat rang there.  It can have happened to no man, however, to be paid a\ngreater price than such an enchanted hush as surrounded him on his\ngreatest nights.  The most profane, on these occasions, felt a presence;\nall minor eloquence grew dumb.  Adelaide Mulville, for the pride of her\nhospitality, anxiously watched the door or stealthily poked the fire.  I\nused to call it the music-room, for we had anticipated Bayreuth.  The\nvery gates of the kingdom of light seemed to open and the horizon of\nthought to flash with the beauty of a sunrise at sea.\n\nIn the consideration of ways and means, the sittings of our little board,\nwe were always conscious of the creak of Mrs. Saltram’s shoes.  She\nhovered, she interrupted, she almost presided, the state of affairs being\nmostly such as to supply her with every incentive for enquiring what was\nto be done next.  It was the pressing pursuit of this knowledge that, in\nconcatenations of omnibuses and usually in very wet weather, led her so\noften to my door.  She thought us spiritless creatures with editors and\npublishers; but she carried matters to no great effect when she\npersonally pushed into back-shops.  She wanted all moneys to be paid to\nherself: they were otherwise liable to such strange adventures.  They\ntrickled away into the desert—they were mainly at best, alas, a slender\nstream.  The editors and the publishers were the last people to take this\nremarkable thinker at the valuation that has now pretty well come to be\nestablished.  The former were half-distraught between the desire to “cut”\nhim and the difficulty of finding a crevice for their shears; and when a\nvolume on this or that portentous subject was proposed to the latter they\nsuggested alternative titles which, as reported to our friend, brought\ninto his face the noble blank melancholy that sometimes made it handsome.\nThe title of an unwritten book didn’t after all much matter, but some\nmasterpiece of Saltram’s may have died in his bosom of the shudder with\nwhich it was then convulsed.  The ideal solution, failing the fee at Kent\nMulville’s door, would have been some system of subscription to projected\ntreatises with their non-appearance provided for—provided for, I mean, by\nthe indulgence of subscribers.  The author’s real misfortune was that\nsubscribers were so wretchedly literal.  When they tastelessly enquired\nwhy publication hadn’t ensued I was tempted to ask who in the world had\never been so published.  Nature herself had brought him out in voluminous\nform, and the money was simply a deposit on borrowing the work.\n\n\n\n\nV\n\n\nI WAS doubtless often a nuisance to my friends in those years; but there\nwere sacrifices I declined to make, and I never passed the hat to George\nGravener.  I never forgot our little discussion in Ebury Street, and I\nthink it stuck in my throat to have to treat him to the avowal I had\nfound so easy to Mss Anvoy.  It had cost me nothing to confide to this\ncharming girl, but it would have cost me much to confide to the friend of\nmy youth, that the character of the “real gentleman” wasn’t an attribute\nof the man I took such pains for.  Was this because I had already\ngeneralised to the point of perceiving that women are really the\nunfastidious sex?  I knew at any rate that Gravener, already quite in\nview but still hungry and frugal, had naturally enough more ambition than\ncharity.  He had sharp aims for stray sovereigns, being in view most from\nthe tall steeple of Clockborough.  His immediate ambition was to occupy à\nlui seul the field of vision of that smokily-seeing city, and all his\nmovements and postures were calculated for the favouring angle.  The\nmovement of the hand as to the pocket had thus to alternate gracefully\nwith the posture of the hand on the heart.  He talked to Clockborough in\nshort only less beguilingly than Frank Saltram talked to his electors;\nwith the difference to our credit, however, that we had already voted and\nthat our candidate had no antagonist but himself.  He had more than once\nbeen at Wimbledon—it was Mrs. Mulville’s work not mine—and by the time\nthe claret was served had seen the god descend.  He took more pains to\nswing his censer than I had expected, but on our way back to town he\nforestalled any little triumph I might have been so artless as to express\nby the observation that such a man was—a hundred times!—a man to use and\nnever a man to be used by.  I remember that this neat remark humiliated\nme almost as much as if virtually, in the fever of broken slumbers, I\nhadn’t often made it myself.  The difference was that on Gravener’s part\na force attached to it that could never attach to it on mine.  He was\nable to use people—he had the machinery; and the irony of Saltram’s being\nmade showy at Clockborough came out to me when he said, as if he had no\nmemory of our original talk and the idea were quite fresh to him: “I hate\nhis type, you know, but I’ll be hanged if I don’t put some of those\nthings in.  I can find a place for them: we might even find a place for\nthe fellow himself.”  I myself should have had some fear—not, I need\nscarcely say, for the “things” themselves, but for some other things very\nnear them; in fine for the rest of my eloquence.\n\nLater on I could see that the oracle of Wimbledon was not in this case so\nappropriate as he would have been had the polities of the gods only\ncoincided more exactly with those of the party.  There was a distinct\nmoment when, without saying anything more definite to me, Gravener\nentertained the idea of annexing Mr. Saltram.  Such a project was\ndelusive, for the discovery of analogies between his body of doctrine and\nthat pressed from headquarters upon Clockborough—the bottling, in a word,\nof the air of those lungs for convenient public uncorking in\ncorn-exchanges—was an experiment for which no one had the leisure.  The\nonly thing would have been to carry him massively about, paid, caged,\nclipped; to turn him on for a particular occasion in a particular\nchannel.  Frank Saltram’s channel, however, was essentially not\ncalculable, and there was no knowing what disastrous floods might have\nensued.  For what there would have been to do The Empire, the great\nnewspaper, was there to look to; but it was no new misfortune that there\nwere delicate situations in which The Empire broke down.  In fine there\nwas an instinctive apprehension that a clever young journalist\ncommissioned to report on Mr. Saltram might never come back from the\nerrand.  No one knew better than George Gravener that that was a time\nwhen prompt returns counted double.  If he therefore found our friend an\nexasperating waste of orthodoxy it was because of his being, as he said,\npoor Gravener, up in the clouds, not because he was down in the dust.\nThe man would have been, just as he was, a real enough gentleman if he\ncould have helped to put in a real gentleman.  Gravener’s great objection\nto the actual member was that he was not one.\n\nLady Coxon had a fine old house, a house with “grounds,” at Clockborough,\nwhich she had let; but after she returned from abroad I learned from Mrs.\nSaltram that the lease had fallen in and that she had gone down to resume\npossession.  I could see the faded red livery, the big square shoulders,\nthe high-walled garden of this decent abode.  As the rumble of\ndissolution grew louder the suitor would have pressed his suit, and I\nfound myself hoping the politics of the late Mayor’s widow wouldn’t be\nsuch as to admonish her to ask him to dinner; perhaps indeed I went so\nfar as to pray, they would naturally form a bar to any contact.  I tried\nto focus the many-buttoned page, in the daily airing, as he perhaps even\npushed the Bath-chair over somebody’s toes.  I was destined to hear, none\nthe less, through Mrs. Saltram—who, I afterwards learned, was in\ncorrespondence with Lady Coxon’s housekeeper—that Gravener was known to\nhave spoken of the habitation I had in my eye as the pleasantest thing at\nClockborough.  On his part, I was sure, this was the voice not of envy\nbut of experience.  The vivid scene was now peopled, and I could see him\nin the old-time garden with Miss Anvoy, who would be certain, and very\njustly, to think him good-looking.  It would be too much to describe\nmyself as troubled by this play of surmise; but I occur to remember the\nrelief, singular enough, of feeling it suddenly brushed away by an\nannoyance really much greater; an annoyance the result of its happening\nto come over me about that time with a rush that I was simply ashamed of\nFrank Saltram.  There were limits after all, and my mark at last had been\nreached.\n\nI had had my disgusts, if I may allow myself to-day such an expression;\nbut this was a supreme revolt.  Certain things cleared up in my mind,\ncertain values stood out.  It was all very well to have an unfortunate\ntemperament; there was nothing so unfortunate as to have, for practical\npurposes, nothing else.  I avoided George Gravener at this moment and\nreflected that at such a time I should do so most effectually by leaving\nEngland.  I wanted to forget Frank Saltram—that was all.  I didn’t want\nto do anything in the world to him but that.  Indignation had withered on\nthe stalk, and I felt that one could pity him as much as one ought only\nby never thinking of him again.  It wasn’t for anything he had done to\nme; it was for what he had done to the Mulvilles.  Adelaide cried about\nit for a week, and her husband, profiting by the example so signally\ngiven him of the fatal effect of a want of character, left the letter,\nthe drop too much, unanswered.  The letter, an incredible one, addressed\nby Saltram to Wimbledon during a stay with the Pudneys at Ramsgate, was\nthe central feature of the incident, which, however, had many features,\neach more painful than whichever other we compared it with.  The Pudneys\nhad behaved shockingly, but that was no excuse.  Base ingratitude, gross\nindecency—one had one’s choice only of such formulas as that the more\nthey fitted the less they gave one rest.  These are dead aches now, and I\nam under no obligation, thank heaven, to be definite about the business.\nThere are things which if I had had to tell them—well, would have stopped\nme off here altogether.\n\nI went abroad for the general election, and if I don’t know how much, on\nthe Continent, I forgot, I at least know how much I missed, him.  At a\ndistance, in a foreign land, ignoring, abjuring, unlearning him, I\ndiscovered what he had done for me.  I owed him, oh unmistakeably,\ncertain noble conceptions; I had lighted my little taper at his smoky\nlamp, and lo it continued to twinkle.  But the light it gave me just\nshowed me how much more I wanted.  I was pursued of course by letters\nfrom Mrs. Saltram which I didn’t scruple not to read, though quite aware\nher embarrassments couldn’t but be now of the gravest.  I sacrificed to\npropriety by simply putting them away, and this is how, one day as my\nabsence drew to an end, my eye, while I rummaged in my desk for another\npaper, was caught by a name on a leaf that had detached itself from the\npacket.  The allusion was to Miss Anvoy, who, it appeared, was engaged to\nbe married to Mr. George Gravener; and the news was two months old.  A\ndirect question of Mrs. Saltram’s had thus remained unanswered—she had\nenquired of me in a postscript what sort of man this aspirant to such a\nhand might be.  The great other fact about him just then was that he had\nbeen triumphantly returned for Clockborough in the interest of the party\nthat had swept the country—so that I might easily have referred Mrs.\nSaltram to the journals of the day.  Yet when I at last wrote her that I\nwas coming home and would discharge my accumulated burden by seeing her,\nI but remarked in regard to her question that she must really put it to\nMiss Anvoy.\n\n\n\n\nVI\n\n\nI HAD almost avoided the general election, but some of its consequences,\non my return, had smartly to be faced.  The season, in London, began to\nbreathe again and to flap its folded wings.  Confidence, under the new\nMinistry, was understood to be reviving, and one of the symptoms, in a\nsocial body, was a recovery of appetite.  People once more fed together,\nand it happened that, one Saturday night, at somebody’s house, I fed with\nGeorge Gravener.  When the ladies left the room I moved up to where he\nsat and begged to congratulate him.  “On my election?” he asked after a\nmoment; so that I could feign, jocosely, not to have heard of that\ntriumph and to be alluding to the rumour of a victory still more\npersonal.  I dare say I coloured however, for his political success had\nmomentarily passed out of my mind.  What was present to it was that he\nwas to marry that beautiful girl; and yet his question made me conscious\nof some discomposure—I hadn’t intended to put this before everything.  He\nhimself indeed ought gracefully to have done so, and I remember thinking\nthe whole man was in this assumption that in expressing my sense of what\nhe had won I had fixed my thoughts on his “seat.”  We straightened the\nmatter out, and he was so much lighter in hand than I had lately seen him\nthat his spirits might well have been fed from a twofold source.  He was\nso good as to say that he hoped I should soon make the acquaintance of\nMiss Anvoy, who, with her aunt, was presently coming up to town.  Lady\nCoxon, in the country, had been seriously unwell, and this had delayed\ntheir arrival.  I told him I had heard the marriage would be a splendid\none; on which, brightened and humanised by his luck, he laughed and said\n“Do you mean for her?”  When I had again explained what I meant he went\non: “Oh she’s an American, but you’d scarcely know it; unless, perhaps,”\nhe added, “by her being used to more money than most girls in England,\neven the daughters of rich men.  That wouldn’t in the least do for a\nfellow like me, you know, if it wasn’t for the great liberality of her\nfather.  He really has been most kind, and everything’s quite\nsatisfactory.”  He added that his eldest brother had taken a tremendous\nfancy to her and that during a recent visit at Coldfield she had nearly\nwon over Lady Maddock.  I gathered from something he dropped later on\nthat the free-handed gentleman beyond the seas had not made a settlement,\nbut had given a handsome present and was apparently to be looked to,\nacross the water, for other favours.  People are simplified alike by\ngreat contentments and great yearnings, and, whether or no it was\nGravener’s directness that begot my own, I seem to recall that in some\nturn taken by our talk he almost imposed it on me as an act of decorum to\nask if Miss Anvoy had also by chance expectations from her aunt.  My\nenquiry drew out that Lady Coxon, who was the oddest of women, would have\nin any contingency to act under her late husband’s will, which was odder\nstill, saddling her with a mass of queer obligations complicated with\nqueer loopholes.  There were several dreary people, Coxon cousins, old\nmaids, to whom she would have more or less to minister.  Gravener\nlaughed, without saying no, when I suggested that the young lady might\ncome in through a loophole; then suddenly, as if he suspected my turning\na lantern on him, he declared quite dryly: “That’s all rot—one’s moved by\nother springs!”\n\nA fortnight later, at Lady Coxon’s own house, I understood well enough\nthe springs one was moved by.  Gravener had spoken of me there as an old\nfriend, and I received a gracious invitation to dine.  The Knight’s widow\nwas again indisposed—she had succumbed at the eleventh hour; so that I\nfound Miss Anvoy bravely playing hostess without even Gravener’s help,\nsince, to make matters worse, he had just sent up word that the House,\nthe insatiable House, with which he supposed he had contracted for easier\nterms, positively declined to release him.  I was struck with the\ncourage, the grace and gaiety of the young lady left thus to handle the\nfauna and flora of the Regent’s Park.  I did what I could to help her to\nclassify them, after I had recovered from the confusion of seeing her\nslightly disconcerted at perceiving in the guest introduced by her\nintended the gentleman with whom she had had that talk about Frank\nSaltram.  I had at this moment my first glimpse of the fact that she was\na person who could carry a responsibility; but I leave the reader to\njudge of my sense of the aggravation, for either of us, of such a burden,\nwhen I heard the servant announce Mrs. Saltram.  From what immediately\npassed between the two ladies I gathered that the latter had been sent\nfor post-haste to fill the gap created by the absence of the mistress of\nthe house.  “Good!” I remember crying, “she’ll be put by me;” and my\napprehension was promptly justified.  Mrs. Saltram taken in to dinner,\nand taken in as a consequence of an appeal to her amiability, was Mrs.\nSaltram with a vengeance.  I asked myself what Miss Anvoy meant by doing\nsuch things, but the only answer I arrived at was that Gravener was\nverily fortunate.  She hadn’t happened to tell him of her visit to Upper\nBaker Street, but she’d certainly tell him to-morrow; not indeed that\nthis would make him like any better her having had the innocence to\ninvite such a person as Mrs. Saltram on such an occasion.  It could only\nstrike me that I had never seen a young woman put such ignorance into her\ncleverness, such freedom into her modesty; this, I think, was when, after\ndinner, she said to me frankly, with almost jubilant mirth: “Oh you don’t\nadmire Mrs. Saltram?”  Why should I?  This was truly a young person\nwithout guile.  I had briefly to consider before I could reply that my\nobjection to the lady named was the objection often uttered about people\nmet at the social board—I knew all her stories.  Then as Miss Anvoy\nremained momentarily vague I added: “Those about her husband.”\n\n“Oh yes, but there are some new ones.”\n\n“None for me.  Ah novelty would be pleasant!”\n\n“Doesn’t it appear that of late he has been particularly horrid?”\n\n“His fluctuations don’t matter”, I returned, “for at night all cats are\ngrey.  You saw the shade of this one the night we waited for him\ntogether.  What will you have?  He has no dignity.”\n\nMiss Anvoy, who had been introducing with her American distinctness,\nlooked encouragingly round at some of the combinations she had risked.\n“It’s too bad I can’t see him.”\n\n“You mean Gravener won’t let you?”\n\n“I haven’t asked him.  He lets me do everything.”\n\n“But you know he knows him and wonders what some of us see in him.”\n\n“We haven’t happened to talk of him,” the girl said.\n\n“Get him to take you some day out to see the Mulvilles.”\n\n“I thought Mr. Saltram had thrown the Mulvilles over.”\n\n“Utterly.  But that won’t prevent his being planted there again, to bloom\nlike a rose, within a month or two.”\n\nMiss Anvoy thought a moment.  Then, “I should like to see them,” she said\nwith her fostering smile.\n\n“They’re tremendously worth it.  You mustn’t miss them.”\n\n“I’ll make George take me,” she went on as Mrs. Saltram came up to\ninterrupt us.  She sniffed at this unfortunate as kindly as she had\nsmiled at me and, addressing the question to her, continued: “But the\nchance of a lecture—one of the wonderful lectures?  Isn’t there another\ncourse announced?”\n\n“Another?  There are about thirty!” I exclaimed, turning away and feeling\nMrs. Saltram’s little eyes in my back.  A few days after this I heard\nthat Gravener’s marriage was near at hand—was settled for Whitsuntide;\nbut as no invitation had reached me I had my doubts, and there presently\ncame to me in fact the report of a postponement.  Something was the\nmatter; what was the matter was supposed to be that Lady Coxon was now\ncritically ill.  I had called on her after my dinner in the Regent’s\nPark, but I had neither seen her nor seen Miss Anvoy.  I forget to-day\nthe exact order in which, at this period, sundry incidents occurred and\nthe particular stage at which it suddenly struck me, making me catch my\nbreath a little, that the progression, the acceleration, was for all the\nworld that of fine drama.  This was probably rather late in the day, and\nthe exact order doesn’t signify.  What had already occurred was some\naccident determining a more patient wait.  George Gravener, whom I met\nagain, in fact told me as much, but without signs of perturbation.  Lady\nCoxon had to be constantly attended to, and there were other good reasons\nas well.  Lady Coxon had to be so constantly attended to that on the\noccasion of a second attempt in the Regent’s Park I equally failed to\nobtain a sight of her niece.  I judged it discreet in all the conditions\nnot to make a third; but this didn’t matter, for it was through Adelaide\nMulville that the side-wind of the comedy, though I was at first\nunwitting, began to reach me.  I went to Wimbledon at times because\nSaltram was there, and I went at others because he wasn’t.  The Pudneys,\nwho had taken him to Birmingham, had already got rid of him, and we had a\nhorrible consciousness of his wandering roofless, in dishonour, about the\nsmoky Midlands, almost as the injured Lear wandered on the storm-lashed\nheath.  His room, upstairs, had been lately done up (I could hear the\ncrackle of the new chintz) and the difference only made his smirches and\nbruises, his splendid tainted genius, the more tragic.  If he wasn’t\nbarefoot in the mire he was sure to be unconventionally shod.  These were\nthe things Adelaide and I, who were old enough friends to stare at each\nother in silence, talked about when we didn’t speak.  When we spoke it\nwas only about the brilliant girl George Gravener was to marry and whom\nhe had brought out the other Sunday.  I could see that this presentation\nhad been happy, for Mrs. Mulville commemorated it after her sole fashion\nof showing confidence in a new relation.  “She likes me—she likes me”:\nher native humility exulted in that measure of success.  We all knew for\nourselves how she liked those who liked her, and as regards Ruth Anvoy\nshe was more easily won over than Lady Maddock.\n\n\n\n\nVII\n\n\nONE of the consequences, for the Mulvilles, of the sacrifices they made\nfor Frank Saltram was that they had to give up their carriage.  Adelaide\ndrove gently into London in a one-horse greenish thing, an early\nVictorian landau, hired, near at hand, imaginatively, from a broken-down\njobmaster whose wife was in consumption—a vehicle that made people turn\nround all the more when her pensioner sat beside her in a soft white hat\nand a shawl, one of the dear woman’s own.  This was his position and I\ndare say his costume when on an afternoon in July she went to return Miss\nAnvoy’s visit.  The wheel of fate had now revolved, and amid silences\ndeep and exhaustive, compunctions and condonations alike unutterable,\nSaltram was reinstated.  Was it in pride or in penance that Mrs. Mulville\nhad begun immediately to drive him about?  If he was ashamed of his\ningratitude she might have been ashamed of her forgiveness; but she was\nincorrigibly capable of liking him to be conspicuous in the landau while\nshe was in shops or with her acquaintance.  However, if he was in the\npillory for twenty minutes in the Regent’s Park—I mean at Lady Coxon’s\ndoor while his companion paid her call—it wasn’t to the further\nhumiliation of any one concerned that she presently came out for him in\nperson, not even to show either of them what a fool she was that she drew\nhim in to be introduced to the bright young American.  Her account of the\nintroduction I had in its order, but before that, very late in the\nseason, under Gravener’s auspices, I met Miss Anvoy at tea at the House\nof Commons.  The member for Clockborough had gathered a group of pretty\nladies, and the Mulvilles were not of the party.  On the great terrace,\nas I strolled off with her a little, the guest of honour immediately\nexclaimed to me: “I’ve seen him, you know—I’ve seen him!”  She told me\nabout Saltram’s call.\n\n“And how did you find him?”\n\n“Oh so strange!”\n\n“You didn’t like him?”\n\n“I can’t tell till I see him again.”\n\n“You want to do that?”\n\nShe had a pause.  “Immensely.”\n\nWe went no further; I fancied she had become aware Gravener was looking\nat us.  She turned back toward the knot of the others, and I said:\n“Dislike him as much as you will—I see you’re bitten.”\n\n“Bitten?”  I thought she coloured a little.\n\n“Oh it doesn’t matter!” I laughed; “one doesn’t die of it.”\n\n“I hope I shan’t die of anything before I’ve seen more of Mrs. Mulville.”\nI rejoiced with her over plain Adelaide, whom she pronounced the\nloveliest woman she had met in England; but before we separated I\nremarked to her that it was an act of mere humanity to warn her that if\nshe should see more of Frank Saltram—which would be likely to follow on\nany increase of acquaintance with Mrs. Mulville—she might find herself\nflattening her nose against the clear hard pane of an eternal\nquestion—that of the relative, that of the opposed, importances of virtue\nand brains.  She replied that this was surely a subject on which one took\neverything for granted; whereupon I admitted that I had perhaps expressed\nmyself ill.  What I referred to was what I had referred to the night we\nmet in Upper Baker Street—the relative importance (relative to virtue) of\nother gifts.  She asked me if I called virtue a gift—a thing handed to us\nin a parcel on our first birthday; and I declared that this very enquiry\nproved to me the problem had already caught her by the skirt.  She would\nhave help however, the same help I myself had once had, in resisting its\ntendency to make one cross.\n\n“What help do you mean?”\n\n“That of the member for Clockborough.”\n\nShe stared, smiled, then returned: “Why my idea has been to help him!”\n\nShe had helped him—I had his own word for it that at Clockborough her\nbedevilment of the voters had really put him in.  She would do so\ndoubtless again and again, though I heard the very next month that this\nfine faculty had undergone a temporary eclipse.  News of the catastrophe\nfirst came to me from Mrs. Saltram, and it was afterwards confirmed at\nWimbledon: poor Miss Anvoy was in trouble—great disasters in America had\nsuddenly summoned her home.  Her father, in New York, had suffered\nreverses, lost so much money that it was really vexatious as showing how\nmuch he had had.  It was Adelaide who told me she had gone off alone at\nless than a week’s notice.\n\n“Alone?  Gravener has permitted that?”\n\n“What will you have?  The House of Commons!”\n\nI’m afraid I cursed the House of Commons: I was so much interested.  Of\ncourse he’d follow her as soon as he was free to make her his wife; only\nshe mightn’t now be able to bring him anything like the marriage-portion\nof which he had begun by having the virtual promise.  Mrs. Mulville let\nme know what was already said: she was charming, this American girl, but\nreally these American fathers—!  What was a man to do?  Mr. Saltram,\naccording to Mrs. Mulville, was of opinion that a man was never to suffer\nhis relation to money to become a spiritual relation—he was to keep it\nexclusively material.  “Moi pas comprendre!” I commented on this; in\nrejoinder to which Adelaide, with her beautiful sympathy, explained that\nshe supposed he simply meant that the thing was to use it, don’t you\nknow? but not to think too much about it.  “To take it, but not to thank\nyou for it?” I still more profanely enquired.  For a quarter of an hour\nafterwards she wouldn’t look at me, but this didn’t prevent my asking her\nwhat had been the result, that afternoon—in the Regent’s Park, of her\ntaking our friend to see Miss Anvoy.\n\n“Oh so charming!” she answered, brightening.  “He said he recognised in\nher a nature he could absolutely trust.”\n\n“Yes, but I’m speaking of the effect on herself.”\n\nMrs. Mulville had to remount the stream.  “It was everything one could\nwish.”\n\nSomething in her tone made me laugh.  “Do you mean she gave him—a dole?”\n\n“Well, since you ask me!”\n\n“Right there on the spot?”\n\nAgain poor Adelaide faltered.  “It was to me of course she gave it.”\n\nI stared; somehow I couldn’t see the scene.  “Do you mean a sum of\nmoney?”\n\n“It was very handsome.”  Now at last she met my eyes, though I could see\nit was with an effort.  “Thirty pounds.”\n\n“Straight out of her pocket?”\n\n“Out of the drawer of a table at which she had been writing.  She just\nslipped the folded notes into my hand.  He wasn’t looking; it was while\nhe was going back to the carriage.”  “Oh,” said Adelaide reassuringly, “I\ntake care of it for him!”  The dear practical soul thought my agitation,\nfor I confess I was agitated, referred to the employment of the money.\nHer disclosure made me for a moment muse violently, and I dare say that\nduring that moment I wondered if anything else in the world makes people\nso gross as unselfishness.  I uttered, I suppose, some vague synthetic\ncry, for she went on as if she had had a glimpse of my inward amaze at\nsuch passages.  “I assure you, my dear friend, he was in one of his happy\nhours.”\n\nBut I wasn’t thinking of that.  “Truly indeed these Americans!” I said.\n“With her father in the very act, as it were, of swindling her\nbetrothed!”\n\nMrs. Mulville stared.  “Oh I suppose Mr. Anvoy has scarcely gone\nbankrupt—or whatever he has done—on purpose.  Very likely they won’t be\nable to keep it up, but there it was, and it was a very beautiful\nimpulse.”\n\n“You say Saltram was very fine?”\n\n“Beyond everything.  He surprised even me.”\n\n“And I know what you’ve enjoyed.”  After a moment I added: “Had he\nperadventure caught a glimpse of the money in the table-drawer?”\n\nAt this my companion honestly flushed.  “How can you be so cruel when you\nknow how little he calculates?”\n\n“Forgive me, I do know it.  But you tell me things that act on my nerves.\nI’m sure he hadn’t caught a glimpse of anything but some splendid idea.”\n\nMrs. Mulville brightly concurred.  “And perhaps even of her beautiful\nlistening face.”\n\n“Perhaps even!  And what was it all about?”\n\n“His talk?  It was apropos of her engagement, which I had told him about:\nthe idea of marriage, the philosophy, the poetry, the sublimity of it.”\nIt was impossible wholly to restrain one’s mirth at this, and some rude\nripple that I emitted again caused my companion to admonish me.  “It\nsounds a little stale, but you know his freshness.”\n\n“Of illustration?  Indeed I do!”\n\n“And how he has always been right on that great question.”\n\n“On what great question, dear lady, hasn’t he been right?”\n\n“Of what other great men can you equally say it?—and that he has never,\nbut never, had a deflexion?” Mrs. Mulville exultantly demanded.\n\nI tried to think of some other great man, but I had to give it up.\n“Didn’t Miss Anvoy express her satisfaction in any less diffident way\nthan by her charming present?” I was reduced to asking instead.\n\n“Oh yes, she overflowed to me on the steps while he was getting into the\ncarriage.”  These words somehow brushed up a picture of Saltram’s big\nshawled back as he hoisted himself into the green landau.  “She said she\nwasn’t disappointed,” Adelaide pursued.\n\nI turned it over.  “Did he wear his shawl?”\n\n“His shawl?”  She hadn’t even noticed.\n\n“I mean yours.”\n\n“He looked very nice, and you know he’s really clean.  Miss Anvoy used\nsuch a remarkable expression—she said his mind’s like a crystal!”\n\nI pricked up my ears.  “A crystal?”\n\n“Suspended in the moral world—swinging and shining and flashing there.\nShe’s monstrously clever, you know.”\n\nI thought again.  “Monstrously!”\n\n\n\n\nVIII\n\n\nGEORGE GRAVENER didn’t follow her, for late in September, after the House\nhad risen, I met him in a railway-carriage.  He was coming up from\nScotland and I had just quitted some relations who lived near Durham.\nThe current of travel back to London wasn’t yet strong; at any rate on\nentering the compartment I found he had had it for some time to himself.\nWe fared in company, and though he had a blue-book in his lap and the\nopen jaws of his bag threatened me with the white teeth of confused\npapers, we inevitably, we even at last sociably conversed.  I saw things\nweren’t well with him, but I asked no question till something dropped by\nhimself made, as it had made on another occasion, an absence of curiosity\ninvidious.  He mentioned that he was worried about his good old friend\nLady Coxon, who, with her niece likely to be detained some time in\nAmerica, lay seriously ill at Clockborough, much on his mind and on his\nhands.\n\n“Ah Miss Anvoy’s in America?”\n\n“Her father has got into horrid straits—has lost no end of money.”\n\nI waited, after expressing due concern, but I eventually said: “I hope\nthat raises no objection to your marriage.”\n\n“None whatever; moreover it’s my trade to meet objections.  But it may\ncreate tiresome delays, of which there have been too many, from various\ncauses, already.  Lady Coxon got very bad, then she got much better.\nThen Mr. Anvoy suddenly began to totter, and now he seems quite on his\nback.  I’m afraid he’s really in for some big reverse.  Lady Coxon’s\nworse again, awfully upset by the news from America, and she sends me\nword that she _must_ have Ruth.  How can I supply her with Ruth?  I\nhaven’t got Ruth myself!”\n\n“Surely you haven’t lost her?” I returned.\n\n“She’s everything to her wretched father.  She writes me every\npost—telling me to smooth her aunt’s pillow.  I’ve other things to\nsmooth; but the old lady, save for her servants, is really alone.  She\nwon’t receive her Coxon relations—she’s angry at so much of her money\ngoing to them.  Besides, she’s hopelessly mad,” said Gravener very\nfrankly.\n\nI don’t remember whether it was this, or what it was, that made me ask if\nshe hadn’t such an appreciation of Mrs. Saltram as might render that\nactive person of some use.\n\nHe gave me a cold glance, wanting to know what had put Mrs. Saltram into\nmy head, and I replied that she was unfortunately never out of it.  I\nhappened to remember the wonderful accounts she had given me of the\nkindness Lady Coxon had shown her.  Gravener declared this to be false;\nLady Coxon, who didn’t care for her, hadn’t seen her three times.  The\nonly foundation for it was that Miss Anvoy, who used, poor girl, to chuck\nmoney about in a manner she must now regret, had for an hour seen in the\nmiserable woman—you could never know what she’d see in people—an\ninteresting pretext for the liberality with which her nature overflowed.\nBut even Miss Anvoy was now quite tired of her.  Gravener told me more\nabout the crash in New York and the annoyance it had been to him, and we\nalso glanced here and there in other directions; but by the time we got\nto Doncaster the principal thing he had let me see was that he was\nkeeping something back.  We stopped at that station, and, at the\ncarriage-door, some one made a movement to get in.  Gravener uttered a\nsound of impatience, and I felt sure that but for this I should have had\nthe secret.  Then the intruder, for some reason, spared us his company;\nwe started afresh, and my hope of a disclosure returned.  My companion\nheld his tongue, however, and I pretended to go to sleep; in fact I\nreally dozed for discouragement.  When I reopened my eyes he was looking\nat me with an injured air.  He tossed away with some vivacity the remnant\nof a cigarette and then said: “If you’re not too sleepy I want to put you\na case.”  I answered that I’d make every effort to attend, and welcomed\nthe note of interest when he went on: “As I told you a while ago, Lady\nCoxon, poor dear, is demented.”  His tone had much behind it—was full of\npromise.  I asked if her ladyship’s misfortune were a trait of her malady\nor only of her character, and he pronounced it a product of both.  The\ncase he wanted to put to me was a matter on which it concerned him to\nhave the impression—the judgement, he might also say—of another person.\n“I mean of the average intelligent man, but you see I take what I can\nget.” There would be the technical, the strictly legal view; then there\nwould be the way the question would strike a man of the world.  He had\nlighted another cigarette while he talked, and I saw he was glad to have\nit to handle when he brought out at last, with a laugh slightly\nartificial: “In fact it’s a subject on which Miss Anvoy and I are pulling\ndifferent ways.”\n\n“And you want me to decide between you?  I decide in advance for Miss\nAnvoy.”\n\n“In advance—that’s quite right.  That’s how I decided when I proposed to\nher.  But my story will interest you only so far as your mind isn’t made\nup.”  Gravener puffed his cigarette a minute and then continued: “Are you\nfamiliar with the idea of the Endowment of Research?”\n\n“Of Research?” I was at sea a moment.\n\n“I give you Lady Coxon’s phrase.  She has it on the brain.”\n\n“She wishes to endow—?”\n\n“Some earnest and ‘loyal’ seeker,” Gravener said.  “It was a sketchy\ndesign of her late husband’s, and he handed it on to her; setting apart\nin his will a sum of money of which she was to enjoy the interest for\nlife, but of which, should she eventually see her opportunity—the matter\nwas left largely to her discretion—she would best honour his memory by\ndetermining the exemplary public use.  This sum of money, no less than\nthirteen thousand pounds, was to be called The Coxon Fund; and poor Sir\nGregory evidently proposed to himself that The Coxon Fund should cover\nhis name with glory—be universally desired and admired.  He left his wife\na full declaration of his views, so far at least as that term may be\napplied to views vitiated by a vagueness really infantine.  A little\nlearning’s a dangerous thing, and a good citizen who happens to have been\nan ass is worse for a community than bad sewerage.  He’s worst of all\nwhen he’s dead, because then he can’t be stopped.  However, such as they\nwere, the poor man’s aspirations are now in his wife’s bosom, or\nfermenting rather in her foolish brain: it lies with her to carry them\nout.  But of course she must first catch her hare.”\n\n“Her earnest loyal seeker?”\n\n“The flower that blushes unseen for want of such a pecuniary independence\nas may aid the light that’s in it to shine upon the human race.  The\nindividual, in a word, who, having the rest of the machinery, the\nspiritual, the intellectual, is most hampered in his search.”\n\n“His search for what?”\n\n“For Moral Truth.  That’s what Sir Gregory calls it.”\n\nI burst out laughing.  “Delightful munificent Sir Gregory!  It’s a\ncharming idea.”\n\n“So Miss Anvoy thinks.”\n\n“Has she a candidate for the Fund?”\n\n“Not that I know of—and she’s perfectly reasonable about it.  But Lady\nCoxon has put the matter before her, and we’ve naturally had a lot of\ntalk.”\n\n“Talk that, as you’ve so interestingly intimated, has landed you in a\ndisagreement.”\n\n“She considers there’s something in it,” Gravener said.\n\n“And you consider there’s nothing?”\n\n“It seems to me a piece of solemn twaddle—which can’t fail to be attended\nwith consequences certainly grotesque and possibly immoral.  To begin\nwith, fancy constituting an endowment without establishing a tribunal—a\nbench of competent people, of judges.”\n\n“The sole tribunal is Lady Coxon?”\n\n“And any one she chooses to invite.”\n\n“But she has invited you,” I noted.\n\n“I’m not competent—I hate the thing.  Besides, she hasn’t,” my friend\nwent on.  “The real history of the matter, I take it, is that the\ninspiration was originally Lady Coxon’s own, that she infected him with\nit, and that the flattering option left her is simply his tribute to her\nbeautiful, her aboriginal enthusiasm.  She came to England forty years\nago, a thin transcendental Bostonian, and even her odd happy frumpy\nClockborough marriage never really materialised her.  She feels indeed\nthat she has become very British—as if that, as a process, as a ‘Werden,’\nas anything but an original sign of grace, were conceivable; but it’s\nprecisely what makes her cling to the notion of the ‘Fund’—cling to it as\nto a link with the ideal.”\n\n“How can she cling if she’s dying?”\n\n“Do you mean how can she act in the matter?” Gravener asked.  “That’s\nprecisely the question.  She can’t!  As she has never yet caught her\nhare, never spied out her lucky impostor—how should she, with the life\nshe has led?—her husband’s intention has come very near lapsing.  His\nidea, to do him justice, was that it _should_ lapse if exactly the right\nperson, the perfect mixture of genius and chill penury, should fail to\nturn up.  Ah the poor dear woman’s very particular—she says there must be\nno mistake.”\n\nI found all this quite thrilling—I took it in with avidity.  “And if she\ndies without doing anything, what becomes of the money?” I demanded.\n\n“It goes back to his family, if she hasn’t made some other disposition of\nit.”\n\n“She may do that then—she may divert it?”\n\n“Her hands are not tied.  She has a grand discretion.  The proof is that\nthree months ago she offered to make the proceeds over to her niece.”\n\n“For Miss Anvoy’s own use?”\n\n“For Miss Anvoy’s own use—on the occasion of her prospective marriage.\nShe was discouraged—the earnest seeker required so earnest a search.  She\nwas afraid of making a mistake; every one she could think of seemed\neither not earnest enough or not poor enough.  On the receipt of the\nfirst bad news about Mr. Anvoy’s affairs she proposed to Ruth to make the\nsacrifice for her.  As the situation in New York got worse she repeated\nher proposal.”\n\n“Which Miss Anvoy declined?”\n\n“Except as a formal trust.”\n\n“You mean except as committing herself legally to place the money?”\n\n“On the head of the deserving object, the great man frustrated,” said\nGravener.  “She only consents to act in the spirit of Sir Gregory’s\nscheme.”\n\n“And you blame her for that?” I asked with some intensity.\n\nMy tone couldn’t have been harsh, but he coloured a little and there was\na queer light in his eye.  “My dear fellow, if I ‘blamed’ the young lady\nI’m engaged to I shouldn’t immediately say it even to so old a friend as\nyou.”  I saw that some deep discomfort, some restless desire to be sided\nwith, reassuringly, approvingly mirrored, had been at the bottom of his\ndrifting so far, and I was genuinely touched by his confidence.  It was\ninconsistent with his habits; but being troubled about a woman was not,\nfor him, a habit: that itself was an inconsistency.  George Gravener\ncould stand straight enough before any other combination of forces.  It\namused me to think that the combination he had succumbed to had an\nAmerican accent, a transcendental aunt and an insolvent father; but all\nmy old loyalty to him mustered to meet this unexpected hint that I could\nhelp him.  I saw that I could from the insincere tone in which he\npursued: “I’ve criticised her of course, I’ve contended with her, and it\nhas been great fun.”  Yet it clearly couldn’t have been such great fun as\nto make it improper for me presently to ask if Miss Anvoy had nothing at\nall settled on herself.  To this he replied that she had only a trifle\nfrom her mother—a mere four hundred a year, which was exactly why it\nwould be convenient to him that she shouldn’t decline, in the face of\nthis total change in her prospects, an accession of income which would\ndistinctly help them to marry.  When I enquired if there were no other\nway in which so rich and so affectionate an aunt could cause the weight\nof her benevolence to be felt, he answered that Lady Coxon was\naffectionate indeed, but was scarcely to be called rich.  She could let\nher project of the Fund lapse for her niece’s benefit, but she couldn’t\ndo anything else.  She had been accustomed to regard her as tremendously\nprovided for, and she was up to her eyes in promises to anxious Coxons.\nShe was a woman of an inordinate conscience, and her conscience was now a\ndistress to her, hovering round her bed in irreconcilable forms of\nresentful husbands, portionless nieces and undiscoverable philosophers.\n\nWe were by this time getting into the whirr of fleeting platforms, the\nmultiplication of lights.  “I think you’ll find,” I said with a laugh,\n“that your predicament will disappear in the very fact that the\nphilosopher _is_ undiscoverable.”\n\nHe began to gather up his papers.  “Who can set a limit to the ingenuity\nof an extravagant woman?”\n\n“Yes, after all, who indeed?” I echoed as I recalled the extravagance\ncommemorated in Adelaide’s anecdote of Miss Anvoy and the thirty pounds.\n\n\n\n\nIX\n\n\nTHE thing I had been most sensible of in that talk with George Gravener\nwas the way Saltram’s name kept out of it.  It seemed to me at the time\nthat we were quite pointedly silent about him; but afterwards it appeared\nmore probable there had been on my companion’s part no conscious\navoidance.  Later on I was sure of this, and for the best of reasons—the\nsimple reason of my perceiving more completely that, for evil as well as\nfor good, he said nothing to Gravener’s imagination.  That honest man\ndidn’t fear him—he was too much disgusted with him.  No more did I,\ndoubtless, and for very much the same reason.  I treated my friend’s\nstory as an absolute confidence; but when before Christmas, by Mrs.\nSaltram, I was informed of Lady Coxon’s death without having had news of\nMiss Anvoy’s return, I found myself taking for granted we should hear no\nmore of these nuptials, in which, as obscurely unnatural, I now saw I had\nnever _too_ disconcertedly believed.  I began to ask myself how people\nwho suited each other so little could please each other so much.  The\ncharm was some material charm, some afffinity, exquisite doubtless, yet\nsuperficial some surrender to youth and beauty and passion, to force and\ngrace and fortune, happy accidents and easy contacts.  They might dote on\neach other’s persons, but how could they know each other’s souls?  How\ncould they have the same prejudices, how could they have the same\nhorizon?  Such questions, I confess, seemed quenched but not answered\nwhen, one day in February, going out to Wimbledon, I found our young lady\nin the house.  A passion that had brought her back across the wintry\nocean was as much of a passion as was needed.  No impulse equally strong\nindeed had drawn George Gravener to America; a circumstance on which,\nhowever, I reflected only long enough to remind myself that it was none\nof my business.  Ruth Anvoy was distinctly different, and I felt that the\ndifference was not simply that of her marks of mourning.  Mrs. Mulville\ntold me soon enough what it was: it was the difference between a handsome\ngirl with large expectations and a handsome girl with only four hundred a\nyear.  This explanation indeed didn’t wholly content me, not even when I\nlearned that her mourning had a double cause—learned that poor Mr. Anvoy,\ngiving way altogether, buried under the ruins of his fortune and leaving\nnext to nothing, had died a few weeks before.\n\n“So she has come out to marry George Gravener?” I commented.  “Wouldn’t\nit have been prettier of him to have saved her the trouble?”\n\n“Hasn’t the House just met?” Adelaide replied.  “And for Mr. Gravener the\nHouse—!”  Then she added: “I gather that her having come is exactly a\nsign that the marriage is a little shaky.  If it were quite all right a\nself-respecting girl like Ruth would have waited for him over there.”\n\nI noted that they were already Ruth and Adelaide, but what I said was:\n“Do you mean she’ll have had to return to _make_ it so?”\n\n“No, I mean that she must have come out for some reason independent of\nit.”  Adelaide could only surmise, however, as yet, and there was more,\nas we found, to be revealed.  Mrs. Mulville, on hearing of her arrival,\nhad brought the young lady out in the green landau for the Sunday.  The\nCoxons were in possession of the house in Regent’s Park, and Miss Anvoy\nwas in dreary lodgings.  George Gravener had been with her when Adelaide\ncalled, but had assented graciously enough to the little visit at\nWimbledon.  The carriage, with Mr. Saltram in it but not mentioned, had\nbeen sent off on some errand from which it was to return and pick the\nladies up.  Gravener had left them together, and at the end of an hour,\non the Saturday afternoon, the party of three had driven out to\nWimbledon.  This was the girl’s second glimpse of our great man, and I\nwas interested in asking Mrs. Mulville if the impression made by the\nfirst appeared to have been confirmed.  On her replying after\nconsideration, that of course with time and opportunity it couldn’t fail\nto be, but that she was disappointed, I was sufficiently struck with her\nuse of this last word to question her further.\n\n“Do you mean you’re disappointed because you judge Miss Anvoy to be?”\n\n“Yes; I hoped for a greater effect last evening.  We had two or three\npeople, but he scarcely opened his mouth.”\n\n“He’ll be all the better to-night,” I opined after a moment.  Then I\npursued: “What particular importance do you attach to the idea of her\nbeing impressed?”\n\nAdelaide turned her mild pale eyes on me as for rebuke of my levity.\n“Why the importance of her being as happy as _we_ are!”\n\nI’m afraid that at this my levity grew.  “Oh that’s a happiness almost\ntoo great to wish a person!”  I saw she hadn’t yet in her mind what I had\nin mine, and at any rate the visitor’s actual bliss was limited to a walk\nin the garden with Kent Mulville.  Later in the afternoon I also took\none, and I saw nothing of Miss Anvoy till dinner, at which we failed of\nthe company of Saltram, who had caused it to be reported that he was\nindisposed and lying down.  This made us, most of us—for there were other\nfriends present—convey to each other in silence some of the unutterable\nthings that in those years our eyes had inevitably acquired the art of\nexpressing.  If a fine little American enquirer hadn’t been there we\nwould have expressed them otherwise, and Adelaide would have pretended\nnot to hear.  I had seen her, before the very fact, abstract herself\nnobly; and I knew that more than once, to keep it from the servants,\nmanaging, dissimulating cleverly, she had helped her husband to carry him\nbodily to his room.  Just recently he had been so wise and so deep and so\nhigh that I had begun to get nervous—to wonder if by chance there were\nsomething behind it, if he were kept straight for instance by the\nknowledge that the hated Pudneys would have more to tell us if they\nchose.  He was lying low, but unfortunately it was common wisdom with us\nin this connexion that the biggest splashes took place in the quietest\npools.  We should have had a merry life indeed if all the splashes had\nsprinkled us as refreshingly as the waters we were even then to feel\nabout our ears.  Kent Mulville had been up to his room, but had come back\nwith a face that told as few tales as I had seen it succeed in telling on\nthe evening I waited in the lecture-room with Miss Anvoy.  I said to\nmyself that our friend had gone out, but it was a comfort that the\npresence of a comparative stranger deprived us of the dreary duty of\nsuggesting to each other, in respect of his errand, edifying\npossibilities in which we didn’t ourselves believe.  At ten o’clock he\ncame into the drawing-room with his waistcoat much awry but his eyes\nsending out great signals.  It was precisely with his entrance that I\nceased to be vividly conscious of him.  I saw that the crystal, as I had\ncalled it, had begun to swing, and I had need of my immediate attention\nfor Miss Anvoy.\n\nEven when I was told afterwards that he had, as we might have said\nto-day, broken the record, the manner in which that attention had been\nrewarded relieved me of a sense of loss.  I had of course a perfect\ngeneral consciousness that something great was going on: it was a little\nlike having been etherised to hear Herr Joachim play.  The old music was\nin the air; I felt the strong pulse of thought, the sink and swell, the\nflight, the poise, the plunge; but I knew something about one of the\nlisteners that nobody else knew, and Saltram’s monologue could reach me\nonly through that medium.  To this hour I’m of no use when, as a witness,\nI’m appealed to—for they still absurdly contend about it—as to whether or\nno on that historic night he was drunk; and my position is slightly\nridiculous, for I’ve never cared to tell them what it really was I was\ntaken up with.  What I got out of it is the only morsel of the total\nexperience that is quite my own.  The others were shared, but this is\nincommunicable.  I feel that now, I’m bound to say, even in thus roughly\nevoking the occasion, and it takes something from my pride of clearness.\nHowever, I shall perhaps be as clear as is absolutely needful if I remark\nthat our young lady was too much given up to her own intensity of\nobservation to be sensible of mine.  It was plainly not the question of\nher marriage that had brought her back.  I greatly enjoyed this discovery\nand was sure that had that question alone been involved she would have\nstirred no step.  In this case doubtless Gravener would, in spite of the\nHouse of Commons, have found means to rejoin her.  It afterwards made me\nuncomfortable for her that, alone in the lodging Mrs. Mulville had put\nbefore me as dreary, she should have in any degree the air of waiting for\nher fate; so that I was presently relieved at hearing of her having gone\nto stay at Coldfield.  If she was in England at all while the engagement\nstood the only proper place for her was under Lady Maddock’s wing.  Now\nthat she was unfortunate and relatively poor, perhaps her prospective\nsister-in-law would be wholly won over.\n\nThere would be much to say, if I had space, about the way her behaviour,\nas I caught gleams of it, ministered to the image that had taken birth in\nmy mind, to my private amusement, while that other night I listened to\nGeorge Gravener in the railway-carriage.  I watched her in the light of\nthis queer possibility—a formidable thing certainly to meet—and I was\naware that it coloured, extravagantly perhaps, my interpretation of her\nvery looks and tones.  At Wimbledon for instance it had appeared to me\nshe was literally afraid of Saltram, in dread of a coercion that she had\nbegun already to feel.  I had come up to town with her the next day and\nhad been convinced that, though deeply interested, she was immensely on\nher guard.  She would show as little as possible before she should be\nready to show everything.  What this final exhibition might be on the\npart of a girl perceptibly so able to think things out I found it great\nsport to forecast.  It would have been exciting to be approached by her,\nappealed to by her for advice; but I prayed to heaven I mightn’t find\nmyself in such a predicament.  If there was really a present rigour in\nthe situation of which Gravener had sketched for me the elements, she\nwould have to get out of her difficulty by herself.  It wasn’t I who had\nlaunched her and it wasn’t I who could help her.  I didn’t fail to ask\nmyself why, since I couldn’t help her, I should think so much about her.\nIt was in part my suspense that was responsible for this; I waited\nimpatiently to see whether she wouldn’t have told Mrs. Mulville a portion\nat least of what I had learned from Gravener.  But I saw Mrs. Mulville\nwas still reduced to wonder what she had come out again for if she hadn’t\ncome as a conciliatory bride.  That she had come in some other character\nwas the only thing that fitted all the appearances.  Having for family\nreasons to spend some time that spring in the west of England, I was in a\nmanner out of earshot of the great oceanic rumble—I mean of the\ncontinuous hum of Saltram’s thought—and my uneasiness tended to keep me\nquiet.  There was something I wanted so little to have to say that my\nprudence surmounted my curiosity.  I only wondered if Ruth Anvoy talked\nover the idea of The Coxon Fund with Lady Maddock, and also somewhat why\nI didn’t hear from Wimbledon.  I had a reproachful note about something\nor other from Mrs. Saltram, but it contained no mention of Lady Coxon’s\nniece, on whom her eyes had been much less fixed since the recent\nuntoward events.\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nPOOR Adelaide’s silence was fully explained later—practically explained\nwhen in June, returning to London, I was honoured by this admirable woman\nwith an early visit.  As soon as she arrived I guessed everything, and as\nsoon as she told me that darling Ruth had been in her house nearly a\nmonth I had my question ready.  “What in the name of maidenly modesty is\nshe staying in England for?”\n\n“Because she loves me so!” cried Adelaide gaily.  But she hadn’t come to\nsee me only to tell me Miss Anvoy loved her: that was quite sufficiently\nestablished, and what was much more to the point was that Mr. Gravener\nhad now raised an objection to it.  He had protested at least against her\nbeing at Wimbledon, where in the innocence of his heart he had originally\nbrought her himself; he called on her to put an end to their engagement\nin the only proper, the only happy manner.\n\n“And why in the world doesn’t she do do?” I asked.\n\nAdelaide had a pause.  “She says you know.”\n\nThen on my also hesitating she added: “A condition he makes.”\n\n“The Coxon Fund?” I panted.\n\n“He has mentioned to her his having told you about it.”\n\n“Ah but so little!  Do you mean she has accepted the trust?”\n\n“In the most splendid spirit—as a duty about which there can be no two\nopinions.”  To which my friend added: “Of course she’s thinking of Mr.\nSaltram.”\n\nI gave a quick cry at this, which, in its violence, made my visitor turn\npale.  “How very awful!”\n\n“Awful?”\n\n“Why, to have anything to do with such an idea one’s self.”\n\n“I’m sure _you_ needn’t!” and Mrs. Mulville tossed her head.\n\n“He isn’t good enough!” I went on; to which she opposed a sound almost as\ncontentious as my own had been.  This made me, with genuine immediate\nhorror, exclaim: “You haven’t influenced her, I hope!” and my emphasis\nbrought back the blood with a rush to poor Adelaide’s face.  She declared\nwhile she blushed—for I had frightened her again—that she had never\ninfluenced anybody and that the girl had only seen and heard and judged\nfor herself.  _He_ had influenced her, if I would, as he did every one\nwho had a soul: that word, as we knew, even expressed feebly the power of\nthe things he said to haunt the mind.  How could she, Adelaide, help it\nif Miss Anvoy’s mind was haunted?  I demanded with a groan what right a\npretty girl engaged to a rising M.P. had to _have_ a mind; but the only\nexplanation my bewildered friend could give me was that she was so\nclever.  She regarded Mr. Saltram naturally as a tremendous force for\ngood.  She was intelligent enough to understand him and generous enough\nto admire.\n\n“She’s many things enough, but is she, among them, rich enough?” I\ndemanded.  “Rich enough, I mean, to sacrifice such a lot of good money?”\n\n“That’s for herself to judge.  Besides, it’s not her own money; she\ndoesn’t in the least consider it so.”\n\n“And Gravener does, if not _his_ own; and that’s the whole difficulty?”\n\n“The difficulty that brought her back, yes: she had absolutely to see her\npoor aunt’s solicitor.  It’s clear that by Lady Coxon’s will she may have\nthe money, but it’s still clearer to her conscience that the original\ncondition, definite, intensely implied on her uncle’s part, is attached\nto the use of it.  She can only take one view of it.  It’s for the\nEndowment or it’s for nothing.”\n\n“The Endowment,” I permitted myself to observe, “is a conception\nsuperficially sublime, but fundamentally ridiculous.”\n\n“Are you repeating Mr. Gravener’s words?” Adelaide asked.\n\n“Possibly, though I’ve not seen him for months.  It’s simply the way it\nstrikes me too.  It’s an old wife’s tale.  Gravener made some reference\nto the legal aspect, but such an absurdly loose arrangement has _no_\nlegal aspect.”\n\n“Ruth doesn’t insist on that,” said Mrs. Mulville; “and it’s, for her,\nexactly this technical weakness that constitutes the force of the moral\nobligation.”\n\n“Are you repeating _her_ words?” I enquired.  I forget what else Adelaide\nsaid, but she said she was magnificent.  I thought of George Gravener\nconfronted with such magnificence as that, and I asked what could have\nmade two such persons ever suppose they understood each other.  Mrs.\nMulville assured me the girl loved him as such a woman could love and\nthat she suffered as such a woman could suffer.  Nevertheless she wanted\nto see _me_.  At this I sprang up with a groan.  “Oh I’m so sorry!—when?”\nSmall though her sense of humour, I think Adelaide laughed at my\nsequence.  We discussed the day, the nearest it would be convenient I\nshould come out; but before she went I asked my visitor how long she had\nbeen acquainted with these prodigies.\n\n“For several weeks, but I was pledged to secrecy.”\n\n“And that’s why you didn’t write?”\n\n“I couldn’t very well tell you she was with me without telling you that\nno time had even yet been fixed for her marriage.  And I couldn’t very\nwell tell you as much as that without telling you what I knew of the\nreason of it.  It was not till a day or two ago,” Mrs. Mulville went on,\n“that she asked me to ask you if you wouldn’t come and see her.  Then at\nlast she spoke of your knowing about the idea of the Endowment.”\n\nI turned this over.  “Why on earth does she want to see me?”\n\n“To talk with you, naturally, about Mr. Saltram.”\n\n“As a subject for the prize?”  This was hugely obvious, and I presently\nreturned: “I think I’ll sail to-morrow for Australia.”\n\n“Well then—sail!” said Mrs. Mulville, getting up.\n\nBut I frivolously, continued.  “On Thursday at five, we said?”  The\nappointment was made definite and I enquired how, all this time, the\nunconscious candidate had carried himself.\n\n“In perfection, really, by the happiest of chances: he has positively\nbeen a dear.  And then, as to what we revere him for, in the most\nwonderful form.  His very highest—pure celestial light.  You _won’t_ do\nhim an ill turn?” Adelaide pleaded at the door.\n\n“What danger can equal for him the danger to which he’s exposed from\nhimself?” I asked.  “Look out sharp, if he has lately been too prim.\nHe’ll presently take a day off, treat us to some exhibition that will\nmake an Endowment a scandal.”\n\n“A scandal?” Mrs. Mulville dolorously echoed.\n\n“Is Miss Anvoy prepared for that?”\n\nMy visitor, for a moment, screwed her parasol into my carpet.  “He grows\nbigger every day.”\n\n“So do you!” I laughed as she went off.\n\nThat girl at Wimbledon, on the Thursday afternoon, more than justified my\napprehensions.  I recognised fully now the cause of the agitation she had\nproduced in me from the first—the faint foreknowledge that there was\nsomething very stiff I should have to do for her.  I felt more than ever\ncommitted to my fate as, standing before her in the big drawing-room\nwhere they had tactfully left us to ourselves, I tried with a smile to\nstring together the pearls of lucidity which, from her chair, she\nsuccessively tossed me.  Pale and bright, in her monotonous mourning, she\nwas an image of intelligent purpose, of the passion of duty; but I asked\nmyself whether any girl had ever had so charming an instinct as that\nwhich permitted her to laugh out, as for the joy of her difficulty, into\nthe priggish old room.  This remarkable young woman could be earnest\nwithout being solemn, and at moments when I ought doubtless to have\ncursed her obstinacy I found myself watching the unstudied play of her\neyebrows or the recurrence of a singularly intense whiteness produced by\nthe parting of her lips.  These aberrations, I hasten to add, didn’t\nprevent my learning soon enough why she had wished to see me.  Her reason\nfor this was as distinct as her beauty: it was to make me explain what I\nhad meant, on the occasion of our first meeting, by Mr. Saltram’s want of\ndignity.  It wasn’t that she couldn’t imagine, but she desired it there\nfrom my lips.  What she really desired of course was to know whether\nthere was worse about him than what she had found out for herself.  She\nhadn’t been a month so much in the house with him without discovering\nthat he wasn’t a man of monumental bronze.  He was like a jelly minus its\nmould, he had to be embanked; and that was precisely the source of her\ninterest in him and the ground of her project.  She put her project\nboldly before me: there it stood in its preposterous beauty.  She was as\nwilling to take the humorous view of it as I could be: the only\ndifference was that for her the humorous view of a thing wasn’t\nnecessarily prohibitive, wasn’t paralysing.\n\nMoreover she professed that she couldn’t discuss with me the primary\nquestion—the moral obligation: that was in her own breast.  There were\nthings she couldn’t go into—injunctions, impressions she had received.\nThey were a part of the closest intimacy of her intercourse with her\naunt, they were absolutely clear to her; and on questions of delicacy,\nthe interpretation of a fidelity, of a promise, one had always in the\nlast resort to make up one’s mind for one’s self.  It was the idea of the\napplication to the particular case, such a splendid one at last, that\ntroubled her, and she admitted that it stirred very deep things.  She\ndidn’t pretend that such a responsibility was a simple matter; if it\n_had_ been she wouldn’t have attempted to saddle me with any portion of\nit.  The Mulvilles were sympathy itself, but were they absolutely candid?\nCould they indeed be, in their position—would it even have been to be\ndesired?  Yes, she had sent for me to ask no less than that of me—whether\nthere was anything dreadful kept back.  She made no allusion whatever to\nGeorge Gravener—I thought her silence the only good taste and her gaiety\nperhaps a part of the very anxiety of that discretion, the effect of a\ndetermination that people shouldn’t know from herself that her relations\nwith the man she was to marry were strained.  All the weight, however,\nthat she left me to throw was a sufficient implication of the weight _he_\nhad thrown in vain.  Oh she knew the question of character was immense,\nand that one couldn’t entertain any plan for making merit comfortable\nwithout running the gauntlet of that terrible procession of\ninterrogation-points which, like a young ladies’ school out for a walk,\nhooked their uniform noses at the tail of governess Conduct.  But were we\nabsolutely to hold that there was never, never, never an exception,\nnever, never, never an occasion for liberal acceptance, for clever\ncharity, for suspended pedantry—for letting one side, in short,\noutbalance another?  When Miss Anvoy threw off this appeal I could have\nembraced her for so delightfully emphasising her unlikeness to Mrs.\nSaltram.  “Why not have the courage of one’s forgiveness,” she asked, “as\nwell as the enthusiasm of one’s adhesion?”\n\n“Seeing how wonderfully you’ve threshed the whole thing out,” I evasively\nreplied, “gives me an extraordinary notion of the point your enthusiasm\nhas reached.”\n\nShe considered this remark an instant with her eyes on mine, and I\ndivined that it struck her I might possibly intend it as a reference to\nsome personal subjection to our fat philosopher, to some aberration of\nsensibility, some perversion of taste.  At least I couldn’t interpret\notherwise the sudden flash that came into her face.  Such a\nmanifestation, as the result of any word of mine, embarrassed me; but\nwhile I was thinking how to reassure her the flush passed away in a smile\nof exquisite good nature.  “Oh you see one forgets so wonderfully how one\ndislikes him!” she said; and if her tone simply extinguished his strange\nfigure with the brush of its compassion, it also rings in my ear to-day\nas the purest of all our praises.  But with what quick response of fine\npity such a relegation of the man himself made me privately sigh “Ah poor\nSaltram!”  She instantly, with this, took the measure of all I didn’t\nbelieve, and it enabled her to go on: “What can one do when a person has\ngiven such a lift to one’s interest in life?”\n\n“Yes, what can one do?”  If I struck her as a little vague it was because\nI was thinking of another person.  I indulged in another inarticulate\nmurmur—“Poor George Gravener!”  What had become of the lift _he_ had\ngiven that interest?  Later on I made up my mind that she was sore and\nstricken at the appearance he presented of wanting the miserable money.\nThis was the hidden reason of her alienation.  The probable sincerity, in\nspite of the illiberality, of his scruples about the particular use of it\nunder discussion didn’t efface the ugliness of his demand that they\nshould buy a good house with it.  Then, as for _his_ alienation, he\ndidn’t, pardonably enough, grasp the lift Frank Saltram had given her\ninterest in life.  If a mere spectator could ask that last question, with\nwhat rage in his heart the man himself might!  He wasn’t, like her, I was\nto see, too proud to show me why he was disappointed.\n\n\n\n\nXI\n\n\nI WAS unable this time to stay to dinner: such at any rate was the plea\non which I took leave.  I desired in truth to get away from my young\nlady, for that obviously helped me not to pretend to satisfy her.  How\n_could_ I satisfy her?  I asked myself—how could I tell her how much had\nbeen kept back?  I didn’t even know and I certainly didn’t desire to\nknow.  My own policy had ever been to learn the least about poor\nSaltram’s weaknesses—not to learn the most.  A great deal that I had in\nfact learned had been forced upon me by his wife.  There was something\neven irritating in Miss Anvoy’s crude conscientiousness, and I wondered\nwhy, after all, she couldn’t have let him alone and been content to\nentrust George Gravener with the purchase of the good house.  I was sure\nhe would have driven a bargain, got something excellent and cheap.  I\nlaughed louder even than she, I temporised, I failed her; I told her I\nmust think over her case.  I professed a horror of responsibilities and\ntwitted her with her own extravagant passion for them.  It wasn’t really\nthat I was afraid of the scandal, the moral discredit for the Fund; what\ntroubled me most was a feeling of a different order.  Of course, as the\nbeneficiary of the Fund was to enjoy a simple life-interest, as it was\nhoped that new beneficiaries would arise and come up to new standards, it\nwouldn’t be a trifle that the first of these worthies shouldn’t have been\na striking example of the domestic virtues.  The Fund would start badly,\nas it were, and the laurel would, in some respects at least, scarcely be\ngreener from the brows of the original wearer.  That idea, however, was\nat that hour, as I have hinted, not the source of solicitude it ought\nperhaps to have been, for I felt less the irregularity of Saltram’s\ngetting the money than that of this exalted young woman’s giving it up.\nI wanted her to have it for herself, and I told her so before I went\naway.  She looked graver at this than she had looked at all, saying she\nhoped such a preference wouldn’t make me dishonest.\n\nIt made me, to begin with, very restless—made me, instead of going\nstraight to the station, fidget a little about that many-coloured Common\nwhich gives Wimbledon horizons.  There was a worry for me to work off, or\nrather keep at a distance, for I declined even to admit to myself that I\nhad, in Miss Anvoy’s phrase, been saddled with it.  What could have been\nclearer indeed than the attitude of recognising perfectly what a world of\ntrouble The Coxon Fund would in future save us, and of yet liking better\nto face a continuance of that trouble than see, and in fact contribute\nto, a deviation from attainable bliss in the life of two other persons in\nwhom I was deeply interested?  Suddenly, at the end of twenty minutes,\nthere was projected across this clearness the image of a massive\nmiddle-aged man seated on a bench under a tree, with sad far-wandering\neyes and plump white hands folded on the head of a stick—a stick I\nrecognised, a stout gold-headed staff that I had given him in devoted\ndays.  I stopped short as he turned his face to me, and it happened that\nfor some reason or other I took in as I had perhaps never done before the\nbeauty of his rich blank gaze.  It was charged with experience as the sky\nis charged with light, and I felt on the instant as if we had been\noverspanned and conjoined by the great arch of a bridge or the great dome\nof a temple.  Doubtless I was rendered peculiarly sensitive to it by\nsomething in the way I had been giving him up and sinking him.  While I\nmet it I stood there smitten, and I felt myself responding to it with a\nsort of guilty grimace.  This brought back his attention in a smile which\nexpressed for me a cheerful weary patience, a bruised noble gentleness.\nI had told Miss Anvoy that he had no dignity, but what did he seem to me,\nall unbuttoned and fatigued as he waited for me to come up, if he didn’t\nseem unconcerned with small things, didn’t seem in short majestic?  There\nwas majesty in his mere unconsciousness of our little conferences and\npuzzlements over his maintenance and his reward.\n\nAfter I had sat by him a few minutes I passed my arm over his big soft\nshoulder—wherever you touched him you found equally little firmness—and\nsaid in a tone of which the suppliance fell oddly on my own ear: “Come\nback to town with me, old friend—come back and spend the evening.”  I\nwanted to hold him, I wanted to keep him, and at Waterloo, an hour later,\nI telegraphed possessively to the Mulvilles.  When he objected, as\nregards staying all night, that he had no things, I asked him if he\nhadn’t everything of mine.  I had abstained from ordering dinner, and it\nwas too late for preliminaries at a club; so we were reduced to tea and\nfried fish at my rooms—reduced also to the transcendent.  Something had\ncome up which made me want him to feel at peace with me—and which,\nprecisely, was all the dear man himself wanted on any occasion.  I had\ntoo often had to press upon him considerations irrelevant, but it gives\nme pleasure now to think that on that particular evening I didn’t even\nmention Mrs. Saltram and the children.  Late into the night we smoked and\ntalked; old shames and old rigours fell away from us; I only let him see\nthat I was conscious of what I owed him.  He was as mild as contrition\nand as copious as faith; he was never so fine as on a shy return, and\neven better at forgiving than at being forgiven.  I dare say it was a\nsmaller matter than that famous night at Wimbledon, the night of the\nproblematical sobriety and of Miss Anvoy’s initiation; but I was as much\nin it on this occasion as I had been out of it then.  At about 1.30 he\nwas sublime.\n\nHe never, in whatever situation, rose till all other risings were over,\nand his breakfasts, at Wimbledon, had always been the principal reason\nmentioned by departing cooks.  The coast was therefore clear for me to\nreceive her when, early the next morning, to my surprise, it was\nannounced to me his wife had called.  I hesitated, after she had come up,\nabout telling her Saltram was in the house, but she herself settled the\nquestion, kept me reticent by drawing forth a sealed letter which,\nlooking at me very hard in the eyes, she placed, with a pregnant absence\nof comment, in my hand.  For a single moment there glimmered before me\nthe fond hope that Mrs. Saltram had tendered me, as it were, her\nresignation and desired to embody the act in an unsparing form.  To bring\nthis about I would have feigned any humiliation; but after my eyes had\ncaught the superscription I heard myself say with a flatness that\nbetrayed a sense of something very different from relief: “Oh the\nPudneys!”  I knew their envelopes though they didn’t know mine.  They\nalways used the kind sold at post-offices with the stamp affixed, and as\nthis letter hadn’t been posted they had wasted a penny on me.  I had seen\ntheir horrid missives to the Mulvilles, but hadn’t been in direct\ncorrespondence with them.\n\n“They enclosed it to me, to be delivered.  They doubtless explain to you\nthat they hadn’t your address.”\n\nI turned the thing over without opening it.  “Why in the world should\nthey write to me?”\n\n“Because they’ve something to tell you.  The worst,” Mrs. Saltram dryly\nadded.\n\nIt was another chapter, I felt, of the history of their lamentable\nquarrel with her husband, the episode in which, vindictively,\ndisingenuously as they themselves had behaved, one had to admit that he\nhad put himself more grossly in the wrong than at any moment of his life.\nHe had begun by insulting the matchless Mulvilles for these more specious\nprotectors, and then, according to his wont at the end of a few months,\nhad dug a still deeper ditch for his aberration than the chasm left\nyawning behind.  The chasm at Wimbledon was now blessedly closed; but the\nPudneys, across their persistent gulf, kept up the nastiest fire.  I\nnever doubted they had a strong case, and I had been from the first for\nnot defending him—reasoning that if they weren’t contradicted they’d\nperhaps subside.  This was above all what I wanted, and I so far\nprevailed that I did arrest the correspondence in time to save our little\ncircle an infliction heavier than it perhaps would have borne.  I knew,\nthat is I divined, that their allegations had gone as yet only as far as\ntheir courage, conscious as they were in their own virtue of an exposed\nplace in which Saltram could have planted a blow.  It was a question with\nthem whether a man who had himself so much to cover up would dare his\nblow; so that these vessels of rancour were in a manner afraid of each\nother.  I judged that on the day the Pudneys should cease for some reason\nor other to be afraid they would treat us to some revelation more\ndisconcerting than any of its predecessors.  As I held Mrs. Saltram’s\nletter in my hand it was distinctly communicated to me that the day had\ncome—they had ceased to be afraid.  “I don’t want to know the worst,” I\npresently declared.\n\n“You’ll have to open the letter.  It also contains an enclosure.”\n\nI felt it—it was fat and uncanny.  “Wheels within wheels!” I exclaimed.\n“There’s something for me too to deliver.”\n\n“So they tell me—to Miss Anvoy.”\n\nI stared; I felt a certain thrill.  “Why don’t they send it to her\ndirectly?”\n\nMrs. Saltram hung fire.  “Because she’s staying with Mr. and Mrs.\nMulville.”\n\n“And why should that prevent?”\n\nAgain my visitor faltered, and I began to reflect on the grotesque, the\nunconscious perversity of her action.  I was the only person save George\nGravener and the Mulvilles who was aware of Sir Gregory Coxon’s and of\nMiss Anvoy’s strange bounty.  Where could there have been a more signal\nillustration of the clumsiness of human affairs than her having\ncomplacently selected this moment to fly in the face of it?  “There’s the\nchance of their seeing her letters.  They know Mr. Pudney’s hand.”\n\nStill I didn’t understand; then it flashed upon me.  “You mean they might\nintercept it?  How can you imply anything so base?” I indignantly\ndemanded.\n\n“It’s not I—it’s Mr. Pudney!” cried Mrs. Saltram with a flush.  “It’s his\nown idea.”\n\n“Then why couldn’t he send the letter to you to be delivered?”\n\nMrs. Saltram’s embarrassment increased; she gave me another hard look.\n“You must make that out for yourself.”\n\nI made it out quickly enough.  “It’s a denunciation?”\n\n“A real lady doesn’t betray her husband!” this virtuous woman exclaimed.\n\nI burst out laughing, and I fear my laugh may have had an effect of\nimpertinence.  “Especially to Miss Anvoy, who’s so easily shocked? Why do\nsuch things concern _her_?” I asked, much at a loss.\n\n“Because she’s there, exposed to all his craft.  Mr. and Mrs. Pudney have\nbeen watching this: they feel she may be taken in.”\n\n“Thank you for all the rest of us!  What difference can it make when she\nhas lost her power to contribute?”\n\nAgain Mrs. Saltram considered; then very nobly: “There are other things\nin the world than money.”  This hadn’t occurred to her so long as the\nyoung lady had any; but she now added, with a glance at my letter, that\nMr. and Mrs. Pudney doubtless explained their motives.  “It’s all in\nkindness,” she continued as she got up.\n\n“Kindness to Miss Anvoy?  You took, on the whole, another view of\nkindness before her reverses.”\n\nMy companion smiled with some acidity “Perhaps you’re no safer than the\nMulvilles!”\n\nI didn’t want her to think that, nor that she should report to the\nPudneys that they had not been happy in their agent; and I well remember\nthat this was the moment at which I began, with considerable emotion, to\npromise myself to enjoin upon Miss Anvoy never to open any letter that\nshould come to her in one of those penny envelopes.  My emotion, and I\nfear I must add my confusion, quickly deepened; I presently should have\nbeen as glad to frighten Mrs. Saltram as to think I might by some\ndiplomacy restore the Pudneys to a quieter vigilance.\n\n“It’s best you should take _my_ view of my safety,” I at any rate soon\nresponded.  When I saw she didn’t know what I meant by this I added: “You\nmay turn out to have done, in bringing me this letter, a thing you’ll\nprofoundly regret.”  My tone had a significance which, I could see, did\nmake her uneasy, and there was a moment, after I had made two or three\nmore remarks of studiously bewildering effect, at which her eyes followed\nso hungrily the little flourish of the letter with which I emphasised\nthem that I instinctively slipped Mr. Pudney’s communication into my\npocket.  She looked, in her embarrassed annoyance, capable of grabbing it\nto send it back to him.  I felt, after she had gone, as if I had almost\ngiven her my word I wouldn’t deliver the enclosure.  The passionate\nmovement, at any rate, with which, in solitude, I transferred the whole\nthing, unopened, from my pocket to a drawer which I double-locked would\nhave amounted, for an initiated observer, to some such pledge.\n\n\n\n\nXII\n\n\nMRS. SALTRAM left me drawing my breath more quickly and indeed almost in\npain—as if I had just perilously grazed the loss of something precious.\nI didn’t quite know what it was—it had a shocking resemblance to my\nhonour.  The emotion was the livelier surely in that my pulses even yet\nvibrated to the pleasure with which, the night before, I had rallied to\nthe rare analyst, the great intellectual adventurer and pathfinder.  What\nhad dropped from me like a cumbersome garment as Saltram appeared before\nme in the afternoon on the heath was the disposition to haggle over his\nvalue.  Hang it, one had to choose, one had to put that value somewhere;\nso I would put it really high and have done with it.  Mrs. Mulville drove\nin for him at a discreet hour—the earliest she could suppose him to have\ngot up; and I learned that Miss Anvoy would also have come had she not\nbeen expecting a visit from Mr. Gravener.  I was perfectly mindful that I\nwas under bonds to see this young lady, and also that I had a letter to\nhand to her; but I took my time, I waited from day to day.  I left Mrs.\nSaltram to deal as her apprehensions should prompt with the Pudneys.  I\nknew at last what I meant—I had ceased to wince at my responsibility.  I\ngave this supreme impression of Saltram time to fade if it would; but it\ndidn’t fade, and, individually, it hasn’t faded even now.  During the\nmonth that I thus invited myself to stiffen again, Adelaide Mulville,\nperplexed by my absence, wrote to me to ask why I _was_ so stiff.  At\nthat season of the year I was usually oftener “with” them.  She also\nwrote that she feared a real estrangement had set in between Mr. Gravener\nand her sweet young friend—a state of things but half satisfactory to her\nso long as the advantage resulting to Mr. Saltram failed to disengage\nitself from the merely nebulous state.  She intimated that her sweet\nyoung friend was, if anything, a trifle too reserved; she also intimated\nthat there might now be an opening for another clever young man.  There\nnever was the slightest opening, I may here parenthesise, and of course\nthe question can’t come up to-day.  These are old frustrations now.  Ruth\nAnvoy hasn’t married, I hear, and neither have I.  During the month,\ntoward the end, I wrote to George Gravener to ask if, on a special\nerrand, I might come to see him, and his answer was to knock the very\nnext day at my door.  I saw he had immediately connected my enquiry with\nthe talk we had had in the railway-carriage, and his promptitude showed\nthat the ashes of his eagerness weren’t yet cold.  I told him there was\nsomething I felt I ought in candour to let him know—I recognised the\nobligation his friendly confidence had laid on me.\n\n“You mean Miss Anvoy has talked to you?  She has told me so herself,” he\nsaid.\n\n“It wasn’t to tell you so that I wanted to see you,” I replied; “for it\nseemed to me that such a communication would rest wholly with herself.\nIf however she did speak to you of our conversation she probably told you\nI was discouraging.”\n\n“Discouraging?”\n\n“On the subject of a present application of The Coxon Fund.”\n\n“To the case of Mr. Saltram?  My dear fellow, I don’t know what you call\ndiscouraging!” Gravener cried.\n\n“Well I thought I was, and I thought she thought I was.”\n\n“I believe she did, but such a thing’s measured by the effect.  She’s not\n‘discouraged,’” he said.\n\n“That’s her own affair.  The reason I asked you to see me was that it\nappeared to me I ought to tell you frankly that—decidedly!—I can’t\nundertake to produce that effect.  In fact I don’t want to!”\n\n“It’s very good of you, damn you!” my visitor laughed, red and really\ngrave.  Then he said: “You’d like to see that scoundrel publicly\nglorified—perched on the pedestal of a great complimentary pension?”\n\nI braced myself.  “Taking one form of public recognition with another it\nseems to me on the whole I should be able to bear it.  When I see the\ncompliments that _are_ paid right and left I ask myself why this one\nshouldn’t take its course.  This therefore is what you’re entitled to\nhave looked to me to mention to you.  I’ve some evidence that perhaps\nwould be really dissuasive, but I propose to invite Mss Anvoy to remain\nin ignorance of it.”\n\n“And to invite me to do the same?”\n\n“Oh you don’t require it—you’ve evidence enough.  I speak of a sealed\nletter that I’ve been requested to deliver to her.”\n\n“And you don’t mean to?”\n\n“There’s only one consideration that would make me,” I said.\n\nGravener’s clear handsome eyes plunged into mine a minute, but evidently\nwithout fishing up a clue to this motive—a failure by which I was almost\nwounded.  “What does the letter contain?”\n\n“It’s sealed, as I tell you, and I don’t know what it contains.”\n\n“Why is it sent through you?”\n\n“Rather than you?” I wondered how to put the thing.  “The only\nexplanation I can think of is that the person sending it may have\nimagined your relations with Miss Anvoy to be at an end—may have been\ntold this is the case by Mrs. Saltram.”\n\n“My relations with Miss Anvoy are not at an end,” poor Gravener\nstammered.\n\nAgain for an instant I thought.  “The offer I propose to make you gives\nme the right to address you a question remarkably direct.  Are you still\nengaged to Miss Anvoy?”\n\n“No, I’m not,” he slowly brought out.  “But we’re perfectly good\nfriends.”\n\n“Such good friends that you’ll again become prospective husband and wife\nif the obstacle in your path be removed?”\n\n“Removed?” he anxiously repeated.\n\n“If I send Miss Anvoy the letter I speak of she may give up her idea.”\n\n“Then for God’s sake send it!”\n\n“I’ll do so if you’re ready to assure me that her sacrifice would now\npresumably bring about your marriage.”\n\n“I’d marry her the next day!” my visitor cried.\n\n“Yes, but would she marry _you_?  What I ask of you of course is nothing\nless than your word of honour as to your conviction of this.  If you give\nit me,” I said, “I’ll engage to hand her the letter before night.”\n\nGravener took up his hat; turning it mechanically round he stood looking\na moment hard at its unruffled perfection.  Then very angrily honestly\nand gallantly, “Hand it to the devil!” he broke out; with which he\nclapped the hat on his head and left me.\n\n“Will you read it or not?” I said to Ruth Anvoy, at Wimbledon, when I had\ntold her the story of Mrs. Saltram’s visit.\n\nShe debated for a time probably of the briefest, but long enough to make\nme nervous.  “Have you brought it with you?”\n\n“No indeed.  It’s at home, locked up.”\n\nThere was another great silence, and then she said “Go back and destroy\nit.”\n\nI went back, but I didn’t destroy it till after Saltram’s death, when I\nburnt it unread.  The Pudneys approached her again pressingly, but,\nprompt as they were, The Coxon Fund had already become an operative\nbenefit and a general amaze: Mr. Saltram, while we gathered about, as it\nwere, to watch the manna descend, had begun to draw the magnificent\nincome.  He drew it as he had always drawn everything, with a grand\nabstracted gesture.  Its magnificence, alas, as all the world now knows,\nquite quenched him; it was the beginning of his decline.  It was also\nnaturally a new grievance for his wife, who began to believe in him as\nsoon as he was blighted, and who at this hour accuses us of having bribed\nhim, on the whim of a meddlesome American, to renounce his glorious\noffice, to become, as she says, like everybody else.  The very day he\nfound himself able to publish he wholly ceased to produce.  This deprived\nus, as may easily be imagined, of much of our occupation, and especially\ndeprived the Mulvilles, whose want of self-support I never measured till\nthey lost their great inmate.  They’ve no one to live on now.  Adelaide’s\nmost frequent reference to their destitution is embodied in the remark\nthat dear far-away Ruth’s intentions were doubtless good.  She and Kent\nare even yet looking for another prop, but no one presents a true sphere\nof usefulness.  They complain that people are self-sufficing.  With\nSaltram the fine type of the child of adoption was scattered, the\ngrander, the elder style.  They’ve got their carriage back, but what’s an\nempty carriage?  In short I think we were all happier as well as poorer\nbefore; even including George Gravener, who by the deaths of his brother\nand his nephew has lately become Lord Maddock.  His wife, whose fortune\nclears the property, is criminally dull; he hates being in the Upper\nHouse, and hasn’t yet had high office.  But what are these accidents,\nwhich I should perhaps apologise for mentioning, in the light of the\ngreat eventual boon promised the patient by the rate at which The Coxon\nFund must be rolling up?", "answers": ["She declined to read it."], "length": 22698, "dataset": "narrativeqa", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "0cb4ddf1bedade882d28e7940531bbac3ec45efb1f668635"}

Sunday.\n\n<b>  INT. OUISHI HOUSEHOLD  TOMOKOS ROOM - NIGHT\n</b>\n  CLOSEUP on a TELEVISION SET.  Theres a baseball game on, but the sound \n  is turned completely down.  Camera PANS to show two cute high school \n  girls, MASAMI and TOMOKO.  Masami is seated on the floor at a low coffee \n  table, TEXTBOOK in front of her. Tomoko is at her desk.  There are SNACKS \n  all over the room, and its obvious there hasnt been much studying going \n  on. Masami is currently in mid-story, speaking excitedly.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMASAMI\n</b>\t\tThey say that some elementary school \n\t\tkid spent the night with his parents \n\t\tat a bed and breakfast in Izu.  The kid\n\t\twanted to go out and play with everybody, \n\t\tright, but he didnt want to miss the \n\t\tprogram he always used to watch back in \n\t\tTokyo, so he records it on the VCR in \n\t\ttheir room.  But of course the stations \n\t\tin Izu are different from the ones in \n\t\tTokyo.  In Izu, it was just an empty \n\t\tchannel, so he shouldve recorded\n\t\tnothing but static.  But when the kid \n\t\tgets back to his house and watches the \n\t\ttape, all of a sudden this woman comes \n\t\ton the screen and says--\n\n  Masami points so suddenly and dramatically at her friend that Tomoko \n  actually jumps in her seat.\n\n\t\t\t\tMASAMI (contd)\n\t\tOne week from now, you will die.\n\n  Short silence as Masami pauses, relishing the moment.\n\n\t\t\t\tMASAMI (contd)\t\n\t\tOf course the kids completely \n\t\tfreaked, and he stops the video.  \n\t\tJust then the phone rings, and when he \n\t\tpicks it up a voice says--\n\n  Her voice drops voice almost to a whisper.\n\n\t\t\t\tMASAMI (contd)\t\n\t\tYou watched it, didnt you?  That \n\t\tsame time, exactly one week later... \n\t\thes dead!\n\n  Masami laughs loudly, thoroughly enjoying her own performance.  \n  Tomoko, however, is completely silent.  She begins looking more \n  and more distressed, until finally Masami notices.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMASAMI\n</b>\t\tWhat is it, Tomoko?\n\n  Tomoko comes out of her chair and drops onto the floor next to her \n  friend.  Her words are quick, earnest.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTOMOKO\n</b>\t\tWho did you hear that story from?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMASAMI\n</b>\t\tWho?  Its just a rumor.

Masami slaps her on the knee, \n  laughing.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMASAMI\n</b>\t\tWhats up with you?\n\n  Tomoko speaks slowly, still looking away.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTOMOKO\n</b>\t\tThe other day, I...

Her \n  expression becomes serious as she resumes her conversation.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTOMOKO\n</b>\t\tIwata... he found this weird video.  \n\t\tEveryone was like, Whats that? so \n\t\the put it on and we all watched it.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMASAMI\n</b>\t\t\t(quietly) \n\t\tAnd?  What kind of video was it?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTOMOKO\n</b>\t\tJust... weird, I cant really explain \n\t\tit.  Anyway, right after we finished \n\t\twatching it, the phone rang.

Are you faking me \n\t\tout?\n\n  Tomokos face suddenly breaks into a smile. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTOMOKO\t\n</b>\t\tBusted, huh?\n\n  They both crack up laughing. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMASAMI\n</b>\t\tOh, my... I cant believe you!  \n\n  Masami reaches out, slaps her friend on the knee.\n\n\t\t\t\tMASAMI (contd)\n\t\tYoure terrible!\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTOMOKO\n</b>\t\tGotcha!\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMASAMI\t\n</b>\t\t\t(thinking) \n\t\tBut hang on... you really stayed\n\t\tthe night with Youko and Iwata, \n\t\tright?\n\n  Tomoko nods, uh-huh.  Masami dives forward, pinching her friends \n  cheeks and grinning wildly.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMASAMI\t\n</b>\t\tSo, how far did you and he get?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTOMOKO \t\n</b>\t\tOh... I cant remember.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMASAMI\t\n</b>\t\tYou cant remember, huh?\n\n  Masami laughs, then slaps Tomoko on the knee again as she remembers \n  the trick her friend played on her.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMASAMI\t\n</b>\t\tMan, you had me freaked me out. \n<b>\t\tI--\n</b>\n  Just at that moment, the phone RINGS.  They are both suddenly, \n  instantly serious.  Tomokos eyes go off in one direction and she \n  begins shaking her head, -No-.  Masami looks over her shoulder, \n  following her friends gaze.  \n\n  Tomoko is looking at the CLOCK, which currently reads 9:40.\n\n  The phone continues to ring.  Tomoko is now clutching tightly onto her \n  friend, looking panicked.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMASAMI\n</b>\t\t\t(softly) \n\t\tWas it true?\n\n  Tomoko nods her head, still holding on tightly.  Masami has to \n  forcibly disengage herself in order to stand.  The phone is downstairs, \n  so Masami opens the bedroom DOOR and races down the STAIRS.  Tomoko \n  calls out to her from behind.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTOMOKO\n</b>\t\tMasami!\n\n<b>  INT. OUISHI HOUSEHOLD  STAIRCASE - NIGHT  \n</b>\n  Tomoko and Masami run down the staircase, through the hallway towards \n  the kitchen.  Tomoko cries out again just before they reach the kitchen.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTOMOKO\t\n</b>\t\tMasami!\n\n<b>  INT. OUISHI HOUSEHOLD  KITCHEN - NIGHT  \n</b>\n  Masami has come to a halt before a PHONE mounted on the wall.  She \n  pauses, looking slowly at her friend, then back to the phone.  She \n  takes it tentatively from its cradle, answers it wordlessly.  The \n  tension continues to mount as nothing is said. Masami suddenly breaks \n  into a huge grin.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMASAMI\t\n</b>\t\tIll put her on.\n\n  Still grinning, she hands the phone to Tomoko.

Alone now, Tomoko stands and walks \n  toward the SINK, where she takes a GLASS from the DISH RACK.  She \n  then goes to the FRIDGE and sticks her face in, looking for something \n  to drink.  Suddenly there is the SOUND of people clapping and \n  cheering.  Tomoko, startled, peers her head over the refrigerator \n  door to check for the source of the sound.  \n\n  She begins walking slowly, following the sound to the DINING ROOM \n  adjacent the kitchen. \n\n<b>  INT.

Tomoko pauses a \n  moment, bathed in the garish LIGHT from the TV, which has been switched\n  on.  Playing is the same baseball game they had on the TV upstairs; the \n  same game that Tomokos parents are currently at.  The VOLUME is up \n  quite high.\n\n  A puzzled look on her face, Tomoko takes the REMOTE from the coffee \n  table and flicks the TV off.  She walks back to the kitchen.\n\n<b>  INT.

She picks the bottle up, pours herself a drink.  \n  Before she can take a sip, however, the air around her becomes suddenly \n  charged, heavy.  Her body begins to shiver as somewhere out of sight \n  comes a popping, crackling SOUND underscored by a kind of GROANING.  \n  Trembling now, Tomoko spins around to see what she has already felt \n  lurking behind her.  She draws in her breath to scream.\n\n  The screen goes white, and fades into:\n\n<b>  CAMERA POV \n</b>\n  The screen is filled with the visage of a nervous-looking YOUNG GIRL.  \n  She is being interviewed by ASAKAWA, a female reporter seated offscreen.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tASAKAWA (O.S.)\n</b>\t\tThere seems to be a popular rumor \n\t\tgoing around about a cursed \n\t\tvideotape.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tYOUNG GIRL\t\n</b>\t\tUh-huh.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tASAKAWA (O.S.) \n</b>\t\tHave you heard what kind of video \n\t\tit might be?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tYOUNG GIRL\t\n</b>\t\tUh-huh.\n\n  The girl looks directly at the camera, her mouth dropping into an O \n  as shes suddenly overcome by a kind of stage fright.

Local authorities \n    identified the deceased as a 19-year old preparatory school student \n    of Tokyo, and a 16-year old Yokohama resident, a student of a \n    private all-girls high school. Because there were no external \n    injuries, police are investigating the possibility of drug-induced \n    suicide...\n\n  Just then two men walk by, a GUY IN A BUSINESS SUIT and a youngish \n  intern named OKAZAKI.

OUISHI HOUSEHOLD - NIGHT \n</b>\n  Mother and son halt before the open DOOR to the main wake room, where \n  guests may show their respects to the departed.  The room is laid in \n  traditional Japanese-style tatami, a kind of woven straw mat that \n  serves as a carpet. Two GUESTS, their shoes off, are kneeling upon \n  zabuton cushions.  \n\n  Kneeling opposite the guests is KOUICHI, Asakawas father.  The two \n  guests are bowing deeply, and Kouichi bows in response.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tASAKAWA\t\n</b>\t\tDad.\n\n  Kouichi turns to see her.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKOUICHI\n</b>\t\tAh!\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tASAKAWA\n</b>\t\tHow is sis holding up?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKOUICHI\n</b>\t\tShes resting inside right now.  \n\t\tShes shaken up pretty badly, you \n\t\tknow.

It is made of wood, and surrounded by candles, flowers, and \n  small paper lanterns.  At the center is a PICTURE of the deceased, a \n  teenage girl.  A small wooden PLAQUE reads her name: Tomoko Ouishi. It \n  is the same Tomoko from the first scene.\n\n  Yoichi continues to stare at Tomokos picture.  He makes a peculiar \n  gesture as he does so, rubbing his index finger in small circles just \n  between his eyes.\n\n<b>  INT.

The aunt speaks in a \n  fierce, quick whisper.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tAUNT\t\t\n</b>\t\tHave you heard anything more about \n\t\tTomo-chans death?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tASAKAWA\t\n</b>\t\tNo, I...\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tAUNT\t\t\n</b>\t\tBut the police have already finished \n\t\ttheir autopsy!\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tASAKAWA\t\n</b>\t\tWell, they said there was no sign of \n\t\tfoul play.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tAUNT\t\n</b>\t\t\t(shaking her head) \n\t\tThat was no normal death.

Her reflection in \n  the screen looks stretched, distorted.\n\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYOMI\t(O.S.) \n</b>\t\tThey tell me that Yoichi came to \n\t\tthe funeral, too. \n\n  Asakawa steps back into the kitchen.  She addresses her sister, who \n  continues to stare out at nothing.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tASAKAWA\n</b>\t\tMmm-hmm.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYOMI\n</b>\t\tThey used to play a lot together, didnt they?  Upstairs.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tASAKAWA\t\n</b>\t\tYeah...\n\n  Ryomi lapses back into a silence.  Asakawa waits for her to say more, \n  but when it is clear that nothing else is forthcoming, she quietly gives \n  up and exits the kitchen.\n\n<b>  INT. OUISHI HOUSEHOLD  STAIRCASE - DAY  \n</b>\n  Asakawa climbs the steps to the second floor.  She makes her way down \n  the hall.\n\n<b>  INT. OUISHI HOUSEHOLD - TOMOKOS ROOM - DAY  \n</b>\n  As if intruding, Asakawa walks slowly, cautiously into Tomokos room.  \n  The window to the room is open, and a single piece of folded white PAPER \n  on Tomokos desk flutters in the breeze.  Asakawa walks towards it, picks \n  it up.  It is a RECEIPT from a photo shop.  The developed photos have yet \n  to be claimed.  \n\n  Asakawa senses something, spins to look over her shoulder.  Her sister \n  has crept quietly up the stairs and down the hall, and stands now in the \n  doorway to Tomokos room.  She appears not to notice what Asakawa has in \n  her hands, as her gaze has already shifted to the sliding closet door.  \n  She regards it almost druggedly.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYOMI\n</b>\t\t\t(haltingly) \n\t\tThis... this is where Tomoko died.\n\n<b>  FLASHBACK\n</b><b>\t\t\t\tRYOMI (O.S.)\n</b>\t\tTomoko!\n\n  Ryomis hands fling aside the CLOSET DOOR.  Within, she finds the pale \n  blue CARCASS of her daughter, curled up into an unnatural fetal position.  \n  Tomokos mouth yawns gaping, her eyes glassy and rolled up into the back \n  of her head.  Her hands are caught in her hair, as if trying to pull it \n  out by the roots.  It is a horrific scene, one that says Tomoko died as \n  if from some unspeakable fear.\n\n<b>  PRESENT\n</b>\n  Ryomi sinks to her knees, hitting the wooden floor hard.  She puts her \n  face into her hands and begins sobbing loudly.  Asakawa says nothing.\n\n<b>  EXT. CAMERA SHOP  DAY\n</b>\n  Asakawa leaves the camera shop clutching Tomokos unclaimed PHOTOS.  She \n  walks out onto the sidewalk and begins flipping through them.  We see \n  Tomoko standing arm-in-arm with Iwata, her secret boyfriend. Tomoko and \n  her friends eating lunch.  The camera had its date-and-time function \n  enabled, and the photos are marked\n\n<b>    97 8 29.\n</b>\n  The next shot is of Tomoko, Iwata, and another young couple posing in \n  front of a SIGN for a bed and breakfast.  The sign reads:\n\n<b>    IZU PACIFIC LAND\n</b>\n<b>\t\t\t\tASAKAWA\t\n</b>\t\tIzu...\n\n  Asakawa continues looking through the photos, various shots of the \n  four friends clowning around in their room.  Suddenly she comes to a \n  shot taken the next day, at check out.  The friends are lined up, arms \n  linked-- and all four of their faces are blurred, distorted as if \n  someone had taken an eraser to them and tried to rub them out of \n  existence.\n\n<b>  INT. ASAKAWAS APARTMENT  KITCHEN - DAY\n</b>\n  Asakawa wears an APRON, and is frying something up on the STOVE.  Yoichi \n  stands watching.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tASAKAWA\t\n</b>\t\tLook, Im probably going to be late\n\t\tcoming home tonight, so just stick \n\t\tyour dinner in the microwave when \n\t\tyoure ready to eat, OK?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tYOICHI\t\n</b>\t\tK...

She shakes him roughly.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tASAKAWA\t\n</b>\t\tWhat did you say?

Asakawa goes back to the stove, but stops after only \n  a few stirs, staring off and thinking.\n\n  Caption-- September 13th.  Monday.\n\n<b>  EXT.

COUNTRY ROAD  DAY\n</b>\n  Asakawas car drives past a sign reading:\n\n<b>\tIZU PACIFIC LAND\n</b>\n<b>  EXT. IZU PACIFIC LAND - DRIVEWAY  DAY\n</b>\n  Asakawa has left her car and is walking around the driveway of what is \n  less a bed and breakfast and more like a series of cabin-style rental \n<b>  COTTAGES. \n</b>\n  She wanders about for a while, trying to get her bearings.  She pauses \n  now in front of a particular cottage and reaches into her PURSE.  She \n  withdraws the PICTURE from the photomat, the one that showed Tomoko and \n  her friends with their faces all blurred.  The four are posing in front \n  of their cottage, marked in the photograph as B4.  Asakawa lowers the \n  photo to regard the cottage before her.\n\n<b>    B4\n</b>\n  She walks to the door, turns the handle experimentally.  Its open.  \n  Asakawa walks in.\n\n<b>  INT. PACIFIC LAND - COTTAGE B4  DAY\n</b>\n  Asakawa lets her eyes wander around the cottage.  It looks very modern, \n  all wood paneling and spacious comfort.  \n\n  Her eyes rest on the TV/VCR setup at the front of the room.  Crouching \n  before the VCR now, she presses the eject button.  Nothing happens.  \n  She fingers the inside of the deck, finds it empty, then reaches behind \n  to the rear of the VCR, searching.  Again, there is nothing.  Asakawa \n  presses the power button on the television, picks up the REMOTE, and \n  takes a seat on the SOFA.  She runs through a few channels but theyre \n  all talk shows, no clues whatsoever.  She flicks the TV off and leans \n  back in the sofa, sighing.\n\n  Just then, she spies a LEDGER on the coffee table.  These things are \n  sometimes left in hotels in Japan, so that guests can write a few \n  comments about their stay for others to read.  Asakawa picks the \n  ledger up, begins thumbing through it.  She stops at a strange PICTURE\n  obviously drawn by a child, that shows three rotund, almost entirely \n  round personages.  She reads the handwritten MESSAGE.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tASAKAWA\t\n</b>\t\t\"My dad is fat.  My mom is fat.  \n\t\tThats why Im fat, too.\"\n\n  She smiles in spite of herself.  \n\n  Asakawa flips through the rest of the ledger, but theres nothing else \n  of any import.  \n\n  She tosses it back onto the coffee table and, sighing again, leans into \n  the sofa and closes her eyes.\n\n<b>  EXT. OUTDOOR CAF - DUSK  \n</b>\n  Asakawa eats silently, alone.\n\n<b>  INT. PACIFIC LAND - FRONT RECEPTION - NIGHT  \n</b>\n  Asakawa has returned to the bed and breakfast.  As she walks in the \n  door, the COUNTER CLERK rises out of his chair to greet her.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCLERK\n</b>\t\tRoom for one?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tASAKAWA\t\n</b>\t\tUm, actually Im here on business.\n\n  She passes the clerk a picture of Tomoko and her three other friends.  \n  He stares at it for a moment.\n\n\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tASAKAWA\n</b>\t\tThey would have stayed here on \n\t\tAugust 29th, all four of them.  \n\t\tIf theres any information you \n\t\tmight have...\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCLERK\n</b>\t\tUh, hang on just a minute.  \n\n  The clerk turns his back to her, begins leafing through a guest log.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCLERK\t\n</b>\t\t\t(to himself) \n\t\tAugust 29th...\n\n  While she waits, Asakawas eyes start to wander around the room.  \n  Behind the desk is a sign reading Rental Video, and a large wooden \n  BOOKSHELF filled with VIDEOTAPES. They are all in their original boxes, \n  and she lets her eyes glance over the titles.  Raiders of the Lost Ark, \n  48 Hours--\n\n  --and then, suddenly, she spies a VIDEOTAPE in a plain, unmarked \n  sleeve, tucked away in the back of the very bottom shelf.  She feels \n  the hairs on the back of her neck rise.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tASAKAWA\t\n</b>\t\tThat...\n\n  The clerk looks up.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCLERK\n</b>\t\tHmm?\n\n  Asakawa stabs a finger excitedly towards the shelf.\n\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tASAKAWA\n</b>\t\tThat!  What tape is that?\n\n  The clerk reaches out for it, grabs it.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCLERK\t\n</b>\t\tThis?  Hmm...\n\n  The clerk pulls the tape out of its SLEEVE and checks for a label.  \n  Its unmarked.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCLERK\n</b>\t\tMaybe one of the guests left it behind\n\n<b>  INT. PACIFIC LAND  COTTAGE B4 - NIGHT \n</b>\n  Asakawa flips on the TV.  Its on channel 2, and there is nothing but \n  static. She kneels down to slide the tape into the deck and pauses a \n  moment, framed in the vaguely spectral LIGHT from the television \n  screen.  Steeling her nerves, she puts the tape into the machine, picks \n  up the remote, and presses play.\n\n\n  NOTE: This next scene is entirely visual.  If you are reading this \n  translation before watching the movie, do yourself a favor; STOP \n  reading this now and watch the scene for itself.  Afterwards, you can \n  come back here to check the meaning of the Japanese characters \n  displayed.\n\n\n<b>  THE VIDEOTAPE\n</b>\n  At first it looks like nothing has happened-- then Asakawa realizes that \n  she is now viewing recorded static instead of broadcast static.  She \n  watches, waiting, but the static continues unbroken.  Asakawa looks \n  down at the remote, is about to press fast forward, when suddenly the \n  picture on the screen clears and for a moment she thinks shes looking \n  at the moon.\n\n  Its not the moon at all, she realizes.  The shape is round like a full \n  moon, but it seems to be made up of thin RIBBONS of cloud streaking \n  against a night sky.  And theres a FACE, she sees, a face hidden in \n  shadows, looking down from above.  \n\n  What is this?\n\n  The scene changes now, and Asakawa notes that the tape has that kind of \n  grainy quality one sees in 3rd or 4th generation copies.  The scene is of \n  a WOMAN brushing her long hair before an oval-shaped MIRROR.  The nerve-\n  wracking grating as if of some giant metallic insect sounds in the \n  background, but the lady doesnt seem to notice.  The mirror the lady is \n  using to brush her hair suddenly changes position from the left part of \n  the wall before which she stands, to the right.  Almost instantly the \n  mirror returns to its original position, but in that one moment in its \n  changed location we see a small FIGURE in a white GOWN.  The woman turns \n  towards where that figure stood, and smiles.\n\n  The screen next becomes a twitching, undulating impenetrable sea of the \n  kanji characters used in the Japanese language.  Asakawa can pick out \n  only two things recognizable:\n\n    local     volcanic eruption\n\n  Now the screen is awash in PEOPLE-- crawling, scrabbling, shambling \n  masses, some of them moving in reverse.  A sound like moaning accompanies \n  them.\n<b>  -\n</b>\n  A FIGURE stands upon a shore, its face shrouded.  It points accusingly, \n  not towards the screen, but at something unseen off to one side.  The \n  insect-like screeching sounds louder. \n<b>  --\n</b>\n  Close up on inhuman, alien-looking EYE.  Inside that eye a single \n  character is reflected in reverse:  SADA, meaning \"chastity.\"\n\n  The eye blinks once, twice.  The symbol remains.\n<b>  ---\n</b>\n  A long shot of an outdoor, uncovered WELL.\n<b>  ----\n</b>\n  Sudden loud, blinding STATIC as the tape ends.\n\n  Asakawa turns the TV off, looking physically drained.  She sighs shakily \n  and slumps forward, resting on her knees.  Just then, she glances at the \n  television screen.  She sees, reflected, a small FIGURE in a white gown \n  standing at the rear of the room.  Shocked, Asakawa draws in breath, \n  spins around.\n\n  The room is empty.  Asakawa runs to the sofa to collect her jacket--\n\n  --and the RINGING of the telephone stops her dead in her tracks.  Zombie-\n  like, she walks towards the telephone, picks it up wordlessly.  \n\n  From the other end comes the same metallic, insectoid SQUEAKING heard on \n  the video.  Asakawa slams the phone down and glances up at the CLOCK.  \n  Its about seven minutes after 7 P.M.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tASAKAWA\t\n</b>\t\t\t(to herself) \n\t\tOne week\n\n  Asakawa grabs her coat, pops the tape out of the deck, and runs out the \n  door.\n\n<b>  EXT. STREET  DAY\n</b>\n  It is dark and raining heavily.  Yoichi, Asakawas son, is walking to \n  school, UMBRELLA firmly in hand.  The sidewalk is quite narrow, and Yoichi \n  comes to a halt when a second PERSON comes from the opposite direction, \n  blocking his way. Yoichi slowly raises his umbrella, peers up to look at \n  this other pedestrian.  It is a MAN, a BAG slung over one shoulder.  He \n  has a beard; unusual for Japan where clean-shaven is the norm.  \n\n  The two continue looking directly at each other, neither moving nor \n  speaking.  Yoichi then walks around the persons left and continues on his\n   way.  The man resumes walking as well.\n\n  Caption-- September 14th.  Tuesday.\n\n<b>  EXT. OUTSIDE AN APARTMENT DOOR - DAY  \n</b>\n  The bearded man, whose name is RYUJI, reaches out to press the DOORBELL, \n  but the door has already opened from within.  Asakawa leans out, holding \n  the door open for him.  Neither of them speaks.  Wordlessly, Ryuji enters \n  the apartment.\n\n<b>  INT. ASAKAWAS APARTMENT - DAY  \n</b>\n  Ryuji puts his bag down, looks around the apartment.  The interior is dark, \n  ominous somehow.  He takes his JACKET off and wanders into the living room.  \n  Asakawa is in the kitchen behind him, preparing TEA.  Ryuji spies the \n  collection of FRAMED PHOTOGRAPHS in living room.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI\n</b>\t\tYoichis in elementary school \n\t\talready, is he?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tASAKAWA\t\n</b>\t\tHis first year.

On the coffee table \n  before them is a VIDEOTAPE in a plain, unmarked case.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tASAKAWA\n</b>\t\tAnd money is...?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI\n</b>\t\tIm teaching at university.\n\n  Ryuji picks up his cup of tea but stops, grimacing, before it is to his \n  lips.  He rubs his forehead as if experiencing a sudden headache.  Ryuji \n  shakes it off and quickly regains his composure.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI\n</b>\t\tAnyway.  You said that the phone rang?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tASAKAWA\n</b>\t\tThats right.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI\t\t\n</b>\t\tSo if I watch it too, that phone over \n\t\tthere--\n\n  He gestures with his mug \n\n\t\t\t\tRYUJI (contd)\n\t\t--should ring.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tASAKAWA\n</b>\t\tRyuji, four people have already \n\t\tdied.

Asakawa reaches quickly, grabs something \n  from the bookshelf behind her-- a POLAROID CAMERA.    She shoves it \n  into Ryujis hands, then turns to look down at the floor.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tASAKAWA\t\n</b>\t\tTake my picture.\n\n  Ryuji raises the camera to his eye.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI\t\t\n</b>\t\tTurn this way.\n\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tASAKAWA\t\n</b>\t\t\t(unmoving) \n\t\tHurry up and take it.\n\n  Ryuji snaps off a shot.  It comes out the other end and he takes it, \n  waits impatiently for an image to appear.  When it does, all he can \n  do is pass it wordlessly over to Asakawa.  Her face is twisted, \n  misshapen.  \n\n  Just like the picture of Tomoko and her friends.\n\n  Asakawa stares at it, horrified.  By the time she finally looks up, \n  Ryuji has already risen from his seat and slid the videotape into the \n  VCR.  Again, the screen is filled with static, only to be replaced \n  with what looks like the moon.  Asakawa slams the Polaroid on the \n  coffee table and goes outside onto the veranda.  \n\n<b>  EXT.

Hes deep in \n  thought, writing in a NOTEPAD. There are multitudes of PEOPLE about \n  him, and we can hear the sounds of their coming and going.  A PAIR \n  OF LEGS attached to a woman in white dress, hose, and pumps appears, \n  heading directly for Ryuji.  Her pace is slow, rhythmical, and as \n  that pace progresses all other sounds FADE into the background, so \n  that all we can hear is the CLOMP, CLOMP as those legs walk to stand \n  just before Ryuji.  The pumps are scuffed, dirtied with grime.  \n\n  A gust of WIND rips by.  Ryuji fights the urge to look up as in his \n  ears rings the same hollowed, multi-voiced BABBLING heard on the \n  videotape.  The sound grows stronger.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI (VO)\n</b> \t\tSo, it was you.  You did it.\n\n  The babbling fades, disappears as slowly the worlds normal \n  background sounds return.

When it does, we can again see the small figure in the \n  white gown, a figure with long black hair. When Ryuji sees this \n  his body stiffens, becomes tense.  Asakawa notices but says nothing.  \n  She also notices something else.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tASAKAWA\n</b>\t\t\t(excitedly) \n\t\tTheres something strange about \n\t\tthis shot.\n\n  She takes the remote from Ryuji, rewinds it a ways.

They leave.\n\n  Mai pouts unhappily a bit, and then breaks into a smile as an idea \n  crosses her mind.  She walks across the room to where Ryuji has set \n  up a large BLACKBOARD filled with mathematical equations.  Grinning, \n  Mai rubs out part of one equation with her sleeve and writes in a \n  new value.\n\n<b>  INT. NEWS STATION  HALLWAY - NIGHT  \n</b>\n  Asakawa and Ryuji stride purposefully.  They stop before a DOOR to \n  the right, which Asakawa unlocks.  They both walk in.\n\n<b>  INT.

They are again watching the scene \n  with the fragmented kanji characters, but despite their efforts have \n  been able to identify only one additional word, bringing the total \n  to three:\n\n\tvolcanic eruption\t  local\t     residents\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI\t\t\n</b>\t\tThis is impossible.\n\n  Ryuji fast forwards, stopping at the scene with the kanji reflected\n  inside an alien-looking EYE.

Theyre \n\t\tprobably waiting for us to find it.\n\n  Asakawa turns a DIAL to bring up the volume, which up until now has \n  been  on mute.  The room is filled with an eerie, metallic GRATING, \n  and Asakawa spins the dial again, shutting it off.  Just as she does, \n  Ryujis eyes widen.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI\t\n</b>\t\tWait a minute.\n\n  He turns the dial again, punches a few buttons as if searching for \n  something.  He listens carefully, and when he hears that strange \n  something again he stops, looks at the screen.\n\n  It is paused at the scene with the figure, pointing, a CLOTH draped \n  over its head.  The figure now looks oddly like a messenger.\n\n  Ryuji and Asakawa exchange glances.  This could be it.  Ryuji flips \n  some more switches, setting the sound for super-slow mo.  What follows \n  is a strange, labored sort of speech- a hidden message-- framed in \n  the skittering distortion of the tape in slow motion. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTAPE\t\n</b>\t\tShoooomonnn bakkkkkarrri toou...  \n\t\tboooouuuukonn ga kuuru zouuu...\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI\t\n</b>\t\t\t(repeating) \n\t\tShoumon bakkari, boukon ga kuru \n\t\tzo.

She has spied an article \n  that looks like...\n\n  Nervously, Asakawa puts the thumb and forefinger of each hand together, \n  forming the shape of a rectangle.  Or a screen.  She places the rectangle\n  over the article she has just discovered, its headlines reading:\n\n    Mount Mihara Erupts \tLocal Residents Urged to Take Precautions\n\n  Ryuji notices her, leans forward excitedly.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tASAKAWA\t\n</b>\t\tIve got it!

KOUJIS HOUSE - GUEST ROOM  NIGHT\n</b>\n  The lights are all off and Asakawa is asleep in her futon.  Her eyes \n  suddenly fly open as a VOICE sounding eerily like her deceased niece \n  Tomoko calls out to her.\n\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTOMOKO (O.S.) \n</b>\t\tAuntie?\n\n  Asakawa looks around the room, gets her bearings.  Her eyes fall on \n  the futon next to hers.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tASAKAWA\n</b>\t\tYoichi?\n\n  There is a BODY in that futon, but it is full-grown, dressed all in \n  black.  It is curled into a fetal position and has its head turned \n  away.\n\n  Suddenly, the IMAGE from the video of the figure with its face \n  shrouded springs to Asakawas mind.  Just an instant, its pointing \n  visage materializes, and then disappears.  It reappears a moment \n  later, pointing more insistently now, and disappears again.  \n\n  Asakawa blinks her eyes and realizes that the futon next to hers is \n  empty.  Yoichi is nowhere to be seen.\n\n  Just then, she hears that high-pitched, metallic SQUEAKING from the \n  video.  Eyes wide with horror, she flings the sliding doors apart--\n  --and there, seated before the television, is Yoichi.\n\n  He is watching the video.\n\n  It is already at the very last scene, the shot of the outdoor well. \n  CLOSEUP on the screen now, and for just an instant we can see that \n  something is trying to claw its way out of the well.  The video cuts \n  off, and the screen fills with static.  \n\n  Shrieking, Asakawa races over to Yoichi, covers his eyes though it is \n  already too late.  She scoots over to the VCR, ejects the tape and \n  stares at it uncomprehendingly.  She is then at Yoichis side again, \n  shaking him roughly.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tASAKAWA\n</b>\t\tYoichi!

When Ryuji speaks up again, his voice is soft, \n  reassuring.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI\t\n</b>\t\tWe still have two days left...\n\n  Just then the VOICE of the innkeeper calls tentatively out from \n  the other side of the sliding door.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKAZUE (O.S.) \n</b>\t\tExcuse me?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI\t\n</b>\t\tCome in.\n\n  Kazue slides the door open.

Yamamura glances up to see Ryuji approaching.  \n  Ryuji takes a seat next to the old man, but its Yamamura who speaks \n  first.

At their touch Ryujis power awakens, and as \n  he peers into the old mans mind there is a sudden blinding\n\n<b>  FLASH\n</b>\n  The setting is a large MEETING HALL.  A number of people are seated \n  in folding chairs before a STAGE, on which are a four MEN in BUSINESS \n  SUITS and a WOMAN in a KIMONO.  A BANNER hangs above the stage, which \n  reads PUBLIC DEMONSTRATION ON THE EXISTENCE OF CLAIRVOYANCE.  \n\n<b>  FLASH\n</b>\n  Ryuji eyes widen as he realizes he is seeing Shizukos demonstration \n  before the press.  He also realizes--\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI\n</b>\t\t\t(to Yamamura)\n\t\tYou were there!\n\n<b>  FLASH\n</b>\n  YAMAMURA SHIZUKO, the woman in the kimono, is sitting at a TABLE \n  onstage.

Asakawa comes running up toward Ryuji and the \n  prone Mr. Yamamura.  Suddenly there is another\n\n<b>  FLASH\n</b>\n  Asakawa, her eyes wide, finds herself inside the scene, reliving it \n  as if she had actually been there.  She watches as Shizuko receives \n  a sealed clay POT in both hands.  Shizuko regards the pot a moment \n  and then places it gently on the table before her.  She takes a \n  calligraphy STYLUS from the table, begins writing on a thin, \n  rectangular sheet of RICE PAPER.  The members of the press talk \n  excitedly, craning their necks for a better look.\n\n  Onstage, a JUDGE holds up the phrase written by Shizuko and the \n  folded sheet of paper taken from the sealed pot.  The phrase on both \n  sheets is identical.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJUDGE\t\t\n</b>\t\tMatch.\n\n  Cameras begin FLASHING excitedly.  Shizukos features melt into a soft \n  smile. \n\n  The experiment is performed again, and again the phrase written by \n  Shizuko corresponds to the sealed sheet of paper.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJUDGE\n</b>\t\tMatch.\n\n  Again and again, Shizuko unerringly demonstrates her power to see \n  the unseen.  Finally, a bearded REPORTER explodes from his chair, \n  begins striding angrily towards the stage.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tREPORTER\t\n</b>\t\tFaker!  This is nothing but trickery, \n\t\tand the lowest form of trickery at \n\t\tthat. \n\n  The reporter stops at the foot of the stage, points his finger \n  accusingly at Shizuko.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tREPORTER\t\n</b>\t\tWhat are you trying to pull, woman?\n\n  A SECOND REPORTER sitting in the front row also rises to his feet.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tREPORTER #2\t\n</b>\t\tThats right!  Professor Ikuma, \n\t\tyoure being fooled!\n\n  By now most of the press has risen from their chairs, pointing and \n  shouting angrily. Onstage, Shizuko backs away, eyes wide and \n  frightened.  She covers both ears, trying to block out the increasing \n  din.  Professor Ikuma holds her protectively by the shoulders.  The \n  first reporter is still shouting angrily, his voice rising above the \n  others.  Suddenly, a pained look crosses his face and he collapses to \n  the floor.  The crowd, and Asakawa as well, see that the reporters \n  face is contorted into a grotesque mask of fear.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tREPORTER #3\t\n</b>\t\tWhats happened?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tREPORTER #4\t\n</b>\t\tHes dead!\n\n\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tREPORTER #5\t\n</b>\t\t\t(to Shizuko) \n\t\tWitch!\n\n  Professor Ikuma begins leading Shizuko offstage.

He looks up excitedly.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI\t\t\n</b>\t\tSadako?!\n\n  He recalls the image from the video, the alien eye with the single \n  character SADA reflected in reverse. *\n\n\n  >* The majority of girls' names in Japanese end in either -mi (\"beauty\") \n  >or -ko (\"child\").  Thus, Sadako means \"Chaste child.\"  Sadako is, of \n  >course, the mysterious daughter of Shizuko and Professor Ikuma.\n\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI\n</b>\t\tSadako killed him?  She can kill \n\t\tjust with a thought?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tYAMAMURA\t\n</b>\t\tShes... a devil spawn.\n\n  CUT back to the demonstration hall.  Sadako, her face completely hidden \n  by her long hair, runs offstage... and heads directly for Asakawa.  \n  Asakawa instinctively raises her arm, and Sadako grasps it fiercely.  \n  All the nails on Sadako hand are stripped away; her fingers are raw, \n  bloody stumps.\n\n  CUT back to the beach.  Asakawa, still caught in the throes of the \n  vision, has begun to swoon.  Finally her legs give out and she crumples \n  to the beach.  Ryuji grabs hold of her supportively.  He glances down at \n  her wrist, sees an ugly, purple BRUISE already beginning to form.  \n\n  The bruise is in the shape of five long, spindly fingers.\n\n  Mr. Yamamura slowly rises to a sitting position, and together the three \n  watch the approach of ominous, dark STORM CLOUDS.\n\n<b>  INT.

He is out of breath, and speaks rapidly.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tHAYATSU\t\n</b>\t\tIts no good.

Glasses \n  rattle wildly.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI\t\n</b>\t\tFine!  Ill try searching myself!\n\n  Ryuji stands and races past Mr. Hayatsu out into the rain.  Hayatsu \n  takes pursuit, calling after him.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tHAYATSU\t\n</b>\t\tMr. Takayama!?  Mr. Takayama...\n\n  Asakawa, left alone, stares down at the tatami mats.\n\n<b>  EXT.

Asakawa closes her eyes in \n  concentration... and suddenly, as with the incident on the beach, \n  Asakawa finds herself drawn into Ryujis psychometric VISION.\n\n<b>  FLASH\n</b>\n  The picture is black and white, grainy like old film.  A YOUNG GIRL in \n  a WHITE GOWN walks slowly towards an open well. She places her hand on \n  the LIP of the well, peers curiously down.  \n\n<b>  FLASH\n</b>\n  Asakawa looks up, her eyes wide open.\n\n<b>  FLASH\n</b><b>  \n</b>  There is now a second person in the vision, an ELDERLY MAN in an old-\n  fashioned tweed SUIT standing behind the young girl.  He suddenly \n  produces some BLADED OBJECT, and strikes the girl savagely across the \n  back of the head.  \n\n  The girl falls forward. The man drops to the ground, grabbing the girl \n  behind the knees and hoisting her limp BODY over the lip and into the \n  well.  The body falls into its depths.\n\n  Panting heavily, the man leans forward and grasps the lip of the well \n  with both hands, looking down.  He flashes a guilty look in either \n  direction, checking that his crime has gone unnoticed, and as he does \n  so Asakawa realizes that she knows this face.  The image from the \n  videotape, like a face in the moon: it had been Sadako inside the well, \n  looking up to see this man staring back down at her.\n\n  This man whose name is Professor Ikuma Heihachiro.\n\n<b>  FLASH\n</b>\n<b>\t\t\t\tASAKAWA\n</b>\t\tHer own father!\n\n  The energy seems to drain out of Asakawa in a rush, and her body \n  crumbles.  Ryuji catches hold of her.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI\t\t\n</b>\t\tIt was Ikuma who put this lid on.  \n\t\tAnd Sadakos still inside.\n\n  Ryuji stands quickly, takes hold of the crowbar.  He inserts it under \n  the lid and begins trying to pry it off, face scrunched with effort.  \n  Asakawa digs her fingers in and lends her own strength as well. Slowly,\n  the lid begins to move.  Ryuji tosses the crowbar aside and the two \n  lean the combined weight of their bodies into it.  The lid slides off, \n  dropping to the earth with a dull THUD.  Ryuji sits to one side, winded \n  with effort, as Asakawa takes hold of the flashlight.  She shines it \n  down into the well, but it only seems to intensify the gloom. What \n  WATER she can see looks fetid and brackish.  Ryuji sees her expression \n  and begins removing his JACKET.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI\n</b>\t\tIll go.\n\n  He walks off, leaving Asakawa alone.\n\n  CUT to an overhead shot of the well.  A ROPE is fastened to one side, \n  and Ryuji has already begun lowering himself down.  His eyes wander \n  overthe grime-smeared WALLS, and with a shudder he begins to pick out \n  human FINGERNAILS.  Torn loose and spattered with blood, countless \n  fingernails line the sides of the well. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI\n</b> \t\tSadako was alive!  Shed tried to \n\t\tclimb her way out.\n\n  Ryujis face twists into a grimace as if momentarily experiencing \n  Sadakosterrible agony.  He waits a moment longer before edging his \n  way down the rope again, finally SPLASHING to rest at the bottom of \n  the well.  He holds his flashlight above the brackish water, calls up \n  to Asakawa.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI\n</b>\t\tLower the buckets!\n\n  Asakawa nods and lowers two plastic BUCKETS fastened to a rope.  Ryuji \n  grabs one and scoops up a bucketful of water, tugging on the rope when \n  finished.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI\n</b>\t\tTake it up!\n\n  Asakawa hoists the bucket up to the rim of the well.  She walks a small \n  distance and tosses the contents out onto the ground.  She happens to \n  glance through the wooden lattice to the outside, and with a start \n  realizes that the sun has already started to set.  A nervous glance at \n  her WATCH later and she is back at the well, lowering the empty bucket \n  to find another full one already awaiting her.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI\n</b>\t\tTake it up!\n\n  In the well, Ryuji glances at his watch.  He looks at it for a long \n  moment, the expression on his face saying Were not going to make it.  \n  Time passes as Asakawa pulls up bucketload after bucketload, her \n  strength beginning to fade.  She half-stumbles, glances up... and is \n  shocked to realize that NIGHT has fallen.\n\n  CUT to Asakawa slowly pulling up yet another bucket, her strength \n  almost gone.  She looks at her watch and sees that it is now past \n  6:00.  She calls frantically down to Ryuji.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tASAKAWA\n</b>\t\tIts already six!\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI\n</b>\t\t\t(explosively) \n\t\tI know!  Hurry up and TAKE IT UP!!\n\n  The bucket slowly jerks into motion.  Asakawa pulls it up to the rim \n  of the well, holds it unsteadily.  She takes one faltering step and \n  falls, spilling the buckets contents onto the ground.  \n\n  CUT to Ryuji in the well, standing ready with another bucketful.\n\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI\n</b> \t\tTake it up!\n\n  Nothing happens.  \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI\n</b>\t\tAsakawa!\n\n  The bucket begins moving, even slower than before.  CUT to Asakawa, \n  her body trembling with effort. By now its all she can do to simply \n  keep her body moving.  She glances behind her, sees through the wooden \n  lattice that it is now pitch black.  A look of resignation crosses her \n  face and she releases her hold on the bucket, her body crumpling and \n  falling in on itself. \n<b>  \n</b>  CUT to the bucket splashing back into the well, narrowly missing \n  Ryuji.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI\t\n</b>\t\t\t(fuming) \n\t\tWhat the hell are you doing?  Trying \n\t\tto get me killed?\n\n  CUT back to Asakawa, her face dead.  Ryuji calls out from the well.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI (O.S.) \n</b>\t\tHey!\n\n  Asakawa falls backward onto the ground, arms splayed. CUT to the rim \n  of the well.  Ryuji pulls himself up over the rim, catches sight of \n  Asakawa.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI\n</b>\t\tAsakawa!\n\n  She lifts her head up but says nothing as Ryuji walks over to her.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI\n</b>\t\tWell change.  Youre in no condition \n\t\tto keep this up.\n\n  Asakawa suddenly springs into life.  Her voice is frantic, fearful.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tASAKAWA:\t\n</b>\t\tNo!\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI\n</b>\t\tWho do you expect to pull up these \n\t\tbuckets, then?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tASAKAWA\n</b>\t\tBut, we dont even know if its doing \n\t\tany good...\n\n  Ryuji strides forward and slaps Asakawa painfully across the cheek.  \n  He begins shaking her roughly for good measure.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI\n</b>\t\tAnd what about Yoichi, huh?  Is his\n\t\tmother not coming to pick him up \n\t\tafter all?\n\n  He releases his hold on her.  The two stare at each other a long time, \n  saying nothing.\n<b> \n</b>  CUT to an overhead shot of Asakawa being lowered into the well. CUT \n  now to Asakawa inside the well, her face and clothes covered with \n  grime, body simultaneously limp with exhaustion and tense with fright.  \n  Unable to resist the impulse, Asakawa slowly looks over her shoulder \n  and down into the well.  The dankness, the claustrophobia seeps in \n  and she draws in her breath in the first signs of panic.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI\n</b>\t\tDont look down!\n\n  She returns her gaze, cranes her neck upward.  CUT to Ryuji leaning \n  over the rim of the well, peering down at her.  For an instant, \n  everything becomes monochrome. Its not Ryuji looking down at her at \n  all; its Professor Ikuma, checking to see if shes still alive or \n  if the blow to the back of her head has finished her off.  CUT to \n  Asakawa, her eyes wide with fright.\n\n  Asakawa comes to rest at the bottom of the well.  A FLASHLIGHT hangs \n  from another rope, but its beam has almost no effect on the darkness.  \n  Asakawa crouches forward, hands moving searchingly through the water.  \n  She calls out pleadingly.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tASAKAWA\n</b>\t\tWhere are you?  Please, come out.\n\n  Asakawa straightens, unties herself from the rope.  A full bucket \n  already awaits.  She tugs on the rope and Ryuji pulls it up.  \n\n  She scoops up a second bucket, but something stops her from sending \n  it up.  Instead, she begins running her arms through the water again, \n  her voice close to tears.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tASAKAWA\n</b>\t\tPlease.  Where are you?\n\n  Asakawa continues her blind fumbling, which sends up little splashes \n  of stagnant water.  With a start, she realizes that her fingers have \n  caught something.  Seaweed?  Asakawa draws her hands close for a \n  better look... and sees that is HAIR.  A thick clump of long, black \n  hair.\n\n  Suddenly a pale, thin ARM shoots out from beneath the water, catching \n  Asakawa just below the wrist.  Asakawas ears are filled with a SOUND \n  like moaning as something slowly rises from its watery slumber.  It \n  is a GIRL, her face completely hidden by long, black hair.  CUT to a \n  shot of Asakawas face.  Far from being frightened, her features are \n  oddly placid.  She regards the fearsome thing before her with an \n  almost tender look.  Asakawa reaches out, lightly strokes that long \n  hair.  \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tASAKAWA\n</b>\t\tIts you...\n\n  She strokes the hair again, and abruptly it peels right off the head \n  with a loud SQUELCH. Revealed is not a face at all but a SKULL.  Its \n  sockets are at first menacingly empty, but then begin to ooze the \n  green SLUDGE it has pulled up from the bottom of the well.  Like a \n  mother comforting a frightened child, Asakawa pulls the skeletal \n  remains to her breast, strokes the bony head comfortingly. Her eyes \n  begin to glaze.\n\n  CUT to Ryuji racing up to the rim of the well, leaning down intently.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI\n</b>\t\tHey!  Asakawa!  Its already 10 \n\t\tminutes past seven!  We did it!\n\n  Down in the well, Asakawa continues staring blankly ahead.  Her body \n  suddenly falls forward, limp.\n\n<b>  EXT. OUTSIDE COTTAGE B4  NIGHT\n</b>\n  Three POLICE CARS are parked outside the rental cottages, crimson \n  headlights flashing.   A few COPS walk by, two of them carrying \n  something off in white PLASTIC BAGS.  CUT to Ryuji and Asakawa \n  sitting on the curb.  Asakawa is staring off at something, a BLANKET \n  draped over her shoulder.  \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tASAKAWA\t\n</b>\t\tWhy would Ikuma have killed her?  \n\t\tHis own daughter...\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI\n</b>\t\tMaybe she wasnt his daughter at all.  \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tASAKAWA\n</b>\t\tWhat?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI\n</b>\t\tMaybe her father... wasnt even human.\n\n  The two exchange glances.  Ryujis gaze falls to Asakawas WRIST, \n  which he suddenly takes and holds close to his face.  The ugly \n  bruise where Sadako had grabbed her has disappeared.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI\n</b>\t\tIts gone...  \n\n  He shakes his head, clearing his analytical mind of their ordeal.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI\n</b>\t\tEnough, already.  Its over.  Cmon.  \n\t\tIll take you home.\n\n  Ryuji stands, pulls Asakawa to her feet.\n\n<b>  EXT. OUTSIDE ASKAWAS APARTMENT - NIGHT  \n</b>\n  Ryujis white CAR pulls up into the parking lot.  He and Asakawa \n  get out, regard each other from opposite sides of the car. There is \n  a long moment where neither of them says anything.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI\t\n</b>\t\tGet some rest.  \n\n  He flashes her the slightest of grins. \n\n\t\t\t\tRYUJI (contd)\n\t\tI still have a thesis to finish. \n\n  CUT to a shot of Ryuji and Asakawa, the car creating an almost \n  metaphoric distance between them. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tASAKAWA\n</b>\t\t...thank you.\n\n  Ryuji nods silently by way of reply.  He gets into his car and \n  drives off.  Asakawa watches him go, and then walks towards the \n  entrance of her apartment.\n\n<b>  INT. ASAKAWAS APARTMENT  BEDROOM  MORNING\n</b>\n  Asakawa walks into her room, sits on the edge of her bed.  It is \n  now morning, and she sits dazedly watching the sun come up.\n\n<b>  INT. RYUJIS APARTMENT  MORNING\n</b>\n  Ryuji sits busily scribbling into a NOTEBOOK.  He stops writing a \n  moment to regard his notes while taking a sip of COFFEE.  He \n  glances over at his BLACKBOARD for confirmation when a small scowl \n  crosses his brow.  Its gone a moment later as he chuckles wryly \n  to himself.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI\n</b>\t\tThat girl...\n\n  Ryuji stands, walks over to the blackboard.  He fixes Mais little \n  prank with a single chalk stroke. \n\n<b>  EXT. ASAKAWAS APARTMENT  VERANDA  MORNING\n</b>\n  Asakawa emerges, taking in the dawn.  At first her face is calm and \n  tranquil... but her features change as the sun almost noticeably \n  darkens and a WIND begins to kick up her hair.  She now looks very \n  anxious.\n\n  Caption-- September 21st.  Tuesday.\n\n\n  NOTE: This next scene is entirely visual.  If you are reading this \n  translation before watching the movie, do yourself a favor; STOP \n  reading this now and watch the scene for itself.\n\n\n<b>  INT. RYUJIS APARTMENT  MORNING\n</b>\n  Ryuji is busy scribbling away at his notes again.  His hand suddenly \n  ceases, eyes dancing worriedly as he hears a faint...\n\n  No.\n\n  Breath rattling fearfully in his throat, Ryuji spins around to face \n  the TELEVISION SET.  He gets out of his seat for a better look, \n  falling to his knees on the tatami. \n\n  The image that fills the screen is the last scene from the videotape; \n  the shot of the well.  \n\n  The SOUND from before comes louder now, more insistent, a metallic \n  screeching that both repulses and beckons him closer. Ryuji crawls on \n  all fours towards the SCREEN, stares at its unchanging image with \n  terrible foreboding.\n\n  There is a flash of MOTION as something shoots out of the well. A \n  hand. First one, and then another, as Sadako, still in her grimy white \n  dress, face hidden beneath long, oily strands of hair, begins slowly \n  pulling herself out.  The television screen jumps unsteadily, fills \n  with static as if barely able to contain her image.  \n\n  CUT back and forth between Ryuji, who is beginning to visibly panic, \n  and the television, which shows Sadako lurching ever closer.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI\n</b>\t\t\t(almost frantic) \n\t\tWhy?!\n\n  The TELEPHONE rings, and Ryuji spins round towards it, breath catching \n  in his throat.  He looks at the phone, over his shoulder at the \n  television, back to the phone.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI\n</b>\t\tThats it!  Asakawa...\n\n  Ryuji scrambles wildly towards the phone.  He takes the receiver but \n  is unable to do more than clutch it fearfully as his gaze is drawn \n  inexorably back to the television.  Sadakos shrouded face has filled \n  the entire screen... and then, television popping and crackling, she \n  jerks forward and emerges from the television onto the floor of \n  Ryujis apartment.  Ryuji backs away, screaming in terror.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI\n</b>\t\tAaargh!\n\n  Sadako lies prone, collapsed, hair splayed out like a drowned corpse.  \n  Only her FINGERS are active, crawling, feeling.  The TIPS of her \n  fingers are little more than bloodied stumps, not a single fingernail \n  on them.  She uses the strength in those fingers to pull herself \n  forward, coming jerkily to her feet.  The joints of her body twist \n  unnaturally, more insect-like than human.\n\n  Ryuji flings the phone aside and begins scrambling about the apartment \n  as if looking for cover.  The strength has already begun to fade from \n  his body, however, and his movements are clumsy, exaggerated. He falls \n  to the floor, panting heavily.  \n\n  Sadako turns to regard him, and for just an instant we can see beneath \n  her impenetrable shroud of hair; a single EYE burns with manic, \n  unbridled hatred.   \n\n  Its gaze meets Ryujis, and his face twists into a grimace as he \n  SCREAMS loudly.\n\n<b>  FLASH\n</b>\n<b>  EXT. KOUJIS HOUSE - FRONT YARD  DAY\n</b>\n  Yoichi sits on the lawn, doodling into a large SKETCHPAD.  He \n  suddenly stops, eyes registering that he has somehow felt his fathers \n  death.\n<b>  \n</b><b>  INT. ASAKAWAS APARTMENT  DAY\n</b>\n  Asakawa clutches the RECEIVER to her ear.  She can still hear the \n  sounds of metallic SCREECHING coming from the video, though they are \n  now becoming softer.\n\n<b>  EXT. OUTSIDE RYUJIS APARTMENT BUILDING  DAY\n</b>\n  Asakawa comes running down a side street, turning the corner and \n  making for the entrance to Ryujis apartment building.  There is a \n  single GUARD posted at the entrance. He reaches out, catches Asakawa \n  lightly by the arm.\n\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tGUARD\n</b>\t\tAre you a resident here, maam?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tASAKAWA\n</b>\t\tIm Takayama Ryujis wife!\n\n  The guard drops his hand, and Asakawa makes for the entrance.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tGUARD\n</b>\t\tIm sorry maam, but theyve already \n\t\ttaken the body away.\n\n  Asakawas spins around, eyes wide.  Body?\n\n<b>  INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE RYUJIS APARTMENT  DAY\n</b>\n  Mai is there, slumped against one wall. Asakawa comes running up, \n  dropping to her knees and grasping Mai by the shoulders.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tASAKAWA\n</b>\t\tWhat happened?\n\n  Mai shakes her head dreamily.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMAI\n</b>\t\tWhen I got here he was just \n\t\tlying there...\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tASAKAWA\t\n</b>\t\tDid he say anything to you?  About \n\t\ta videotape?\n\n  Mai shakes her head again, shakes it harder until the breath \n  catches in her throat.\n\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMAI\n</b>\t\tHis face...\n\n  Mai falls into silence, curls up on herself.  Asakawa leaves her \n  and crosses toward the door to Ryujis apartment.\n\n<b>  INT. RYUJIS APARTMENT - DAY  \n</b>\n  The front DOOR opens wildly, noisily forward.  Asakawa comes \n  rushing in, eyes darting about the apartment.  She thinks \n  frantically to herself.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tASAKAWA (VO)\n</b>\t\tRyuji... why?  Does this mean that\n\t\tYoichi will die, too?  Is the curse \n\t\tnot broken yet?\n\n  Her gaze falls to the television set.  She dives forward, presses \n  the eject button on the VCR.  Sure enough, the TAPE is still in \n  the deck.  She takes the tape and leaves.\n\n<b>  INT. ASAKAWAS APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM  NIGHT\n</b>\n  Asakawa walks slowly, dreamily forward.  She drops the videotape \n  loudly onto the coffee table and slouches into a CHAIR.  Her eyes \n  fall to the framed photographs of Yoichi on one of the shelves.  \n  This snaps Asakawa out of her daze and she begins whispering \n  intently to herself, thinking.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tASAKAWA\n</b>\t\tI was the only one to break \n\t\tSadakos curse.  Ryuji... why...?  \n\t\tSomething I did that you didnt...  \n\t\tSomething I did that you didnt...  \n\n  Asakawa gives up, lowers her face into her hands.  When she looks \n  up again, she happens to glance at the television screen-- and \n  its GLARE reveals that there is someone ELSE in the room with her.  \n  It is the figure from the videotape, the silent accuser with the \n  cloth draped over its face.  With a start, Asakawa realizes that \n  the figure is wearing Ryujis clothes.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tASAKAWA\n</b>\t\tRyuji?!\n\n  She spins around, but the room is empty.  Asakawas mind races.  \n  The figure had been pointing towards her BAG.  She stands, \n  rummages in her bag to produce her copy of the cursed videotape.  \n  She takes Ryujis COPY in her other hand, her eyes darting \n  between the two tapes.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tASAKAWA\n</b>\t\tSomething I did that you didnt...\
