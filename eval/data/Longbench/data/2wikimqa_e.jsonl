{"input": "Who is Hermann Ii, Count Palatine Of Lotharingia's paternal grandfather?", "context": "Passage 1:\nAdolf I of Lotharingia\nAdolf I of Lotharingia, count of Keldachgau, Vogt of Deutz from 1008 until 1018, was the son of Hermann I \"Pusillus\" (the Little Pfalzgraf), count palatine of Lotharingia. He left three sons:\n\nHermann III, Vogt of Deutz in St. Severin (Cologne) und Werden (died 1056);\nAdolf II of Lotharingia, count of Keldachgau, Vogt of Deutz (born 1002, died 1041);\nErenfried, Probst of St. Severin.\nPassage 2:\nHenry of Laach\nHenry of Laach (in German: Heinrich von Laach) was the first count palatine of the Rhine (1085/1087–1095). Henry was the son of Herman I, count of Gleiberg. Henry was a follower of Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor. He had lands in the southeastern Eifel and on the Moselle River.\nMost of the holdings of Hermann II, Count Palatine fell back to the emperor, when Hermann died without successor. The emperor named Henry count palatine of the Rhine and during the emperor's trip to Italy tasked Henry to hold interim judicial councils. Henry married Herman's widow, Adelaide of Weimar-Orlamünde (d. 1100). From this marriage, Henry may have taken control over some of her holdings along the Moselle. As a consequence, the geographic center of the palatinate moved towards the south.\nWith his wife, Adelaide, Henry founded the Maria Laach Abbey. He was succeeded by his stepson, Siegfried of Ballenstedt.\nPassage 3:\nHermann II, Count Palatine of Lotharingia\nHermann II (born 1049; died Dalhem, 20 September 1085), Count Palatine of Lotharingia 1064–1085. He was count in the Ruhrgau and the Zulpichgau, as well as a count of Brabant.\n\nLife\nAccording to Egon Kimpen he was the son of Henry I of Lotharingia († 1061) and Mathild of Verdun († 1060), daughter of Gozelo I of Lotharingia, but the basis for this has been questioned. However, if that is the case, his maternal uncle was Pope Stephen IX. Until 1064, young Hermann was under the guardianship of Anno II, Archbishop of Cologne, who significantly reduced Hermann's territorial power.\nIn 1080 he married Adelaide of Weimar-Orlamünde († 1100), widow of Adalbert II, Count of Ballenstedt. She was a daughter of Otto of Orlamünde, count of Weimar and margrave of Meissen in Thuringia, and Adela of Brabant. Together they had two children who had died by 1085.\nHe is assumed to have been the last Count Palatine of Lotharingia of the Ezzonian dynasty. He was killed in a duel with Albert III, Count of Namur, near his castle in Dalhem. \nHis widow married again, her third husband being Henry of Laach, count in the Mayfeldgau, who became the first count palatine of the Rhine between 1085 and 1087.\nPassage 4:\nJohn Christian, Count Palatine of Sulzbach\nJohn Christian (23 January 1700 – 20 July 1733; in German: Johann Christian Joseph) was the Count Palatine of Sulzbach from 1732–33. He was the second and youngest surviving son of duke Theodore Eustace, Count Palatine of Sulzbach (1659–1732) with his consort Eleonore Maria Amalia of Hesse-Rotenburg (1675–1720). His elder brother was Joseph Charles, Count Palatine of Sulzbach.\n\nLife\nAfter the death of his elder brother Joseph Charles, John Christian Joseph became the eventual designated heir of the Electoral Palatine. In 1732 he succeeded his father as Count Palatine of Sulzbach, but died in Sulzbach in 1733 before inheriting the Palatinate.\nCharles III Philip, Elector Palatine, a member of the Palatine Neuburg line of Wittelsbach failed to produce a legitimate male heir, and his brothers also. By 1716 it was evident that the Neuburg line would become extinct and that the Sulzbach branch would succeed them.\n\nMarriage\nHe married twice:\n\nMarie Anne Henriëtte Leopoldine de La Tour d'Auvergne (24 October 1708 – 28 July 1728), daughter of Francois Egon de la Tour d'Auvergne, Prince of Auvergne, and had the following children:Charles Theodore (11 December 1724 – 16 February 1799); became Elector Palatine in 1742, and Elector of Bavaria in 1777\nMaria Anne (30 May 1728 – 25 June 1728)Eleonore Philippina Christina Sophia of Hesse-Rotenburg  (1712-1759); married on 1731 but had no issue.\n\n\n== Ancestry ==\nPassage 5:\nPhilip William August, Count Palatine of Neuburg\nPhilip William August, Count Palatine of Neuburg (born 19 November 1668 in Neuburg an der Donau; died: 5 April 1693 in Zákupy (German: Reichstadt)) was a  Prince and Count Palatine of Neuburg.\n\nLife\nPhilip William August was the 13th from a total of 17 children of Elector Palatine Philip William (1615-1690) from his second marriage to Elisabeth Amalie (1635-1709), a daughter of Landgrave George II of Hesse-Darmstadt.\nHis oldest sister, Eleonor Magdalene married Emperor Leopold I in 1676.  In August 1689, after he had visited his brother in Breslau and his sister in Vienna, Philip William began his Grand Tour to Italy.\nPhilip William August chose a secular career and entered into active military service.  He died at the age of 24 after suffering for seven days from a \"malignant fever\" and was buried in the parish church of Zákupy.  His heart lies in the Court Church in Neuburg on the Danube.\n\nMarriage and issue\nHe married on 29 October 1690 in Raudnitz Anna Maria Franziska (1672–1741), a daughter of Duke Julius Francis of Saxe-Lauenburg.  The wedding ceremony, which had to be postponed due to the illness and death of Philip William August's father, was carried out \"plainly\".  His marriage brought Philipp Wilhelm August the following children:\n\nLeopoldine Eleanor (1691–1693).\nMaria Anna Carolina (1693–1751), married in 1719 Prince Ferdinand of Bavaria (1699–1738).\n\nAncestry\nPassage 6:\nHenry I, Count Palatine of Lotharingia\nHenry I (German: Heinrich; d.1061), was Count Palatine of Lotharingia from 1045 until 1060. He was the son of Hezzelin I, Count in Zülpichgau, and a member of the Ezzonid dynasty. Historians have given several nicknames to Heinrich: Furiosus (the Violent/the Insane), because he murdered his wife, and Monachus (the Monk), because he was confined into an abbey to treat his insanity.\n\nLife\nHenry was the son of Hezzelin I and his unnamed wife, who was probably a daughter of  Conrad I of Carinthia.Around 1048 Henry married Mathilda of Verdun (born abt 1025, died 27 July 1060), daughter of Duke Gozelo of Lotharingia, and sister of pope Stephen IX.\nHe received the Mosellan castle of Cochem from his niece, Queen Richeza of Poland. He was elected as successor for the German kingdom during Emperor Henry III's illness.\nShortly after 1058, Henry began to show signs of insanity, for which he was confined to the abbey of Gorze. He escaped however, and thinking that his wife Matilda had been unfaithful to him, he killed her (27 July 1060). Henry then was definitely enclosed into the abbey of Echternach, where he died in 1061. His office and counties were confiscated by Anno II, archbishop of Cologne, who became the guardian of their only son, the later count palatine Hermann II (1064-1085).\nPassage 7:\nRudolph II, Count Palatine of Tübingen\nRudolph II, Count Palatine of Tübingen (died 1 November 1247) was Count Palatine of Tübingen and Vogt of Sindelfingen.  He was the younger son of Rudolph I and his wife Matilda of Gleiberg, heiress of Giessen.\n\nLife\nRudolph II inherited the County Palatine of Tübingen when his elder brother Hugo III died in 1216.  From 1224 onwards, he is described as Count Palatine in many imperial documents, while his younger brother William is merely styled as Count.  Rudolph II supported Bebenhausen Abbey, which his parents had founded. \nNext to his father, Rudolph II is the second most mentioned Count Palatine of Tübingen in imperial documents, mostly in documents by King Henry (VII) of Germany, the son of Emperor Frederick II, who had been elected King of Germany in 1220, at the age of 8.  Frederick II spent much of his time in Italy, leaving his ancestral Swabia in the hands of his son.  Later, in 1232, Henry revolted against his father, and did everything in his power to win the Swabian nobility over to his side.  Rudolph II appears to have been among the noblemen who sided with Henry VII, at least, he is mentioned in 10 different documents of Henry VII and never by Frederick II.  Considering Rudolph's energetic character, one can assume that he intended to use the conflict between Henry VII and Frederick II to expand his own power and aim at an independent position.Swabian noblemen, including Rudolph II and his brother William, Count Hartmann I of Württemberg and a Count of Dillingen, visited Henry VII in Worms on 8 January 1224.  They met Margrave Herman V of Baden was also present, as was Eberhard, Sénéchal of Waldburg and councillor and former guardian of Henry VII in Oppenheim on 5 April 1227 and in Hagenau on 1 May.  In the same year, Rudolph met Duke Louis I of Bavaria, who was an imperial vicar and Conrad of Winterstetten, who was imperial cup-bearer and also a councilor of Henry VII.  He met the Lords of Neuffen and the imperial marshal Anselm of Justingen in Ulm on 23 February 1228.  On 31 August 1228, Rudolph II appears, together with Margrave Herman V of Baden, Count Henry of Wirtemberg, a Count of Dillingen, Conrad of Weinsperg and the councillors mentioned above, as witnesses of a deed in which King henry VII confirms the privileges of Adelber Abbey in Esslingen.  Later that year, Rudolph II appeared as a witness in four deed by Duke Louis I of Bavaria and Bishop Ekbert of Bamberg, together with, among others, Margrave Herman V of Baden, Count Ulrich and Eberhard of Helfenstein, Counts Eberhard and Otto of Eberstein, Count Gottfried of Hohenlohe, and two councilors.Rudolph II stood at the head of a delegation of eight Swabian counts, among them Albert IV of Habsburg, Frederick IV of Zollern and a Count of Eberstein, at the Imperial Diet in Worms on 29 April 1231.  On 22 November 1231, Rudolph II and his brother William met Counts Albert of Rottenburg, Ulrich of Hefenstein and Eberhard of Walpurg at Henry VII's castle in Ulm.  On 31 December 1231, Rudolph witnessed a deed benefiting Neresheim Abbey in Wimpfen, together with Duke Conrad I of Teck and Margrave Hermann V of Baden.  The last time Rudolph II witnessed a deed of Henry VII was on 4 June 1233 in Esslingen, again with his brother William.In 1235, Pope Gregory IX called on the princes of the empire to organize a new crusade into the Holy Land, to render assistance to the beleaguered church there.  Rudolph II is the only Swabian nobleman named in this call to arms; whether he actually went to the Holy Land is unknown.  The fact that he is not mentioned in any deed between 1235 and 1243 suggests that he may have been absent for an extended period.  In particular, no mention is made of his position in the struggle between King Conrad IV of Germany and anti-King Henry Raspe IV, which is remarkable, since this struggle took place mainly in Swabia.  However, a deed in favour of Bebenhausen Abbey which the papal legate made at Rudolph II's request in the army camp outside Ulm on 28 January 1247, suggests that he supported Henry Raspe.\n\nFamily\nThe name of Rudolph II's wife has not been preserved.  She was a daughter of a Margrave Henry from the House of Ronsberg and Udilhild of Gammertingen. They had the following children:\n\nHugo IV, Count Palatine of Tübingen\nRudolf III of Scheer (d. 12 May 1277), Count of Tübingen-Herrenberg\nUlrich\nMathilda, married Burchard II, Count of Hohenberg (d. 14 July 1253, struck by lightning).  Their daughter Gertrude Anna (c. 1225 – 16 February 1281) married Emperor Rudolf I, the first Emperor from the House of Habsburg.\n\n\n== Footnotes ==\nPassage 8:\nReichard, Count Palatine of Simmern-Sponheim\nReichard (25 July 1521 – 13 January 1598) was the Count Palatine of Simmern-Sponheim from 1569 until 1598.\nReichard was born in Simmern in 1521 to Johann II, Count Palatine of Simmern. In 1569 he succeeded his brother Georg as Count Palatine of Simmern-Sponheim. Reichard died in Simmern in 1598. Without any surviving children, Simmern-Sponheim was inherited by his great-nephew Frederick IV.\n\nMarriage\nReichard married Juliane of Wied (c. 1545 - 30 April 1575, daughter of Count Johann IV of Wied, on 30 July 1569 and had several children:\n\nJuliana (21 November 1571 – 4 February 1592)\nKatherine (10 May 1573 – 12 October 1576)\nunnamed son (1574)\nunnamed son (30 April 1575)Reichard married Emilie of Württemberg (19 August 1550 - 4 June 1589), daughter of Christoph, Duke of Württemberg, on 26 March 1578.\nReichard married Anne Margaret of Palatinate-Veldenz (17 January 1571 - 1 November 1621), daughter of Count Palatine Georg Johann I, on 14 December 1589.\nPassage 9:\nSabina, Duchess of Bavaria\nSabina, Duchess of Bavaria (1528–1578) was the daughter of John II, Count Palatine of Simmern and Beatrix of Baden.\n\nMarriage\nIn 1544 she married Lamoral, Count of Egmont with whom she had twelve children. When her husband was arrested and accused of treason in 1567, she wrote king Philip II, the king of Spain, a letter to plead for his release. It was to no avail and he was decapitated in the following year. Sabina was buried in Egmont's crypt in Zottegem.\n\nChildren\nCharles, 7th Count of Egmont, Prince de Gavre: married to Marie de Lens,  Lady of Aubigny.\n\nWidowhood\nAfter her death in 1578, she was buried next to her husband in Zottegem.\nPassage 10:\nOtto I, Count Palatine of Mosbach\nOtto I (24 August 1390 – 5 July 1461) was the Count Palatine of Mosbach from 1410 until 1448, and the Count Palatine of Mosbach-Neumarkt from 1448 until 1461.\n\nLife\nOtto was born in Mosbach in 1390 as the youngest son of Rupert III of the Palatinate, King of Germany. In 1410 after the death of his father, the territories of the Palatinate were divided between his four sons; Otto received the territory around Mosbach and Eberbach. He made Mosbach his capital and began the construction of a new residence there. Otto became the regent of the Electorate of the Palatinate and guardian of his nephew Louis IV after his brother Louis III returned from a pilgrimage to Jerusalem seriously ill and died soon after. He held the regency until 1442.\nIn 1448 he inherited half of the territory of the extinct Palatinate-Neumarkt line and purchased the other half from his brother Stephen, and he also established a residence in Neumarkt. Otto died in Reichenbach in 1461 and was buried in the Benedictine Reichenbach Abbey.\n\nMarriage\nOtto married Joanna of Bavaria-Landshut (1413 - 20 July 1444), daughter of duke Henry XVI in January 1430 and had the following children:\n\nMargaret (2 March 1432 - 14 September 1457)\nAmalie (22 February 1433 - 5 December 1488)\nOtto (26 June 1435 - 8 April 1499)\nRupert (25 November 1437 - 1 November 1465)\nDorothea (24 August 1439 - 15 May 1482) Prioress in the Liebenau monastery\nAlbert (6 September 1440 -  20 August 1506)\nAnne (1441 - ?)

{"input": "Where was the director of film Requiem For Dominic born?", "context": "Passage 1:\nBrian Kennedy (gallery director)\nBrian Patrick Kennedy (born 5 November 1961) is an Irish-born art museum director who has worked in Ireland and Australia, and now lives and works in the United States.  He was the director of the Peabody Essex Museum in Salem for 17 months, resigning December 31, 2020. He was the director of the Toledo Museum of Art in Ohio from 2010 to 2019. He was the director of the Hood Museum of Art from 2005 to 2010, and the National Gallery of Australia (Canberra) from 1997 to 2004.\n\nCareer\nBrian Kennedy currently lives and works in the United States after leaving Australia in 2005 to direct the Hood Museum of Art at Dartmouth College. In October 2010 he became the ninth Director of the Toledo Museum of Art. On 1 July 2019, he succeeded Dan Monroe as the executive director and CEO of the Peabody Essex Museum.\n\nEarly life and career in Ireland\nKennedy was born in Dublin and attended Clonkeen College. He received B.A. (1982), M.A. (1985) and PhD (1989) degrees from University College-Dublin, where he studied both art history and history.\nHe worked in the Irish Department of Education (1982), the European Commission, Brussels (1983), and in Ireland at the Chester Beatty Library (1983–85), Government Publications Office (1985–86), and Department of Finance (1986–89). He married Mary Fiona Carlin in 1988.He was Assistant Director at the National Gallery of Ireland in Dublin from 1989 to 1997. He was Chair of the Irish Association of Art Historians from 1996 to 1997, and of the Council of Australian Art Museum Directors from 2001 to 2003. In September 1997 he became Director of the National Gallery of Australia.\n\nNational Gallery of Australia (NGA)\nKennedy expanded the traveling exhibitions and loans program throughout Australia, arranged for several major shows of Australian art abroad, increased the number of exhibitions at the museum itself and oversaw the development of an extensive multi-media site.  Although he oversaw several years of the museum's highest ever annual visitation, he discontinued the emphasis of his predecessor, Betty Churcher, on showing \"blockbuster\" exhibitions.\nDuring his directorship, the NGA gained government support for improving the building and significant private donations and corporate sponsorship. However, the initial design for the building proved controversial generating a public dispute with the original architect on moral rights grounds.  As a result, the project was not delivered during Dr Kennedy's tenure, with a significantly altered design completed some years later.  Private funding supported two acquisitions of British art, including David Hockney's A Bigger Grand Canyon in 1999, and Lucian Freud's After Cézanne in 2001. Kennedy built on the established collections at the museum by acquiring the Holmgren-Spertus collection of Indonesian textiles; the Kenneth Tyler collection of editioned prints, screens, multiples and unique proofs; and the Australian Print Workshop Archive. He was also notable for campaigning for the construction of a new \"front\" entrance to the Gallery, facing King Edward Terrace, which was completed in 2010 (see reference to the building project above).\nKennedy's cancellation of the \"Sensation exhibition\" (scheduled at the NGA from 2 June 2000 to 13 August 2000) was controversial, and seen by some as censorship. He claimed that the decision was due to the exhibition being \"too close to the market\" implying that a national cultural institution cannot exhibit the private collection of a speculative art investor. However, there were other exhibitions at the NGA during his tenure, which could have raised similar concerns. The exhibition featured the privately owned Young British Artists works belonging to Charles Saatchi and attracted large attendances in London and Brooklyn. Its most controversial work was Chris Ofili's The Holy Virgin Mary, a painting which used elephant dung and was accused of being blasphemous. The then-mayor of New York, Rudolph Giuliani, campaigned against the exhibition, claiming it was \"Catholic-bashing\" and an \"aggressive, vicious, disgusting attack on religion.\" In November 1999, Kennedy cancelled the exhibition and stated that the events in New York had \"obscured discussion of the artistic merit of the works of art\". He has said that it \"was the toughest decision of my professional life, so far.\"Kennedy was also repeatedly questioned on his management of a range of issues during the Australian Government's Senate Estimates process - particularly on the NGA's occupational health and safety record and concerns about the NGA's twenty-year-old air-conditioning system. The air-conditioning was finally renovated in 2003. Kennedy announced in 2002 that he would not seek extension of his contract beyond 2004, accepting a seven-year term as had his two predecessors.He became a joint Irish-Australian citizen in 2003.\n\nToledo Museum of Art\nThe Toledo Museum of Art is known for its exceptional collections of European and American paintings and sculpture, glass, antiquities, artist books, Japanese prints and netsuke. The museum offers free admission and is recognized for its historical leadership in the field of art education.  During his tenure, Kennedy has focused the museum's art education efforts on visual literacy, which he defines as \"learning to read, understand and write visual language.\"   Initiatives have included baby and toddler tours, specialized training for all staff, docents, volunteers and the launch of a website, www.vislit.org. In November 2014, the museum hosted the International Visual Literacy Association (IVLA) conference, the first Museum to do so. Kennedy has been a frequent speaker on the topic, including 2010 and 2013 TEDx talks on visual and sensory literacy.\nKennedy has expressed an interest in expanding the museum's collection of contemporary art and art by indigenous peoples. Works by Frank Stella, Sean Scully, Jaume Plensa, Ravinder Reddy and Mary Sibande have been acquired.  In addition, the museum has made major acquisitions of Old Master paintings by Frans Hals and Luca Giordano.During his tenure the Toledo Museum of Art has announced the return of several objects from its collection due to claims the objects were stolen and/or illegally exported prior being sold to the museum.  In 2011 a Meissen sweetmeat stand was returned to Germany followed by an Etruscan Kalpis or water jug to Italy (2013), an Indian sculpture of Ganesha (2014) and an astrological compendium to Germany in 2015.\n\nHood Museum of Art\nKennedy became Director of the Hood Museum of Art in July 2005. During his tenure, he implemented a series of large and small-scale exhibitions and oversaw the production of more than 20 publications to bring greater public attention to the museum's remarkable collections of the arts of America, Europe, Africa, Papua New Guinea and the Polar regions. At 70,000 objects, the Hood has one of the largest collections on any American college of university campus. The exhibition, Black Womanhood: Images, Icons, and Ideologies of the African Body, toured several US venues. Kennedy increased campus curricular use of works of art, with thousands of objects pulled from storage for classes annually. Numerous acquisitions were made with the museum's generous endowments, and he curated several exhibitions: including Wenda Gu: Forest of Stone Steles: Retranslation and Rewriting Tang Dynasty Poetry, Sean Scully: The Art of the Stripe, and Frank Stella: Irregular Polygons.\n\nPublications\nKennedy has written or edited a number of books on art, including:\n\nAlfred Chester Beatty and Ireland 1950-1968: A study in cultural politics, Glendale Press (1988), ISBN 978-0-907606-49-9\nDreams and responsibilities: The state and arts in independent Ireland, Arts Council of Ireland (1990), ISBN 978-0-906627-32-7\nJack B Yeats: Jack Butler Yeats, 1871-1957 (Lives of Irish Artists), Unipub (October 1991), ISBN 978-0-948524-24-0\nThe Anatomy Lesson: Art and Medicine (with Davis Coakley), National Gallery of Ireland (January 1992), ISBN 978-0-903162-65-4\nIreland: Art into History (with Raymond Gillespie), Roberts Rinehart Publishers (1994), ISBN 978-1-57098-005-3\nIrish Painting, Roberts Rinehart Publishers (November 1997),  ISBN 978-1-86059-059-7\nSean Scully: The Art of the Stripe, Hood Museum of Art (October 2008), ISBN 978-0-944722-34-3\nFrank Stella: Irregular Polygons, 1965-1966, Hood Museum of Art (October 2010), ISBN 978-0-944722-39-8\n\nHonors and achievements\nKennedy was awarded the Australian Centenary Medal in 2001 for service to Australian Society and its art. He is a trustee and treasurer of the Association of Art Museum Directors, a peer reviewer for the American Association of Museums and a member of the International Association of Art Critics. In 2013 he was appointed inaugural eminent professor at the University of Toledo and received an honorary doctorate from Lourdes University. Most recently, Kennedy received the 2014 Northwest Region, Ohio Art Education Association award for distinguished educator for art education.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nPassage 2:\nOlav Aaraas\nOlav Aaraas (born 10 July 1950) is a Norwegian historian and museum director.\nHe was born in Fredrikstad.

He competed in the men's tournament at the 2004 Summer Olympics.\nPassage 3:\nMaria al-Qibtiyya\nMāriyya bint Shamʿūn (Arabic: ماریة بنت شمعون), better known as Māriyyah al-Qibṭiyyah or al-Qubṭiyya (Arabic: مارية القبطية), or Maria the Copt, died 637, was an Egyptian woman who, along with her sister Sirin bint Shamun, was sent to the Islamic prophet Muhammad in 628 as a gift by Al-Muqawqis, a Christian governor of Alexandria, during the territory's Sasanian occupation. She and her sister were slaves. She spent the rest of her life in Medina and had a son, Ibrahim with Muhammad. The son died as an infant and she died almost five years later.Al-Maqrizi says that she was a native of Hebenu (Coptic: ⲡⲙⲁⲛϩⲁⲃⲓⲛ, Koinē Greek: Ἀλάβαστρων πόλις Alábastrōn pólis, Arabic: الخفن, romanized: al-Khafn), a village located near Antinoöpolis.\n\nBiography\nIn the Islamic year 6 AH (627 – 628 CE), Muhammad is said to have had letters written to the great rulers of the Middle East, proclaiming the continuation of the monotheistic faith with its final messages and inviting the rulers to join. The purported texts of some of the letters are found in Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari's History of the Prophets and Kings. Tabari writes that a deputation was sent to an Egyptian governor named as al-Muqawqis. Maria was a slave who was offered as a gift of goodwill to Muhammad in reply to his envoys inviting the governor of Alexandria to Islam. Muhammad emancipated her after the birth of her son.\nTabari recounts the story of Maria's arrival from Egypt:\n\nIn this year Hātib b. Abi Balta'ah came back from al-Muqawqis bringing Māriyah and her sister Sīrīn, his female mule Duldul, his donkey Ya'fūr, and sets of garments. With the two women al-Muqawqis had sent a eunuch, and the latter stayed with them. Hātib had invited them to become Muslims before he arrived with them, and Māriyah and her sister did so. The Messenger of God, peace and blessings of Allah be upon Him, lodged them with Umm Sulaym bt. Milhān. Māriyah was beautiful. The prophet sent her sister Sīrīn to Hassān b. Thābit and she bore him 'Abd al-Rahmān b. Hassān.\nThe death of Ibrahim caused Muhammad to weep.\n\nStatus as a wife or concubine\nMuhammad's earliest biographers, like Ibn Ishaq, Ibn Sa’d, and al-Tabari, mentioned Mariyah as the Prophet’s slavegirl or concubine in their sirah.Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya is another scholar and biographer of prophet Muhammad who writes a sirah called Zad al-Ma'ad where he mentioned Mariyah as a slave girl.Like Rayhana bint Zayd, there is some debate between historians and scholars as to whether Mariyah ever became Muhammad's wife or remained a concubine. An indication that she was a concubine is that when she bore her son to Muhammad, she was set free.\nIbn ‘Abbas said: When Maria gave birth to Ibrahim the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said, ‘Her son has set her free.’  There is also strong evidence that there was no living quarter for her in the proximity of the Prophet's Mosque. Only the wives of Muhammad had their quarters adjacent to one another in the proximity of his mosque at Medina. Maria was made to reside permanently in an orchard, some three kilometers from the mosque. Evidence that suggests she was a concubine is in the narration:\nAnas said:  The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) had a female-slave (amat) with whom he had intercourse, but ‘Aishah and Hafsah would not leave him alone until he said that she was forbidden for him. Then Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, revealed: “O Prophet! Why do you forbid (for yourself) that which Allah has allowed to you.’ until the end of the Verse.”\nThe ‘female-slave’ referred to in this narration was Maria, the Copt, as specified in a hadith attributed to Umar and classified as sahih by Ibn Kathir, which names her Umm Ibrahim (the mother of Ibrahim).In a report from Ibn ‘Abbas and ‘Urwah b. al-Zubair concerning the same incident, Muhammad said to Hafsa:\n\nI make you witness that I my concubine (surriyyati) is now forbidden unto me.\nSome Islamic scholars point to a different Asbāb al-nuzūl (circumstance of revelation) for the above incident, saying it was only caused by Muhammad drinking honey, as narrated in Sahih al-Bukhari by Muhammed's wife Aisha:\nThe Prophet (ﷺ) used to stay (for a period) in the house of Zaynab bint Jahsh (one of the wives of the Prophet ) and he used to drink honey in her house. Hafsa bint Umar and I decided that when the Prophet (ﷺ) entered upon either of us, she would say, \"I smell in you the bad smell of Maghafir (a bad smelling raisin). Have you eaten Maghafir?\" When he entered upon one of us, she said that to him. He replied (to her), \"No, but I have drunk honey in the house of Zaynab bint Jahsh, and I will never drink it again.\"\nHowever, another narration in Sunan Abu Dawud indicates that drinking honey is a euphemism for sexual intercourse:\n\nThe Apostle of Allah (peace be upon him) was asked about a man who divorced his wife three times, and she married another who entered upon her, but divorced her before having intercourse with her, whether she was lawful for the former husband. She said: The Prophet (peace be upon him) replied: She is not lawful for the first (husband) until she tastes the honey of the other husband and he tastes her honey.\nAl-Tabari lists Maria as both one of Muhammad's wives and his slave, perhaps using \"wife\" in the sense of one whom Muhammad slept with and who mothered his child.\nMariyah the Copt was presented to the Messenger of God, given to him by al-Muqawqis, the ruler of Alexandria, and she gave birth to the Messenger of God’s son Ibrahim. These were the Messenger of God's wifes.\nThe Prophet admired Umm Ibrahim [\"Mother of Ibrahim,\" Mariyah’s title], who was fair-skinned and beautiful. He lodged her in al-‘Aliyah, at the property nowadays called of Umm Ibrahim. He used to visit her there and ordered her to veil herself, [but] he had intercourse with her by virtue of her being his property...\nOne hadith attributed to Mus‘ab b. ‘Abdullah al-Zubairi states that the two were married, though another rendering of the hadith by Mus‘ab's nephew Zubair b. al-Bakkar makes no mention of marriage.\n\nSee also\nAisha bint Abu Bakr\nList of non-Arab Sahaba\n\nNotes\nPassage 4:\nIbrahim ibn Muhammad Al ash-Sheikh\nIbrahim ibn Muhammad Al ash-Sheikh  was a leading Salafi scholar in Saudi Arabia and minister of justice between 1975 and 1990.\n\nBackground\nIbrahim ibn Muhammad Al ash-Sheikh was born into the noted family of Saudi religious scholars, the Al ash-Sheikh, descendants of Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab, the influential Muslim scholar. He was the eldest son of Muhammad ibn Ibrahim Al ash-Sheikh, Grand Mufti of Saudi Arabia until 1969.\n\nCareer\nIbrahim ibn Muhammad was one of the most influential religious leaders in the early 1970s. He maintained a close relationship with King Faisal, with whom he met on a weekly basis. He believed that Saudi Arabia should take a leading role in the Arab world and pushed for Saudi involvement in war with Israel.Between 1975 and 1990, he served as minister of justice.\n\nFamily\nHis brother Abdullah ibn Muhammad Al ash-Sheikh, a younger son of the late Grand Mufti, also served as minister of justice, from 1993 to 2009. His grandson Turki is a lawyer practicing in London and Riyadh.\nPassage 5:\nAbdullah ibn Muhammad\nʿAbd Allāh ibn Muḥammad (Arabic: عَبْد ٱللَّٰه ٱبْن مُحَمَّد) also known as al-Ṭāhir (lit. 'the pure') and al-Ṭayyib (lit. 'the good') was one of the sons of Muhammad and Khadija. He died in childhood.\nHis full name was Abd Allah ibn Muhammad ibn Abd Allah ibn Shaiba. His father became a successful merchant and was involved in trade. Due to his upright character Muhammad acquired the nickname \"al-Amin\" (Arabic: الامين), meaning \"faithful, trustworthy\" and \"al-Sadiq\" meaning \"truthful\" and was sought out as an impartial arbitrator. His reputation attracted a proposal in 595 from Khadija, a successful businesswoman. Muhammad consented to the marriage, which by all accounts was a happy one. After the marriage was consummated, his elder brother al-Qasim was born. Qasim was the eldest son of Muhammad and Khadija. After Qasim, his four sisters were born. Abd Allah was born around 611. He was the youngest child of Muhammad and Khadija.\nMuhammad gave him the name of his father. Abd Allah died at 4 in 615 CE.\n\nSiblings\n\nQasim ibn Muhammad\nZainab bint Muhammad\nRuqayya bint Muhammad\nUmm Kulthum bint Muhammad\nFatima bint Muhammad\nIbrahim ibn Muhammad\nPassage 6:\nIbrahim ibn Muhammad\nIbrāhīm ibn Muḥammad (Arabic: إِبْرَاهِيم ٱبْن مُحَمَّد), was the son of the Islamic prophet Muhammad and Maria al-Qibtiyya. He died at the age of 2.\n\nEclipse occurrence\nIn his book \"Al-Bidāya wa-n-Nihāya\" Ibn Kathir mentions that Ibrahim died on Thursday 10 Rabi' al-Awwal 10 AH, and on the same day right after his death, an eclipse of the sun occurred, so people at the moment started talking that Allah is showing his condolences to his prophet by eclipsing the Sun. Muhammad, not wanting his companions to fall into Fitna by ascribing divinities to him or his son, stood at the mosque and said:  \"The sun and the moon do not eclipse because of the death or life (i.e. birth) of someone. When you see the eclipse pray and invoke Allah.\"\n\nIllness and death\nMuhammad's wife, and the mother of believers, Ibrahim's mother was an Egyptian woman who came from Byzantine official to Muhammad in 628. According to Ibn Kathir, quoting Ibn Sa'd, he was born in the last month of the year 8 AH, equivalent of 630 CE. Muslim scholars such as Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj and Al-Nasa'i mention that Al-Waqidi is not reliable and is not trustworthy to be quoted. The child was named after Abraham (or Ibrahim in Arabic) the Biblical prophet revered in Jewish, Christian and Muslim traditions. Ibrahim was placed in the care of a nurse called Umm Sayf, wife of Abu Sayf, the blacksmith, in the tradition of the Arabs of the time, to whom Muhammad gave some goats to complement her milk supply. When he fell ill he was moved to a date orchard near the residence of his mother, under the care of her and her sister Sirin. When it was clear that he would not likely survive, Muhammad was informed. His reaction to the news is reported as:\n\nHe was so shocked at the news that he felt his knees could no longer carry him, and asked `Abd al Rahman ibn `Awf to give him his hand to lean upon. He proceeded immediately to the orchard and arrived in time to bid farewell to an infant dying in his mother's lap. Prophet Muhammad took the child and laid him in his own lap while shaking his hand. His heart was torn apart by the new tragedy, and his face mirrored his inner pain. Choking with sorrow, he said to his son, \"O Ibrahim, against the judgement of God, we cannot avail you a thing,\" and then fell silent. Tears flowed from his eyes. The child lapsed gradually, and his mother and aunt watched and cried incessantly, and the Prophet never ordered them to stop. As Ibrahim surrendered to death, Prophet Muhammad's hope which had consoled him for a brief while completely crumbled. With tears in his eyes he talked once more to the dead child: \"O Ibrahim, were the truth not certain that the last of us will join the first, we would have mourned you even more than we do now.\" A moment later he said: \"The eyes send their tears and the heart is saddened, but we do not say anything except that which pleases our Lord. Indeed, O Ibrahim, we are bereaved by your departure from us.\"\n\nBurial\nMuhammad is also reported as having informed Maria and Sirin that Ibrahim would have his own nurse in Paradise. Different accounts relate that the ghusl for Ibrahim was performed by either Umm Burdah, or al-Fadl ibn ʿAbbas, in preparation for burial. Thereafter, he was carried to the cemetery upon a little bier by Muhammad, his uncle al-ʿAbbas, and others. Here, after a funeral prayer led by Muhammad, he was interred. Muhammad then filled the grave with sand, sprinkled some water upon it, and placed a landmark on it, saying that \"Tombstones do neither good nor ill, but they help appease the living. Anything that man does, God wishes him to do well.\"\n\nSiblings\nQasim ibn Muhammad\nAbd Allah ibn Muhammad\nZainab bint Muhammad\nRuqayya bint Muhammad\nUmm Kulthum bint Muhammad\nFatimah al-Zahra bint Muhammad\n\nSee also\nIslam and children\nPassage 7:\nIbrahim ibn al-Husayn (Ibn al-Walid)\nIbrahim ibn al-Husayn ibn Ali ibn Muhammad ibn al-Walid (Arabic: إبراهيم بن الحسين بن علي بن محمد بن الوليد, romanized: Ibrāhīm ibn al-Ḥusayn ibn ʿAlī ibn Muḥammad ibn al-Walīd) was the eleventh Tayyibi Isma'ili Dāʿī al-Muṭlaq in Yemen, from 1287 to his death in 1328.\n\nLife\nIbrahim was a member of the Banu al-Walid al-Anf family, that dominated the office of Dāʿī al-Muṭlaq almost continuously in the 13th to early 16th centuries. He was the son of the eighth Dāʿī, Al-Husayn ibn Ali, and brother of the ninth Dāʿī, Ali ibn al-Husayn. Ibrahim moved his seat from Sanaa to the fortress of Af'ida, and in 1325 he took over the town of Kawkaban, where he started gathering military forces to oppose the Zaydi imams.He was succeeded by Muhammad ibn Hatim (1327–1328), who in turn was succeeded by Ibrahim's son Ali Shams al-Din I.\n\nTomb\nHis grave, along with those of the 12th and 13th Dāʿīs, were hidden and unknown until recently, when the archaeological authority of Yemen, along with Dawoodi Bohras living there, located them on Hisn Af'ida.

It was Fassbinder's last film, released shortly after his death at the age of 37.\n\nPlot\nThe plot centers on the handsome Belgian sailor Georges Querelle, who is also a thief and murderer. When his ship, Le Vengeur, arrives in Brest, he visits the Feria, a bar and brothel for sailors run by the Madame Lysiane, whose lover, Robert, is Querelle's brother. Querelle has a love/hate relationship with his brother: when they meet at La Feria, they embrace, but also punch one another slowly and repeatedly in the belly. Lysiane's husband Nono works behind the bar and also manages La Feria's underhanded affairs with the assistance of his friend, the corrupt police captain Mario.\nQuerelle makes a deal to sell opium to Nono. During the execution of the deal, he murders his accomplice Vic by slitting his throat.  After delivering the drugs, Querelle announces that he wants to sleep with Lysiane.  He knows that this means he will have to throw dice with Nono, who has the privilege of playing a game of chance with all of her prospective lovers. If Nono loses, the suitor is allowed to proceed with his affair. If the suitor loses, however, he must submit to anal sex with Nono first, according to Nono's maxim that \"That way, I can say my wife only sleeps with arseholes.\" Querelle deliberately loses the game, allowing himself to be sodomized by Nono. When Nono gloats about Querelle's \"loss\" to Robert, who won his dice game, the brothers end up in a violent fight.  Later, Querelle becomes Lysiane's lover, and also has sex with Mario.\nLuckily for Querelle, a builder, Gil, murders his work mate Theo, who had been harassing and sexually assaulting him.  Gil hides from the police in an abandoned prison, and Roger, who is in love with Gil, establishes contact between Querelle and Gil in the hopes that Querelle can help Gil flee. Querelle falls in love with Gil, who closely resembles his brother.  Gil returns his affections, but Querelle betrays Gil by tipping off the police. Querelle cleverly arranged it so that the murder of Vic is also blamed on Gil.\nQuerelle's superior, Lieutenant Seblon, is in love with Querelle, and constantly tries to prove his manliness to him. Seblon is aware that Querelle murdered Vic, but chooses to protect him.  Later, Seblon reveals his love and concern to a drunken Querelle, and they kiss and embrace before returning to Le Vengeur.\n\nCast\nBrad Davis as Querelle\nFranco Nero as Lieutenant Seblon\nJeanne Moreau as Lysiane\nLaurent Malet as Roger Bataille\nHanno Pöschl as Robert / Gil\nGünther Kaufmann as Nono\nBurkhard Driest as Mario\nRoger Fritz as Marcellin\nDieter Schidor as Vic Rivette\nNatja Brunckhorst as Paulette\nWerner Asam as Worker\nAxel Bauer as Worker\nNeil Bell as Theo\nRobert van Ackeren as Drunken legionnaire\nWolf Gremm as Drunken legionnaire\nFrank Ripploh as Drunken legionnaire\n\nProduction\nAccording to Genet's biographer Edmund White, Querelle was originally going to be made by Werner Schroeter, with a scenario by Burkhard Driest, and produced by Dieter Schidor. However, Schidor could not find the money to finance a film by Schroeter, and therefore turned to other directors, including John Schlesinger and Sam Peckinpah, before finally settling on Fassbinder. Driest wrote a radically different script for Fassbinder, who then \"took the linear narrative and jumbled it up\". White quotes Schidor as saying \"Fassbinder did something totally different, he took the words of Genet and tried to meditate on something other than the story. The story became totally unimportant for him. He also said publicly that the story was a sort of third-rate police story that wouldn't be worth making a movie about without putting a particular moral impact into it\".Schroeter had wanted to make a black and white film with amateur actors and location shots, but Fassbinder instead shot it with professional actors in a lurid, expressionist color, and on sets in the studio. Edmund White comments that the result is a film in which, \"Everything is bathed in an artificial light and the architectural elements are all symbolic.\"\n\nSoundtrack\nJeanne Moreau – \"Each Man Kills the Things He Loves\" (music by Peer Raben, lyrics from Oscar Wilde's poem \"The Ballad of Reading Gaol\")\n\"Young and Joyful Bandit\" (Music by Peer Raben, lyrics by Jeanne Moreau)Both songs were nominated to the 1984 Razzie Awards for \"Worst Original Song\".\n\nRelease\nQuerelle sold more than 100,000 tickets in the first three weeks after its release in Paris, the first time that a film with a gay theme had achieved such success. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, which categorizes reviews as positive or negative only, the film has an approval rating of 57% calculated based on 14 critics comments. By comparison, with the same opinions being calculated using a weighted arithmetic mean, the rating is 6.10/10. Writing for The New York Times critic Vincent Canby noted that Querelle was \"a mess...a detour that leads to a dead end.\"\nPenny Ashbrook calls Querelle Fassbinder's \"perfect epitaph: an intensely personal statement that is the most uncompromising portrayal of gay male sensibility to come from a major filmmaker.\" Edmund White considers Querelle the only film based on Genet's book that works, calling it \"visually as artificial and menacing as Genet's prose.\" Genet, in discussion with Schidor, said that he had not seen the film, commenting \"You can't smoke at the movies.\"\nPassage 10:\nIronmaster (film)\nIronmaster (Italian: La guerra del ferro: Ironmaster) is a 1983 film directed by Umberto Lenzi.\n\nProduction\nIronmaster was filmed on location at Custer State Park in South Dakota with interiors shot at RPA-Elios Studios in Rome.\n\nRelease\nIronmaster was released in Italy on 10 March 1983. The film was released on Blu-ray on 23 January 2017 in North America by Code Red and on 10 April 2017 in the United Kingdom by 88 Films.\n\nReception\nAccording to Michael Klossner, author of Prehistoric Humans in Film and Television, while Ironmaster received \"few and very bad notices [and is] simple, only modestly ambitious and has its share of flaws … it's hard not to like a film which shows intelligent, articulate prehistoric people making discoveries, facing moral issues and showing capacity for great evil and finally for good.\" Hal Erickson wrote in AllMovie that \"Seldom has there been a more predictable 98 minutes' worth of Sword and Sorcery, but that doesn't mean it isn't enjoyable.\"", "answers": ["Mickey'S Tent Show"], "length": 2858, "dataset": "2wikimqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "4adca5ba1654b740d1e25c6e73d45aa2f3621537bed9086b"}

In the first innings of his first match, against Lancashire at The Oval, he took five wickets for 81 runs.In his first full season, 1948, he was Surrey's leading wicket-taker and in the last home game of the season he was awarded his county cap – he celebrated by taking eight Northamptonshire wickets for 46 runs at The Oval, six of them coming in the space of 6.3 overs for seven runs. This would remain the best bowling performance of his first-class career, not surpassed, but he did equal it seven years later. In the following game, the last away match of the season, he took 10 Hampshire wickets for 150 runs in the match at Bournemouth. In the 1948 season as a whole, he took 91 wickets at an average of 28.07. As a tail-end left-handed batsman, he managed just 93 runs in the season at an average of 4.22.The emergence of Tony Lock as a slow left-arm bowler in 1949 brought a stuttering end of McMahon's Surrey career. Though he played in 12 first-class matches in the 1949 season, McMahon took only 19 wickets; a similar number of matches in 1950 brought 34 wickets. In 1951, he played just seven times and in 1952 only three times. In 1953, Lock split the first finger of his left hand, and played in only 11 of Surrey's County Championship matches; McMahon played as his deputy in 14 Championship matches, though a measure of their comparative merits was that Lock's 11 games produced 67 wickets at 12.38 runs apiece, while McMahon's 14 games brought him 45 wickets at the, for him, low average of 21.53. At the end of the 1953 season, McMahon was allowed to leave Surrey to join Somerset, then languishing at the foot of the County Championship and recruiting widely from other counties and other countries.\n\nSomerset cricketer\nSomerset's slow bowling in 1954 was in the hands of leg-spinner Johnny Lawrence, with support from the off-spin of Jim Hilton while promising off-spinner Brian Langford was on national service. McMahon filled a vacancy for a left-arm orthodox spinner that had been there since the retirement of Horace Hazell at the end of the 1952 season; Hazell's apparent successor, Roy Smith, had failed to realise his promise as a bowler in 1953, though his batting had advanced significantly.\nMcMahon instantly became a first-team regular and played in almost every match during his four years with the county, not missing a single Championship game until he was controversially dropped from the side in August 1957, after which he did not play in the Championship again.In the 1954 season, McMahon, alongside fellow newcomer Hilton, was something of a disappointment, according to Wisden: \"The new spin bowlers, McMahon and Hilton, did not attain to the best standards of their craft in a wet summer, yet, like the rest of the attack, they would have fared better with reasonable support in the field and from their own batsmen,\" it said. McMahon took 85 wickets at an average of 27.47 (Hilton took only 42 at a higher average). His best match was against Essex at Weston-super-Mare where he took six for 96 in the first innings and five for 45 in the second to finish with match figures of 11 for 141, which were the best of his career. He was awarded his county cap in the 1954 season, but Somerset remained at the bottom of the table.\nThe figures for the 1955 were similar: McMahon this time took 75 wickets at 28.77 apiece. There was a small improvement in his batting and the arrival of Bryan Lobb elevated McMahon to No 10 in the batting order for most of the season, and he responded with 262 runs and an average of 9.03. This included his highest-ever score, 24, made in the match against Sussex at Frome. A week later in Somerset's next match, he equalled his best-ever bowling performance, taking eight Kent wickets for 46 runs in the first innings of a match at Yeovil through what Wisden called \"clever variation of flight and spin\". These matches brought two victories for Somerset, but there were only two others in the 1955 season and the side finished at the bottom of the Championship for the fourth season running.At the end of the 1955 season, Lawrence retired and McMahon became Somerset's senior spin bowler for the 1956 season, with Langford returning from National Service as the main support. McMahon responded with his most successful season so far, taking 103 wickets at an average of 25.57, the only season in his career in which he exceeded 100 wickets. The bowling average improved still further in 1957 to 23.10 when McMahon took 86 wickets. But his season came to an abrupt end in mid-August 1957 when, after 108 consecutive Championship matches, he was dropped from the first team during the Weston-super-Mare festival. Though he played some games for the second eleven later in August, he regained his place in the first team for only a single end-of-season friendly match, and he was told that his services were not required for the future, a decision, said Wisden, that \"proved highly controversial\".\n\nSacked by Somerset\nThe reason behind McMahon's sacking did not become public knowledge for many years. In its obituary of him in 2002, McMahon was described by Wisden as \"a man who embraced the antipodean virtues of candour and conviviality\". It went on: \"Legend tells of a night at the Flying Horse Inn in Nottingham when he beheaded the gladioli with an ornamental sword, crying: 'When Mac drinks, everybody drinks!'\" The obituary recounts a further escapade in second eleven match at Midsomer Norton where a curfew imposed on the team was circumvented by \"a POW-type loop\" organised by McMahon, \"with his team-mates escaping through a ground-storey window and then presenting themselves again\". As the only Somerset second eleven match that McMahon played in at Midsomer Norton was right at the end of the 1957 season, this may have been the final straw. But in any case there had been \"an embarrassing episode at Swansea's Grand Hotel\" earlier in the season, also involving Jim Hilton, who was also dismissed at the end of the season. Team-mates and club members petitioned for McMahon to be reinstated, but the county club was not to be moved.\nAfter a period in Lancashire League cricket with Milnrow Cricket Club, McMahon moved back to London where he did office work, later contributing some articles to cricket magazines.\n\n\n== Notes and references ==\nPassage 9:\nAvital Tamir\nAvital Tamir (Hebrew: אביטל תמיר) is an Israeli musician best known for his work as the lead singer for metal band Betzefer and for his experimental pop trio On Shoulders of Giants. He was also briefly a member of fellow Betzefer bandmate Matan Cohen's death metal band Nail Within.\n\nMusical career\nBetzefer (1998–2016)\nAvital Tamir formed Betzefer along with guitarist Matan Cohen and drummer Roey Berman as a one-off band for a high school gig in 1998.\nWhat started as a high school gig became a big part of the lives of the band members and since then the band started working, first as a cover band and later they started recording their own material, releasing Pitz Aachbar in 2000 and the EP New Hate in 2003. In 2005, the band released its first full-length album Down Low.\nTamir was the vocalist for the band since its formation and appeared on all of the band's releases, until his departure in 2016. He was replaced by Aharon Ragoza.\n\nNail Within (2003, 2007)\nIn 2003, after Nail Within vocalist Yishay Swearts left, guitarist Matan Cohen brought his Betzefer bandmates Avital Tamir (on vocals) and Rotem Inbar (on bass) to play with the band. After few rehearsals the idea fell through and the band disbanded. Although, before those events, Tamir did guest on some live shows of Nail Within. \n\nIn 2007, before reuniting the whole line-up, Cohen brought Tamir once again to rehearse with the band. Again, the collaboration wasn't long and soon the whole old line-up reunited.\nIt is being rumored that Avital Tamir, along with Betzefer bassist Rotem Inbar, will be involved in the new proposed album by Nail Within, though this wasn't confirmed, but it is known that Matan Cohen, Avital Tamir and Rotem Inbar, are all active in Nail Within.\n\nOn Shoulders of Giants (2006–present)\nIn 2006, Avital took time off from touring with Betzefer to start a new project dubbed On Shoulders of Giants together with 7% Mind Usage guitarist Idan Epshtein and Jerusalem based singer Katie Danielson. The three recorded their debut album titled Come Crashing, which was released independently on September 17, 2009. Avital handled most of the guitar duties on the record as well as the vocals, and the bass.\n\nBlack Swan (2010–present)\nIn early 2010, Tamir has started the alternative/garage rock band Black Swan with ex-Got No Shame lead guitarist Matan Ergas (AKA Nose). The band has played extensively in Israel through 2010 while Betzefer was on hiatus, playing both full band electric shows, as well as many stripped-down acoustic shows, even playing one whole show in two parts: opening with acoustic and main show as a full-band.\nThe band has recorded several demos which were upped to the band's Facebook page. The band planned to record the album sometime in 2011. Around that time, Tamir promoted Betzefer's second album Freedom to the Slave Makers released in February 2011.\n\nDiscography\nBetzefer\nPitz Aachbar (2000)\nSome Tits, But No Bush (2001)\nNew Hate (2003)\nDown Low (2005)\nFreedom to The Slave Makers (2011)\nThe Devil Went Down to the Holy Land (2013)\n\nOn Shoulders of Giants\nCome Crashing (2009)\nPassage 10:\nTom Dickinson\nThomas or Tom Dickinson may refer to: \n\nThomas Dickenson, or Dickinson, merchant and politician of York, England\nThomas R.

It was also shown in Grandeur at the Carthay Circle Theatre in Los Angeles, from February 28, 1930.\nAt a screening at the Roxy Theater, film critic Mordaunt Hall praised the cinematography, which was noted to be enhanced by the wider format. However, he regarded the film itself as \"not one that gives as full a conception of the possibilities as future films of this type will probably do.\"Owing to the Great Depression, few movie theaters invested in equipment for this format and it was soon abandoned. Fox Film Corporation's heavy investment in Grandeur technology led to William Fox losing his business, which was eventually merged in 1935 with Twentieth Century Pictures to form 20th Century Fox. No widescreen print of Happy Days is known to have survived.\n\nSee also\nList of early sound feature films (1926–1929)", "answers": ["no"], "length": 3470, "dataset": "2wikimqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "16a0130f95804e9b0791a89e2d18e46f611c1620891658b8"}

He is conceived when his mother Maria is attracted to a mysterious stranger during a performance of The Magic Flute. The stranger disappears after the conception, and as a result Andris does not know his father. The law states that a boy should have his father's name, even if the father is unknown, to avoid the taint of illegitimacy. When Maria tries to register Andris with the child custody department, Andris is given the name of a fictitious father. She enters on Andris' birth certificate the name of the bureaucrat she is dealing with, Antal Orban.\nMaria dies when she is hit on the head by a falling brick, an accident resulting from being in the wrong place at the wrong time, leaving Andris suddenly motherless. He then goes off in search of his nonexistent father. Along the way he meets and is helped by The Girl, the young nurse who delivered him, and who is alone like Andris. Meanwhile, the kindly Orban becomes tired of the tyrannical bureaucracy, and decides to destroy the files of children he has helped to legitimize by giving them fictitious fathers. He then sets out to find Andris. Andris and The Girl finally meet Orban, and they form their own family.\nThey meet scouts being trained as instruments of the state, and the scouts pursue Andris, Orban and The Girl.

He directed more than 90 films between 1934 and 1978. His 1958 film That Won't Keep a Sailor Down was entered into the 1st Moscow International Film Festival. Two years later, his 1960 film Big Request Concert was entered into the 2nd Moscow International Film Festival. His career encompassed both Nazi cinema and West German productions. He also wrote several books on the 1930s and 1940s wave of German cinema.\n\nCareer\nIn his early teens, Rabenalt began his stage career directing operas at theatres in Darmstadt, Berlin and Gera. From then on to the mid-1920s he worked (though uncredited) as a production assistant on several films such including G. W. Pabst's Joyless Street (1925). After Nazi's rise to power, Rabenalt made his feature film debut directing the musical comedy, What Am I Without You (1934), which was then shortly followed with the release of the comedy Pappi (1934). He continued to work in different genres, including The Love of the Maharaja (1936), and Men Are That Way and Midsummer Night's Fire which were released in 1939.        \nThrough out the 1940s, Rabaenalt worked with melodramatic dramas and comedy. Some of his early films in the 1940s, such as Riding for Germany, supported Nazi ideology. In 1989, he said \"I had only made circus films and chamber-type entertainment films since 1941. The only Nazi film I knew was ... rides for Germany (1941), and it was admired. The first films of mine that were distributed again after the war were Circus Renz (1943) and Regimental Music (shot in 1944 under the title The Guilty of Gabriele Rottweil, the film only came to the cinemas in 1950). The controversy about ... rides for Germany came much later.After the war he resumed his stage career as a director, beginning with the East German production, Chemistry and Love (1948), satire on anti-capitalism based on a play by Bela Balasz. He continued to work on productions for East German state studio DEFA until 1948. In the 1950s, he moved into more mainstream entertainment, including the Weimar horror remake of Alraune (1952), which starred Hildegard Knef and Erich von Stroheim.            \nFrom 1960, Rabanalt worked only in television, adapting classic comedies and operettas for a mainstream audience.

During World War II, when he was 13, he left his parents home and lived alone in Budapest. During the Holocaust, his mother and two younger sisters were murdered, while his father, brother and older sister were saved. Later, he was taken to a labor camp in Yugoslavia and worked in copper mining until he was liberated by local partisans, whom he joined in fighting the Germans until his immigration to Palestine in 1944 at age 18. Atzmoni wanted to join the military, but was concerned that his slim figure would cause him to be rejected, so he said he was two years older than he was.\n\nMilitary career\nAfter immigrating to Palestine, Atzmoni joined the Jewish Settlement Police and dealt with Naharayim. Following an Arab Legion attack, he retreated with the guards and reached the nearby base of the 12th Battalion of the Golani Brigade. He joined the ranks of the brigade and after a sergeant course was stationed as a company sergeant and served in this position during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. Later, He joined the artillery corps, where he served in reserves for many years. In 1969, following severe manpower shortage in the Israel Defense Forces, he responded to a request by its Chief of General Staff and returned for a year of voluntary service in the artillery corps.\n\nDecorations\nIn September 1948, Atzmoni cleared a fire-focused ammunition box during battle and received a commendation from the brigade commander.In January 1949, Atzmoni's unit was attacked near Rafah. A military car was blocking the artillery's line of sight, preventing an effective response. Atzmoni ran, under heavy fire, and was able to start the car and move it, thus clearing the way for the artillery to act and destroy 18 enemy vehicles. For this he was awarded the Hero of Israel commendation, which is the highest commendation ever awarded by the IDF, given to only twelve soldiers:\n\n On January 4, 1949, in the battle for the cemetery in Rafah, our artillery car was stopped in the field and the entire sector was concealed in front of our cannon position. The enemy, which attacked tanks and armored vehicles accompanied by infantry, rained fire on the outpost and prevented any action to remove the car from the area. Lt. Col. Arieh Otzmany, whose job was to bring ammunition and digging equipment to the outpost, jumped at the car, managed to start it, and drove it from the front to the rear, enabling our anti-tank cannon to launch an operation that resulted in the use of nine tanks and other enemy vehicles.\n\nLater life and death\nFollowing his discharge from the military, Atzmoni settled in the Hadar neighborhood in Haifa with his wife Lea (née Lustig), and worked as a cab driver. Concurrently, he imported and sold car parts. The two then established the Haifa branch of car rental company Hertz, which flourished. They then established their own car rental agency, also successful, allowing him donate some earnings to charity. After decades, the couple retired to the Ahuza retirement home. He died on March 30, 2005, and was buried in Haifa with a military ceremony. He had a son, daughter and four grandchildren.\nPassage 10:\nThe Hero of My Dreams\nThe Hero of My Dreams (German: Der Held meiner Träume) is a 1960 West German romantic comedy film directed by Arthur Maria Rabenalt and starring Carlos Thompson, Heidi Brühl and Peter Vogel.It was shot at the Bavaria Studios in Munich.

He is best known for his recordings of \"Skylark\" and \"'Round Midnight\" from the late 1940s to the early 1950s.\n\nMusic career\nEarly years\nParis was born and raised in Nutley, New Jersey, to an Italian-American family, where he attended Nutley High School. His uncle Chick had been a guitarist with Paul Whiteman's orchestra. Paris was a popular child entertainer in vaudeville who shared the stage with Bill \"Bojangles\" Robinson and the Mills Brothers. He tap danced from his youth and into his years in the US Army.\nAfter serving in the army during World War II, he was inspired by his friend Nat King Cole to assemble a trio featuring himself on guitar and vocals. The Jackie Paris Trio was a hit at the Onyx Club on New York's 52nd Street.\n\nRecording and performing\nHe recorded from the 1940s into the 2000s. His albums include Songs by Jackie Paris (EmArcy), Jackie Paris Sings the Lyrics of Ira Gershwin (Time), and The Song Is Paris (Impulse!). The first song that he recorded was \"Skylark\", on one of two sessions made by his trio for MGM Records in 1947. He recorded Thelonious Monk's \"Round Midnight\", which was produced by the critic Leonard Feather and featured a young Dick Hyman on piano.\nIn 1949, he toured with the Lionel Hampton Orchestra and was invited to join Duke Ellington's Orchestra, but he was too exhausted to take it. Paris was part of the Lionel Hampton Orchestra that played at the famed Cavalcade of Jazz in Los Angeles at Wrigley Field which was produced by Leon Hefflin Sr. on July 10, 1949. They did a second concert at Lane Field in San Diego on September 3, 1949. He was the only vocalist to tour as a regular member of the Charlie Parker Quintet. Unfortunately, no recordings exist of the Parker–Paris combination, but there is a photograph of the two working together. He worked often with Charles Mingus, who called Paris his favorite singer and recorded with him often, including 1952's \"Paris in Blue\" and \"Duke Ellington's Sound of Love\" on the album Changes Two in 1974.\nDuring the 1960s–70s, Paris frequently performed with his wife at the time Anne Marie Moss.Paris performed or recorded with Bobby Scott, Charlie Shavers, Coleman Hawkins, Dizzy Gillespie, Donald Byrd, Eddie Costa, Gigi Gryce, Hank Jones, Joe Wilder, Johnny Mandel, Lee Konitz, Max Roach, Neal Hefti, Oscar Pettiford, Ralph Burns, Terry Gibbs, Tony Scott, and Wynton Kelly.\nA documentary about him, 'Tis Autumn: The Search for Jackie Paris came out in 2006.\n\nRecognition\nHe won many jazz polls and awards, including those of Down Beat, Playboy, Swing Journal, and Metronome. In 1953, he was named Best New Male Vocalist of the Year in the first Down Beat Critics Poll. The winning female vocalist was Ella Fitzgerald, who repeatedly named Paris as one of her favorites.\nIn 2001, Paris played to a standing room crowd – and to a standing ovation – at New York's Birdland jazz club in Times Square. He was virtually the only performer to have appeared at every incarnation of the famed night spot, from the legendary Birdland of the 1950s to the present.\nHe was praised by comic Lenny Bruce, who shared the bill with him on many occasions. Bruce said, \"I dig his talent. The audience loves him and he gets laughs. He is too much!\"\n\nAwards and honors\nNew Star Male Vocalist, Down Beat Critics Poll, 1953\nBest Male Vocalist, Playboy Musicians & Critics Poll, 1957–1961\nGold Disc Award, Lucky to Be Me, Swing Journal, 1989\n\nDiscography\nSongs by Jackie Paris (Wing, 1956)\nSkylark (Brunswick, 1957)\nThe Jackie Paris Sound (EastWest, 1958)\nThe Song Is Paris (Impulse!, 1962)\nSings the Lyrics of Ira Gershwin (Time, 1962)\nLive at the Maisonette with Anne Marie Moss (Differant Drummer, 1975)\nJackie Paris (Audiophile, 1981)\nNobody Else but Me (Audiophile, 1988)\nLucky to Be Me (EmArcy, 1989)\nLove Songs (EmArcy, 1990)\nThe Intimate Jackie Paris (Hudson, 2001)\nPassage 9:\n55 (number)\n55 (fifty-five) is the natural number following 54 and preceding 56.\n\nMathematics\n55 is \n\na triangular number (the sum of the consecutive numbers 1 to 10), and a doubly triangular number.\nthe 10th Fibonacci number.

{"input": "What is the place of birth of Anne Elizabeth Rector's husband?", "context": "Passage 1:\nAnne Elizabeth Rector\nAnne Elizabeth Rector (June 26, 1899 – February 17, 1970) was an American artist.\nRector was the daughter of Enoch J. Rector and she attended the Art Students League of New York studying under John French Sloan. Ann also studied landscape painting under Andrew Dasburg. She married Edmund Duffy and they moved to New York City in 1948, when her husband began work for the Saturday Evening Post. She later headed Rector Studios that manufactured glass top tables. Her daughter married Ivan Chermayeff, the son of Serge Ivan Chermayeff.Rector's childhood diaries were published in 2004. They had been found many years after Rector's death and described her life for the year of 1912.\nPassage 2:\nEdmund Duffy\nEdmund Duffy (March 1, 1899 – September 12, 1962), was an American editorial cartoonist.  He grew up in Jersey City, New Jersey, eventually moving to metropolitan areas. Duffy did not attend high school, but instead went into the Art Students League of New York. Duffy's career took him to London, Paris, New York, and finally to Baltimore, where he spent the majority of his professional career working for The Baltimore Sun.\nDuffy won three Pulitzer Prizes for Editorial Cartooning in 1931, 1934, and 1940. Duffy began working for the Baltimore Sun in 1924, when he was only about 25 years old, and he received high praise from the famous journalist H.L. Mencken.\n\nJournalism career\nDuffy first came into the journalism field with his submission of a page of sketches for Armistice Day. The sketches were put into the New York Tribune in the Sunday section. Duffy worked on a variety of assignments in order to save up money, then launching his European career. He moved to London and worked for the London Evening News. Duffy worked in Paris for a few years, and he finally returned to the United States in 1922. He worked for two years with both the New York Leader and the Brooklyn Eagle.\nThe longest period of his career began in 1924 when he began working for The Baltimore Sun. Duffy worked there until 1948, in order to work a less tiring job, working for the Saturday Evening Post.  Duffy drew numerous noteworthy cartoons, approaching major issues and incidents, such as lynching and the Ku Klux Klan, but also the famous Monkey Scopes Trial of 1925.\n\nDenouncing racism through art\nDuffy was known for his daring nature in relation to his work. H.L. Mencken saw promise in his work and “Duffy with his sometimes savage artwork, did the kind of thing that delighted Mencken, who loved nothing more than to ‘stir up the animals’”. Duffy was not afraid to please Mencken, and held nothing back  He was one of the few people of his time that would boldly approach the topic of racism.  He blatantly condemned lynching and the actions of the KKK.  This was one of his main issues that he approached during his career.  During the time period that Duffy worked it was not popular to advocate against racism, so Duffy was civil rights before it was a wide movement in the United States. S.L. Harrison, a late professor of Communication at the University of Miami, wrote that Duffy “displayed uncommon vigor in attacking the Ku Klux Klan”.\n\nScopes Trial\nJust a year after Duffy began working for The Baltimore Sun, 1925, a famous trial began in Tennessee.  Tennessee had passed a law, the Butler Act, barring teachers against the topic of evolution in the classroom, but one biology teacher, John T. Scopes, ignored the law and taught his students evolution.  Scopes decided that the students should learn evolution, even if it went against the teachings of the bible.  Since the trial was popular and a nationwide topic, Mencken took a staff from The Sun, including Duffy, to cover the trial.  “[Edmund Duffy’s] graphic artwork played a significant role in the public’s perception of the trial proceedings reported in the pages of The Sun, then one of America’s most influential newspapers”.  His cartoons brought more attention to the issue, as he derided Tennessee for crushing knowledge in one of his more notable cartoons from the trial called ‘A Closed Book in Tennessee.’ \nIn this cartoon, Duffy shows a man, representing Tennessee, holding a sign that says “Fundamentalists Only Wanted as Teachers.”  The man is standing on top of the book of knowledge, holding it shut.  Duffy knew that this powerful cartoon would cause a great response, but that is exactly what Mencken wanted and expected from him.  Many more of his cartoons from the trial held the same message, in which he was publicly shaming Tennessee for the law, the trial, and the verdict.  Mencken once said that with a good cartoonist he would not need a whole editorial staff, and a great cartoonist he found in Duffy.\n\nPulitzer Prizes\nOver Edmund Duffy's career, he won three Pulitzer Prizes, which is a lot compared to other recipients over the years.  His three prize winning cartoons are the following:\n“An Old Struggle Still Going On” (1931)\nThis cartoon references the anti-communism era that began in the 1920s and 1930s.  At the time, communism was seen as being anti-religion, which is what Duffy conveys in the cartoon.  \n“California Points with Pride!” (1934)\nThis cartoon is one of Duffy's many anti-lynching pieces.  This one, however, deals with white on white lynching.  In California, people took two kidnappers from prison and lynched them in a park, but the Governor praised the people that did the lynching.  Duffy condemned the Governor in this cartoon.\n“The 'Outstretched Hand'” (1940)\nIn this cartoon, Duffy's topic is Adolf Hitler and his brutality.  By the time the cartoon was drawn, Germany had already invaded Poland, and Duffy shows Hitler's broken promises and peace offerings.  Hitler's hand drips with blood in the image.\nPassage 3:\nAnne Evans\nAnne or Ann Evans may refer to:\n\nAnn Evans (midwife) (1840–1916), New Zealand nurse\nAnne Evans (poet) (1820–1870), English poet and composer\nAnne Evans (arts patron) (1871–1941), art patron in Colorado\nAnne Evans (soprano) (born 1941), British operatic soprano\nAnne Evans Estabrook, American real estate developer\n\nSee also\nMary Ann Evans, writer better known as George Eliot\nMary Anne Disraeli, née Evans, wife of Disraeli\nEvans (surname)\nPassage 4:\nJames Randall Marsh\nJames Randall Marsh (1896–1966) was an American artist and the husband of Anne Steele Marsh.\n\nBiography\nMarsh was born in 1896 in Paris, France. He was the son of Frederick Dana Marsh and Alice Randall Marsh. He was the brother of the painter Reginald Marsh.He married Anne Steele in 1925 and the couple settled in Essex Fells, New Jersey. There Marsh set up a metal forge which he used to create industrial and residential lighting fixtures. In 1948, the Marshes relocated to Pittstown, New Jersey where James continued operating a forge, expanding the operation to include decorative metal work. His work was mainly in the American Arts and Craft style.\nIn 1952, Marsh was instrumental in establishing the Hunterdon Art Museum. When an 1836 stone mill became available for sale, Marsh and his neighbors decided to turn it into an art center, with Marsh providing most of the purchase price. The museum, with workshops, is still in operation and the building is listed as Dunham's Mill on the National Register of Historic Places listings in Hunterdon County, New Jersey.In 1964, he purchased the M. C. Mulligan & Sons Quarry, also listed on the NRHP, and donated it to the Clinton Historical Museum, now known as the Red Mill Museum Village. On October 9, 1965, the James Randall Marsh Historical Park was dedicated at the museum.Marsh died on January 20, 1966, in Flemington.\nPassage 5:\nMichael Rector\nMichael Rector (born December 16, 1993) is a former American football wide receiver.

They briefly attended North Texas State University together, before marrying in 1961 and moving to San Francisco in 1962, to enroll at San Francisco State University, where they both earned their bachelor's and master's degrees.\nRice was a professor of English and Creative Writing at San Francisco State University. In 1977, he received the Academy of American Poets' Edgar Allan Poe Award for Whiteboy, and in subsequent years was also the recipient of the Joseph Henry Jackson Award, as well as a writing fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts. Rice retired after 22 years as Chairman of the Creative Writing program as well as Assistant Director of the Poetry Center in 1989.It was the death of his and Anne's first child, daughter Michele (1966–1972), at age six of leukemia, which led to Stan Rice becoming a published author. His first book of poems, based on his daughter's illness and death, was titled Some Lamb, and was published in 1975. He encouraged his wife to quit her work as a waitress, cook and theater usher in order to devote herself full-time to her writing, and both eventually encouraged their son, novelist Christopher Rice, to become a published author as well.\n\nRice, his wife and his son moved to Garden District, New Orleans, in 1988, where he eventually opened the Stan Rice Gallery. In 1989, they purchased the Brevard-Rice House, 1239 First Street, built in 1857 for Albert Hamilton Brevard.\nStan Rice's paintings are represented in the collections of the Ogden Museum of Southern Art and the New Orleans Museum of Art.

Prospective plans are underway to present exhibitions of Rice's paintings at various locations in Mexico.In Prism of the Night, Anne Rice said of Stan: \"He's a model to me of a man who doesn't look to heaven or hell to justify his feelings about life itself. His capacity for action is admirable. Very early on he said to me, 'What more could you ask for than life itself'?\"\nPoet Deborah Garrison was Rice's editor at Alfred A. Knopf for his 2002 collection, Red to the Rind, which was dedicated to novelist son Christopher, in whose success as a writer his father greatly rejoiced. Garrison said of Rice: \"Stan really attempted to kind of stare down the world, and I admire that.\"Knopf's Victoria Wilson, who edited Anne's novels and worked with Stan Rice on his 1997 book, Paintings, was particularly impressed by his refusal to sell his artworks, saying, \"The great thing about Stan is that he refused to play the game as a painter, and he refused to play the game as a poet.\"\n\nPersonal life\nRice was an atheist.\n\nDeath\nStan Rice died of brain cancer at age 60, on December 9, 2002, in New Orleans where he lived and was survived by Anne and Christopher, as well as his mother, Margaret; a brother, Larry; and two sisters, Nancy and Cynthia.\nRice is entombed in Metairie Cemetery in New Orleans.\n\nPoetry collections\nSome Lamb (1975)\nWhiteboy (1976) (earned the Edgar Allan Poe Award from the Academy of American Poets)\nBody of Work (1983)\nSinging Yet: New and Selected Poems (1992)\nFear Itself (1997)\nThe Radiance of Pigs (1999)\nRed to the Rind (2002)\nFalse Prophet (2003) (Posthumous)\n\nPoetry video recordings\nTwo series of recordings – one from 1973 at San Francisco State University and the other from 1996 at the poet's New Orleans home by filmmaker Blair Murphy – capturing Stan Rice reading several of his poems are on the YouTube site dedicated to the poet.\n\nOther books\nPaintings (1997)\n\nFootnotes\nNotes\nPassage 7:\nStan Marks\nStan Marks is an Australian writer and journalist.

He also served as the first gentleman of Rajasthan and also as mayor of Amravati. He was a member of the Indian National Congress.\n\nEarly life\nDevisingh Ramsingh Shekhawat, who was then a lecturer in chemistry, married Pratibha Patil on 7 July 1965. The couple had a daughter and a son, Raosaheb Shekhawat, who is also a politician.Shekhawat was awarded a PhD from the University of Mumbai in 1972. Prior to his wife's elevation to her presidential role, he had been principal of a college operated by his wife's Vidya Bharati Shikshan Sanstha foundation and also a First Mayor of Amravati (1991–1992). Like his wife, he was a member of the Indian National Congress party. He was also an agriculturalist and a former member of the Legislative Assembly, being elected for the period 1985–1990 from the Amravati constituency in the Maharashtra state legislature. He lost his deposit in the 1995 contest for that constituency.Various accusations against Shekhawat and Patil emerged after the latter was nominated for the office of president. Among these was the case of Kisan Dhage, a teacher in a school run by Vidya Prasarak Shikshan Mandal in Buldana district, who committed suicide in November 1998. He left a note saying that he was committing suicide because he was tired of the mental harassment caused by Shekhawat, who was chairman of the institution, and four others. When the police registered the case as \"accidental death\", Dhage's wife appealed to the Judicial Magistrate First Class (JMFC) in Jalgaon Jamod, a tehsil in Buldana district. The JMFC ordered the police to start criminal proceedings. Shekhawat petitioned the courts seeking dismissal of charges of abetting Dhage's suicide. Two lower courts turned down this plea and by June 2007 the issue was pending in the Bombay High Court. A judge at that court dismissed the charges against Shekhawat in 2009 on the grounds that there was no proof of direct involvement, although one of his co-accused remained subject to the proceedings.In 2009, a court ruled that Shekhawat had colluded with five relatives and local officials to illegally transfer into his ownership 2.5 acres (1.0 ha) of land in Chandrapur belonging to a Dalit farmer. This was one of several allegations of corruption and irregularities to emerge during Patil's presidency in relation to her and her family.\n\nFirst Gentleman of Rajasthan (2004–2007)\nUpon Shekhawat's wife's succession as governor of Rajasthan, he moved into Raj Bhavan, Jaipur succeeding as the first gentleman of Rajasthan for 3 years.\n\nFirst Gentleman of India (2007–2012)\nOn 25 July 2007 Shekhawat became the first first gentleman of India upon his wife's succession as the twelfth — and first woman — President of India for a full five-year term.\n\nDeath\nShekhawat died on 24 February 2023 at the age of 89.", "answers": ["Jersey City"], "length": 3648, "dataset": "2wikimqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "14387a7ce67635d6f5c75fd29b6d3344758a8be64311ea6e"}

He was brought up at Rome, in the school of Pietro da Cortona, and was employed in several prominent public works during the pontificate of Alexander VII. He painted historical subjects. He died in 1686 at Rieti.\nIn the Quirinal, he painted The Judgment of Solomon, and others of his works are in Santa Maria Maggiore and in the Rotunda.

In the first innings of his first match, against Lancashire at The Oval, he took five wickets for 81 runs.In his first full season, 1948, he was Surrey's leading wicket-taker and in the last home game of the season he was awarded his county cap – he celebrated by taking eight Northamptonshire wickets for 46 runs at The Oval, six of them coming in the space of 6.3 overs for seven runs. This would remain the best bowling performance of his first-class career, not surpassed, but he did equal it seven years later. In the following game, the last away match of the season, he took 10 Hampshire wickets for 150 runs in the match at Bournemouth. In the 1948 season as a whole, he took 91 wickets at an average of 28.07. As a tail-end left-handed batsman, he managed just 93 runs in the season at an average of 4.22.The emergence of Tony Lock as a slow left-arm bowler in 1949 brought a stuttering end of McMahon's Surrey career. Though he played in 12 first-class matches in the 1949 season, McMahon took only 19 wickets; a similar number of matches in 1950 brought 34 wickets. In 1951, he played just seven times and in 1952 only three times. In 1953, Lock split the first finger of his left hand, and played in only 11 of Surrey's County Championship matches; McMahon played as his deputy in 14 Championship matches, though a measure of their comparative merits was that Lock's 11 games produced 67 wickets at 12.38 runs apiece, while McMahon's 14 games brought him 45 wickets at the, for him, low average of 21.53. At the end of the 1953 season, McMahon was allowed to leave Surrey to join Somerset, then languishing at the foot of the County Championship and recruiting widely from other counties and other countries.\n\nSomerset cricketer\nSomerset's slow bowling in 1954 was in the hands of leg-spinner Johnny Lawrence, with support from the off-spin of Jim Hilton while promising off-spinner Brian Langford was on national service. McMahon filled a vacancy for a left-arm orthodox spinner that had been there since the retirement of Horace Hazell at the end of the 1952 season; Hazell's apparent successor, Roy Smith, had failed to realise his promise as a bowler in 1953, though his batting had advanced significantly.\nMcMahon instantly became a first-team regular and played in almost every match during his four years with the county, not missing a single Championship game until he was controversially dropped from the side in August 1957, after which he did not play in the Championship again.In the 1954 season, McMahon, alongside fellow newcomer Hilton, was something of a disappointment, according to Wisden: \"The new spin bowlers, McMahon and Hilton, did not attain to the best standards of their craft in a wet summer, yet, like the rest of the attack, they would have fared better with reasonable support in the field and from their own batsmen,\" it said. McMahon took 85 wickets at an average of 27.47 (Hilton took only 42 at a higher average). His best match was against Essex at Weston-super-Mare where he took six for 96 in the first innings and five for 45 in the second to finish with match figures of 11 for 141, which were the best of his career. He was awarded his county cap in the 1954 season, but Somerset remained at the bottom of the table.\nThe figures for the 1955 were similar: McMahon this time took 75 wickets at 28.77 apiece. There was a small improvement in his batting and the arrival of Bryan Lobb elevated McMahon to No 10 in the batting order for most of the season, and he responded with 262 runs and an average of 9.03. This included his highest-ever score, 24, made in the match against Sussex at Frome. A week later in Somerset's next match, he equalled his best-ever bowling performance, taking eight Kent wickets for 46 runs in the first innings of a match at Yeovil through what Wisden called \"clever variation of flight and spin\". These matches brought two victories for Somerset, but there were only two others in the 1955 season and the side finished at the bottom of the Championship for the fourth season running.At the end of the 1955 season, Lawrence retired and McMahon became Somerset's senior spin bowler for the 1956 season, with Langford returning from National Service as the main support. McMahon responded with his most successful season so far, taking 103 wickets at an average of 25.57, the only season in his career in which he exceeded 100 wickets. The bowling average improved still further in 1957 to 23.10 when McMahon took 86 wickets. But his season came to an abrupt end in mid-August 1957 when, after 108 consecutive Championship matches, he was dropped from the first team during the Weston-super-Mare festival. Though he played some games for the second eleven later in August, he regained his place in the first team for only a single end-of-season friendly match, and he was told that his services were not required for the future, a decision, said Wisden, that \"proved highly controversial\".\n\nSacked by Somerset\nThe reason behind McMahon's sacking did not become public knowledge for many years. In its obituary of him in 2002, McMahon was described by Wisden as \"a man who embraced the antipodean virtues of candour and conviviality\". It went on: \"Legend tells of a night at the Flying Horse Inn in Nottingham when he beheaded the gladioli with an ornamental sword, crying: 'When Mac drinks, everybody drinks!'\" The obituary recounts a further escapade in second eleven match at Midsomer Norton where a curfew imposed on the team was circumvented by \"a POW-type loop\" organised by McMahon, \"with his team-mates escaping through a ground-storey window and then presenting themselves again\". As the only Somerset second eleven match that McMahon played in at Midsomer Norton was right at the end of the 1957 season, this may have been the final straw. But in any case there had been \"an embarrassing episode at Swansea's Grand Hotel\" earlier in the season, also involving Jim Hilton, who was also dismissed at the end of the season. Team-mates and club members petitioned for McMahon to be reinstated, but the county club was not to be moved.\nAfter a period in Lancashire League cricket with Milnrow Cricket Club, McMahon moved back to London where he did office work, later contributing some articles to cricket magazines.\n\n\n== Notes and references ==\nPassage 9:\nHenry Moore (cricketer)\nHenry Walter Moore (1849 – 20 August 1916) was an English-born first-class cricketer who spent most of his life in New Zealand.\n\nLife and family\nHenry Moore was born in Cranbrook, Kent, in 1849. He was the son of the Reverend Edward Moore and Lady Harriet Janet Sarah Montagu-Scott, who was one of the daughters of the 4th Duke of Buccleuch. One of his brothers, Arthur, became an admiral and was knighted. Their great \ngrandfather was John Moore, Archbishop of Canterbury from 1783 to 1805. One of their sisters was a maid of honour to Queen Victoria.Moore went to New Zealand in the 1870s and lived in Geraldine and Christchurch. He married Henrietta Lysaght of Hāwera in November 1879, and they had one son. In May 1884 she died a few days after giving birth to a daughter, who also died.In 1886 Moore became a Justice of the Peace in Geraldine. In 1897 he married Alice Fish of Geraldine. They moved to England four years before his death in 1916.\n\nCricket career\nMoore was a right-handed middle-order batsman. In consecutive seasons, 1876–77 and 1877–78, playing for Canterbury, he made the highest score in the short New Zealand first-class season: 76 and 75 respectively. His 76 came in his first match for Canterbury, against Otago. He went to the wicket early on the first day with the score at 7 for 2 and put on 99 for the third wicket with Charles Corfe before he was out with the score at 106 for 3 after a \"very fine exhibition of free hitting, combined with good defence\". Canterbury were all out for 133, but went on to win the match. His 75 came in the next season's match against Otago, when he took the score from 22 for 2 to 136 for 6. The New Zealand cricket historian Tom Reese said, \"Right from the beginning he smote the bowling hip and thigh, going out of his ground to indulge in some forceful driving.\" Canterbury won again.Moore led the batting averages in the Canterbury Cricket Association in 1877–78 with 379 runs at an average of 34.4. Also in 1877–78, he was a member of the Canterbury team that inflicted the only defeat on the touring Australians. In 1896–97, at the age of 47, he top-scored in each innings for a South Canterbury XVIII against the touring Queensland cricket team.\nPassage 10:\nHartley Lobban\nHartley W Lobban (9 May 1926 – 15 October 2004) was a Jamaican-born first-class cricketer who played 17 matches for Worcestershire in the early 1950s.\n\nLife and career\nLobban played little cricket in Jamaica. He went to England at the end of World War II as a member of the Royal Air Force, and settled in Kidderminster in Worcestershire in 1947, where he worked as a civilian lorry driver for the RAF. He began playing for Kidderminster Cricket Club in the Birmingham League, and at the start of the 1952 season, opening the bowling for the club's senior team, he had figures of 7 for 9 and 7 for 37.Worcestershire invited him to play for them, and he made his first-class debut against Sussex in July 1952. He took five wickets in the match (his maiden victim being Ken Suttle) and then held on for 4 not out with Peter Richardson (20 not out) to add the 12 runs needed for a one-wicket victory after his county had collapsed from 192 for 2 to 238 for 9. A week later he claimed four wickets against Warwickshire, then a few days later still he managed 6 for 52 (five of his victims bowled) in what was otherwise a disastrous innings defeat to Derbyshire. In the last match of the season he took a career-best 6 for 51 against Glamorgan; he and Reg Perks (4 for 59) bowled unchanged throughout the first innings. Worcestershire won the game and Lobban finished the season with 23 wickets at 23.69.He took 23 wickets again in 1953, but at a considerably worse average of 34.43, and had only two really successful games: against Oxford University in June, when he took 5 for 70, and then against Sussex in July. On this occasion Lobban claimed eight wickets, his most in a match, including 6 for 103 in the first innings. He also made his highest score with the bat, 18, but Sussex won by five wickets.In 1954 Lobban made only two first-class appearances, and managed only the single wicket of Gloucestershire tail-ender Bomber Wells. In his final game, against Warwickshire at Dudley, his nine first-innings overs cost 51. He bowled just two overs in the second innings as Warwickshire completed an easy ten-wicket win. Lobban played one more Second XI game, against Glamorgan II at Cardiff Arms Park; in this he picked up five wickets.\nHe was also a professional boxer and played rugby union for Kidderminster.He later moved to Canada, where he worked as a teacher in Burnaby, British Columbia.

He co-composed with Howard Talbot the successful Kitty Grey (1900).He continued to write songs and to receive recognition for them. The 1901 and 1902 BBC Promenade Concerts, \"The Proms\", included four of his compositions, namely Come back, sweet Love, The Mermaid, My Peggy and Private Donald.\nHis setting of My Ships, a poem by Ella Wheeler Wilcox, was performed by Clara Butt and republished several times.

The setting of the story is transplanted from Stockholm to San Francisco. It was directed by Stuart Rosenberg and features Walter Matthau as Detective Jake Martin.\n\nPlot\nA busload of passengers, including off-duty police detective Dave Evans, are gunned down and killed. Evans, on his own time, has been following a man named Gus Niles in search of information linking businessman Henry Camarero to the murder of his wife, Teresa, two years earlier.\nEvans was the partner of Detective Sergeant Jake Martin, a veteran but cynical member of the Homicide Detail working the bus massacre investigation. Jake originally investigated the Teresa Camarero case and has been obsessed with his failure to \"make\" Camarero for the murder. Jake returns to it after many dead-end leads (including a disastrous confrontation with a deranged amputee who takes hostages at gunpoint) in the bus investigation. Niles was killed on the bus as well, and it was Niles who provided the alibi that enabled Camarero to cover up his wife's murder.\nThe sullen Jake and enthusiastic but impulsive Inspector Leo Larsen are paired to interview suspects. Jake shuts out Larsen from his deductions, while Larsen, despite a loose-on-the-rules and brutal side, tries to understand and gain the confidence of his new partner. Defying the orders of their police superior Lt. Steiner, they seek, find and then smoke out Camarero, leading to a chase through the streets of San Francisco and a confrontation aboard another bus.\n\nCast\nWalter Matthau as Sgt.

It provides the special delight we get from gradually unraveling a complicated case... The direction is by Stuart Rosenberg, and marks a comeback of sorts... With The Laughing Policeman, he takes a labyrinthine plot and leads us through it at a gallop; he respects our intelligence and doesn't bother to throw in a lot of scenes where everything is explained. All the pieces in the puzzle do fit together, you realize after the movie is over, and part of the fun is assembling them yourself. And there are a couple of scenes that are really stunning, like the bus shooting, and an emergency room operation, and scenes where the partners try to shake up street people to get a lead out of them. Police movies so often depend on sheer escapist action that it's fun to find a good one.\nVariety praised the film saying that \"After an extremely overdone prolog of violent mass murder on a bus, The Laughing Policeman becomes a handsomely made manhunt actioner, starring Walter Matthau and Bruce Dern in excellent performances as two San Francisco detectives\".According to Chris Petit of Time Out, \"By the end, complete with car chase and split-second shooting, the film has become indistinguishable from all those movies it's trying so hard to disown\".The Laughing Policeman was released on Blu-ray on November 15, 2016. Matthew Hartman of High-Def Digest, who reviewed it, wrote \"[the film] could have been a great and gritty 70s thriller, unfortunately, it's primary story doesn't live up to the potential of the opening scene\".\n\nSee also\nList of American films of 1973\nPassage 4:\nPiero Schivazappa\nPiero Schivazappa (born  14 April 1935) is an Italian film and television director and screenwriter.\n\nLife and career\nBorn in Colorno, Schivazappa entered the film industry in 1959 as an assistant director, collaborating with Valerio Zurlini, Mario Monicelli and  Carlo Lizzani, among others.

He was the second son of Cleombrotus I, and grandfather of Areus I, who succeeded him. Although he reigned for more than 60 years, his life is completely unknown, apart from a victory at the Pythian Games in 336 BC. Several theories have been suggested by modern historians to explain such inactivity, but none has gained consensus.\n\nLife and reign\nCleomenes was the second son of king Cleombrotus I (r. 380–371), who belonged to the Agiad dynasty, one of the two royal families of Sparta (the other being the Eurypontids). Cleombrotus died fighting Thebes at the famous Battle of Leuctra in 371. His eldest son Agesipolis II succeeded him, but he died soon after in 370. Cleomenes' reign was instead exceptionally long, lasting 60 years and 10 months according to Diodorus of Sicily, a historian of the 1st century BC. In a second statement, Diodorus nevertheless tells that Cleomenes II reigned 34 years, but he confused him with his namesake Cleomenes I (r. 524–490).\n\nDespite the outstanding length of his reign, very little can be said about Cleomenes. He has been described by modern historians as a \"nonentity\". Perhaps that the apparent weakness of Cleomenes inspired the negative opinion of the hereditary kingship at Sparta expressed by Aristotle in his Politics (written between 336 and 322). However, Cleomenes may have focused on internal politics within Sparta, because military duties were apparently given to the Eurypontid Agesilaus II (r. 400–c.360), Archidamus III (r. 360–338), and Agis III (r. 338–331). As the Spartans notably kept their policies secret from foreign eyes, it would explain the silence of ancient sources on Cleomenes. Another explanation is that his duties were assumed by his elder son Acrotatus, described as a military leader by Diodorus, who mentions him in the aftermath of the Battle of Megalopolis in 331, and again in 315.Cleomenes' only known deed was his chariot race victory at the Pythian Games in Delphi in 336. In the following autumn, he gave the small sum of 510 drachmas for the reconstruction of the Temple of Apollo at Delphi, which had been destroyed by an earthquake in 373. Cleomenes might have made this gift as a pretext to go to Delphi and engage in informal diplomacy with other Greek states, possibly to discuss the consequences of the recent assassination of the Macedonian king Philip II.One short witticism of Cleomenes regarding cockfighting is preserved in the Moralia, written by the philosopher Plutarch in the early 2nd century AD:\nSomebody promised to give to Cleomenes cocks that would die fighting, but he retorted, \"No, don't, but give me those that kill fighting.\"\nAs Acrotatus died before Cleomenes, the latter's grandson Areus I succeeded him while still very young, so Cleomenes' second son Cleonymus acted as regent until Areus' majority. Some modern scholars also give Cleomenes a daughter named Archidamia, who played an important role during Pyrrhus' invasion of the Peloponnese, but the age difference makes it unlikely.\nPassage 7:\nObata Toramori\nObata Toramori (小畠虎盛, 1491 – July 14, 1561) was Japanese samurai warrior of the Sengoku Period. He is known as one of the \"Twenty-Four Generals of Takeda Shingen\" \nHe also recorded as having been wounded 41 times in 36 encounters. \nHe was the father of Obata Masamori.\n\nSee also\nIsao Obata\nPassage 8:\nLars Eliasson\nLars Eliasson  (December 8, 1914 – June 5, 2002) was a Swedish politician.

The woman is Nargis who is revealed as a prostitute. He then falls in love. One night, Rajiv visits the \"bar\", and watches her (Nargis) dance.

Mockingly, Nargis refuses it but Rajiv says if she keeps disappearing like this, he will hang himself with the scarf. Nargis offers for a longer one in a jokingly way.\nRegardless, Rajiv wants to marry Nargis. Rajiv wants Nargis to be free from prostitution. Rajiv must now get past Zohra Baano. She owns a prostitution business and hires other women to do their dirty work, the only source of income. Zohra Baano wants a price in exchange and Rajiv is willing to do that. Slowly, Nargis begins to develop feelings for Rajiv. One night, Nargis escapes the brothel, Rajiv finds her and takes her to a hotel. Nargis realises this was a mistake so she must return to the brothel. As soon as the \"couple\" leave the hotel, 3 drunkards approach them and one of them recognizes Rajiv as \"Rocky\". In fact, this is his real name, although \"Rajiv\" denies it. Rajiv fights off the drunkards and realises that Nargis knows the truth. So he decides to come clean about his life story.\nRocky Desai (also Himesh Reshammiya), a singer, is on the aeroplane. An ardent boy, who's a fan of Rocky, and his granny wants an autograph so Rocky writes one for them. On the plane, an uneasy passenger heads for the restroom but he is a terrorist.

Babbar is a most-wanted terrorist. He vows revenge on Rocky. Avtaar recommends Rocky to change his identity and start afresh. And this is how Rocky becomes Rajiv.\nRajiv breaks Avtaar's oath by going back to UK. He's playing with his sister in the park until he receives a call. It is Avtaar who wants him to return to London (as a cover up) Babbar is targeting his sister. After the call, his sister is gone. The white woman who witnessed the event says a man just took her. Babbar then tells Rocky he's sister is dead. This shatters him completely.\nWhat follows is the underlying quest for true love. At the climax, Babbar captures Zohra Baano and Nargis.

At the end, they are married.\n\nCast\nHimesh Reshammiya as Rajiv Behl / Rocky Desai\nSara Loren as Nargis (Mona Lizza)\nAmrita Singh as Zohra Baano\nNatasha Sinha as Nargis (Mona Lizza)'s mother\nGaurav Chanana as Sadiq - Dead\nJaved Sheikh as Tariq Anwar\nGulshan Grover as Avtaar Singh\nAnupam Shyam as  Nawaz\nAdnan Shah as Babur Altaf Khan\nVeeru Krishnan\n\nRelease\nThe film was supposed to be released on 6 August 2010, along with Aisha, but due to clashes between director Pooja Bhatt and the producer, Bhushan Kumar, the release was delayed.

Upon arrival in Atlanta, Robinson and David Doe approached Dr. John S. Pemberton, a chemist and pharmacist, and struck a deal. In 1886 Frank Robinson officially settled in Atlanta where a new business was made called the Pemberton Chemical Company consisting of Robinson, Pemberton, David Doe and Pemberton's old partner, Ed Holland.\n\nCoca-Cola\nPemberton was experimenting with a medicinal formula which included coca leaves and kola nuts as sources of its ingredients. Robinson, who served as bookkeeper and partner to Pemberton, gave the syrup formula the name Coca-Cola, where Coca came from the coca leaves used and Cola for the kola nuts. The name Coca-Cola was also chosen \"because it was euphonious, and on account of my familiarity with such names as 'S.S.S; and 'B.B.B'\" said Robinson himself. He was also responsible for writing the Coca-Cola name in Spencerian script which was popular with bookkeepers of the era and remains one of the most recognized trademarks in the world. \nThe formula was introduced in May 1886 at the Jacobs Pharmacy in Atlanta. It sold 25 US gallons (95 L) the first year. The next year sales increased to 1,049 US gallons (3,970 L). In 1888 Pemberton sold the formula to Asa G. Candler, another Atlanta pharmacist and businessman, for a total investment of $2,300 before Pemberton died. Coca-Cola was granted a charter in 1892 and became the official Georgia Corporation named the Coca-Cola Company with Asa G. Candler, his brother John S. Candler, Frank M. Robinson and two other associates.  Robinson served as treasurer and secretary and changed the Coca-Cola syrup formula so as not to include any faint traces of cocaine by the time of the Pure Food and Drug Act initiated by the Federal Government in 1906. The starting capitalization for the company was at $100,000.Robinson overall was responsible for the early advertising of Coca-Cola before and after Candler bought the name and syrup formula from Pemberton, the first ads appearing in The Atlanta Journal in 1887. While still working with Pemberton, Robinson had the initial ads display short phrases such as \"Coca-Cola! Delicious! Refreshing! Exhilarating! Invigorating! The new and popular soda fountain drink containing the properties of the wonderful Coca plant and the famous Cola nut.\" Marketing for the drink showed the syrup beverage with medicinal properties curing headaches but with a unique taste. The initial ads distributed invited citizens to try \"the new and popular soda fountain drink.\" Hand painted oil cloth signs were put outside stores displaying the Coca-Cola brand name with catchy words such as \"Drink\" in order to inform customers and other people passing by about the new medicinal beverage that was also a soda fountain drink. First year sales showed an average of nine bottles sold per day.Robinson later retired in 1914, but remained one of the company's directors. In The Columbus Enquirer-Sun a newspaper founded in 1874, published an article in 1906 praising Robinson's work with Coca-Cola: \"there is one person to whom particular credit is due for the fact that the Coca-Cola formula remained, in the hands of the Georgians, and the further fact that the drink soon became so popular. He is Mr. Robinson, and the present secretary of the Coca-Cola Company...In developing the drink, Mr. Robinson has also developed. He is said to be one of the best posted experts on advertising in America today, all due to his experience in advertising and pushing Coca-Cola.\"\n\nPersonal life\nOriginally from Maine, as a young man he was in Iowa where he married Laura Clapp. Robinson had a home in Druid Hills, an early suburb of Atlanta. He also had a 40-acre (160,000 m2) country home on the Cobb County banks of the Chattahoochee River. The property had been a southern fortification defending the railroad bridge. The property is currently the Frank Mason Robinson Nature Preserve. He owned six residences which were occupied rent free by family and friends.\nRobinson taught a large Bible class at the First Christian Church of Atlanta. A large English stained glass window dedicated to his memory is above the pulpit of Peachtree Christian Church. He was a Republican in national politics but a Democrat in state and local politics.\nRobinson died in July 1923 and was buried in Atlanta's Westview Cemetery.\nPassage 4:\nDouglas Ivester\nDouglas Ivester (born 1947) is an American businessman.

Makavejev's most internationally successful film was the 1971 political satire W.R.: Mysteries of the Organism, which he both directed and wrote.\n\nCareer\nMakavejev's first three feature films, Man Is Not a Bird (1965, starring actress and icon of the \"Black Wave\" period in film, Milena Dravić), Love Affair, or the Case of the Missing Switchboard Operator (1967, starring actress and icon of the \"Black Wave\" period in film, Eva Ras) and Innocence Unprotected (1968), all won him international acclaim. The last-mentioned won  the Silver Bear Extraordinary Prize of the Jury at the 18th Berlin International Film Festival. In 1970 he was a member of the jury at the 20th Berlin International Film Festival. In 1991 he was a member of the jury at the 17th Moscow International Film Festival.His 1971 movie W.R.: Mysteries of the Organism (starring Milena Dravić, Jagoda Kaloper, and Ivica Vidović) was banned in Yugoslavia due to its sexual and political content. He described authoritarian figures in the film as people who are not in control of themselves striving to control others. The political scandal surrounding Makavejev's film was symptomatic of an increasingly oppressive political climate in Yugoslavia that effectively ended the director's domestic career and resulted in his leaving Yugoslavia to live and work abroad in Europe and North America. Makavejev's next film, Sweet Movie (1974), was the first feature work that the director produced entirely outside of Yugoslavia (the film was made in Canada). The film's explicit depiction of sex together with its bold treatment of the more taboo dimensions of sexuality reduced the size of its audience (i.e. it was largely confined to the art house context) and also resulted in the film's being censored in several countries. Makavejev said: \"After Sweet Movie it was as if I had burned all my bridges. I just lost the chance to talk to producers.\"\nAfter a seven-year hiatus in feature film production, Makavejev released the comparatively more conventional black comedy entitled Montenegro (1981). The director's next feature film, The Coca-Cola Kid (1985), which was based on short stories by Frank Moorhouse and featured performances by Eric Roberts and Greta Scacchi, is arguably his most accessible picture.\nMakavejev appears as one of the narrators in the 2007 Serbian documentary film Zabranjeni bez zabrane (Banned without being banned), which gives profound insight into the history and the nature of Yugoslav film censorship through its investigation of the country's distinctive political-cultural mechanisms for unofficially banning politically controversial films. The film contains original interviews with key filmmakers from the communist era.He published two books of selected articles: Poljubac za drugaricu parolu (1960) and 24 sličice u sekundi (1965).\n\nViews\nIn 1993 Makavejev wrote and appeared in a half hour televised Opinions lecture in Britain, produced by Open Media for Channel 4 and subsequently published in The Times. Makavejev speaks of himself as a citizen of the world but \"of the leftovers of Yugoslavia too\". He cites Jacques Tourneur's Hollywood horror classic Cat People as one of the rare films in the history of the cinema that mention Serbs, \"a people from an obscure region who were haunted by evil; when hurt they turn into ferocious cats, like panthers, and killed those whom they thought to be the source of hurt of rejection\". He comments on the division of Bosnia on ethnic lines:\n\n\"Creators of nationalist myths, both Serbs and Croats, came from the same mountainous region that was probably the source of this Hollywood story. Before the armed conflict, these people were whipping up nationalist fever and indoctrination until conflict became inevitable and both nations were trapped in a bloody embrace...How long will it take for an ethnically \"clean\" state for every single person who miraculously stays alive? A state for each family, a state for the father in case he is a Croat, a state for the mother in case she is a Muslim, a state for the daughter in case she is a Yugoslav, a state for the son in case he is a Serb, a specific flag for the dog, a currency for the cat.\"\n\nFilmography\nFeature films\n\nShort films\n\nJatgan mala (1953)\nPečat (1955)\nAntonijevo razbijeno ogledalo (1957)\nSpomenicima ne treba verovati (1958)\nOsmjeh '61 (1961)\nEci peci pec (1961)\nParada (1962)\nNova domaća životinja (1964)\nPassage 10:\nK.

The provincial Progressive Conservative government purchased the land from Wilson in 1971, giving him an 81% profit, which resulted in complaints by the parliamentary opposition and a formal inquiry which found no wrongdoing on the part of Willis but which criticized the government for not bargaining for a lower price.Willis died in flight from Ottawa to Toronto.\nPassage 8:\nCharalampos Mavrias\nCharalampos Mavrias (Greek: Χαράλαμπος Μαυρίας; born 21 February 1994), known as \"Charis\" (Greek: Χάρης) or \"Harry\", is a Greek professional footballer who plays as a right back and right midfielder for Greece national team.\n\nClub career\nPanathinaikos\nMavrias joined Panathinaikos' youth academy in 2007, aged 13, and was promoted to the first-team squad in 2010, after signing a professional contract in the previous year. On 20 October 2010 he made his first-team – and UEFA Champions League – debut, playing the last 12 minutes of a 0–0 home draw against Rubin Kazan, thus becoming the youngest Greek ever to appear in the competition, and the second youngest overall (only behind Celestine Babayaro, being surpassed later by Alen Halilović, Youri Tielemans and Rayan Cherki). Four days later he made his league debut, again as a substitute in a 0–1 loss at AEK.\nMavrias scored his first professional goal on 18 February 2012, netting his side's last of a 2–0 success at Ergotellis; he scored his first European goal on 31 July 2012, again netted the last of a 2–0 win at Motherwell in the first leg of the third qualifying round of the Champions League, one minute after coming onto the pitch as a substitute.\n\nSunderland\nOn 22 August 2013, Mavrias joined English Premier League side Sunderland on a four-year contract, for an undisclosed fee, rumoured to be £2-3 million. However, he was left out of the squad to play Southampton due to lack of match fitness.\nMavrias made his debut five days later, coming on as a second-half substitute in a 4–2 home success over Milton Keynes Dons, for the campaign's Football League Cup. He scored his first goal on 25 January of the following year, netting the winner against Kidderminster Harriers in the fourth round of the FA Cup.On 2 February 2015, it was confirmed Mavrias had joined his former club Panathinaikos on loan until the end of the 2014–15 season.\nMavrias returned to Sunderland where he has been training and playing for the Black Cats Under-21s – and is understood to have impressed the club's coaching staff with his attitude and contribution. But Mavrias has not come close to being included in the first-team squad, however is not bitter over seeing his career stall on Wearside. “I took the decision to leave Panathinaikos and go to Sunderland, and I think anyone in my position would take this decision,” he told the Greek press. On 9 January 2016, almost two years after his last match with the first team, Mavrias entered the game in second half as a substitute in a 3–1 away loss against Arsenal for FA Cup.\n\nFortuna Düsseldorf\nHe was loaned to Fortuna Düsseldorf on 27 January 2016.\nMavrias - who has 18 months remaining on his Sunderland contract - now has a chance to play regular first-team football after joining Düsseldorf until the end of the campaign, with a view to a permanent switch next summer. On 6 February 2016, he made his debut with a club, in a 0–1 home loss against Heidenheim.\nMavrias performance in Düsseldorf was satisfying, leading the club to set an offer for the Greek international winger. Unfortunately on 24 June 2016, Sunderland reject Fortuna Düsseldorf's lower bid than the £400,000 clause to convert the loan into a permanent switch.\n\nKarlsruher SC\nOn 6 September 2016, after three seasons spent playing for Sunderland, only 7 official caps overall collected as a Black Cats man, plus 2 experiences as a loanee (at Fortuna Düsseldorf and Panathinaikos), he joined 2. Bundesliga side Karlsruher SC for a three-years contract. On 10 September 2016, he made his debut with the club in a 4–0 away loss against Union Berlin. Unfortunately, KSC harboured hopes of promotion back to the Bundesliga this summer, after finishing seventh last term had erupted during the year as the club relegated to Germany's third tier.\n\nRijeka\nOn 24 August 2017, Mavrias joined Rijeka in the Croatian First Football League on a one-year contract with a three-year extension option.\n\nHibernian\nMavrias signed with Scottish Premiership club Hibernian in October 2018 on a short-term contract, following a trial period. He made two first-team appearances for Hibernian, but then suffered a hamstring injury and was released at the end of his contract.\n\nOmonia\nOn 29 December 2018, Omonia officially announced the signing of Mavrias on a 2,5 year contract. He made his debut for the team on 13 January 2019, on a match against Apollon Limassol for the Cypriot First Division, replacing Saša Živec on the 41st minute. On February 10, he scored his first goal on a match against Doxa Katokopias.\n\nApollon Limassol\nOn 11 June 2021, Apollon Limassol announced him, with a contract lasting until 2023.\n\nInternational career\nOn 19 March 2019, Greece head coach Angelos Anastasiadis announced the call up of Mavrias for the match against Liechtenstein and Bosnia and Herzegovina for UEFA Euro 2020. Mavrias's talent is undoubted and has added versatility to his game, demonstrating he is able to operate as a right back if need be. His form in Cyprus has been patchy which again makes his selection fascinating. Anastasiadis may see him as a ‘wildcard’ option to throw on off the bench as his speed could add another dimension to a team severely lacking such a trait. He has already featured for the Greece national team on five occasions, but his last appearance came in 2014 as the Greece lost to Serbia in a friendly.\n\nCareer statistics\nAs of 22:01, 08 May 2022 (UTC).\n\nHonours\nClub\nRijeka\n\nAtlantic Cup: 2017Omonia\n\nCypriot First Division: 2020–21Apollon Limassol\n\nCypriot First Division: 2021–22\n\nInternational\nGreece U19\n\nUEFA European Under-19 Championship runner-up: 2012\nPassage 9:\nJohn J.

At age 16 he was working as a painter for his father, but then established himself as a magician, daredevil, and escapologist, sometimes with the spelling Harry Herd, as \"The world’s youngest Handcuff King,\" an English version of Harry Houdini, although it's uncertain whether he met Houdini or saw him perform.\n\nActing career\nHeard began his film career in 1912 and used the name Harry Lorraine throughout his acting career. It appears to have been strictly a stage name, as he used the surname Heard on his marriage certificate in 1932, and there is no known documentation of a legal name change.Lorraine's first acting role was Little John in Robin Hood Outlawed. The next month, he took the lead role of Lieutenant Rose in Lieutenant Rose and the Train Wreckers. In this movie, typical for the time period, Lorraine's character is traveling on a train which has been directed to a siding by the enemy, and – all while the smallest slip means certain death – as the train is hurtling along, he climbs out of the carriage, swings himself between two coaches, and disconnects the couplings, thereby saving the day by sending on the bulk of the train to destruction while his own carriage remains safely on the track.Lorraine did his own stunts in movies, drawing on his natural strength and the physical skills he had developed prior to acting. During a time when it seemed audiences wanted more and every action movie had to outdo previous movies – and with only visual effects and music – some were quite challenging and even dangerous. Examples of some of the daredevil stunts Lorraine performed include diving into a pool of sharks (filming on location in Jamaica), being thrown bound hand and foot from Walton Bridge into the river thirty feet below, fighting six men single-handedly and getting thrown down onto a table with such force that it splintered (this was an unrehearsed and unexpected thrill), jumping from an airplane, dangling from the jib of a very tall crane while bound, being dragged by a taxicab, and sundry chase scenes.Lorraine's acting career spanned three decades, and its end probably had as much to do with the near-standstill of the British film industry during World War II as with his advancing age for the types of characters he usually played.\n\nPersonal life\nIn 1932, Lorraine married Gladys Seals in Kingston. His name was recorded as Harry Heard on the marriage certificate. He was forty-five years old and his occupation was listed as film director; she was twenty-four. Gladys used the name Tonie throughout her life. They had two boys, both born in Staines, whose surnames were registered as both Heard and Lorraine, and adopted to use the surname Lorraine.The British film industry was decimated by the effects of World War II, and after the war Lorraine left acting to manage his father’s building business. Known as Lorraine Estates, it was initially involved in repairing bomb damage to property in Battersea and other sites in and around London. Lorraine continued working in the building business almost until his death at age 85 on 27 March 1970, and was recorded as \"film director (retired)\" on his death certificate. Tonie died in 2002, at age 94.\n\nSelected filmography\nNotes\nCopies of some of Lorraine's movies are no longer extant, and there are only brief synopses for some. For others, even story lines and listing of credits are not available.\nDuring Lorraine's career, there was another actor name Harry Lorraine, an American silent film actor who was noted for comedy and romance films, not action films. Their careers largely overlapped, and due to incomplete records and because the English Harry Lorraine spent time and is thought to filmed movies in the United States, their filmographies have not yet been disambiguated with certainty.", "answers": ["Harry Albert Willis"], "length": 2990, "dataset": "2wikimqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "fbbe6a3e39955eca34caa6cf37d147f6af697a70eb83a30c"}
{"input": "Which film came out earlier, Olavina Udugore or A Pearl In The Forest?", "context": "Passage 1:\nWorskla Forest\nThe Worskla Forest (на Ворскле) is in the Belgorod Oblast of Russia. It is part of the (Sapowednik) Belogorye Nature Reserve.\nIt lies on the high right side of the Worskla river, between the Worskla and the Gotnja rivers. It covers an area of 1,038 hectares (2,560 acres). Geographically the area belongs to the southern part of the forest-steppe zone. The nature reserve is bordered to the north-west by the village of Krasny Kutok, to the southeast by Borisovka, and in the north and the south and west by the Worsklatal. On the left bank of the Vorskla, is the village of Dubino (Landsgemeinde Belenkoje). The territory of the forest itself is part of the rural community Kryukovo.\n\nGeography\nThe western, northwestern and southern edges form the river terraces and slopes of Woskla and Loknjatal Rivers. The highest point in the forest at 217 metres (712 ft) is located in the northeastern part of the forest. The lowest point (137 metres (449 ft)) is located in Worsklatal. Through the forest run numerous small gullies that are called in this region \"Jar\".\nIn the forest there are no springs and watercourses although the forest is quite wet at the beginning of spring, after the snow melts, flowing rivulets at the bottom of canyons. The rivers Vorskla, Gotnja and Loknja flow along the forest edge for a distance of 10 to 900 metres (33 to 2,953 ft).\nOn the territory of the forest there is no natural pond. Only in the protection zone of the nature reserve, in the Worsklatalaue, there are small backwaters. In the 20th century, ponds were built in the Klosterrunse whose dams broke through snow meltwater. Only a pond remained at the top of the gully.\n\nSoils\nThe soils of the forest at the Vorskla developed on different parent materials, especially on the loam, which is found in the eastern half of the forest. In the northwestern part of the forest, old alluvium sands play a role. They are distributed on the river terraces of Gotnja and Loknja. At the southern and south-eastern edge of the forest an oligozänischer sandy loam is common parent rock. In some places in the southern part of the forest, a rust-colored clay comes out. The oligozänische sandy loam and the rust-colored clay are the starting materials of soil formation, where erosion has removed the loess. Under the oligozänischen clay are rocks from the Cretaceous, which do not appear on the surface in the territory of the forest.\nHere 20 different soil types are distinguished. They differ on the degree of podsolisation and the humus content. All floors of the Forest on the Vorskla are based on the Russian soil classification from 1977 about the types of gray forest soils.  According to the USDA soil classification they belong to the Alfi sols, after the German soil classification if they were classified as Luvisols.\n\nHistory\nUntil the 17th century, the Worskla forest was a part of an undivided oak forest that stretched along the high right bank of the Vorskla River. Forest was used as a natural barrier against depredations of the Tartars. Therefore, logging of the woods was strictly forbidden. At the end of the 17th century, however, the Tartar threat had diminished.\n\nIn the Early 18th century the forest was protected from being cut down by regulations of Peter I. In 1701, the deforestation along the rivers was banned, then in 1703, the ban was extended to the small rivers. The edict included a ban on grazing and oaks, pines, maples and elms with trunk thicknesses of more than 54 centimetres (21 in) were excluded from felling.In 1705 the forest was owned by Count Boris Sheremetev who created a conservation area and hunting reserve. In 1714 Count Sheremetev founded a nunnery in Borisovka on the edge of the forest, today it is a nature reserve.\nIn the 1880s and 1890s the first major deforestation in the fourth section of the forest and in the northern part of the tenth section the deforestation continued into the 20th century.After the October Revolution, the forest on the Vorskla was in danger with felling beginning in 1917, with grazing and vegetable gardens being introduced. Larger native animals almost disappeared.\nIt fell to the entomologist Malyshev to begin a movement to save the forest. He knew the forest at the Vorskla from the time before the revolution when as a student he undertook entomological research there. In 1919 he wrote appeals to various authorities. He also appeared in the People's Assembly of the residents of Borisovka and made propaganda work for forest conservation in schools and village libraries. His efforts were successful, and after the establishment of Zoopsychologischen Station (in 1922) the forest was made a nature reserve in 1924.  Malyshev organized the protection of forests. In the nature reserve began scientific research, the nature reserve, the Natural History Museum was founded. In Russian and Germany  scientific journals first article on the forest at the Vorskla were published. However, Malyshev was subject to a political witch-hunt under Joseph Stalin and he was dismissed from his role at the Nature Reserve and in 1934, Malyshev was transported to Leningrad.\nIn 1934 the forest was transferred to control of Leningrad University. During World War II, the forest fell under German occupation who felled tens of thousands of trees. During the Battle of Kursk, trenches were laid out in the forest, causing soil erosion, which can be seen to this day.In 1994, the Nature Reserve of the University of St. Petersburg was handed over to the Ministry of Natural Resources. Today an area of 160 hectares (400 acres), is the only forest with 300-year-old oak trees to have survived in the European part of the former Soviet Union.\n\nGallery\nPassage 2:\nPearl Airways\nPearl Airways or Pearl Airways Compagne Haitienne was an airline based in Haiti.\nPassage 3:\nOlavina Udugore\nOlavina Udugore is a 1987 Indian Kannada-language film directed, written and co-produced by D.

The script is based on the true story of the Battle of Kolwezi that happened in 1978. It was diligently described in a book of the same name by former 1st Foreign Parachute Regiment Captain Pierre Sergent. He published his book in 1979, and the film came out in 1980. Coutard shot the film in a documentary style.\n\nPlot\nThe film is based on true events. In 1978, approximately 3,000 heavily armed fighters from Katanga crossed the border to the Zaire and marched into Kolwezi, a mining centre for copper and cobalt. They took 3,000 civilians as hostages. Within a few days, between 90 and 280 hostages were killed. The rebels appeared to be unpredictable and are reported to have threatened to annihilate all civilians.\nMobutu Sese Seko, Zaire's head of state, urged Belgium, France and the United States to help. France sent the Foreign Legion's 2nd Foreign Parachute Regiment, which were flown from Corsica to Kolwezi. Following their arrival, they secured the perimeter, in co-operation with Belgian soldiers from Zaire, and then started to evacuate the civilians. Within two days more than 2,000 Europeans and about 3,000 African citizens were saved. The film strives to depict the events in a dramatised form, concentrating on the Europeans' plight.\n\nProduction\nThe late Jean Seberg had filmed scenes on location for the film, but her death caused her to be replaced by another French American actress, Mimsy Farmer, who reshot Seberg's scenes.\n\nCast\nBruno Cremer: Pierre Delbart\nJacques Perrin:Ambassador Berthier\nLaurent Malet: Phillipe Denrémont\nPierre Vaneck: Colonel Grasser\nMimsy Farmer: Annie Devrindt\nGiuliano Gemma: Adjudant Fédérico\nRobert Etcheverry : Colonel Dubourg\nJean-Claude Bouillon : Maurois\nPassage 5:\nA Pearl in the Forest\nA Pearl in the Forest (Mongolian: Мойлхон, Moilkhon, Buckthorn) is a 2008 Mongolian historical film.This is a story about a young couple whose newly planned life was destroyed by the impact of the Great Purge of 1934–1938 in Mongolia.\nThe main goal of this movie was to provide a testimony for the many Buryats and Mongolians who were persecuted during the Great Purges initiated by Joseph Stalin. In 1937 and 1938, many people, and even entire families, were killed after being wrongfully accused of conspiracies.\nThe movie was shot on location near the Buryat village of Dadal in the Khentii province of Mongolia. The acting and other participation of many local villagers was a great addition to the authenticity of the film.\n\nSynopsis\nIn the 1930s in Mongolia, a former villager returns as a government informer, and is determined to use his authority to crush a village in order to take by force what he cannot win by love: a young woman who is engaged to another man.\n\nCast\nBayarmaa Baatar : Sendem\nZolboot Gombo : Markhaa\nNarankhuu Khatanbaatar : Dugar\nG.

The forest is around Mount Cole, which formed 390 million years ago. The Indigenous Australians, the Beeripmo balug people, called it Bereep-bereep, which means wild. The forest covers an area of 12,150 hectares, including the forest around Mount Lonarch.The forest is on a plateau which is above grassy plains. The plateau is about 760 metres above sea level. High peaks in the forest include Mount Buangor (1,090 metres), Mount Cole (899 metres) and Ben Nevis (877 metres).The main trees in the southern part of the forest are Messmate (Eucalyptus obliqua), Manna Gum (Eucalyptus viminalis), and Blue Gums (Eucalyptus globulus). In the north, which is drier, there are Yellow Box (Eucalyptus melliodora), and Red Stringybark (Eucalyptus macrorhyncha). There is also the rare Mount Cole Grevillea, Grevillea montis-cole. On the high peaks there are groups of Snow Gums (Eucalyptus pauciflora).There have been 130 different birds seen in the forest, including the Powerful owl (Ninox strenua). Animals include kangaroos, wallabies, echidna, koalas and possums. In 1954, 160 koalas were set free in the forest to as part of a plan to re-establish the animals in Victorian forests. In the 19th century, deer were introduced and Sambar deer are still living in the wet gullies in the south of the forest.\nActivities in the forest include camping, walking, four wheel driving, horse riding, and bird watching.The purpose of the forest is to supply good quality hardwood logs for sawmills. The management plan for the forest also protects the water catchments of several creeks which supply water to nearby towns.\nOn 24 June 2021, the Andrews State Government, following an extensive review and recommendation, declerated that the Mt Cole State Forest would be added to the National Park register, providing it with additional protections. The proposed Mt Buangor National Park would be staged over the next 8 years in addition to 60,000 hectares of State forests and parks also to be added.\n\nMount Buangor State Park\nAn area of 1,940 hectares, the Mount Buangor State Park, was protected from logging in 1973. This park includes the waterfalls on Middle Creek, and the large rock faces and caves on Cave Hill.\n\nClimate\nAs the ranges face into the prevailing westerly storm track, maximum temperatures are particularly cold for the altitude and latitude. Heavy snowfalls occur regularly throughout the year, and sub-freezing daily maximum temperatures have been recorded well into spring at Lookout Hill (965 metres). Cold weather is present even at the height of summer: on 02 February 2005, the daily maximum temperature did not exceed 4.5 °C (40.1 °F) at Lookout Hill. The ranges can be classed as having a cool mediterranean climate.

It was one of the singles from the soundtrack album for the film Rugrats in Paris: The Movie (known in France as Les Razmokets à Paris). With its lyrics written by Farmer and the song being composed and produced by her long-time songwriting collaborator Laurent Boutonnat, \"L'Histoire d'une fée, c'est...\" was released on 27 February 2001. The song describes the fairy Mélusine with \"childish\" lyrics that contrast with double entendres and puns referring to sexual practices. Although the single had no music video nor airplay promotion, it received generally positive reviews from critics and reached top-ten charts in France and Belgium.\n\nBackground and writing\nRugrats in Paris: The Movie was the second in a trilogy of films based on the children's animated television series Rugrats, which features the adventures of a group of toddlers. After filming, the producers wanted to record a soundtrack for the movie with mainly French songs, as well as a few in English. Several singers were contacted, including TLC member Tionne Watkins, the 1990s boys band 2Be3, Sinéad O'Connor, Cyndi Lauper and Mylène Farmer. Persistent but unconfirmed rumours claimed that Madonna, as the founder of the Maverick company producing the soundtrack, had expressly asked Farmer to participate in the album. Farmer accepted, but preferred to produce a new song instead of licensing the rights to one of her old compositions. The recording label Maverick signed a contract for an unreleased song, with lyrics written by Farmer and music composed by her songwriting partner Laurent Boutonnat. This was the first time that the singer had recorded a song especially for a movie. An English version was canceled in favour of a French version, and eventually the song only played for about 15 seconds in the movie. The first title chosen, \"Attrapez-moi\", was also quickly abandoned as it was too similar to the Pokémon's cry of \"Attrapez-les tous\".\n\nMusic and lyrics\n\"L'Histoire d'une fée, c'est...\" is a synthpop song. It tells the story of a mischievous and malicious fairy, Mélusine, here embodied by Farmer. Lyrically, the song uses words referring to magic, baffling several of Farmer's fans as the lyrics seem to be closer to the themes found in songs by young singers such as Alizée. The lyrics also contain several double entendres and puns which refer to sexual practices. The song's title itself is ambiguous and can be deemed sexually suggestive as it contains a pun in French alluding to spanking: in French, the title \"L'Histoire d'une fée, c'est...\" could be phonetically understand as meaning \"L'Histoire d'une fessée...\" (translation: \"The Story of a Spanking\").\n\nRelease\nIn Europe the soundtrack release was postponed until 7 February 2001 because Farmer had bought the song's royalties and finally decided to release it as a single, 14 days later. It was only released as a digipack CD single, in which the song's lyrics are written inside, and there was no promotional format. For the second time in the singer's career – after the song \"XXL\" – the single cover does not show her, but a drawing of a fairy from the film by Tom Madrid. The song began circulating online a month before the soundtrack's release and was well received by many fans who felt that it could be a hit. The song did not receive much radio airplay, with only Europe 2 playing it regularly. \"L'Histoire d'une fée, c'est...\" was also released on the soundtrack of the film in a longer version than the CD single version, and was later included on Mylène Farmer's greatest hits album Les Mots. It was also released as the third track on the European CD maxi \"Les Mots\", released in the Switzerland on 4 September 2002.\n\nCritical reception\nThe song was generally well received by critics, who particularly noted the puns. According to author Erwan Chuberre, the lyrics are \"as funny as disillusioned\" and Farmer uses puns that \"highlight her immoderate pleasure for impolite pleasures\", with a music he deemed \"effective\". Author Thierry Desaules said that the song appears to be a childish fairly tale, but is actually structured in a perverse enough way to address the adult public, as the allusions to the spanking can be seen as references to sadomasochism. Journalist Benoît Cachin wrote that her puns are \"of the funniest\" and that the singer included in the lyrics \"some very personal thoughts\", including sadness; he added that Farmer appears to be \"fun, dynamic and delightfully mischievous\" on this song.\n\nChart performance\nOn 3 March 2001, the single debuted at a peak of number nine on the French SNEP Singles Chart, providing Farmer her 22nd top ten hit. In the following weeks, the song fell steadily and remained in the top 50 for nine weeks and a total of 15 weeks on the chart. This chart performance was surprising given that the song was aired little on radio, the film met a mixed commercial success in France and there was no music video, no promotion on television, and only one format. According to Instant-Mag the beauty of the single's cover undoubtedly helped increase sales. In Belgium, the single started at number 23 on 15 March 2001, climbed to number 11, then peaked at number 10. Thereafter, it dropped and fell off the Ultratop 50 after 13 weeks. On the 2001 Belgian singles year-end chart, \"L'Histoire d'une fée, c'est...\" ranked at number 89.\n\nFormats and track listings\nThese are the formats and track listings of single releases of \"L'Histoire d'une fée, c'est...\":\n\nCD single – Digipack\n\nOfficial versions\nCredits and personnel\nThese are the credits and the personnel as they appear on the back of the single:\n\nMylène Farmer – lyrics\nLaurent Boutonnat – music, producer\nJohn Eng – artistic director\nGena Kornyshev – stylist\nTom Madrid – drawings\nRequiem Publishing – editions\nPolydor – recording company\nHenry Neu – design\nBertrand Chatenet – mixing\n\nCharts\nRelease history\nPassage 7:\nI Can Change (LCD Soundsystem song)\n\"I Can Change\" is a song by American rock band LCD Soundsystem.

Mathur was the Director of the Indian Intelligence Bureau between September 1975 and February 1980. He was also the Director General of Police in Punjab.\nPassage 2:\nSweepstakes (film)\nSweepstakes is a 1931 American pre-Code comedy film directed by Albert S. Rogell from a screenplay written by Lew Lipton and Ralph Murphy. The film stars Eddie Quillan, James Gleason, Marian Nixon,  Lew Cody, and Paul Hurst, which centers around the travails and romances of jockey Buddy Doyle, known as the \"Whoop-te-doo Kid\" for his trademark yell during races. Produced by the newly formed RKO Pathé Pictures, this was the first film Charles R. Rogers would produce for the studio, after he replaced William LeBaron as head of production. The film was released on July 10, 1931, through RKO Radio Pictures.\n\nPlot\nBud Doyle is a jockey who has discovered the secret to get his favorite mount, Six-Shooter, to boost his performance. If he simply chants the phrase, \"Whoop-te-doo\", the horse responds with a burst of speed. There is a special bond between the jockey and his mount, but there is increasing tension between Doyle and the horse's owner, Pop Blake (who also raised Doyle), over Doyle's relationship with local singer Babe Ellis. Blake sees Ellis as a distraction prior to the upcoming big race, the Camden Stakes.\nThe owner of the club where Babe sings, Wally Weber, has his eyes on his horse winning the Camden Stakes. When the issues between Pop and Doyle come to a head, Pop tells Doyle that he has to choose: either he stops seeing Babe, or he'll be replaced as Six-Shooter's jockey in the big race. Angry and frustrated, Doyle quits. Weber approaches him to become the jockey for Rose Dawn, Weber's horse, and Doyle agrees, with the precondition that he not ride Royal Dawn in the Camden Stakes, for he wants Six-Shooter to still win the race.  Weber accedes to that one precondition, however, on the day of the race, he makes it clear that Doyle is under contract, and that he will ride Rose Dawn in the race.\nUpset, Doyle has no choice but to ride Rose Dawn.  However, during the race, he manages to chant his signature \"Whoop-te-doo\" to Six-Shooter, causing his old mount to win the race. Furious that his horse lost, Weber goes to the judges, who rule that Doyle threw the race, pulling back on Rose Dawn, to allow Six-Shooter to win, and suspend Doyle from horse-racing.\nDevastated, Doyle wanders from town to town, riding in small local races, until his identity is uncovered, and he is forced to move on.  Soon, he is out of racing all together, and forced to taking one odd-job after another.  Eventually, he ends up south of the border, in Tijuana, Mexico, working as a waiter. Doyle's friend, Sleepy Jones, hears of Doyle's plight. Jones gets the racing commission to lift the ban, by proving Doyle's innocence.  He then, accompanied by Babe, gets a group to buy Six-Shooter from Pop, and they take the horse down to Tijuana, where there is another big race in the near future, the Tijuana Handicap.\nDoyle is reluctant to ride at first, however, he is eventually cajoled into it by Sleepy and Babe, and of course, his bond with Six-Shooter is there.  He rides the horse to victory, re-establishing his credentials as a rider. The film ends by jumping a few years into the future, which shows Doyle and Babe happily married, with a child of their own.\n\nCast\n(Cast list as per AFI database)\nEddie Quillan as Bud Doyle\nLew Cody as Wally Weber\nJames Gleason as Sleepy Jones\nMarian Nixon as Babe Ellis\nKing Baggot as Mike\nPaul Hurst as Cantina Bartender\nClarence Wilson as Mr. Emory\nFrederick Burton as Pop Blake\nBilly Sullivan as Speed Martin\nLillian Leighton as Ma Clancy\nMike Donlin as The Dude\n\nProduction\nCritical response\nMordaunt Hall of The New York Times gave a very non-committal review of this film, with neither much praise or criticism.

He was the director of the Peabody Essex Museum in Salem for 17 months, resigning December 31, 2020. He was the director of the Toledo Museum of Art in Ohio from 2010 to 2019. He was the director of the Hood Museum of Art from 2005 to 2010, and the National Gallery of Australia (Canberra) from 1997 to 2004.\n\nCareer\nBrian Kennedy currently lives and works in the United States after leaving Australia in 2005 to direct the Hood Museum of Art at Dartmouth College. In October 2010 he became the ninth Director of the Toledo Museum of Art. On 1 July 2019, he succeeded Dan Monroe as the executive director and CEO of the Peabody Essex Museum.\n\nEarly life and career in Ireland\nKennedy was born in Dublin and attended Clonkeen College. He received B.A. (1982), M.A. (1985) and PhD (1989) degrees from University College-Dublin, where he studied both art history and history.\nHe worked in the Irish Department of Education (1982), the European Commission, Brussels (1983), and in Ireland at the Chester Beatty Library (1983–85), Government Publications Office (1985–86), and Department of Finance (1986–89). He married Mary Fiona Carlin in 1988.He was Assistant Director at the National Gallery of Ireland in Dublin from 1989 to 1997. He was Chair of the Irish Association of Art Historians from 1996 to 1997, and of the Council of Australian Art Museum Directors from 2001 to 2003. In September 1997 he became Director of the National Gallery of Australia.\n\nNational Gallery of Australia (NGA)\nKennedy expanded the traveling exhibitions and loans program throughout Australia, arranged for several major shows of Australian art abroad, increased the number of exhibitions at the museum itself and oversaw the development of an extensive multi-media site.  Although he oversaw several years of the museum's highest ever annual visitation, he discontinued the emphasis of his predecessor, Betty Churcher, on showing \"blockbuster\" exhibitions.\nDuring his directorship, the NGA gained government support for improving the building and significant private donations and corporate sponsorship. However, the initial design for the building proved controversial generating a public dispute with the original architect on moral rights grounds.  As a result, the project was not delivered during Dr Kennedy's tenure, with a significantly altered design completed some years later.  Private funding supported two acquisitions of British art, including David Hockney's A Bigger Grand Canyon in 1999, and Lucian Freud's After Cézanne in 2001. Kennedy built on the established collections at the museum by acquiring the Holmgren-Spertus collection of Indonesian textiles; the Kenneth Tyler collection of editioned prints, screens, multiples and unique proofs; and the Australian Print Workshop Archive. He was also notable for campaigning for the construction of a new \"front\" entrance to the Gallery, facing King Edward Terrace, which was completed in 2010 (see reference to the building project above).\nKennedy's cancellation of the \"Sensation exhibition\" (scheduled at the NGA from 2 June 2000 to 13 August 2000) was controversial, and seen by some as censorship. He claimed that the decision was due to the exhibition being \"too close to the market\" implying that a national cultural institution cannot exhibit the private collection of a speculative art investor. However, there were other exhibitions at the NGA during his tenure, which could have raised similar concerns. The exhibition featured the privately owned Young British Artists works belonging to Charles Saatchi and attracted large attendances in London and Brooklyn. Its most controversial work was Chris Ofili's The Holy Virgin Mary, a painting which used elephant dung and was accused of being blasphemous. The then-mayor of New York, Rudolph Giuliani, campaigned against the exhibition, claiming it was \"Catholic-bashing\" and an \"aggressive, vicious, disgusting attack on religion.\" In November 1999, Kennedy cancelled the exhibition and stated that the events in New York had \"obscured discussion of the artistic merit of the works of art\". He has said that it \"was the toughest decision of my professional life, so far.\"Kennedy was also repeatedly questioned on his management of a range of issues during the Australian Government's Senate Estimates process - particularly on the NGA's occupational health and safety record and concerns about the NGA's twenty-year-old air-conditioning system.

He was the director of the Peabody Essex Museum in Salem for 17 months, resigning December 31, 2020. He was the director of the Toledo Museum of Art in Ohio from 2010 to 2019. He was the director of the Hood Museum of Art from 2005 to 2010, and the National Gallery of Australia (Canberra) from 1997 to 2004.\n\nCareer\nBrian Kennedy currently lives and works in the United States after leaving Australia in 2005 to direct the Hood Museum of Art at Dartmouth College. In October 2010 he became the ninth Director of the Toledo Museum of Art. On 1 July 2019, he succeeded Dan Monroe as the executive director and CEO of the Peabody Essex Museum.\n\nEarly life and career in Ireland\nKennedy was born in Dublin and attended Clonkeen College. He received B.A. (1982), M.A. (1985) and PhD (1989) degrees from University College-Dublin, where he studied both art history and history.\nHe worked in the Irish Department of Education (1982), the European Commission, Brussels (1983), and in Ireland at the Chester Beatty Library (1983–85), Government Publications Office (1985–86), and Department of Finance (1986–89). He married Mary Fiona Carlin in 1988.He was Assistant Director at the National Gallery of Ireland in Dublin from 1989 to 1997. He was Chair of the Irish Association of Art Historians from 1996 to 1997, and of the Council of Australian Art Museum Directors from 2001 to 2003. In September 1997 he became Director of the National Gallery of Australia.\n\nNational Gallery of Australia (NGA)\nKennedy expanded the traveling exhibitions and loans program throughout Australia, arranged for several major shows of Australian art abroad, increased the number of exhibitions at the museum itself and oversaw the development of an extensive multi-media site.  Although he oversaw several years of the museum's highest ever annual visitation, he discontinued the emphasis of his predecessor, Betty Churcher, on showing \"blockbuster\" exhibitions.\nDuring his directorship, the NGA gained government support for improving the building and significant private donations and corporate sponsorship. However, the initial design for the building proved controversial generating a public dispute with the original architect on moral rights grounds.  As a result, the project was not delivered during Dr Kennedy's tenure, with a significantly altered design completed some years later.  Private funding supported two acquisitions of British art, including David Hockney's A Bigger Grand Canyon in 1999, and Lucian Freud's After Cézanne in 2001. Kennedy built on the established collections at the museum by acquiring the Holmgren-Spertus collection of Indonesian textiles; the Kenneth Tyler collection of editioned prints, screens, multiples and unique proofs; and the Australian Print Workshop Archive. He was also notable for campaigning for the construction of a new \"front\" entrance to the Gallery, facing King Edward Terrace, which was completed in 2010 (see reference to the building project above).\nKennedy's cancellation of the \"Sensation exhibition\" (scheduled at the NGA from 2 June 2000 to 13 August 2000) was controversial, and seen by some as censorship. He claimed that the decision was due to the exhibition being \"too close to the market\" implying that a national cultural institution cannot exhibit the private collection of a speculative art investor. However, there were other exhibitions at the NGA during his tenure, which could have raised similar concerns. The exhibition featured the privately owned Young British Artists works belonging to Charles Saatchi and attracted large attendances in London and Brooklyn. Its most controversial work was Chris Ofili's The Holy Virgin Mary, a painting which used elephant dung and was accused of being blasphemous. The then-mayor of New York, Rudolph Giuliani, campaigned against the exhibition, claiming it was \"Catholic-bashing\" and an \"aggressive, vicious, disgusting attack on religion.\" In November 1999, Kennedy cancelled the exhibition and stated that the events in New York had \"obscured discussion of the artistic merit of the works of art\". He has said that it \"was the toughest decision of my professional life, so far.\"Kennedy was also repeatedly questioned on his management of a range of issues during the Australian Government's Senate Estimates process - particularly on the NGA's occupational health and safety record and concerns about the NGA's twenty-year-old air-conditioning system. The air-conditioning was finally renovated in 2003. Kennedy announced in 2002 that he would not seek extension of his contract beyond 2004, accepting a seven-year term as had his two predecessors.He became a joint Irish-Australian citizen in 2003.\n\nToledo Museum of Art\nThe Toledo Museum of Art is known for its exceptional collections of European and American paintings and sculpture, glass, antiquities, artist books, Japanese prints and netsuke. The museum offers free admission and is recognized for its historical leadership in the field of art education.  During his tenure, Kennedy has focused the museum's art education efforts on visual literacy, which he defines as \"learning to read, understand and write visual language.\"   Initiatives have included baby and toddler tours, specialized training for all staff, docents, volunteers and the launch of a website, www.vislit.org. In November 2014, the museum hosted the International Visual Literacy Association (IVLA) conference, the first Museum to do so.

In addition, the museum has made major acquisitions of Old Master paintings by Frans Hals and Luca Giordano.During his tenure the Toledo Museum of Art has announced the return of several objects from its collection due to claims the objects were stolen and/or illegally exported prior being sold to the museum.  In 2011 a Meissen sweetmeat stand was returned to Germany followed by an Etruscan Kalpis or water jug to Italy (2013), an Indian sculpture of Ganesha (2014) and an astrological compendium to Germany in 2015.\n\nHood Museum of Art\nKennedy became Director of the Hood Museum of Art in July 2005. During his tenure, he implemented a series of large and small-scale exhibitions and oversaw the production of more than 20 publications to bring greater public attention to the museum's remarkable collections of the arts of America, Europe, Africa, Papua New Guinea and the Polar regions.

(French: Mais où est donc passée la septième compagnie?) is a 1973 French-Italian comedy war film directed by Robert Lamoureux. The film portrays the adventures of a French Army squad lost somewhere on the front in May 1940 during the Battle of France.\n\nPlot\nDuring the Battle of France, while German forces are spreading across the country, the 7th Transmission Company suffers an air raid near the Machecoul woods, but survive and hide in the woods. Captain Dumont, the company commander, sends Louis Chaudard, Pithiviers and Tassin to scout the area. After burying the radio cable beneath a sandy road, the squad crosses the field, climbs a nearby hill, and takes position within a cemetery. One man cut down the wrong tree for camouflage, pulling up the radio cable and revealing it to the passing German infantry. The Germans cut the cable, surround the woods, and order a puzzled 7th Company to surrender. The squad tries to contact the company, but then witness their capture and run away.\nCommanded by Staff Sergeant Chaudard, the unit stops in a wood for the night. Pithiviers is content to slow down and wait for the end of the campaign. The next day, he goes for a swim in the lake, in sight of possible German fighters. When Chaudard and Tassin wake up, they leave the camp without their weapons to look for Pithiviers. Tassin finds him and gives an angry warning, but Pithiviers convinces Tassin to join him in the lake. Chaudard orders them to get out, but distracted by a rabbit, falls into the lake. While Chaudard teaches his men how to swim, two German fighter planes appear, forcing them out of the water. After shooting down one of the German planes, a French pilot, Lieutenant Duvauchel, makes an emergency landing and escapes before his plane explodes. PFC Pithiviers, seeing the bad shape of one of his shoes, destroys what is left of his shoe sole. Tassin is sent on patrol to get food and a new pair of shoes for Pithiviers. Tassin arrives in a farm, but only finds a dog, so he returns and Chaudard goes to the farm after nightfall. The farmer returns with her daughter-in-law and Lt Duvauchel, and she welcomes Chaudard. Duvauchel, who is hiding behind the door, comes out upon hearing the news and decides to meet Chaudard's men.\nWhen Chaudard and Duvauchel return to the camp, Tassin and Pithiviers are roasting a rabbit they caught. Duvauchel realizes that Chaudard has been lying and takes command.\nThe following day, the men leave the wood in early morning and capture a German armored tow truck after killing its two drivers. They originally planned to abandon the truck and the two dead Germans in the woods, but instead realized that the truck is the best way to disguise themselves and free the 7th Company. They put on the Germans' uniforms, recover another soldier of the 7th Company, who succeeded in escaping, and obtain resources from a collaborator who mistook them for Germans.\nOn their way, they encounter a National Gendarmerie patrol, who appear to be a 5th column. The patrol injures the newest member of their group, a young soldier, and then are killed by Tassin.

He was the younger son of Rudolph I and his wife Matilda of Gleiberg, heiress of Giessen.\n\nLife\nRudolph II inherited the County Palatine of Tübingen when his elder brother Hugo III died in 1216.  From 1224 onwards, he is described as Count Palatine in many imperial documents, while his younger brother William is merely styled as Count.  Rudolph II supported Bebenhausen Abbey, which his parents had founded. \nNext to his father, Rudolph II is the second most mentioned Count Palatine of Tübingen in imperial documents, mostly in documents by King Henry (VII) of Germany, the son of Emperor Frederick II, who had been elected King of Germany in 1220, at the age of 8.  Frederick II spent much of his time in Italy, leaving his ancestral Swabia in the hands of his son.  Later, in 1232, Henry revolted against his father, and did everything in his power to win the Swabian nobility over to his side.  Rudolph II appears to have been among the noblemen who sided with Henry VII, at least, he is mentioned in 10 different documents of Henry VII and never by Frederick II.  Considering Rudolph's energetic character, one can assume that he intended to use the conflict between Henry VII and Frederick II to expand his own power and aim at an independent position.Swabian noblemen, including Rudolph II and his brother William, Count Hartmann I of Württemberg and a Count of Dillingen, visited Henry VII in Worms on 8 January 1224.  They met Margrave Herman V of Baden was also present, as was Eberhard, Sénéchal of Waldburg and councillor and former guardian of Henry VII in Oppenheim on 5 April 1227 and in Hagenau on 1 May.  In the same year, Rudolph met Duke Louis I of Bavaria, who was an imperial vicar and Conrad of Winterstetten, who was imperial cup-bearer and also a councilor of Henry VII.  He met the Lords of Neuffen and the imperial marshal Anselm of Justingen in Ulm on 23 February 1228.  On 31 August 1228, Rudolph II appears, together with Margrave Herman V of Baden, Count Henry of Wirtemberg, a Count of Dillingen, Conrad of Weinsperg and the councillors mentioned above, as witnesses of a deed in which King henry VII confirms the privileges of Adelber Abbey in Esslingen.  Later that year, Rudolph II appeared as a witness in four deed by Duke Louis I of Bavaria and Bishop Ekbert of Bamberg, together with, among others, Margrave Herman V of Baden, Count Ulrich and Eberhard of Helfenstein, Counts Eberhard and Otto of Eberstein, Count Gottfried of Hohenlohe, and two councilors.Rudolph II stood at the head of a delegation of eight Swabian counts, among them Albert IV of Habsburg, Frederick IV of Zollern and a Count of Eberstein, at the Imperial Diet in Worms on 29 April 1231.  On 22 November 1231, Rudolph II and his brother William met Counts Albert of Rottenburg, Ulrich of Hefenstein and Eberhard of Walpurg at Henry VII's castle in Ulm.  On 31 December 1231, Rudolph witnessed a deed benefiting Neresheim Abbey in Wimpfen, together with Duke Conrad I of Teck and Margrave Hermann V of Baden.  The last time Rudolph II witnessed a deed of Henry VII was on 4 June 1233 in Esslingen, again with his brother William.In 1235, Pope Gregory IX called on the princes of the empire to organize a new crusade into the Holy Land, to render assistance to the beleaguered church there.  Rudolph II is the only Swabian nobleman named in this call to arms; whether he actually went to the Holy Land is unknown.  The fact that he is not mentioned in any deed between 1235 and 1243 suggests that he may have been absent for an extended period.  In particular, no mention is made of his position in the struggle between King Conrad IV of Germany and anti-King Henry Raspe IV, which is remarkable, since this struggle took place mainly in Swabia.  However, a deed in favour of Bebenhausen Abbey which the papal legate made at Rudolph II's request in the army camp outside Ulm on 28 January 1247, suggests that he supported Henry Raspe.\n\nFamily\nThe name of Rudolph II's wife has not been preserved.  She was a daughter of a Margrave Henry from the House of Ronsberg and Udilhild of Gammertingen. They had the following children:\n\nHugo IV, Count Palatine of Tübingen\nRudolf III of Scheer (d. 12 May 1277), Count of Tübingen-Herrenberg\nUlrich\nMathilda, married Burchard II, Count of Hohenberg (d. 14 July 1253, struck by lightning).

He was an innovative composer of instrumental music as well as songs, and was the composer of the earliest surviving music for the guitar.\n\nBiography\nThe place of his birth is not recorded, but he grew up in Guadalajara, and probably received his musical training there.  He most likely went to Italy in 1529 with Charles V, in the company of the fourth Duke of the Infantado, Íñigo López de Mendoza, marqués de Santillana.  When he returned to Spain he became a priest, receiving the post of canon at the cathedral in Seville in 1546, where he remained for the rest of his life.  While at the cathedral, he directed all of the musical activities; many records remain of his musical activities there, which included hiring instrumentalists, buying and assembling a new organ, and working closely with composer Francisco Guerrero for various festivities.  Mudarra died in Seville, and his sizable fortune was distributed to the poor of the city according to his will.\n\nMudarra wrote numerous pieces for the vihuela and the four-course guitar, all contained in the collection Tres libros de musica en cifras para vihuela (\"Three books of music in numbers for vihuela\"), which he published on December 7, 1546 in Seville.  These three books contain the first music ever published for the four-course guitar, which was then a relatively new instrument. The second book is noteworthy in that it contains eight multi-movement works, all arranged by \"tono\", or mode.\nCompositions represented in this publication include fantasias, variations (including a set on La Folia), tientos, pavanes and galliards, and songs. Modern listeners are probably most familiar with his Fantasia X, which has been a concert and recording mainstay for many years.   The songs are in Latin, Spanish and Italian, and include romances, canciones (songs), villancicos, (popular songs) and sonetos (sonnets).  Another innovation was the use of different signs for different tempos:  slow, medium, and fast.\n\nReferences and further reading\nJohn Griffiths: \"Alonso Mudarra\", Grove Music Online ed. L.

A pioneer of rock and roll, Jones played rhythm guitar in Bo Diddley's band in the late 1950s and early 1960s, becoming one of the first (perhaps the first) female rock guitarists in a highly visible rock band, and was sometimes called the Queen Mother of Guitar.\n\nEarly life\nBorn in Harlem, New York City, in 1940, Jones grew up in the Sugar Hill section, and attended the High School of Performing Arts where she studied tap and ballet dance and trained in opera. Even from a very young age, she found herself completely consumed with music; purchasing her first guitar at the age of 15. She was briefly in a local doo-wop group, the Bop Chords, which disbanded in 1957.  A chance meeting with Bo Diddley, who was impressed to see a girl with a guitar case, led to an invitation to join Diddley's band as a guitarist and singer.  She recorded with him from 1957 to 1961 or 1963, appearing on singles including \"Hey! Bo Diddley\", \"Road Runner\", \"Bo Diddley's A Gunslinger\", and the instrumental \"Aztec\" which she wrote and played all the guitar parts. However, throughout her career, Peggy Jones always strived to be an independent artist and was involved in an R&B band known as the Jewels, among other various names.Throughout her time with Diddley, Jones maintained the separate career she had begun independently as a songwriter, session musician, and bandleader.  She led her own band, the Jewels (also known as the Fabulous Jewels, Lady Bo and the Family Jewels, and various other names, but not to be confused with The Jewels), which became a top R&B band on the New York – Boston east coast club scene the 1960s and 1970s.  She eventually left Diddley's band to concentrate on the Jewels and other activities.  She was replaced with another female guitarist, Norma-Jean Wofford (\"The Duchess\").Jones played guitar on Les Cooper's 1962 instrumental \"Wiggle Wobble\" and percussion on the 1967 hit \"San Franciscan Nights\" by Eric Burdon and The Animals and other recordings and later backed James Brown and Sam & Dave.  She remained musically active well into the 21st century.\n\nSolo work\nShe left Bo Diddley's band in 1961 to focus on her work with the Jewels. In 1970, she re-joined Bo Diddley’s band, bringing The Jewels with her.\nJones was known for playing the Roland guitar synthesizer, an experimental instrument not typically heard in rhythm and blues music.\n\nRelationships\nJones met Bo Diddley in 1956 backstage after playing with the Bop-Chords in the Apollo Theater in the neighborhood of Harlem. Many assumed that Lady Bo and Bo Diddley were a couple but that was not the case. She was married to the band’s bass player, Wally Malone.Malone lived in the mountains of western Pennsylvania when he first met Jones in a New York club in the 1960s. Later, Jones invited Malone into her band in 1968 and got married. They both moved to San Jose, California where Jones played at a show with Bo Diddley and that was the time she received her nickname, “Lady Bo.” In 1962 Jones left Bo Diddley and recruited The Duchess to play for him. In 1979, Malone and Jones moved to Boulder Creek.\n\nDeath\nAt the age of 75, Peggy Jones died on September 16, 2015, leaving behind her husband, Wally Malone. He announced his wife’s death via Facebook, saying, “Today is one of the saddest days of my life. My wife and partner of 47 years has been called up to that great rock & roll band in the heavens to be reunited with Bo Diddley, Jerome Green and Clifton James. The last hour and a quarter I spent by her side and the last thing I said to her was the quote above regarding Diddley and band. The other thing I added at the end of it is that band doesn’t have a bass player and for them to please hold that seat until it is my time to join them. The incredible part of this is immediately after saying this to her there was a quick sound that came from her and right then her heart stopped beating. Many of you know about the Bo Diddley connection but in case not my wife’s professional stage name is Lady Bo.”\n\nDiscography\nWith Bo Diddley\n\nGo Bo Diddley (Checker, 1959)\nHave Guitar Will Travel (Checker, 1960)\nBo Diddley in the Spotlight (Checker, 1960)\nBo Diddley Is a Gunslinger (Checker, 1960)\nBo Diddley Is a Lover (Checker, 1961)\nBo Diddley's a Twister (Checker, 1962)\nBo Diddley (Checker, 1962)\nPassage 10:\nJovan Markovski\nJovan Markovski (born March 28, 1988) is a Macedonian professional basketball small forward who last played for TFT.

This was a private company under a government contract to provide public radio programming. The BCC still exists today, but in 1998 the Voice of Free China and the government-owned Central Broadcasting System merged.\nWith the easing of cross-strait relations and the liberalization of Taiwan's government, the Voice of Free China changed its name to Radio Taipei International in 1998 and also used the name \"Voice of Asia\" for some broadcasts. In 2003, it became Radio Taiwan International reflecting the defeat of the Kuomintang government in 2000 and the new government's orientation towards Taiwan independence from China.

It provides port access and railroad interchange services not only to the more than twenty businesses at the park, but also to any business seeking to ship or receive cargo through the McClellan-Kerr Arkansas River Navigation System.\n\nHistory\nPurchase of 151 acres in July 1967 started the planning process for the dock area at the Port.  Four miles of railroad were constructed by July, 1968, the year in which the port began operations.   In 1970, the railroad connected to what were then the Rock Island Railroad and the Missouri Pacific Railroad, and started work on a marshalling yard.  By 1974 the marshalling yard was complete.    In 1977, railroad engine storage and maintenance buildings were completed.\n\nInterchange\nThe line extends from the dock to the interchange point with what is now the Union Pacific (UP) at a junction near Clinton National Airport.  Access to what is now the BNSF is obtained through trackage/haulage rights.\n\nOperations\nThe port railroad operates with two locomotives and five crew members.  It utilizes a tandem unit with an EMD GP15-1 locomotive owned by the port, and one EMD SW1500 locomotive leased from GATX.  The railroad handles over 20,000 cars annually.\nPassage 5:\nJamal Beyg\nJamal Beyg (Persian: جمال بيگ, also Romanized as Jamāl Beyg) is a village in Dezhkord Rural District, Sedeh District, Eqlid County, Fars Province, Iran.

The southernmost of the two, Great Abington, covers 1,588 acres (6.43 km2) and is bounded to the south by the county border with Essex, to the west by a branch of the Icknield Way (now the A11), and to the east by the parish of Hildersham. Little Abington covers 1,309 acres (5.30 km2), again bordered by the Icknield Way and Hildersham to the west and east, and by the ancient thoroughfare of Wool Street to the north.The village history dates back to the Bronze Age, some 4000 years ago. The Saxons gave the village its name, originally called \"estate named after Abba\", and the village was listed as Abintone in the Domesday Book. The 'Great' and 'Little' prefixes came later: the Latin magna is observed from 1218 and the Modern English great from 1523 while the Latin parva is observed from 1218 and the Middle English littel from 1336.In the decades before the Second World War the Land Settlement Association created a site to the south of Great Abington consisting of over sixty houses and plots of land for unemployed miners mainly from the former shipyards of Tyneside and coalfields of Yorkshire and Durham.The Cambridge to Haverhill railway line that opened in 1865 crossed Great Abington just south of the village, but closed in 1967. The medieval Cambridge to Colchester road that was the main route through the village was by-passed in the 1960s.\n\nChurches\nGreat Abington's parish church has been dedicated to St Mary since at least the 16th century and comprises a chancel, nave with south aisle and porch, and west tower. The majority of the present building dates from the 13th century, possibly earlier, including the two-storey tower with short leaded spire.Little Abington's parish church is also dedicated to St Mary, and has been since at least the 16th century. The present building consists of a chancel, nave with north chapel and south porch, and west tower. The nave is believed to date from around 1100, and the chancel was rebuilt in the 13th century. The three-storey tower is probably 14th century.\nA Protestant chapel was built in Little Abington towards the end of the 19th century. It closed in late 2019 and the land has now been sold. Demolition of the chapel has been confirmed.\n\nVillage life\nThe village has a vibrant community with a primary school, village shop, pub, football and cricket team and a large number of local businesses, most of them at Granta Park including The Welding Institute which started in Abington Hall in 1946. In 2009 Abington cricket club played a friendly against Babraham cricket club to commemorate 150 years of the cricket team.\nThe village also has a village hall, called The Abington Institute, which has a café, a large main hall with video projection and an audio system allowing the showing of films and presentations. It also has a meeting room, another large room overlooking the cricket pitch and two changing rooms with showers. The Institute is used by many local clubs and organisations and also hosts regular lunches for older Abington residents.\nThe remaining public house, The Three Tuns in Great Abington, is a 17th-century building that was possibly open in 1687 and certainly by 1756. Former pubs in Little Abington include The Crown which closed in the late 20th century, and The Bricklayers' Arms, which opened in the mid-19th century and was sold in 1912. The Princess (later Prince) of Wales in Great Abington opened at the end of the 19th century and closed in about 1963. The King's Arms opened on the Stump Cross to Newmarket road (now the A11) just north of Bourn Bridge in the late 17th century, closing in 1850 with the advent of the railway. The antiquary William Cole was born there while his father was publican. The White Hart opened on the same road just south of the bridge in around 1750, but closed by the end of the century.\nPassage 8:\nLittle Rock Creek\nLittle Rock Creek may refer to:\n\nLittle Rock Creek (Los Angeles County, California)\nLittle Rock Creek (Minnesota River), a stream in Minnesota\nLittle Rock Creek (Mississippi River), a stream in Minnesota\nLittle Rock Creek (Red Lake), a stream in Minnesota\nLittle Rock Creek (Montana)\nPassage 9:\nThe Abingtons, Cambridgeshire\nThe Abingtons are a community in South Cambridgeshire consisting of two small villages: Little Abington and Great Abington, about 7 miles (11 km) south east of Cambridge.\n\nHistory\nThough often listed as a single entity, Great and Little Abington have since early medieval times been two parishes divided by the River Granta and remain so.

He appeared on several television programs, including Seinfeld.\n\nEarly life\nSaluga was born on September 16, 1937 in Youngstown, Ohio. When Saluga was 10, his father was killed in an industrial accident at the Republic Steel Mill where he worked and his mother supported the family by working as a bookkeeper. Saluga, known as \"Billy\" to his friends and family, was a high school cheerleader and class clown. After graduation, he served two years in the Navy and then began working as a performer in local theaters.\n\nCareer\nSaluga spent several years performing in Youngstown, Ohio theaters and clubs. He played numerous roles in notable productions, including Guys and Dolls and Inherit the Wind. Saluga became a talent coordinator for the Steve  Allen show in the late 1960s. in 1969, he created the \"Johnson\" character while a member of the comedic troupe Ace Trucking Company.Saluga's shtick as the character \"Johnson\" would be, when someone would refer to him as \"Mr. Johnson\" or by the common generic nickname \"Johnson,\" to exaggeratedly feign offense and list off all permutations of the name Raymond J. Johnson Jr. and nicknames thereof that do not mention the word \"Johnson:\"\n\n\"NOOO!!! You don't have to call me Johnson! My name is Raymond J. Johnson Jr.  Now you can call me Ray, or you can call me J, or you can call me Johnny, or you can call me Sonny, or you can call me Junie, or you can call me Junior; now you can call me Ray J, or you can call me RJ, or you can call me RJJ, or you can call me RJJ Jr. . . but you doesn't hasta call me Johnson!\" \nSaluga would then smugly turn away and begin puffing on his cigar. Saluga's routine \nreceived more widespread attention in the late 1970s after being used in a series of commercials for Miller Lite beer, and subsequently, in the early 1980s for Anheuser-Busch Natural Light beer. Saluga appeared alongside comedian/pitchman Norm Crosby echoing (in a roundabout way) Norm's advice to unknowing customers on how to more easily order the lengthily-named beer: \"Well, y'doesn't hasta call it Anheuser Busch Natural Light Beer, and y'doesn't hasta call it 'Busch Natural.'  Just say 'Natural!'\" Saluga then later launches into the \"You can call me Ray\" routine after Crosby warns not to ask Johnson his name.From 1977 to 1978, Saluga appeared regularly as Raymond J. Johnson Jr. on Redd Foxx's eponymous variety show. Saluga as Johnson also made appearances on This Is Tom Jones, Laugh-In  and The David Steinberg Show. He also made appearances on Chuck Barris' The Gong Show during 1977 and 1978.\nA novelty disco single called \"Dancin' Johnson,\" based around Johnson's schtick, was released in 1978. a 1978 episode of Good Times contained a scene where Keith (while intoxicated) recited \"You can call me Ray, or you can call me J\" which was at the height of its popularity for the saying.\nBob Dylan referenced the \"you may call me\" schtick in his 1979 hit, \"Gotta Serve Somebody,\" when he sings, \"You may call me Terry, you may call me Timmy / You may call me Bobby, you may call me Zimmy / You may call me R.J., you may call me Ray / You may call me anything, but no matter what you say / You’re gonna have to serve somebody.\" The idea for the verse originated from Jerry Wexler, who suggested it during the recording sessions for Slow Train Coming.\nThe character's popularity is referenced in multiple episodes of The Simpsons, with Saluga appearing as himself in the 2002 episode \"The Old Man and the Key\". Saluga also appeared as Johnson in the 2010 King of the Hill episode \"Just Another Manic Kahn-Day\".\n\nDeath and legacy\nSaluga died of cardiopulmonary arrest in Los Angeles on March 28, 2023, at the age of 85. Saluga's nephew, Scott Saluga, told the media that his uncle was living in Burbank, California at the time of his death. Saluga did not have any surviving immediate family members.Saluga told friends he didn't mind being typecast and known to the public as Raymond Johnson. Comedian David Steinberg said that \"Billy was always doing Ray J. He was relentless with it. I would say 'Mr. Johnson' and Billy would be off. He did it everywhere. At parties. His timing and delivery were so funny every time.\"In 2017, Saluga said that people never recognized him outside his character and that it gave him great pleasure hearing people perform his shtick in his presence without knowing who he was.\n\nBibliography\nSaluga, Bill (1982).

His works include La Garçonne (1936) and The Letter (1929). A French army officer and a designer, he first came to the United States with his parents, Count and Countess de Limur in September 1920; their destination was Burlingame, California, where lived Jean's brother André (who married Ethel, daughter of William Henry Crocker).\n\nFilmography\nThe Arab (1924) actor\nHuman Desires (1924)\nThe Legion of the Condemned (1928) co-screenplay\nThe Letter (1929) director\nJealousy (1929) director\nMy Childish Father (1930)\nPaprika (1933) director\nL'Auberge du Petit-Dragon (1935)\nLa Garçonne (1936) director; with Arletty, Edith Piaf, and Marie Bell\nPassage 2:\nAndréa Ferréol\nAndréa Ferréol (born Andrée Louise Ferréol; January 6, 1947) is a French actress and officer of the Ordre national du Mérite (2009).\nHer debut was in the 1973 film La Grande bouffe, which made a big scandal at the Cannes Film Festival.She was the last partner of Egyptian actor Omar Sharif.\n\nFilmography\nPassage 3:\nBrian Kennedy (gallery director)\nBrian Patrick Kennedy (born 5 November 1961) is an Irish-born art museum director who has worked in Ireland and Australia, and now lives and works in the United States.  He was the director of the Peabody Essex Museum in Salem for 17 months, resigning December 31, 2020. He was the director of the Toledo Museum of Art in Ohio from 2010 to 2019. He was the director of the Hood Museum of Art from 2005 to 2010, and the National Gallery of Australia (Canberra) from 1997 to 2004.\n\nCareer\nBrian Kennedy currently lives and works in the United States after leaving Australia in 2005 to direct the Hood Museum of Art at Dartmouth College. In October 2010 he became the ninth Director of the Toledo Museum of Art. On 1 July 2019, he succeeded Dan Monroe as the executive director and CEO of the Peabody Essex Museum.\n\nEarly life and career in Ireland\nKennedy was born in Dublin and attended Clonkeen College. He received B.A. (1982), M.A. (1985) and PhD (1989) degrees from University College-Dublin, where he studied both art history and history.\nHe worked in the Irish Department of Education (1982), the European Commission, Brussels (1983), and in Ireland at the Chester Beatty Library (1983–85), Government Publications Office (1985–86), and Department of Finance (1986–89). He married Mary Fiona Carlin in 1988.He was Assistant Director at the National Gallery of Ireland in Dublin from 1989 to 1997. He was Chair of the Irish Association of Art Historians from 1996 to 1997, and of the Council of Australian Art Museum Directors from 2001 to 2003. In September 1997 he became Director of the National Gallery of Australia.\n\nNational Gallery of Australia (NGA)\nKennedy expanded the traveling exhibitions and loans program throughout Australia, arranged for several major shows of Australian art abroad, increased the number of exhibitions at the museum itself and oversaw the development of an extensive multi-media site.  Although he oversaw several years of the museum's highest ever annual visitation, he discontinued the emphasis of his predecessor, Betty Churcher, on showing \"blockbuster\" exhibitions.\nDuring his directorship, the NGA gained government support for improving the building and significant private donations and corporate sponsorship. However, the initial design for the building proved controversial generating a public dispute with the original architect on moral rights grounds.  As a result, the project was not delivered during Dr Kennedy's tenure, with a significantly altered design completed some years later.  Private funding supported two acquisitions of British art, including David Hockney's A Bigger Grand Canyon in 1999, and Lucian Freud's After Cézanne in 2001. Kennedy built on the established collections at the museum by acquiring the Holmgren-Spertus collection of Indonesian textiles; the Kenneth Tyler collection of editioned prints, screens, multiples and unique proofs; and the Australian Print Workshop Archive. He was also notable for campaigning for the construction of a new \"front\" entrance to the Gallery, facing King Edward Terrace, which was completed in 2010 (see reference to the building project above).\nKennedy's cancellation of the \"Sensation exhibition\" (scheduled at the NGA from 2 June 2000 to 13 August 2000) was controversial, and seen by some as censorship. He claimed that the decision was due to the exhibition being \"too close to the market\" implying that a national cultural institution cannot exhibit the private collection of a speculative art investor. However, there were other exhibitions at the NGA during his tenure, which could have raised similar concerns. The exhibition featured the privately owned Young British Artists works belonging to Charles Saatchi and attracted large attendances in London and Brooklyn. Its most controversial work was Chris Ofili's The Holy Virgin Mary, a painting which used elephant dung and was accused of being blasphemous. The then-mayor of New York, Rudolph Giuliani, campaigned against the exhibition, claiming it was \"Catholic-bashing\" and an \"aggressive, vicious, disgusting attack on religion.\" In November 1999, Kennedy cancelled the exhibition and stated that the events in New York had \"obscured discussion of the artistic merit of the works of art\". He has said that it \"was the toughest decision of my professional life, so far.\"Kennedy was also repeatedly questioned on his management of a range of issues during the Australian Government's Senate Estimates process - particularly on the NGA's occupational health and safety record and concerns about the NGA's twenty-year-old air-conditioning system. The air-conditioning was finally renovated in 2003. Kennedy announced in 2002 that he would not seek extension of his contract beyond 2004, accepting a seven-year term as had his two predecessors.He became a joint Irish-Australian citizen in 2003.\n\nToledo Museum of Art\nThe Toledo Museum of Art is known for its exceptional collections of European and American paintings and sculpture, glass, antiquities, artist books, Japanese prints and netsuke. The museum offers free admission and is recognized for its historical leadership in the field of art education.  During his tenure, Kennedy has focused the museum's art education efforts on visual literacy, which he defines as \"learning to read, understand and write visual language.\"   Initiatives have included baby and toddler tours, specialized training for all staff, docents, volunteers and the launch of a website, www.vislit.org. In November 2014, the museum hosted the International Visual Literacy Association (IVLA) conference, the first Museum to do so. Kennedy has been a frequent speaker on the topic, including 2010 and 2013 TEDx talks on visual and sensory literacy.\nKennedy has expressed an interest in expanding the museum's collection of contemporary art and art by indigenous peoples. Works by Frank Stella, Sean Scully, Jaume Plensa, Ravinder Reddy and Mary Sibande have been acquired.  In addition, the museum has made major acquisitions of Old Master paintings by Frans Hals and Luca Giordano.During his tenure the Toledo Museum of Art has announced the return of several objects from its collection due to claims the objects were stolen and/or illegally exported prior being sold to the museum.  In 2011 a Meissen sweetmeat stand was returned to Germany followed by an Etruscan Kalpis or water jug to Italy (2013), an Indian sculpture of Ganesha (2014) and an astrological compendium to Germany in 2015.\n\nHood Museum of Art\nKennedy became Director of the Hood Museum of Art in July 2005. During his tenure, he implemented a series of large and small-scale exhibitions and oversaw the production of more than 20 publications to bring greater public attention to the museum's remarkable collections of the arts of America, Europe, Africa, Papua New Guinea and the Polar regions. At 70,000 objects, the Hood has one of the largest collections on any American college of university campus. The exhibition, Black Womanhood: Images, Icons, and Ideologies of the African Body, toured several US venues. Kennedy increased campus curricular use of works of art, with thousands of objects pulled from storage for classes annually. Numerous acquisitions were made with the museum's generous endowments, and he curated several exhibitions: including Wenda Gu: Forest of Stone Steles: Retranslation and Rewriting Tang Dynasty Poetry, Sean Scully: The Art of the Stripe, and Frank Stella: Irregular Polygons.\n\nPublications\nKennedy has written or edited a number of books on art, including:\n\nAlfred Chester Beatty and Ireland 1950-1968: A study in cultural politics, Glendale Press (1988), ISBN 978-0-907606-49-9\nDreams and responsibilities: The state and arts in independent Ireland, Arts Council of Ireland (1990), ISBN 978-0-906627-32-7\nJack B Yeats: Jack Butler Yeats, 1871-1957 (Lives of Irish Artists), Unipub (October 1991), ISBN 978-0-948524-24-0\nThe Anatomy Lesson: Art and Medicine (with Davis Coakley), National Gallery of Ireland (January 1992), ISBN 978-0-903162-65-4\nIreland: Art into History (with Raymond Gillespie), Roberts Rinehart Publishers (1994), ISBN 978-1-57098-005-3\nIrish Painting, Roberts Rinehart Publishers (November 1997),  ISBN 978-1-86059-059-7\nSean Scully: The Art of the Stripe, Hood Museum of Art (October 2008), ISBN 978-0-944722-34-3\nFrank Stella: Irregular Polygons, 1965-1966, Hood Museum of Art (October 2010), ISBN 978-0-944722-39-8\n\nHonors and achievements\nKennedy was awarded the Australian Centenary Medal in 2001 for service to Australian Society and its art. He is a trustee and treasurer of the Association of Art Museum Directors, a peer reviewer for the American Association of Museums and a member of the International Association of Art Critics. In 2013 he was appointed inaugural eminent professor at the University of Toledo and received an honorary doctorate from Lourdes University. Most recently, Kennedy received the 2014 Northwest Region, Ohio Art Education Association award for distinguished educator for art education.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nPassage 4:\nDana Blankstein\nDana Blankstein-Cohen (born March 3, 1981) is the executive director of the Sam Spiegel Film and Television School.

He was the director of the Peabody Essex Museum in Salem for 17 months, resigning December 31, 2020. He was the director of the Toledo Museum of Art in Ohio from 2010 to 2019. He was the director of the Hood Museum of Art from 2005 to 2010, and the National Gallery of Australia (Canberra) from 1997 to 2004.\n\nCareer\nBrian Kennedy currently lives and works in the United States after leaving Australia in 2005 to direct the Hood Museum of Art at Dartmouth College. In October 2010 he became the ninth Director of the Toledo Museum of Art. On 1 July 2019, he succeeded Dan Monroe as the executive director and CEO of the Peabody Essex Museum.\n\nEarly life and career in Ireland\nKennedy was born in Dublin and attended Clonkeen College. He received B.A. (1982), M.A. (1985) and PhD (1989) degrees from University College-Dublin, where he studied both art history and history.\nHe worked in the Irish Department of Education (1982), the European Commission, Brussels (1983), and in Ireland at the Chester Beatty Library (1983–85), Government Publications Office (1985–86), and Department of Finance (1986–89). He married Mary Fiona Carlin in 1988.He was Assistant Director at the National Gallery of Ireland in Dublin from 1989 to 1997. He was Chair of the Irish Association of Art Historians from 1996 to 1997, and of the Council of Australian Art Museum Directors from 2001 to 2003. In September 1997 he became Director of the National Gallery of Australia.\n\nNational Gallery of Australia (NGA)\nKennedy expanded the traveling exhibitions and loans program throughout Australia, arranged for several major shows of Australian art abroad, increased the number of exhibitions at the museum itself and oversaw the development of an extensive multi-media site.  Although he oversaw several years of the museum's highest ever annual visitation, he discontinued the emphasis of his predecessor, Betty Churcher, on showing \"blockbuster\" exhibitions.\nDuring his directorship, the NGA gained government support for improving the building and significant private donations and corporate sponsorship. However, the initial design for the building proved controversial generating a public dispute with the original architect on moral rights grounds.  As a result, the project was not delivered during Dr Kennedy's tenure, with a significantly altered design completed some years later.  Private funding supported two acquisitions of British art, including David Hockney's A Bigger Grand Canyon in 1999, and Lucian Freud's After Cézanne in 2001. Kennedy built on the established collections at the museum by acquiring the Holmgren-Spertus collection of Indonesian textiles; the Kenneth Tyler collection of editioned prints, screens, multiples and unique proofs; and the Australian Print Workshop Archive. He was also notable for campaigning for the construction of a new \"front\" entrance to the Gallery, facing King Edward Terrace, which was completed in 2010 (see reference to the building project above).\nKennedy's cancellation of the \"Sensation exhibition\" (scheduled at the NGA from 2 June 2000 to 13 August 2000) was controversial, and seen by some as censorship. He claimed that the decision was due to the exhibition being \"too close to the market\" implying that a national cultural institution cannot exhibit the private collection of a speculative art investor. However, there were other exhibitions at the NGA during his tenure, which could have raised similar concerns. The exhibition featured the privately owned Young British Artists works belonging to Charles Saatchi and attracted large attendances in London and Brooklyn. Its most controversial work was Chris Ofili's The Holy Virgin Mary, a painting which used elephant dung and was accused of being blasphemous. The then-mayor of New York, Rudolph Giuliani, campaigned against the exhibition, claiming it was \"Catholic-bashing\" and an \"aggressive, vicious, disgusting attack on religion.\" In November 1999, Kennedy cancelled the exhibition and stated that the events in New York had \"obscured discussion of the artistic merit of the works of art\". He has said that it \"was the toughest decision of my professional life, so far.\"Kennedy was also repeatedly questioned on his management of a range of issues during the Australian Government's Senate Estimates process - particularly on the NGA's occupational health and safety record and concerns about the NGA's twenty-year-old air-conditioning system. The air-conditioning was finally renovated in 2003. Kennedy announced in 2002 that he would not seek extension of his contract beyond 2004, accepting a seven-year term as had his two predecessors.He became a joint Irish-Australian citizen in 2003.\n\nToledo Museum of Art\nThe Toledo Museum of Art is known for its exceptional collections of European and American paintings and sculpture, glass, antiquities, artist books, Japanese prints and netsuke. The museum offers free admission and is recognized for its historical leadership in the field of art education.  During his tenure, Kennedy has focused the museum's art education efforts on visual literacy, which he defines as \"learning to read, understand and write visual language.\"   Initiatives have included baby and toddler tours, specialized training for all staff, docents, volunteers and the launch of a website, www.vislit.org. In November 2014, the museum hosted the International Visual Literacy Association (IVLA) conference, the first Museum to do so. Kennedy has been a frequent speaker on the topic, including 2010 and 2013 TEDx talks on visual and sensory literacy.\nKennedy has expressed an interest in expanding the museum's collection of contemporary art and art by indigenous peoples. Works by Frank Stella, Sean Scully, Jaume Plensa, Ravinder Reddy and Mary Sibande have been acquired.  In addition, the museum has made major acquisitions of Old Master paintings by Frans Hals and Luca Giordano.During his tenure the Toledo Museum of Art has announced the return of several objects from its collection due to claims the objects were stolen and/or illegally exported prior being sold to the museum.  In 2011 a Meissen sweetmeat stand was returned to Germany followed by an Etruscan Kalpis or water jug to Italy (2013), an Indian sculpture of Ganesha (2014) and an astrological compendium to Germany in 2015.\n\nHood Museum of Art\nKennedy became Director of the Hood Museum of Art in July 2005. During his tenure, he implemented a series of large and small-scale exhibitions and oversaw the production of more than 20 publications to bring greater public attention to the museum's remarkable collections of the arts of America, Europe, Africa, Papua New Guinea and the Polar regions. At 70,000 objects, the Hood has one of the largest collections on any American college of university campus. The exhibition, Black Womanhood: Images, Icons, and Ideologies of the African Body, toured several US venues. Kennedy increased campus curricular use of works of art, with thousands of objects pulled from storage for classes annually. Numerous acquisitions were made with the museum's generous endowments, and he curated several exhibitions: including Wenda Gu: Forest of Stone Steles: Retranslation and Rewriting Tang Dynasty Poetry, Sean Scully: The Art of the Stripe, and Frank Stella: Irregular Polygons.\n\nPublications\nKennedy has written or edited a number of books on art, including:\n\nAlfred Chester Beatty and Ireland 1950-1968: A study in cultural politics, Glendale Press (1988), ISBN 978-0-907606-49-9\nDreams and responsibilities: The state and arts in independent Ireland, Arts Council of Ireland (1990), ISBN 978-0-906627-32-7\nJack B Yeats: Jack Butler Yeats, 1871-1957 (Lives of Irish Artists), Unipub (October 1991), ISBN 978-0-948524-24-0\nThe Anatomy Lesson: Art and Medicine (with Davis Coakley), National Gallery of Ireland (January 1992), ISBN 978-0-903162-65-4\nIreland: Art into History (with Raymond Gillespie), Roberts Rinehart Publishers (1994), ISBN 978-1-57098-005-3\nIrish Painting, Roberts Rinehart Publishers (November 1997),  ISBN 978-1-86059-059-7\nSean Scully: The Art of the Stripe, Hood Museum of Art (October 2008), ISBN 978-0-944722-34-3\nFrank Stella: Irregular Polygons, 1965-1966, Hood Museum of Art (October 2010), ISBN 978-0-944722-39-8\n\nHonors and achievements\nKennedy was awarded the Australian Centenary Medal in 2001 for service to Australian Society and its art. He is a trustee and treasurer of the Association of Art Museum Directors, a peer reviewer for the American Association of Museums and a member of the International Association of Art Critics. In 2013 he was appointed inaugural eminent professor at the University of Toledo and received an honorary doctorate from Lourdes University. Most recently, Kennedy received the 2014 Northwest Region, Ohio Art Education Association award for distinguished educator for art education.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nPassage 7:\nPeter Levin\nPeter Levin is an American director of film, television and theatre.\n\nCareer\nSince 1967, Levin has amassed a large number of credits directing episodic television and television films.

When asked about his favorite films of his formative years Sandler said, \"I fell in love with Jean Luc Godard’s Contempt and Weekend. I was blown away by Agnes Varda’s Cleo from 5 to 7. Michelangelo Antonioni’s films really struck a chord with me as well. After seeing L’Avventura and Blowup, I went online and ordered every film of his I could find. The Passenger’s penultimate shot blew me away. I watched that 7 minute shot over and over. It’s probably my favorite shot in the history of cinema.\"\n\nCritical reception\nAngelica Jade Bastien for Roger Ebert wrote of the film, \"In 'Live Cargo,' director/co-writer Logan Sandler strives to tell a story that finds poetry in the commonplace by shirking narrative conventions.\"Chuck Wilson for The Village Voice wrote, \"The well-acted Live Cargo, which also features Robert Wisdom and Sam Dillon, is at its best when it observes character acting silently against landscape, as when Nadine goes snorkeling and uses a spear gun to jab at sharks, a juxtaposition of natural beauty and human fury typical of Sandler’s poetic approach.” Wilson as well called Sandler \"a filmmaker to watch.\"Katie Walsh in her IndieWire review wrote, ”Anchored by a quartet of equally strong and understated performances, LIVE CARGO proves itself to be a singularly artful film of great emotional heft.”  Walsh gave the film an A - grade.Stephen Saito for The Moveable Fest in his review and interview wrote, \"While there’s intrigue aplenty as anxieties rise higher than the tide, the assured hand of director Logan Sandler, who co-wrote the script with Thymaya Payne, guides 'Live Cargo' admirably as a thriller that may appear immediately as monochrome but shifts quickly into varying degrees of grey.”H. Nelson Tracey of Cinemacy wrote that Sandler's, “Live Cargo is an unforgettable debut and a promise of greater heights to come.”Justin Lowe of the Hollywood Reporter in his review stated, “A pronounced sense of style and place suffuses the entire film, boding well for Sandler’s future projects.”\n\nAwards/Nominations\nPassage 9:\nIan Barry (director)\nIan Barry is an Australian director of film and TV.\n\nSelect credits\nWaiting for Lucas (1973) (short)\nStone (1974) (editor only)\nThe Chain Reaction (1980)\nWhose Baby?

The plot focuses on a formerly obese high school student (Reynolds) who attempts to free himself from the friend zone after reconnecting with his best friend (Smart) whom he is in love with while visiting his hometown for Christmas.\nThe film revolves around humorous observation of strictly platonic relationships as \"just friends\" or \"just as best friends\". It was shot in Regina and Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan. Just Friends was released on November 23, 2005 and grossed over $50 million.\n\nPlot\nIn 1995, Chris Brander, an obese high school senior, is secretly in love with his classmate and best friend Jamie Palamino. Confessing his feelings by writing in her yearbook, he attends their graduation party. As he returns Jamie's yearbook, it is swapped by her ex-boyfriend, Tim, who reads the declaration aloud to everyone, humiliating Chris. After kissing him on the cheek, Jamie admits she does not reciprocate his affections. He leaves the party in tears, announcing he will never return and vowing to be more successful than everyone else.\nTen years later, a womanizing Chris has lost weight and lives in Los Angeles as a highly successful record producer and vice president of the company. Before Christmas, company CEO KC, asks him to accompany emerging, self-obsessed pop singer Samantha James to Paris so she signs with their label, and Chris reluctantly complies. She wants a relationship with him but he has no interest after their only date previously led to his hospitalization. On the way to Paris, Samantha accidentally sets her private jet on fire, causing an emergency landing in New Jersey, near Chris's hometown.\nChris takes Samantha to his mother's for the night and re-engages with his teenage past, including his unresolved feelings for Jamie. She meets his mother and 18-year-old brother Mike, a huge fan of Samantha who is infatuated with her. At the local bar, Chris encounters some old classmates, including his other best friend Clark and his wife Darla.\nHe also sees Jamie, working as a bartender to pay for graduate school for teaching. Chris asks Mike to keep Samantha busy during his date with Jamie, but realizing their platonic friendship is important to him hampers his plan for them to have sex. During a friendly ice skating \"day date\", Chris is taken away in an ambulance after injuring himself during a hockey game with Jamie and a trio of kids (who dislike him). At the scene, Jamie is reunited with Dusty Dinkleman, a paramedic and former high school classmate also in love with her.\nThe next night, Chris goes to Jamie's Christmas party to express his feelings for her, but Dusty is already there, charming everyone on guitar. Back at Chris's, Samantha ambushes Mike, demanding he reveal Chris's location. He refuses until she gives him a kiss. In a rage, she drives to Jamie's, crashing through her fence and destroying the Christmas decorations. Chris returns home in embarrassment, and Jamie follows. She tells him she is not mad and they end up spending the night catching up and reminiscing. However, due to Chris's continuing lack of assertion, they end up just sleeping and nothing happens.\nThe next day, Jamie speaks with Darla about the night before, while Chris goes to Clark for advice. Jamie admits that while they are \"just friends\", she tried to show Chris she is interested in more. Clark tells Chris that \"the timing wasn't right\" and their history hinders him. Outside the office, Chris and Clark catch Dusty singing to a nurse and then kissing her. Dusty reveals his plans to have sex with Jamie and humiliate her in a way he felt she humiliated him in high school when he was attracted to her.\nChris tries to warn Jamie, but instead attacks Dusty in front of her. She refuses to listen when he tries to explain. Consequently, he gets drunk and goes to Jamie's bar, finding her there with Dusty. When she gently declines Dusty's sexual advances, he storms out. Chris and Jamie get into another fight, where he blames her for keeping him in the \"friend zone\" and says she will never amount to anything. Jamie punches Chris and he is tossed out.\nUpon returning to Los Angeles and rejecting Samantha's continued advances when she sees him again, Chris realizes that Jamie is his one and only true love. He returns to New Jersey, declares his love to her and they kiss, while the three kids (from the hockey game earlier) watch in disgust. One of the boys hands the girl a cookie, which she gives to the other. She calls the boy who gave her a cookie her friend, which he replies with \"the bestest\" before realizing he has been put in the friend zone.\n\nCast\nAlanis Morissette, then Reynolds' fiancée, made a cameo appearance as \"herself\" as a former client of his character. This came about when the casting director said \"we need an Alanis Morissette type\" and Reynolds said he knew someone who would fit.

The script is based on the true story of the Battle of Kolwezi that happened in 1978. It was diligently described in a book of the same name by former 1st Foreign Parachute Regiment Captain Pierre Sergent. He published his book in 1979, and the film came out in 1980. Coutard shot the film in a documentary style.\n\nPlot\nThe film is based on true events. In 1978, approximately 3,000 heavily armed fighters from Katanga crossed the border to the Zaire and marched into Kolwezi, a mining centre for copper and cobalt. They took 3,000 civilians as hostages. Within a few days, between 90 and 280 hostages were killed. The rebels appeared to be unpredictable and are reported to have threatened to annihilate all civilians.\nMobutu Sese Seko, Zaire's head of state, urged Belgium, France and the United States to help. France sent the Foreign Legion's 2nd Foreign Parachute Regiment, which were flown from Corsica to Kolwezi. Following their arrival, they secured the perimeter, in co-operation with Belgian soldiers from Zaire, and then started to evacuate the civilians. Within two days more than 2,000 Europeans and about 3,000 African citizens were saved. The film strives to depict the events in a dramatised form, concentrating on the Europeans' plight.\n\nProduction\nThe late Jean Seberg had filmed scenes on location for the film, but her death caused her to be replaced by another French American actress, Mimsy Farmer, who reshot Seberg's scenes.\n\nCast\nBruno Cremer: Pierre Delbart\nJacques Perrin:Ambassador Berthier\nLaurent Malet: Phillipe Denrémont\nPierre Vaneck: Colonel Grasser\nMimsy Farmer: Annie Devrindt\nGiuliano Gemma: Adjudant Fédérico\nRobert Etcheverry : Colonel Dubourg\nJean-Claude Bouillon : Maurois\nPassage 10:\nMidida Hrudayagalu\nMidida Hrudayagalu is a 1993 Indian Kannada-language romantic drama film, directed by A.

{"input": "Who is Domhnall Mac Alasdair's paternal grandfather?", "context": "Passage 1:\nAlasdair Mór\nAlasdair Mór mac Domhnaill was a younger son of Domhnall mac Raghnaill—the eponymous ancestor of Clan Donald. He first appears on record in 1253, when it is recorded as witnessing a charter by his brother, Aonghus Mór, to Paisley Abbey. According to the 19th century Clan Donald historians Angus and Archibald Macdonald, Alasdair Mór must have been a prominent man as he is the only recorded brother of Aonghus Mór. He is recorded in the Annals of Connacht, in the year 1299, as being a man noted for being a \"generous and bounteous man\". In that year he was slain in a conflict with Alasdair of Argyll and the MacDougalls. He is said to have had at least five sons: Dòmhnall, Gòraidh, Donnchadh, Eoin and Eachann. Alasdair Mòr was succeeded in the representation of his clan by Dòmhnall. Today he is considered to be the eponymous ancestor of Clan MacAlister.\nPassage 2:\nKaya Alp\nKaya Alp (Ottoman Turkish: قایا الپ, lit. 'Brave Rock') was, according to Ottoman tradition, the son of Kızıl Buğa or Basuk and the father of Suleyman Shah.

The Freedman Company went on to become one of Montreal’s largest clothing companies.In 1897, Cohen and Samuel William Jacobs founded the Canadian Jewish Times, the first English-language Jewish newspaper in Canada. The newspaper promoted the Canadianization of recent East European Jewish immigrants and encouraged their acceptance of Canadian customs as Cohen felt that the old world customs of immigrant Jews were one of the main causes of anti-Semitism. In 1914, the paper was purchased by Hirsch Wolofsky, owner of the Yiddish-language Keneder Adler, who transformed it into the Canadian Jewish Chronicle.He died on August 17, 1937, at the age of 69.\n\nPhilanthropy\nCohen was elected the first president of the Canadian Jewish Congress in 1919 and organized the Jewish Immigrant Aid Services of Canada.

He was on the side of the English in 1304 under the orders of John de Botetourt, Justiciar of Galloway, Annan, and the valley of the Nith. Domhnall was part of the jury that, on 31 August 1304, undertook an inquiry as to certain privileges claimed by Robert de Brus, Earl of Carrick.

The latter's attestations suggest that he was a contestant to the Clann Domhnaill lordship, and may have possessed the chiefship.\n\nCitations\nPassage 9:\nAbd al-Muttalib\nShayba ibn Hāshim (Arabic: شَيْبَة إبْن هَاشِم; c. 497–578), better known as ʿAbd al-Muṭṭalib, (Arabic: عَبْد ٱلْمُطَّلِب, lit. 'Servant of Muttalib') was the fourth chief of the Quraysh tribal confederation. He was the grandfather of the Islamic prophet Muhammad.\n\nEarly life\nHis father was Hashim ibn 'Abd Manaf,: 81  the progenitor of the distinguished Banu Hashim, a clan of the Quraysh tribe of Mecca. They claimed descent from Ismā'īl and Ibrāhīm. His mother was Salma bint Amr, from the Banu Najjar, a clan of the Khazraj tribe in Yathrib (later called Madinah). Hashim died while doing business in Gaza, before Abd al-Muttalib was born.: 81 His real name was \"Shaiba\" meaning 'the ancient one' or 'white-haired' because of the streak of white through his jet-black hair, and is sometimes also called Shaybah al-Ḥamd (\"The white streak of praise\").: 81–82  After his father's death he was raised in Yathrib with his mother and her family until about the age of eight, when his uncle Muttalib ibn Abd Manaf went to see him and asked his mother Salmah to entrust Shaybah to his care. Salmah was unwilling to let her son go and Shaiba refused to leave his mother without her consent. Muṭṭalib then pointed out that the possibilities Yathrib had to offer were incomparable to Mecca. Salmah was impressed with his arguments, so she agreed to let him go. Upon first arriving in Mecca, the people assumed the unknown child was Muttalib's servant and started calling him 'Abd al-Muttalib (\"servant of Muttalib\").: 85–86\n\nChieftain of Hashim clan\nWhen Muṭṭalib died, Shaiba succeeded him as the chief of the Hāshim clan. Following his uncle Al-Muṭṭalib, he took over the duties of providing the pilgrims with food and water, and carried on the practices of his forefathers with his people. He attained such eminence as none of his forefathers enjoyed; his people loved him and his reputation was great among them.: 61 \n'Umar ibn Al-Khaṭṭāb's grandfather Nufayl ibn Abdul Uzza arbitrated in a dispute between 'Abdul-Muṭṭalib and Ḥarb ibn Umayyah, Abu Sufyan's father, over the custodianship of the Kaaba. Nufayl gave his verdict in favour of 'Abdul-Muṭṭalib. Addressing Ḥarb ibn Umayyah, he said:\nWhy do you pick a quarrel with a person who is taller than you in stature; more imposing than you in appearance; more refined than you in intellect; whose progeny outnumbers yours and whose generosity outshines yours in lustre? Do not, however, construe this into any disparagement of your good qualities which I highly appreciate. You are as gentle as a lamb, you are renowned throughout Arabia for the stentorian tones of your voice, and you are an asset to your tribe.\n\nDiscovery of Zam Zam Well\n'Abdul-Muṭṭalib said that while sleeping in the sacred enclosure, he had dreamed he was ordered to dig at the worship place of the Quraysh between the two deities Isāf and Nā'ila. There he would find the Zamzam Well, which the Jurhum tribe had filled in when they left Mecca. The Quraysh tried to stop him digging in that spot, but his son Al-Ḥārith stood guard until they gave up their protests. After three days of digging, 'Abdul-Muṭṭalib found traces of an ancient religious well and exclaimed, \"Allahuakbar!\" Some of the Quraysh disputed his claim to sole rights over water, then one of them suggested that they go to a female shaman who lived afar. It was said that she could summon jinns and that she could help them decide who was the owner of the well. So, 11 people from the 11 tribes went on the expedition. They had to cross the desert to meet the priestess but then they got lost. There was a lack of food and water and people started to lose hope of ever getting out. One of them suggested that they dig their own graves and if they died, the last person standing would bury the others. So all began digging their own graves and just as Abdul-Muṭṭalib started digging, water spewed out from the hole he dug and everyone became overjoyed. It was then and there decided that Abdul-Muttalib was the owner of the Zam Zam well. Thereafter he supplied pilgrims to the Kaaba with Zam Zam water, which soon eclipsed all the other wells in Mecca because it was considered sacred.: 86–89 : 62–65\n\nThe Year of the Elephant\nAccording to Muslim tradition, the Ethiopian governor of Yemen, Abrahah al-Ashram, envied the Kaaba's reverence among the Arabs and, being a Christian, he built a cathedral on Sana'a and ordered pilgrimage be made there.: 21  The order was ignored and someone desecrated (some saying in the form of defecation: 696 note 35 ) the cathedral. Abrahah decided to avenge this act by demolishing the Kaaba and he advanced with an army towards Mecca.: 22–23 There were thirteen elephants in Abrahah's army: 99 : 26  and the year came to be known as 'Ām al-Fīl (the Year of the Elephant), beginning a trend for reckoning the years in Arabia which was used until 'Umar ibn Al-Khaṭṭāb replaced it with the Islamic Calendar in 638 CE (17 AH), with the first year of the Islamic Calendar being 622 CE.\nWhen news of the advance of Abrahah's army came, the Arab tribes of Quraysh, Kinānah, Khuzā'ah and Hudhayl united in defence of the Kaaba. A man from the Ḥimyar tribe was sent by Abrahah to advise them that he only wished to demolish the Kaaba and if they resisted, they would be crushed. \"Abdul-Muṭṭalib told the Meccans to seek refuge in the nearest high hills while he, with some leading members of Quraysh, remained within the precincts of the Kaaba. Abrahah sent a dispatch inviting 'Abdul-Muṭṭalib to meet him and discuss matters. When 'Abdul-Muṭṭalib left the meeting he was heard saying, \"The Owner of this House is its Defender, and I am sure He will save it from the attack of the adversaries and will not dishonour the servants of His House.\": 24–26 It is recorded that when Abrahah's forces neared the Kaaba, Allah commanded small birds (abābīl) to destroy Abrahah's army, raining down pebbles on it from their beaks. Abrahah was seriously wounded and retreated towards Yemen but died on the way.: 26–27  This event is referred to in the following Qur'anic chapter:\n\nHave you not seen how your Lord dealt with the owners of the Elephant?\nDid He not make their treacherous plan go astray?\n\nAnd He sent against them birds in flocks, striking them with stones of baked clay, so He rendered them like straw eaten up.\nMost Islamic sources place the event around the year that Muhammad was born, 570 CE, though other scholars place it one or two decades earlier. A tradition attributed to Ibn Shihab al-Zuhri in the musannaf of ʽAbd al-Razzaq al-Sanʽani places it before the birth of Muhammad's father.\n\nSacrificing his son Abdullah\nAl-Harith was 'Abdul-Muṭṭalib's only son at the time he dug the Zamzam Well.: 64  When the Quraysh tried to help him in the digging, he vowed that if he were to have ten sons to protect him, he would sacrifice one of them to Allah at the Kaaba. Later, after nine more sons had been born to him, he told them he must keep the vow. The divination arrows fell upon his favourite son Abdullah. The Quraysh protested 'Abdul-Muṭṭalib's intention to sacrifice his son and demanded that he sacrifice something else instead. 'Abdul-Muṭṭalib agreed to consult a \"sorceress with a familiar spirit\". She told him to cast lots between Abdullah and ten camels. If Abdullah were chosen, he had to add ten more camels, and keep on doing the same until his Lord accepted the camels in Abdullah's place. When the number of camels reached 100, the lot fell on the camels. 'Abdul-Muṭṭalib confirmed this by repeating the test three times. Then the camels were sacrificed, and Abdullah was spared.: 66–68\n\nFamily\nWives\nAbd al-Muttalib had six known wives.\n\nSumra bint Jundab of the Hawazin tribe.\nLubnā bint Hājar of the Khuza'a tribe.\nFatima bint Amr of the Makhzum clan of the Quraysh tribe.\nHalah bint Wuhayb of the Zuhrah clan of the Quraysh tribe.\nNatīla bint Janab of the Namir tribe.\nMumanna'a bint Amr of the Khuza'a tribe.\n\nChildren\nAccording to Ibn Hisham, ʿAbd al-Muṭṭalib had ten sons and six daughters.: 707–708 note 97  However, Ibn Sa'd lists twelve sons.: 99–101 By Sumra bint Jundab:\n\nAl-Ḥārith.: 708  He was the firstborn and he died before his father.: 99 \nQuthum.: 100  He is not listed by Ibn Hisham.By Fatima bint Amr:\n\nAl-Zubayr.: 707  He was a poet and a chief; his father made a will in his favour.: 99  He died before Islam, leaving two sons and daughters.: 101 : 34–35 \nAbu Talib, born as Abd Manaf,: 99 : 707  father of the future Caliph Ali.

One day Muhammad's mother, Amina, wanted to go to Yathrib, where her husband, Abdullah, died. So, Muhammad, Amina, Abd al-Muttalib and their caretaker, Umm Ayman started their journey to Medina, which is around 500 kilometres away from Makkah.

Private funding supported two acquisitions of British art, including David Hockney's A Bigger Grand Canyon in 1999, and Lucian Freud's After Cézanne in 2001. Kennedy built on the established collections at the museum by acquiring the Holmgren-Spertus collection of Indonesian textiles; the Kenneth Tyler collection of editioned prints, screens, multiples and unique proofs; and the Australian Print Workshop Archive. He was also notable for campaigning for the construction of a new \"front\" entrance to the Gallery, facing King Edward Terrace, which was completed in 2010 (see reference to the building project above).\nKennedy's cancellation of the \"Sensation exhibition\" (scheduled at the NGA from 2 June 2000 to 13 August 2000) was controversial, and seen by some as censorship. He claimed that the decision was due to the exhibition being \"too close to the market\" implying that a national cultural institution cannot exhibit the private collection of a speculative art investor. However, there were other exhibitions at the NGA during his tenure, which could have raised similar concerns. The exhibition featured the privately owned Young British Artists works belonging to Charles Saatchi and attracted large attendances in London and Brooklyn. Its most controversial work was Chris Ofili's The Holy Virgin Mary, a painting which used elephant dung and was accused of being blasphemous. The then-mayor of New York, Rudolph Giuliani, campaigned against the exhibition, claiming it was \"Catholic-bashing\" and an \"aggressive, vicious, disgusting attack on religion.\" In November 1999, Kennedy cancelled the exhibition and stated that the events in New York had \"obscured discussion of the artistic merit of the works of art\". He has said that it \"was the toughest decision of my professional life, so far.\"Kennedy was also repeatedly questioned on his management of a range of issues during the Australian Government's Senate Estimates process - particularly on the NGA's occupational health and safety record and concerns about the NGA's twenty-year-old air-conditioning system. The air-conditioning was finally renovated in 2003. Kennedy announced in 2002 that he would not seek extension of his contract beyond 2004, accepting a seven-year term as had his two predecessors.He became a joint Irish-Australian citizen in 2003.\n\nToledo Museum of Art\nThe Toledo Museum of Art is known for its exceptional collections of European and American paintings and sculpture, glass, antiquities, artist books, Japanese prints and netsuke. The museum offers free admission and is recognized for its historical leadership in the field of art education.  During his tenure, Kennedy has focused the museum's art education efforts on visual literacy, which he defines as \"learning to read, understand and write visual language.\"   Initiatives have included baby and toddler tours, specialized training for all staff, docents, volunteers and the launch of a website, www.vislit.org. In November 2014, the museum hosted the International Visual Literacy Association (IVLA) conference, the first Museum to do so. Kennedy has been a frequent speaker on the topic, including 2010 and 2013 TEDx talks on visual and sensory literacy.\nKennedy has expressed an interest in expanding the museum's collection of contemporary art and art by indigenous peoples. Works by Frank Stella, Sean Scully, Jaume Plensa, Ravinder Reddy and Mary Sibande have been acquired.  In addition, the museum has made major acquisitions of Old Master paintings by Frans Hals and Luca Giordano.During his tenure the Toledo Museum of Art has announced the return of several objects from its collection due to claims the objects were stolen and/or illegally exported prior being sold to the museum.  In 2011 a Meissen sweetmeat stand was returned to Germany followed by an Etruscan Kalpis or water jug to Italy (2013), an Indian sculpture of Ganesha (2014) and an astrological compendium to Germany in 2015.\n\nHood Museum of Art\nKennedy became Director of the Hood Museum of Art in July 2005. During his tenure, he implemented a series of large and small-scale exhibitions and oversaw the production of more than 20 publications to bring greater public attention to the museum's remarkable collections of the arts of America, Europe, Africa, Papua New Guinea and the Polar regions. At 70,000 objects, the Hood has one of the largest collections on any American college of university campus. The exhibition, Black Womanhood: Images, Icons, and Ideologies of the African Body, toured several US venues. Kennedy increased campus curricular use of works of art, with thousands of objects pulled from storage for classes annually. Numerous acquisitions were made with the museum's generous endowments, and he curated several exhibitions: including Wenda Gu: Forest of Stone Steles: Retranslation and Rewriting Tang Dynasty Poetry, Sean Scully: The Art of the Stripe, and Frank Stella: Irregular Polygons.\n\nPublications\nKennedy has written or edited a number of books on art, including:\n\nAlfred Chester Beatty and Ireland 1950-1968: A study in cultural politics, Glendale Press (1988), ISBN 978-0-907606-49-9\nDreams and responsibilities: The state and arts in independent Ireland, Arts Council of Ireland (1990), ISBN 978-0-906627-32-7\nJack B Yeats: Jack Butler Yeats, 1871-1957 (Lives of Irish Artists), Unipub (October 1991), ISBN 978-0-948524-24-0\nThe Anatomy Lesson: Art and Medicine (with Davis Coakley), National Gallery of Ireland (January 1992), ISBN 978-0-903162-65-4\nIreland: Art into History (with Raymond Gillespie), Roberts Rinehart Publishers (1994), ISBN 978-1-57098-005-3\nIrish Painting, Roberts Rinehart Publishers (November 1997),  ISBN 978-1-86059-059-7\nSean Scully: The Art of the Stripe, Hood Museum of Art (October 2008), ISBN 978-0-944722-34-3\nFrank Stella: Irregular Polygons, 1965-1966, Hood Museum of Art (October 2010), ISBN 978-0-944722-39-8\n\nHonors and achievements\nKennedy was awarded the Australian Centenary Medal in 2001 for service to Australian Society and its art. He is a trustee and treasurer of the Association of Art Museum Directors, a peer reviewer for the American Association of Museums and a member of the International Association of Art Critics. In 2013 he was appointed inaugural eminent professor at the University of Toledo and received an honorary doctorate from Lourdes University. Most recently, Kennedy received the 2014 Northwest Region, Ohio Art Education Association award for distinguished educator for art education.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nPassage 7:\nIan Barry (director)\nIan Barry is an Australian director of film and TV.\n\nSelect credits\nWaiting for Lucas (1973) (short)\nStone (1974) (editor only)\nThe Chain Reaction (1980)\nWhose Baby?

She is a film director, and an Israeli culture entrepreneur.\n\nBiography\nDana Blankstein was born in Switzerland in 1981 to theatre director Dedi Baron and Professor Alexander Blankstein. She moved to Israel in 1983 and grew up in Tel Aviv.\nBlankstein graduated from the Sam Spiegel Film and Television School, Jerusalem in 2008 with high honors.

Prior to his current position, Govan worked as the director of the Dia Art Foundation in New York City.\n\nEarly life and education\nGovan was born in 1963 in North Adams, Massachusetts, and was raised in the Washington D.C. area, attending Sidwell Friends School.He majored in art history and fine arts at Williams College, where he met Thomas Krens, who was then director of the Williams College Museum of Art. Govan became closely involved with the museum, serving as acting curator as an undergraduate. After receiving his B.A. from Williams in 1985, Govan began an MFA in fine arts from the University of California, San Diego.\n\nCareer\nAs a twenty-five year old graduate student, Govan was recruited by his former mentor at Williams, Thomas Krens, who in 1988 had been appointed director of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation. Govan served as deputy director of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum under Krens from 1988 to 1994, a period that culminated in the construction and opening of the Frank Gehry designed Guggenheim branch in Bilbao, Spain. Govan supervised the reinstallation of the museum's permanent collection galleries after its extensive renovation.\n\nDia Art Foundation\nFrom 1994 to 2006, Govan was president and director of Dia Art Foundation in New York City. There, he spearheaded the conversion of a Nabisco box factory into the 300,000 square foot Dia:Beacon in New York's Hudson Valley, which houses Dia's collection of art from the 1960s to the present. Built in a former Nabisco box factory, the critically acclaimed museum has been credited with catalyzing a cultural and economic revival within the formerly factory-based city of Beacon. Dia's collection nearly doubled in size during Govan's tenure, but he also came under criticism for \"needlessly and permanently\" closing Dia's West 22nd Street building. During his time at Dia, Govan also worked closely with artists James Turrell and Michael Heizer, becoming an ardent supporter of Roden Crater and City, the artists' respective site-specific land art projects under construction in the American southwest. Govan successfully lobbied Washington to have the 704,000 acres in central Nevada surrounding City declared a national monument in 2015.\n\nLACMA\nIn February 2006, a search committee composed of eleven LACMA trustees, led by the late Nancy M. Daly, recruited Govan to run the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. Govan has stated that he was drawn to the role not only because of LACMA's geographical distance from its European and east coast peers, but also because of the museum's relative youth, having been established in 1961. \"I felt that because of this newness I had the opportunity to reconsider the museum,\" Govan has written, \"[and] Los Angeles is a good place to do that.\"Govan has been widely regarded for transforming LACMA into both a local and international landmark. Since Govan's arrival, LACMA has acquired by donation or purchase over 27,000 works for the permanent collection, and the museum's gallery space has almost doubled thanks to the addition of two new buildings designed by Renzo Piano, the Broad Contemporary Art Museum (BCAM) and the Lynda and Stewart Resnick Pavilion. LACMA's annual attendance has grown from 600,000 to nearly 1.6 million in 2016.\n\nArtist collaborations\nSince his arrival, Govan has commissioned exhibition scenography and gallery designs in collaboration with artists. In 2006, for example, Govan invited LA artist John Baldessari to design an upcoming exhibition about the Belgian surrealist René Magritte, resulting in a theatrical show that reflected the twisted perspective of the latter's topsy-turvy world. Baldessari has also designed LACMA's logo. Since then, Govan has also commissioned Cuban-American artist Jorge Pardo to design LACMA's Art of the Ancient Americas gallery, described in the Los Angeles Times as a \"gritty cavern deep inside the earth ... crossed with a high-style urban lounge.\"Govan has also commissioned several large-scale public artworks for LACMA's campus from contemporary California artists. These include Chris Burden's Urban Light (2008), a series of 202 vintage street lamps from different neighborhoods in Los Angeles, arranged in front of the entrance pavilion, Barbara Kruger's Untitled (Shafted) (2008), Robert Irwin's Primal Palm Garden (2010), and Michael Heizer's Levitated Mass, a 340-ton boulder transported 100 miles from the Jurupa Valley to LACMA, a widely publicized journey that culminated with a large celebration on Wilshire Boulevard. Thanks in part to the popularity of these public artworks, LACMA was ranked the fourth most instagrammed museum in the world in 2016.In his first three full years, the museum raised $251 million—about $100 million more than it collected during the three years before he arrived. In 2010, it was announced that Govan will steer LACMA for at least six more years. In a letter dated February 24, 2013, Govan, along with the LACMA board's co-chairmen Terry Semel and Andrew Gordon, proposed a merger with the financially troubled Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles and a plan to raise $100 million for the combined museum.\n\nZumthor Project\nGovan's latest project is an ambitious building project, the replacement of four of the campus's aging buildings with a single new state of the art gallery building designed by architect Peter Zumthor. As of January 2017, he has raised about $300 million in commitments. Construction is expected to begin in 2018, and the new building will open in 2023, to coincide with the opening of the new D Line metro stop on Wilshire Boulevard. The project also envisages dissolving all existing curatorial departments and departmental collections. Some commentators have been highly critical of Govan's plans. Joseph Giovannini, recalling Govan's technically unrealizable onetime plan to hang Jeff Koons' Train sculpture from the facade of the Ahmanson Gallery, has accused Govan of \"driving the institution over a cliff into an equivalent mid-air wreck of its own\". Describing the collection merging proposal as the creation of a \"giant raffle bowl of some 130,000 objects\", Giovannini also points out that the Zumthor building will contain 33% less gallery space than the galleries it will replace, and that the linear footage of wall space available for displays will decrease by about 7,500 ft, or 1.5 miles. Faced with losing a building named in its honor, and anticipating that its acquisitions could no longer be displayed, the Ahmanson Foundation withdrew its support.\nOn the merging of the separate curatorial divisions to create a non-departmental art museum, Christopher Knight has pointed out that \"no other museum of LACMA's size and complexity does it\" that way, and characterized the museum's 2019 \"To Rome and Back\" exhibition, the first to take place under the new scheme, as \"bland and ineffectual\" and an \"unsuccessful sample of what's to come\".\n\nPersonal life\nGovan is married and has two daughters, one from a previous marriage. He and his family used to live in a $6 million mansion in Hancock Park that was provided by LACMA - a benefit worth $155,000 a year, according to most recent tax filings - until LACMA decided that it would sell the property to make up for the museum's of almost $900 million in debt [2]. That home is now worth nearly $8 million and Govan now lives in a trailer park in Malibu's Point Dume region.\nLos Angeles CA 90020\nUnited States. He has had a private pilot's license since 1995 and keeps a 1979 Beechcraft Bonanza at Santa Monica Airport.\nPassage 9:\nTomris Giritlioğlu\nTomris Giritlioğlu (born 1957) is a Turkish film director and producer.

She was educated as a Quaker at Ackworth School in Yorkshire. The family resided in Edinburgh, later moving to Aberdeen. As Quakers, Smeal's family were unusual in Scotland. The 1851 census shows that there were fewer than 400 active Scottish Quakers at the time.Smeal became the leader and secretary of the radical Glasgow Ladies Emancipation Society. Her brother William in 1822 founded the Glasgow Anti-Slavery Society, a forerunner of the Glasgow Emancipation Society, and was later active in the latter. Smeal had a record of anti-slavery activity, long before the Free Church became involved in the issue.\nIn 1838 she published an important pamphlet with Elizabeth Pease of Darlington titled Address to the Women of Great Britain. This document called for British women to speak in public and to form anti-slavery organisations for women. An address that Smeal prepared for Queen Victoria has been credited with being the \"final blow\" that ended slavery in the Caribbean.In 1840 Smeal became the second wife of the Quaker John Wigham, who was a tea merchant and active abolitionist in Glasgow. In 1830, Wigham's wife and two of their children died however the family was revitalized when he married Smeal. Jane Smeal became Jane Wigham and she formed a close friendship and collaboration with her stepdaughter, Eliza Wigham. Smeal and Wigham's marriage took place in the same year as the World's Anti-Slavery Convention in London, where Eliza was one of the delegates.After the Ladies' Emancipation Society ceased activity, Jane and Eliza, along with some of their friends, set up the Edinburgh chapter of the National Society of Women's Suffrage. Priscilla Bright McLaren, the president, Elizabeth Pease, the treasurer, and McLaren's daughter Agnes McLaren joined Eliza as joint secretaries. Despite a lack of support from her husband John, Jane and her stepdaughter established the Edinburgh society as one of the leading British groups supporting the controversial views of the American abolitionist and social reformer William Lloyd Garrison.John Wigham died in 1864 and Eliza remained on at the family home on South Gray Street in Edinburgh to care for her stepmother. Jane died in November 1888 after a prolonged illness.\n\nLegacy\nFour of the women associated with Edinburgh in the 19th century were the subject of a campaign by Edinburgh historians in 2015. The group aimed to gain recognition for Elizabeth Pease Nichol, Priscilla Bright McLaren, Eliza Wigham, and Jane Smeal – the city's \"forgotten heroines\".\nPassage 2:\nAngelo I Gozzadini\nAngelo I Gozzadini (died between 1468 and 1476) was Lord of Kythnos.\nHe married in 1429 Caterina Crispo (born 1415, date of death unknown), daughter of Nicholas Crispo, Lord of Syros and sister of Francesco II, sixteenth Duke of the Archipelago.\nPassage 3:\nMay Green Hinckley\nMay Green Hinckley (May 1, 1881 – May 2, 1943) was the third Primary general president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) from 1940 until her death. She was the stepmother of Gordon B. Hinckley, fifteenth president of the LDS Church.\n\nBiography\nGreen was born in Brampton, Derbyshire, England. Her mother had joined the LDS Church three years before Green's birth, but her father never joined. She emigrated to the United States with her mother and some of her siblings in 1889. Green was baptized into the LDS Church in 1891, and was by then living in Salt Lake City.Green was raised in the church's Salt Lake 5th Ward. Early on she was a teacher in both the Sunday School and the Young Women Mutual Improvement Association (YWMIA). She served as a missionary for the church in the Central States Mission from 1907 to 1909.\nAfter studying booking and accounting, Green began work as business manager for a Salt Lake medical clinic.In 1920, Green was made president of the YLMIA of the Granite Stake in Salt Lake City. She served in this position for the next 12 years, and oversaw the initial establishment of the Gleaner program.In 1932, at the age of 50, Green married Bryant S. Hinckley, whose wife, Ada, had died in 1930. At the time, five of Hinckley's 13 children were still living at home. At that time, Green was president of the stake YWMIA. One of the children, Gordon B. Hinckley, later recalled that he and the other children were upset by their father's decision to remarry, but they eventually came to accept their stepmother: \"I don't know that it was easy for her to step into our family, but she did it well. We all respected her. We all loved her\". In 1935, when Bryant Hinckley became president of the Northern States Mission based in Chicago, May Hinckley went with him and presided over the Primary Association, YWMIA, and Relief Society within the mission.\nIn 1940, May Hinckley was asked by church president Heber J. Grant to succeed May Anderson and become the third general president of the church's Primary Association. In her 3+1⁄2-year tenure, Hinckley introduced a revised curriculum, added a scripture-reading program for leaders and teachers, established a formal scriptural theme for Primary, and selected the official Primary logo, motto and colors.\nHinckley formed a committee that created lessons for use by Primaries in missions (as opposed to stakes). With energy rationing as a result of World War II, she oversaw the creation of more home-based Primary programs.Hinckley was the editor of The Children's Friend while she was the Primary General President. Her term ended when she unexpectedly died of pneumonia in Salt Lake City, Utah, the day after her 62nd birthday. She was succeeded by Adele C. Howells, her first counselor.\n\nSee also\nLaVern W.

He was Lord of Milos, thus a vassal to the Duke of Naxos, as well as his cousin through his marriage to Fiorenza Sanudo, a grand-daughter of the Duke Guglielmo Sanudo. Crispo might also have been a pirate. He was sent by the Republic of Venice to Naxos in March 1383 for concern that the then Duke Niccolò III dalle Carceri was incompetent. The Republic suffered from predation by the Ottoman Empire in the Aegean.On the island, a hunt was suggested. Officially, on the way back Niccolo III, escorted by Crispo's men was attacked by rebels or thieves. He fell off his horse and died. To quench any revolt, Francesco Crispo had to assume power.The Republic of Venice quickly sent its congratulations.Andros was another problem. It belonged to Maria Sanudo, sister of the late duke. When Francesco gave as a dowry Andros and Syros to his own daughter Pétronilla, Maria Sanudo called for justice in Venice.With his wife he had eight children:\n\nGiacomo I Crispo\nPetronilla Crispo (1384–1427), married to Pietro Zeno, together they received Andros and Syros as dowry\nAgnese Crispo (1386–1428), married to Dragonetto Clavelli, Lord of Nisyros\nJohn II Crispo\nWilliam II Crispo\nNicholas Crispo, Lord of Syros\nMarco I Crispo, Lord of Ios\nNobil Huomo Pietro Crispo, Patrizio Veneto (1397–1440), married to NN and had issue:\nGiovanni Crispo (died 1475), Knight of the Knights Hospitaller\nPassage 5:\nDorothy Granger\nDorothy Karolyn Granger (November 21, 1911 – January 4, 1995) was an American actress best known for her roles in short subject comedies in Hollywood.\n\nCareer\nGranger, with her parents, two brothers, Richard and James, and their grandmother, Clara (née Wilcox) Granger, moved to Los Angeles during the late 1920s.\nGranger got her start in the entertainment industry when she won a beauty contest at the age of 13 at Silver Beach Summer Resort near Houston. Her budding figure and confident stage presence were perfect for studios that made comedy shorts. In 1930, her father took her to producer Hal Roach, who was then testing talent for his upcoming comedy series, The Boy Friends. \nGranger’s natural comedy timing got her the job immediately and she was placed under contract to Hal Roach Studios. She became a charter member of the two-reel-comedy community, appearing opposite many major comedians at Roach, Mack Sennett, Educational Pictures, Columbia Pictures, and RKO Radio Pictures. Among her famous credits are Hog Wild with Laurel & Hardy, The Dentist with W.C. Fields, Punch Drunks and Termites of 1938 with The Three Stooges. Granger also appeared with Andy Clyde, Charley Chase, Edgar Kennedy, Harry Langdon, Gus Schilling & Richard Lane, and Joe DeRita, as well as on live television with Abbott & Costello. Granger is best remembered as the sarcastic, suspicious wife in Leon Errol's series of two-reelers for RKO.\nFor her body of work in two-reelers, Granger was known as the \"Queen of the Short Subject Films\". However, she also appeared in about 100 feature films, including Frisco Jenny, Sunset in El Dorado, Kentucky Kernels, Dick Tracy vs. Cueball, Diamond Jim, and Show Boat.\n\nLater years\nGranger worked on a variety of television shows through the 1950s, including The Abbott and Costello Show, I Married Joan, Father Knows Best, Topper, Lassie, Death Valley Days and Wells Fargo. Her last television performance was a live show on Face The Facts in 1961. Granger left show business in 1963, calling it an “ulcer factory.”\nGranger made her last public appearance in 1993 for the Screen Actors Guild’s 60th anniversary celebration. She was an honored guest at the celebration because she was one of SAG’s first members. In later years she helped her husband run an upholstery shop in Los Angeles.\nShe was the stepmother of film maker and former record producer Anthony J. Hilder.\n\nDeath\nGranger died of cancer on January 4, 1995, aged 83, in Los Angeles, California.\n\nSelected filmography\nPassage 6:\nAnthony Crispo, Lord of Syros\nAnthony Crispo (or Antonio;  - 1494), became Lord of Syros in 1463 after his older brother Francesco's death. He was the youngest son of Nicholas Crispo, Lord of Syros and Princess Eudokia Valenza Komnene, daughter of Emperor Alexios IV Komnenos of the Trebizond, and brother of Francesco II, sixteenth Duke of the Archipelago.\nHe married ... de Paterno, without issue.\nPassage 7:\nHenriette Feuerbach\nHenriette Feuerbach (13 August 1812 – 5 August 1892) was a German author and arts patron. She was the wife of Joseph Anselm Feuerbach and the stepmother of painter Anselm Feuerbach, whom she supported in his art.\n\nLife\nBorn Henriette Heydenreich in Ermetzhofen, she was the third child and only daughter of the pastor Johann Alexander Heydenreich (1754–1814) and his wife Friederika Christine née Freudel. Her brothers were Friedrich Wilhelm Heidenreich, to become a physician, and Christian Heydenreich (1800–1865), a future judge. They grew up in Ansbach and were educated in Latin, Greek and music.She married on 13 April 1834 the widower Josef Anselm Feuerbach, whose first wife was Amalie Keerl (1805–1830). She lived with him and his two children, Emilie (1827–1873) and Anselm (1829–1880), first in Freiburg im Breisgau, later in Heidelberg. She gave piano lessons, directed a choir, and organised house concerts. Clara Schumann and Johannes Brahms were among those who frequented her salon. Brahms and Henriette held each other in high esteem; in one of Brahms' letters, he referred to her and Anselm as \"this splendid woman and her illustrious son\". After Anselm's death, Brahms composed Nänie (1881) in his memory and included a dedication to Henriette.She invested most of her energies into supporting her stepson's efforts to establish himself as an artist and, after his death in 1880, to perpetuate his legacy. After he died, she reportedly destroyed all his personal letters and published a collection of his writings \"which show him purely as an artist, as a genius wrestling with himself, his work and ignorant patrons\", in an effort to build a legacy for him. This indeed furthered his renown for the next few decades.She died in Freiburg, eight days short of her 80th birthday.\n\nWriting\nIn 1839, she published anonymously Gedanken über die Liebenswürdigkeit von Frauen, subtitled as Kleiner Beitrag zur weiblichen Charakteristik (A little contribution to the characteristics of women). In 1845, she published Sonntagsmuße (Sunday Rest), announced as a book for women.

In 1866, she published Uz und Cronegk, the portraits of two Franconian poets of the 18th century. She also published reviews in newspapers and magazines.Her letters, edited by Hermann Uhde-Bernays, document over a period of 50 years her influence on the education and development of Anselm Feuerbach. She published in 1882 a book Ein Vermächtnis – Anselm Feuerbach (A Legacy), to promote his recognition after his death in 1880.

He was a son of Francesco I Crispo, tenth Duke of the Archipelago, and wife Fiorenza I Sanudo, Lady of Milos, and brother of Dukes Giacomo I, John II and William II.\n\nMarriage and issue\nIt is not known for certain how many wives he had. In a letter dated 1426 Crispo says he was married to the daughter of Jacopo Gattilusio, lord of Lesbos. In a 1474 chronicle by the Venetian traveller Caterino Zeno it is said that he was married to an Eudoksia Valenza, of whom there is no other mention in any source. Although Zeno claims that she was a daughter of John IV of Trebizond, this has been disproved by historiographical research, which has shown that John had an only daughter, Theodora Despina (married to Uzun Hassan of Ak Koyunlu). Alternative identities have been proposed for Valenza: whether it was the name of Gattilusio's daughter, whether she was a daughter of Alexios IV of Trebizond or whether she was a Genoese woman.\n\nCaterina Crispo, married in 1429 Angelo I Gozzadini, Lord of Kythnos (- 1468/76)\nLucrezia Crispo, married Nobil Huomo Leone Malipiero, Patrizio Veneto\nFrancesco II Crispo\nPetronilla Crispo, married in 1437 Nobil Huomo Jacopo Priuli, Patrizio Veneto\nMaria Crispo, married Nobil Huomo Nicolo Balbi, Patrizio Veneto\nFiorenza Crispo (–1501), married in 1444 Nobil Huomo Marco Cornaro, Cavaliere del Sacro Romano Impero, Patrizio Veneto (Venice, December 1406 – Venice, 1 August 1479), and had:\nGiorgio Cornaro\nCatherine Cornaro\nValenza Crispo, married Nobil Huomo Giovanni Loredan, Patrizio Veneto\nMarco Crispo, Knight of the Knights Hospitaller, who had illegitimate issue\nViolante Crispo, married Nobil Huomo Caterino Zeno, Patrizio Veneto, Diplomat of the Venetian Republic, and had:\nAdriana Zeno\nPietro Zeno\nA daughter\nAnthony Crispo, Lord of Syros\nPassage 9:\nIrene Baker\nEdith Irene Bailey Baker (November 17, 1901 – April 2, 1994) was an American politician and a United States Representative from Tennessee.

They had two children:\n\nArnold I, Count of Chiny\nManasses (died 1068), a monk at the Church of St. Hubert.Legend has it that Louis held hunting parties in his huge game park.  Here, Thibault of Champagne established a hermitage and found a source of holy springs, and Louis built a shrine to the spring's healing powers. The shrine became famous, with many pilgrims who came to implore the grace of Saint-Thibault. Later, monks from Calabria, Italy, founded a monastery nearby at Orval at the invitation of Louis’ son Arnold.\nUpon Louis' death, his son Arnold became Count of Chiny.\nPassage 7:\nArnold VI of Rummen, Count of Loon\nArnold VI de Rumigny (died May 1373), Count of Looz and Count of Chiny (as Arnold IV) (1362–1364), son of William of Oreye, Lord of Rumigny (by donation of Louis IV, Count of Looz in 1331), and Jeanne de Looz, daughter of Arnold V, Count of Loon and Chiny, and, Marguerite Vianden, Lady of Perwez and Grimbergen.\nIn 1336, at the death of his uncle, Louis IV, Count of Loon and Chiny, Arnold laid claim to the estates, but without success.  Instead, the estates passed to another nephew, Thierry de Heinsberg. Finally, on January 25, 1362, he bought the rights to the counties from his cousin Godfrey, Count of Looz and Chiny.  Looz, however, was still occupied by the troops of Engelbert III of the Marck, Prince-Bishop of Liege.\nOn December 25, Arnold approached the Emperor Charles IV for his help in financing the reconquest of Looz, but he failed in that endeavor.  Without options, he sold the counties to  Wenceslaus, Duke of Luxembourg, on June 16, 1364. On September 23, 1366, he entered into a transaction with John of Arkel, Prince-Bishop of Liège, receiving some financial compensation for the occupation of the counties\nIn 1346, Arnold married Elizabeth of Flanders, illegitimate daughter of Louis of Flanders, Count of Nevers.  No children are recorded.\n\nSources\nArlette Laret-Kayser, Entre Bar et Luxembourg : Le Comté de Chiny des Origines à 1300, Bruxelles (éditions du Crédit Communal, Collection Histoire, série in-8°, n° 72), 1986\nPassage 8:\nArnold I, Count of Chiny\nArnold I (died 16 April 1106), Count of Chiny, son of Louis II, Count of Chiny, and his wife Sophie. He succeeded his father as count before 1066.\nArnold is best known for his many clashes with the authorities.  The only known positive action of his was the founding of the Abbey of Orval with Conrad I, Count of Luxembourg. In addition he began other religious institutions, apparently as atonement for his many crimes. He had many run-ins with the clergy, particularly with Henry, Bishop of Liège, a relative of Godfrey the Bearded, no doubt due to the murder of his grandfather by Godfrey’s father. There were also issues with Henry's successor Otbert.\nA convenient story is that Arnold regularly confronted Godfrey’s grandson Count Godfrey of Bouillon, a leader of the First Crusade and nephew of Countess Mathilda of Tuscany, but that they eventually became friends. Because of this newly-found friendship, he allegedly entrusted Godfrey with his sons Otto and Louis to take part in the crusade. The reality is that this is likely a story concocted by Count Louis V, much like the rest of his version of the history of Chiny (see the discussion in the Counts of Chiny), to enhance his standing at the Tournament of Chauvency in 1285, which included such royalty as Rudolf I, King of Germany.\nIt is clear that Otto and Louis never actually joined the crusade, as their names are not listed among the participants in the Holy quest. The reality of the situation appears that Godfrey's army included relatively few of the major nobles of the duchy, especially those of comital rank. The nobles of Lower Lotharingia were not all vassals of the Duke (and later Defender of the Holy Sepulchre) and felt no obligation to follow him, despite the seriousness of the taking of the cross. Notable absentees were Arnold, Albert III of Namur and Henry of Arlon and Limburg. These were all part of the coalition that had waged war on Godfrey and his principal allies Henry of Verdun and his successor Otbert, Prince-Bishops of Liège. There is some uncertainty as to his sons' whereabouts during the crusade, but upon their return, Otto, who became the next Count of Chiny, found Orval falling in ruins. The Calabrian monks left in 1108, and the Cistercians revived Orval with Otto's help.\nApparently unable to abide by normal legal traditions, Arnold attempted to capture Richilde, Countess of Hainaut, widow of Baldwin VI the Good, Count of Flanders, and her son Baldwin II, Count of Hainaut. Like most of his ventures, he failed in this. In 1082, Richilde and her son went on a pilgrimage to Rome, but on her return in 1084, she learned as she approached Chiny that Arnold was planning to kidnap her. She escaped by taking refuge in Benedictine Abbey of Amdain, in the present-day Saint Hubert.\nHe married Adélaïs (Adelaide), daughter of Hilduin IV, Count of Montdidier, Roucy and Ramerupt, and Alix de Roucy.  They had six children:\n\nOtto II, Count of Chiny\nLouis, founder of the priory of Saint-Valpurge at Chiny\nHalide (Hadvide, Hadwida), married to Dodo of Cons (Dudo of Konz-Saarburg), who took the cross and became a Crusader in the army of Godfrey of Bouillon in 1096. He was one of two sons of Adelon de Cons.\nClemence, married to Hugel de Waha, Châtelain de Mirwart, who was son of Hériman de Duras, who in turn was son of Otto I, Count of Duras, and grandson to Giselbert I, Count of Duras.\nBeatrix, mother of Arnulf, Archdeacon of Trier.\nUnnamed daughter, mother to Arnoul and Conon.\nArnold's second wife was Ermengarde (d. 1081), a union for which no children are recorded.

Joan was the daughter of Louis IV, Count of Chiny, and Matilda of Avesnes, and became ruler of the county upon her father’s death on 7 October 1226. She married Arnold IV, Count of Loon, son of Gerard III, Count of Rieneck, and Kunigunde von Zimmern, in 1228, whereupon he assumed the role of Count of Chiny.\nJoan and Arnold had the following children:\n\nJohn I, Count of Chiny and Loon\nArnaul II (died 1273), Bishop of Châlons (1272–73)\nHenry, Seigneur d’Agimont\nGerard (died after April 1284), Seigneur de Chauvency le-Château, married Marguerite de Meurs\nElisabeth (died before 1251), married Thomas III of Coucy, Seigneur of Vervins, and Albert, Seigneur of Voorne\nAdelaide (died after 1268), married to Thierry II, Seigneur of Valkenburg\nJuliana, married to Nicolas, Seigneur of Quiévrain\nLouis V, Count of Chiny\nMargaret (died 1292)?, married William IV, Lord of HornShe was succeeded as ruler of Chiny by her husband, Arnold II, Count of Chiny.\nPassage 10:\nLouis III, Count of Chiny\nLouis III (d.

He entered the Third Crusade alongside Emperor Frederick I Barbarossa, dying in transit in Belgrade.\nHe married Sophie (d. 1207), whose family is unknown.

The final budget was about $60,000.\n\nReception\nThe film was generally well-received by critics, although having 2 heterosexual actors play romantic leads in an LGBTQ+ film was noted in reviews.\n\nAwards\nPassage 2:\nMichael Govan\nMichael Govan (born 1963) is the director of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. Prior to his current position, Govan worked as the director of the Dia Art Foundation in New York City.\n\nEarly life and education\nGovan was born in 1963 in North Adams, Massachusetts, and was raised in the Washington D.C. area, attending Sidwell Friends School.He majored in art history and fine arts at Williams College, where he met Thomas Krens, who was then director of the Williams College Museum of Art. Govan became closely involved with the museum, serving as acting curator as an undergraduate. After receiving his B.A. from Williams in 1985, Govan began an MFA in fine arts from the University of California, San Diego.\n\nCareer\nAs a twenty-five year old graduate student, Govan was recruited by his former mentor at Williams, Thomas Krens, who in 1988 had been appointed director of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation. Govan served as deputy director of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum under Krens from 1988 to 1994, a period that culminated in the construction and opening of the Frank Gehry designed Guggenheim branch in Bilbao, Spain. Govan supervised the reinstallation of the museum's permanent collection galleries after its extensive renovation.\n\nDia Art Foundation\nFrom 1994 to 2006, Govan was president and director of Dia Art Foundation in New York City. There, he spearheaded the conversion of a Nabisco box factory into the 300,000 square foot Dia:Beacon in New York's Hudson Valley, which houses Dia's collection of art from the 1960s to the present. Built in a former Nabisco box factory, the critically acclaimed museum has been credited with catalyzing a cultural and economic revival within the formerly factory-based city of Beacon. Dia's collection nearly doubled in size during Govan's tenure, but he also came under criticism for \"needlessly and permanently\" closing Dia's West 22nd Street building. During his time at Dia, Govan also worked closely with artists James Turrell and Michael Heizer, becoming an ardent supporter of Roden Crater and City, the artists' respective site-specific land art projects under construction in the American southwest. Govan successfully lobbied Washington to have the 704,000 acres in central Nevada surrounding City declared a national monument in 2015.\n\nLACMA\nIn February 2006, a search committee composed of eleven LACMA trustees, led by the late Nancy M. Daly, recruited Govan to run the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. Govan has stated that he was drawn to the role not only because of LACMA's geographical distance from its European and east coast peers, but also because of the museum's relative youth, having been established in 1961. \"I felt that because of this newness I had the opportunity to reconsider the museum,\" Govan has written, \"[and] Los Angeles is a good place to do that.\"Govan has been widely regarded for transforming LACMA into both a local and international landmark. Since Govan's arrival, LACMA has acquired by donation or purchase over 27,000 works for the permanent collection, and the museum's gallery space has almost doubled thanks to the addition of two new buildings designed by Renzo Piano, the Broad Contemporary Art Museum (BCAM) and the Lynda and Stewart Resnick Pavilion. LACMA's annual attendance has grown from 600,000 to nearly 1.6 million in 2016.\n\nArtist collaborations\nSince his arrival, Govan has commissioned exhibition scenography and gallery designs in collaboration with artists. In 2006, for example, Govan invited LA artist John Baldessari to design an upcoming exhibition about the Belgian surrealist René Magritte, resulting in a theatrical show that reflected the twisted perspective of the latter's topsy-turvy world. Baldessari has also designed LACMA's logo. Since then, Govan has also commissioned Cuban-American artist Jorge Pardo to design LACMA's Art of the Ancient Americas gallery, described in the Los Angeles Times as a \"gritty cavern deep inside the earth ... crossed with a high-style urban lounge.\"Govan has also commissioned several large-scale public artworks for LACMA's campus from contemporary California artists. These include Chris Burden's Urban Light (2008), a series of 202 vintage street lamps from different neighborhoods in Los Angeles, arranged in front of the entrance pavilion, Barbara Kruger's Untitled (Shafted) (2008), Robert Irwin's Primal Palm Garden (2010), and Michael Heizer's Levitated Mass, a 340-ton boulder transported 100 miles from the Jurupa Valley to LACMA, a widely publicized journey that culminated with a large celebration on Wilshire Boulevard. Thanks in part to the popularity of these public artworks, LACMA was ranked the fourth most instagrammed museum in the world in 2016.In his first three full years, the museum raised $251 million—about $100 million more than it collected during the three years before he arrived. In 2010, it was announced that Govan will steer LACMA for at least six more years. In a letter dated February 24, 2013, Govan, along with the LACMA board's co-chairmen Terry Semel and Andrew Gordon, proposed a merger with the financially troubled Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles and a plan to raise $100 million for the combined museum.\n\nZumthor Project\nGovan's latest project is an ambitious building project, the replacement of four of the campus's aging buildings with a single new state of the art gallery building designed by architect Peter Zumthor. As of January 2017, he has raised about $300 million in commitments. Construction is expected to begin in 2018, and the new building will open in 2023, to coincide with the opening of the new D Line metro stop on Wilshire Boulevard. The project also envisages dissolving all existing curatorial departments and departmental collections. Some commentators have been highly critical of Govan's plans. Joseph Giovannini, recalling Govan's technically unrealizable onetime plan to hang Jeff Koons' Train sculpture from the facade of the Ahmanson Gallery, has accused Govan of \"driving the institution over a cliff into an equivalent mid-air wreck of its own\". Describing the collection merging proposal as the creation of a \"giant raffle bowl of some 130,000 objects\", Giovannini also points out that the Zumthor building will contain 33% less gallery space than the galleries it will replace, and that the linear footage of wall space available for displays will decrease by about 7,500 ft, or 1.5 miles. Faced with losing a building named in its honor, and anticipating that its acquisitions could no longer be displayed, the Ahmanson Foundation withdrew its support.\nOn the merging of the separate curatorial divisions to create a non-departmental art museum, Christopher Knight has pointed out that \"no other museum of LACMA's size and complexity does it\" that way, and characterized the museum's 2019 \"To Rome and Back\" exhibition, the first to take place under the new scheme, as \"bland and ineffectual\" and an \"unsuccessful sample of what's to come\".\n\nPersonal life\nGovan is married and has two daughters, one from a previous marriage. He and his family used to live in a $6 million mansion in Hancock Park that was provided by LACMA - a benefit worth $155,000 a year, according to most recent tax filings - until LACMA decided that it would sell the property to make up for the museum's of almost $900 million in debt [2]. That home is now worth nearly $8 million and Govan now lives in a trailer park in Malibu's Point Dume region.\nLos Angeles CA 90020\nUnited States.

He was the director of the Peabody Essex Museum in Salem for 17 months, resigning December 31, 2020. He was the director of the Toledo Museum of Art in Ohio from 2010 to 2019. He was the director of the Hood Museum of Art from 2005 to 2010, and the National Gallery of Australia (Canberra) from 1997 to 2004.\n\nCareer\nBrian Kennedy currently lives and works in the United States after leaving Australia in 2005 to direct the Hood Museum of Art at Dartmouth College. In October 2010 he became the ninth Director of the Toledo Museum of Art. On 1 July 2019, he succeeded Dan Monroe as the executive director and CEO of the Peabody Essex Museum.\n\nEarly life and career in Ireland\nKennedy was born in Dublin and attended Clonkeen College. He received B.A. (1982), M.A. (1985) and PhD (1989) degrees from University College-Dublin, where he studied both art history and history.\nHe worked in the Irish Department of Education (1982), the European Commission, Brussels (1983), and in Ireland at the Chester Beatty Library (1983–85), Government Publications Office (1985–86), and Department of Finance (1986–89). He married Mary Fiona Carlin in 1988.He was Assistant Director at the National Gallery of Ireland in Dublin from 1989 to 1997. He was Chair of the Irish Association of Art Historians from 1996 to 1997, and of the Council of Australian Art Museum Directors from 2001 to 2003. In September 1997 he became Director of the National Gallery of Australia.\n\nNational Gallery of Australia (NGA)\nKennedy expanded the traveling exhibitions and loans program throughout Australia, arranged for several major shows of Australian art abroad, increased the number of exhibitions at the museum itself and oversaw the development of an extensive multi-media site.  Although he oversaw several years of the museum's highest ever annual visitation, he discontinued the emphasis of his predecessor, Betty Churcher, on showing \"blockbuster\" exhibitions.\nDuring his directorship, the NGA gained government support for improving the building and significant private donations and corporate sponsorship. However, the initial design for the building proved controversial generating a public dispute with the original architect on moral rights grounds.  As a result, the project was not delivered during Dr Kennedy's tenure, with a significantly altered design completed some years later.  Private funding supported two acquisitions of British art, including David Hockney's A Bigger Grand Canyon in 1999, and Lucian Freud's After Cézanne in 2001. Kennedy built on the established collections at the museum by acquiring the Holmgren-Spertus collection of Indonesian textiles; the Kenneth Tyler collection of editioned prints, screens, multiples and unique proofs; and the Australian Print Workshop Archive. He was also notable for campaigning for the construction of a new \"front\" entrance to the Gallery, facing King Edward Terrace, which was completed in 2010 (see reference to the building project above).\nKennedy's cancellation of the \"Sensation exhibition\" (scheduled at the NGA from 2 June 2000 to 13 August 2000) was controversial, and seen by some as censorship. He claimed that the decision was due to the exhibition being \"too close to the market\" implying that a national cultural institution cannot exhibit the private collection of a speculative art investor. However, there were other exhibitions at the NGA during his tenure, which could have raised similar concerns. The exhibition featured the privately owned Young British Artists works belonging to Charles Saatchi and attracted large attendances in London and Brooklyn. Its most controversial work was Chris Ofili's The Holy Virgin Mary, a painting which used elephant dung and was accused of being blasphemous. The then-mayor of New York, Rudolph Giuliani, campaigned against the exhibition, claiming it was \"Catholic-bashing\" and an \"aggressive, vicious, disgusting attack on religion.\" In November 1999, Kennedy cancelled the exhibition and stated that the events in New York had \"obscured discussion of the artistic merit of the works of art\". He has said that it \"was the toughest decision of my professional life, so far.\"Kennedy was also repeatedly questioned on his management of a range of issues during the Australian Government's Senate Estimates process - particularly on the NGA's occupational health and safety record and concerns about the NGA's twenty-year-old air-conditioning system. The air-conditioning was finally renovated in 2003. Kennedy announced in 2002 that he would not seek extension of his contract beyond 2004, accepting a seven-year term as had his two predecessors.He became a joint Irish-Australian citizen in 2003.\n\nToledo Museum of Art\nThe Toledo Museum of Art is known for its exceptional collections of European and American paintings and sculpture, glass, antiquities, artist books, Japanese prints and netsuke. The museum offers free admission and is recognized for its historical leadership in the field of art education.  During his tenure, Kennedy has focused the museum's art education efforts on visual literacy, which he defines as \"learning to read, understand and write visual language.\"   Initiatives have included baby and toddler tours, specialized training for all staff, docents, volunteers and the launch of a website, www.vislit.org. In November 2014, the museum hosted the International Visual Literacy Association (IVLA) conference, the first Museum to do so. Kennedy has been a frequent speaker on the topic, including 2010 and 2013 TEDx talks on visual and sensory literacy.\nKennedy has expressed an interest in expanding the museum's collection of contemporary art and art by indigenous peoples. Works by Frank Stella, Sean Scully, Jaume Plensa, Ravinder Reddy and Mary Sibande have been acquired.  In addition, the museum has made major acquisitions of Old Master paintings by Frans Hals and Luca Giordano.During his tenure the Toledo Museum of Art has announced the return of several objects from its collection due to claims the objects were stolen and/or illegally exported prior being sold to the museum.  In 2011 a Meissen sweetmeat stand was returned to Germany followed by an Etruscan Kalpis or water jug to Italy (2013), an Indian sculpture of Ganesha (2014) and an astrological compendium to Germany in 2015.\n\nHood Museum of Art\nKennedy became Director of the Hood Museum of Art in July 2005. During his tenure, he implemented a series of large and small-scale exhibitions and oversaw the production of more than 20 publications to bring greater public attention to the museum's remarkable collections of the arts of America, Europe, Africa, Papua New Guinea and the Polar regions. At 70,000 objects, the Hood has one of the largest collections on any American college of university campus. The exhibition, Black Womanhood: Images, Icons, and Ideologies of the African Body, toured several US venues. Kennedy increased campus curricular use of works of art, with thousands of objects pulled from storage for classes annually. Numerous acquisitions were made with the museum's generous endowments, and he curated several exhibitions: including Wenda Gu: Forest of Stone Steles: Retranslation and Rewriting Tang Dynasty Poetry, Sean Scully: The Art of the Stripe, and Frank Stella: Irregular Polygons.\n\nPublications\nKennedy has written or edited a number of books on art, including:\n\nAlfred Chester Beatty and Ireland 1950-1968: A study in cultural politics, Glendale Press (1988), ISBN 978-0-907606-49-9\nDreams and responsibilities: The state and arts in independent Ireland, Arts Council of Ireland (1990), ISBN 978-0-906627-32-7\nJack B Yeats: Jack Butler Yeats, 1871-1957 (Lives of Irish Artists), Unipub (October 1991), ISBN 978-0-948524-24-0\nThe Anatomy Lesson: Art and Medicine (with Davis Coakley), National Gallery of Ireland (January 1992), ISBN 978-0-903162-65-4\nIreland: Art into History (with Raymond Gillespie), Roberts Rinehart Publishers (1994), ISBN 978-1-57098-005-3\nIrish Painting, Roberts Rinehart Publishers (November 1997),  ISBN 978-1-86059-059-7\nSean Scully: The Art of the Stripe, Hood Museum of Art (October 2008), ISBN 978-0-944722-34-3\nFrank Stella: Irregular Polygons, 1965-1966, Hood Museum of Art (October 2010), ISBN 978-0-944722-39-8\n\nHonors and achievements\nKennedy was awarded the Australian Centenary Medal in 2001 for service to Australian Society and its art. He is a trustee and treasurer of the Association of Art Museum Directors, a peer reviewer for the American Association of Museums and a member of the International Association of Art Critics. In 2013 he was appointed inaugural eminent professor at the University of Toledo and received an honorary doctorate from Lourdes University. Most recently, Kennedy received the 2014 Northwest Region, Ohio Art Education Association award for distinguished educator for art education.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nPassage 3:\nGeorge L. Cox\nGeorge L.

{"input": "Who is the paternal grandfather of Trịnh Doanh?", "context": "Passage 1:\nLyon Cohen\nLyon Cohen (born Yehuda Leib Cohen; May 11, 1868 – August 17, 1937) was a Polish-born Canadian businessman and a philanthropist. He was the grandfather of singer/poet Leonard Cohen.\n\nBiography\nCohen was born in Congress Poland, part of the Russian Empire, to a Jewish family on May 11, 1868. He immigrated to Canada with his parents in 1871. He was educated at the McGill Model School and the Catholic Commercial Academy in Montreal. In 1888, he entered the firm of Lee & Cohen in Montreal; later became partner with his father in the firm of L. Cohen & Son; in 1895, he established W. R. Cuthbert & Co; in 1900, he organized the Canadian Improvement Co., a dredging contractor; in 1906, he founded The Freedman Co. in Montreal; and in May 1919, he organized and became President of Canadian Export Clothiers, Ltd.  The Freedman Company went on to become one of Montreal’s largest clothing companies.In 1897, Cohen and Samuel William Jacobs founded the Canadian Jewish Times, the first English-language Jewish newspaper in Canada. The newspaper promoted the Canadianization of recent East European Jewish immigrants and encouraged their acceptance of Canadian customs as Cohen felt that the old world customs of immigrant Jews were one of the main causes of anti-Semitism. In 1914, the paper was purchased by Hirsch Wolofsky, owner of the Yiddish-language Keneder Adler, who transformed it into the Canadian Jewish Chronicle.He died on August 17, 1937, at the age of 69.\n\nPhilanthropy\nCohen was elected the first president of the Canadian Jewish Congress in 1919 and organized the Jewish Immigrant Aid Services of Canada. Cohen was also a leader of the Young Men’s Hebrew Benevolent Society (later the Baron de Hirsch Institute) and the United Talmud Torahs, a Jewish day school in Montreal. He also served as president of Congregation Shaar Hashomayim and president of the Jewish Colonization Association in Canada.\n\nPersonal life\nCohen married Rachel Friedman of Montreal on February 17, 1891. She was the founder and President of Jewish Endeavour Sewing School. They had three sons and one daughter:\n\nNathan Bernard Cohen, who served as a lieutenant in the World War; he married Lithuanian Jewish immigrant Masha Klonitsky and they had one daughter and one son:\nEsther Cohen and\nsinger/poet Leonard Cohen.\nHorace Rives Cohen, who was a captain and quartermaster of his battalion in World War I;\nLawrence Zebulun Cohen, student at McGill University, and\nSylvia Lillian Cohen.\nPassage 2:\nTrịnh Cương\nTrịnh Cương (Hán tự: 鄭棡; 9 July 1686 – 20 December 1729) was the lord who ruled Tonkin from 1709 to 1729 (his title as ruler was An Đô Vương). Trịnh Cương was born to Trịnh Bính, a grandson of the former lord Trịnh Căn. He belonged to the line of Trịnh lords who had ruled parts of Vietnam since 1545. Like his great-grandfather and predecessor, Trịnh Căn, his reign was mostly devoted to administrative reforms.\n\nBiography\nTrịnh Cương ruled Việt Nam during a time of external peace but growing internal strife. He enacted many governmental reforms in both financial matters and judicial rules. His main concern was the growing problem of landless peasants. Unlike the Nguyễn lords who were constantly expanding their territory south, the Trịnh lords had little room for expansion. Hence, the land supply was essentially fixed but the population kept growing.\nTrịnh Cương tried various legislative means to solve the problem. He tried to limit private land holdings. He tried to redistribute the communal fields of the small villages. Nothing really worked and the problem became very serious over the succeeding decades. According to historian R. H. Bruce Lockhart, the governmental reforms enacted by Trịnh Cương and his great-grandfather, Trịnh Căn, made the government more effective but, they also made the government more of a burden to the people. This had the effect of increasing the hatred felt by the people towards the Trịnh rulers in Hanoi.\nTrịnh Cương passed an edict forbidding people to practice Christianity in 1712. Like previous efforts to suppress Christianity, this had little real effect in Vietnam. However, he tried to offer the people an alternative, and he had many Buddhist pagodas constructed during his rule.\nAs far as the Lê dynasty was concerned, the emperor, Lê Dụ Tông, ruled throughout Trịnh Cương's lifetime. The two men died within a few months of each other in 1729.\n\nSources\nEncyclopedia of Asian History, Volume 4. 1988.

He was the grandfather of Ertuğrul Ghazi, the father of the founder of the Ottoman Empire, Osman I. He was also famously known for being the successing name of Ertokus Bey’s son Kaya Alp. He was a descendant of the ancestor of his tribe, Kayı son of Gun son of Oghuz Khagan, the legendary progenitor of the Oghuz Turks.\nPassage 4:\nNguyễn Thị Ngọc Diễm\nNguyễn Thị Ngọc Diễm (Hán tự: 阮氏玉琰, 1721–1784), posthumous name Từ Trạch (慈澤), was a consort of lord Trịnh Doanh.\n\nBiography\nLady Nguyễn Thị Ngọc Diễm was born in 1721 at Linh Đường village, Linh Đàm commune, Thanh Trì district, Southern of Phụng Thiên prefect. She was commended to Trịnh clan's palace by her father who was Duke Nguyễn Văn Luân (阮文倫, 1686–1739).

Trịnh Doanh was the third son of Trịnh Cương, and belonged to the line of Trịnh lords who ruled northern Vietnam. His rule was spent putting down rebellions against Trịnh rule.\n\nTrịnh Doanh took over from his brother, Trịnh Giang, who, through financial mismanagement and bad behavior, provoked a wave of revolts against his rule. This was a time of increasing peasant revolts in both the north and the south under the Nguyễn lords. In the north, some of the revolts were apparently led by members of the royal Lê family. The rebellions which broke out in Tonkin during this period, were almost without number. Princes belonging to the royal family, generals, civil mandarins, common people, and out-casts from the hills, all rose in the provinces against the tyranny of the Trịnh, as well as for their personal interests. Chapter 16 (continued) \nDespite the many revolts, Trịnh Doanh defeated them all and passed the rule of Vietnam to his son, Trịnh Sâm.\nAs far as the Lê dynasty was concerned, there was just one emperor, Lê Hien Tông (1740–1786), who occupied the royal throne in Hanoi.\n\nSee also\nLê dynasty\n\nSources\nEncyclopedia of Asian History, Volumes 4. 1988.

He played college football at St. Louis University.\nPassage 8:\nAbd al-Muttalib\nShayba ibn Hāshim (Arabic: شَيْبَة إبْن هَاشِم; c. 497–578), better known as ʿAbd al-Muṭṭalib, (Arabic: عَبْد ٱلْمُطَّلِب, lit. 'Servant of Muttalib') was the fourth chief of the Quraysh tribal confederation. He was the grandfather of the Islamic prophet Muhammad.\n\nEarly life\nHis father was Hashim ibn 'Abd Manaf,: 81  the progenitor of the distinguished Banu Hashim, a clan of the Quraysh tribe of Mecca. They claimed descent from Ismā'īl and Ibrāhīm. His mother was Salma bint Amr, from the Banu Najjar, a clan of the Khazraj tribe in Yathrib (later called Madinah). Hashim died while doing business in Gaza, before Abd al-Muttalib was born.: 81 His real name was \"Shaiba\" meaning 'the ancient one' or 'white-haired' because of the streak of white through his jet-black hair, and is sometimes also called Shaybah al-Ḥamd (\"The white streak of praise\").: 81–82  After his father's death he was raised in Yathrib with his mother and her family until about the age of eight, when his uncle Muttalib ibn Abd Manaf went to see him and asked his mother Salmah to entrust Shaybah to his care. Salmah was unwilling to let her son go and Shaiba refused to leave his mother without her consent. Muṭṭalib then pointed out that the possibilities Yathrib had to offer were incomparable to Mecca. Salmah was impressed with his arguments, so she agreed to let him go. Upon first arriving in Mecca, the people assumed the unknown child was Muttalib's servant and started calling him 'Abd al-Muttalib (\"servant of Muttalib\").: 85–86\n\nChieftain of Hashim clan\nWhen Muṭṭalib died, Shaiba succeeded him as the chief of the Hāshim clan. Following his uncle Al-Muṭṭalib, he took over the duties of providing the pilgrims with food and water, and carried on the practices of his forefathers with his people. He attained such eminence as none of his forefathers enjoyed; his people loved him and his reputation was great among them.: 61 \n'Umar ibn Al-Khaṭṭāb's grandfather Nufayl ibn Abdul Uzza arbitrated in a dispute between 'Abdul-Muṭṭalib and Ḥarb ibn Umayyah, Abu Sufyan's father, over the custodianship of the Kaaba. Nufayl gave his verdict in favour of 'Abdul-Muṭṭalib. Addressing Ḥarb ibn Umayyah, he said:\nWhy do you pick a quarrel with a person who is taller than you in stature; more imposing than you in appearance; more refined than you in intellect; whose progeny outnumbers yours and whose generosity outshines yours in lustre? Do not, however, construe this into any disparagement of your good qualities which I highly appreciate. You are as gentle as a lamb, you are renowned throughout Arabia for the stentorian tones of your voice, and you are an asset to your tribe.\n\nDiscovery of Zam Zam Well\n'Abdul-Muṭṭalib said that while sleeping in the sacred enclosure, he had dreamed he was ordered to dig at the worship place of the Quraysh between the two deities Isāf and Nā'ila. There he would find the Zamzam Well, which the Jurhum tribe had filled in when they left Mecca. The Quraysh tried to stop him digging in that spot, but his son Al-Ḥārith stood guard until they gave up their protests. After three days of digging, 'Abdul-Muṭṭalib found traces of an ancient religious well and exclaimed, \"Allahuakbar!\" Some of the Quraysh disputed his claim to sole rights over water, then one of them suggested that they go to a female shaman who lived afar. It was said that she could summon jinns and that she could help them decide who was the owner of the well. So, 11 people from the 11 tribes went on the expedition. They had to cross the desert to meet the priestess but then they got lost. There was a lack of food and water and people started to lose hope of ever getting out. One of them suggested that they dig their own graves and if they died, the last person standing would bury the others. So all began digging their own graves and just as Abdul-Muṭṭalib started digging, water spewed out from the hole he dug and everyone became overjoyed. It was then and there decided that Abdul-Muttalib was the owner of the Zam Zam well. Thereafter he supplied pilgrims to the Kaaba with Zam Zam water, which soon eclipsed all the other wells in Mecca because it was considered sacred.: 86–89 : 62–65\n\nThe Year of the Elephant\nAccording to Muslim tradition, the Ethiopian governor of Yemen, Abrahah al-Ashram, envied the Kaaba's reverence among the Arabs and, being a Christian, he built a cathedral on Sana'a and ordered pilgrimage be made there.: 21  The order was ignored and someone desecrated (some saying in the form of defecation: 696 note 35 ) the cathedral. Abrahah decided to avenge this act by demolishing the Kaaba and he advanced with an army towards Mecca.: 22–23 There were thirteen elephants in Abrahah's army: 99 : 26  and the year came to be known as 'Ām al-Fīl (the Year of the Elephant), beginning a trend for reckoning the years in Arabia which was used until 'Umar ibn Al-Khaṭṭāb replaced it with the Islamic Calendar in 638 CE (17 AH), with the first year of the Islamic Calendar being 622 CE.\nWhen news of the advance of Abrahah's army came, the Arab tribes of Quraysh, Kinānah, Khuzā'ah and Hudhayl united in defence of the Kaaba. A man from the Ḥimyar tribe was sent by Abrahah to advise them that he only wished to demolish the Kaaba and if they resisted, they would be crushed. \"Abdul-Muṭṭalib told the Meccans to seek refuge in the nearest high hills while he, with some leading members of Quraysh, remained within the precincts of the Kaaba. Abrahah sent a dispatch inviting 'Abdul-Muṭṭalib to meet him and discuss matters. When 'Abdul-Muṭṭalib left the meeting he was heard saying, \"The Owner of this House is its Defender, and I am sure He will save it from the attack of the adversaries and will not dishonour the servants of His House.\": 24–26 It is recorded that when Abrahah's forces neared the Kaaba, Allah commanded small birds (abābīl) to destroy Abrahah's army, raining down pebbles on it from their beaks. Abrahah was seriously wounded and retreated towards Yemen but died on the way.: 26–27  This event is referred to in the following Qur'anic chapter:\n\nHave you not seen how your Lord dealt with the owners of the Elephant?\nDid He not make their treacherous plan go astray?\n\nAnd He sent against them birds in flocks, striking them with stones of baked clay, so He rendered them like straw eaten up.\nMost Islamic sources place the event around the year that Muhammad was born, 570 CE, though other scholars place it one or two decades earlier. A tradition attributed to Ibn Shihab al-Zuhri in the musannaf of ʽAbd al-Razzaq al-Sanʽani places it before the birth of Muhammad's father.\n\nSacrificing his son Abdullah\nAl-Harith was 'Abdul-Muṭṭalib's only son at the time he dug the Zamzam Well.: 64  When the Quraysh tried to help him in the digging, he vowed that if he were to have ten sons to protect him, he would sacrifice one of them to Allah at the Kaaba. Later, after nine more sons had been born to him, he told them he must keep the vow. The divination arrows fell upon his favourite son Abdullah. The Quraysh protested 'Abdul-Muṭṭalib's intention to sacrifice his son and demanded that he sacrifice something else instead. 'Abdul-Muṭṭalib agreed to consult a \"sorceress with a familiar spirit\". She told him to cast lots between Abdullah and ten camels. If Abdullah were chosen, he had to add ten more camels, and keep on doing the same until his Lord accepted the camels in Abdullah's place. When the number of camels reached 100, the lot fell on the camels. 'Abdul-Muṭṭalib confirmed this by repeating the test three times. Then the camels were sacrificed, and Abdullah was spared.: 66–68\n\nFamily\nWives\nAbd al-Muttalib had six known wives.\n\nSumra bint Jundab of the Hawazin tribe.\nLubnā bint Hājar of the Khuza'a tribe.\nFatima bint Amr of the Makhzum clan of the Quraysh tribe.\nHalah bint Wuhayb of the Zuhrah clan of the Quraysh tribe.\nNatīla bint Janab of the Namir tribe.\nMumanna'a bint Amr of the Khuza'a tribe.\n\nChildren\nAccording to Ibn Hisham, ʿAbd al-Muṭṭalib had ten sons and six daughters.: 707–708 note 97  However, Ibn Sa'd lists twelve sons.: 99–101 By Sumra bint Jundab:\n\nAl-Ḥārith.: 708  He was the firstborn and he died before his father.: 99 \nQuthum.: 100  He is not listed by Ibn Hisham.By Fatima bint Amr:\n\nAl-Zubayr.: 707  He was a poet and a chief; his father made a will in his favour.: 99  He died before Islam, leaving two sons and daughters.: 101 : 34–35 \nAbu Talib, born as Abd Manaf,: 99 : 707  father of the future Caliph Ali.

One day Muhammad's mother, Amina, wanted to go to Yathrib, where her husband, Abdullah, died. So, Muhammad, Amina, Abd al-Muttalib and their caretaker, Umm Ayman started their journey to Medina, which is around 500 kilometres away from Makkah. They stayed there for three weeks, then, started their journey back to Mecca. But, when they reached halfway, at Al-Abwa', Amina became very sick and died six years after her husband's death. She was buried over there. From then, Muhammad became an orphan. Abd al-Muttalib became very sad for Muhammad because he loved him so much. Abd al-Muttalib took care of Muhammad. But when Muhammad was eight years old, the very old Abd al-Muttalib became very sick and died at age 81-82 in 578-579 CE.\nShaybah ibn Hāshim's grave can be found in the Jannat al-Mu'allā cemetery in Makkah, Saudi Arabia.\n\nSee also\nFamily tree of Muhammad\nFamily tree of Shaiba ibn Hashim\nSahaba\nPassage 9:\nFred Le Deux\nFrederick David Le Deux (born 4 December 1934) is a former Australian rules footballer who played with Geelong in the Victorian Football League (VFL). He is the grandfather of Tom Hawkins.\n\nEarly life\nLe Deux grew up in Nagambie and attended Assumption College, after which he went to Bendigo to study teaching.\n\nFootball\nWhile a student at Bendigo Teachers' Training College, Le Deux played for the Sandhurst Football Club. He then moved to Ocean Grove to take up a teaching position and in 1956 joined Geelong.A follower and defender, Le Deux made 18 appearances for Geelong over three seasons, from 1956 to 1958 He was troubled by a back injury in 1958, which kept him out of the entire 1959 VFL season.In 1960 he joined Victorian Football Association club Mordialloc, as he had transferred to a local technical school.\n\nFamily\nLe Deux's daughter Jennifer was married to former Geelong player Jack Hawkins. Jennifer died in 2015. Their son, Tom Hawkins, currently plays for Geelong.\nPassage 10:\nJohn Westley\nRev. John Wesley (1636–78) was an English nonconformist minister. He was the grandfather of John Wesley (founder of Methodism).\n\nLife\nJohn Wesly (his own spelling), Westley, or Wesley was probably born at Bridport, Dorset, although some authorities claim he was born in Devon, the son of the Rev. Bartholomew Westley and Ann Colley, daughter of Sir Henry Colley of Carbery Castle in County Kildare, Ireland. He was educated at Dorchester Grammar School and as a student of New Inn Hall, Oxford, where he matriculated on 23 April 1651, and graduated B.A. on 23 January 1655, and M.A. on 4 July 1657. After his appointment as an evangelist, he preached at Melcombe Regis, Radipole, and other areas in Dorset. Never episcopally ordained, he was approved by Oliver Cromwell's Commission of Triers in 1658 and appointed Vicar of Winterborne Whitechurch.The report of his interview in 1661 with Gilbert Ironside the elder, his diocesan, according to Alexander Gordon writing in the Dictionary of National Biography, shows him to have been an Independent. He was imprisoned for not using the Book of Common Prayer, imprisoned again and ejected in 1662. After the Conventicle Act 1664 he continued to preach in small gatherings at Preston and then Poole, until his death at Preston in 1678.\n\nFamily\nHe married a daughter of John White, who was related also to Thomas Fuller. White, the \"Patriarch of Dorchester\", married a sister of Cornelius Burges. Westley's eldest son was Timothy (born 1659). Their second son was Rev. Samuel Wesley, a High Church Anglican vicar and the father of John and Charles Wesley. A younger son, Matthew Wesley, remained a nonconformist, became a London apothecary, and died on 10 June 1737, leaving a son, Matthew, in India; he provided for some of his brother Samuel's daughters.\n\nNotes\nAdditional sources\nMatthews, A.

{"input": "Are Breville and Jakab Industries both located in the same country?", "context": "Passage 1:\nSatellite tournament\nA satellite tournament is either a minor tournament or event on a competitive sporting tour or one of a group of such tournaments that form a series played in the same country or region.\n\nPoker\nA satellite tournament in poker is a qualifying event. Winners of these satellites usually win the buy-in fee to a larger, more prestigious tournament like the World Series of Poker Main Event. Although there are some land-based satellite tournaments (usually for very high-stakes tournaments), most of them are online-based. Some sites, like PokerStars, maintain several tiers of satellites. A player can thus start out at one tier (not necessarily the lowest one) and play his way to a higher tier. The entry fee for each tier is always higher than the fee for the tier below it, with the first tier being the cheapest.\n\nTennis\nIn professional tennis, satellite circuits were four-week tournaments (five before 1987), typically organised by a country's national tennis association and overseen by the International Tennis Federation. They were played by players who were ranked outside the top few hundred by the Association of Tennis Professionals, with openings for unranked players in the qualifying draw. Total prize money ranged from $25,000 to $75,000 per circuit.  ATP points were awarded on the basis of a player's ranking within the circuit and from 1987 onwards on the basis of the conversion of a player's circuit points into ATP points. Players successful at this level of pro tennis would move on to play ATP Challenger Series or even top-flight ATP Tour events. The men's satellite tournaments were discontinued following the 2006 season as the circuit moved exclusively to one-week Futures tournaments.\n\nPinball\nA satellite tournament in pinball is modeled after those in poker. It is a smaller tournament that leads up to a major pinball championship, where participants have the opportunity to win their entry into the larger tournament. Applying the satellite tournament concept to pinball was first done by Northwest Pinball and Arcade Show in 2013 to promote both the show and the tournaments at the show. Since then, some other major tournaments have begun using the concept.\nPassage 2:\nTunstall, Virginia\nTunstall is an unincorporated community in New Kent County, Virginia, United States.Foster's Castle and Hampstead, both located in Tunstall, are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\nPassage 3:\nTelephone numbers in Ascension Island\nCountry Code: +247International Call Prefix: 00\nAscension Island does not share the same country code (+290) with the rest of St Helena.\n\nCalling formats\nTo call in Ascension Island, the following format is used:\nyxxxx      Calls inside Ascension Island\n+247 yxxxx  Calls from outside Ascension Island\n\nAscension Island numbering plan\nAccording to ITU Communication of 08.V.2015, Sure South Atlantic Limited, Jamestown, announced the following update to the numbering plan for Ascension.\nThe length of geographical numbers increased from four (4) to five (5) digits and prefixed with the number \"6\".\nThe 4XXXX range  reserved for mobile services.\nThe change to five-digit numbering to be implemented on 1 June 2015.   \n\n1: New 5-digit numbering\n2: 6-digit numbering\n\nSee also\nTelephone numbers in the United Kingdom\nTelephone numbers in Saint Helena and Tristan da Cunha\nPassage 4:\nLubnowy\nLubnowy is part of the name of two villages, both located in Gmina Susz, within Iława County, Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship, Poland:\n\nLubnowy Małe\nLubnowy Wielkie\n\nSee also\nLiebenau\nPassage 5:\nBreville\nBreville is an Australian brand of small home appliances, founded in Sydney in 1932. It is best known for its home appliances, specifically blenders, coffee machines, toasters, kettles, microwaves and toaster ovens. As of 2016, the brand also manufactured \"Creatista\" coffee machines for Nespresso, and distributed other Nespresso products in Australia, New Zealand and the USA and Canada, including the \"Inissia\", \"Vertuo\" and \"Citiz\" series of machines.\n\nHistory\nIn 1932, Bill O'Brien and Harry Norville (born Charles Henry Norville) mixed their last names together and the Breville brand was created. The company started by making radios. During World War II, it made mine detectors. By 1953, the radio business had been taken over by A.W. Jackson Industries Pty. Ltd., which manufactured radiograms and, later, television sets under the Breville brand. After that, Breville turned its attention to manufacturing household appliances.\nThe O'Brien family continued developing the Breville business for three generations, with Bill's son, John, setting up the Breville Research and Development centre in the late 1960s, and his daughter, Barbara, running the marketing department throughout the 1990s. John O'Brien continued to lead many product development initiatives for the Breville brand until his death in December 2003. Breville's R&D team has taken out over 100 active patents and has been awarded more than 40 international design awards. In 1974, Breville released the toasted sandwich maker, which was a huge success, selling 400,000 units in its first year, and making the Breville brand a household name in Australia. Soon after this, the Breville toasted sandwich maker was launched in New Zealand and the United Kingdom, where it was met with similar success.\n\nOwnership\nIn 2001, the Breville companies of Australia, New Zealand, and Hong Kong transferred ownership of the brand to Housewares International Limited. The acquisition of the Breville companies caused the group to shift its focus to the electrical business and cease its Australian homewares and cleaning businesses in March 2007. In 2008, Housewares International Limited officially changed its name to the Breville Group Limited. The Breville Group Limited also owns the Kambrook and Sage brands. It markets most of its product under the Sage brand in the UK and Europe, since the Breville brand is owned by the unrelated Jarden company in the UK.\n\nGlobal presence\nBreville trades in over 70 countries including China, Brazil, South Africa, Mexico, and Israel. In 2002, the Breville brand was launched in Canada and the United States.\nPassage 6:\nJawty\nJawty (German: Jauth) is part of the name of two villages, both located in Gmina Susz, within Iława County, Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship, Poland:\n\nLubnowy Małe\nLubnowy Wielkie\nPassage 7:\nJakab Industries\nJakab Industries was an Australian coachbuilder in Tamworth, New South Wales.\n\nHistory\nJakab Industries built its first bus body in July 1973, a Ford R226. It mainly made bodies for buses for the defence forces, but also built some for commercial operators, before withdrawing from the market in late 1995. It also built bodies for ambulances and postal vans. In the 1990s it also overhauled Mercedes-Benz and Scania buses for the State Transit Authority.\nFollowing the collapse of Clifford Corporation in 1998, Volvo arranged for Jakab to take over the Ansair plant in Tamworth and complete the work of providing Orana-style bodies for 60 State Transit Authority Volvo B10BLE buses. The subsidiary company set up to do the work was named Phoenix Bus.Jakab Industries was placed in administration in 2002.\nPassage 8:\nRadzice\nRadzice is part of the name of two villages, both located in Gmina Drzewica, within Opoczno County, Łódź Voivodeship, Poland:\n\nRadzice Duże\nRadzice Male\nPassage 9:\nLimestone Coast\nThe Limestone Coast is a name used since the early twenty-first century for a South Australian government region  located in the south east of South Australia which immediately adjoins the continental coastline and the Victorian border.  The name is also used for a tourist region and a wine zone both located in the same part of South Australia.\n\nExtent\nThe Limestone Coast is a South Australian Government Region which consists of land within the following local government areas located in the south east of the state: the City of Mount Gambier and the District Councils of Grant, Kingston, Robe, Tatiara and Naracoorte Lucindale and the Wattle Range Council, and the extent of \"coastal waters\" up to three nautical miles seaward of the low water mark between the border with Victoria in the east and  the northern boundary of the Kingston District Council in the north-west.\n\nIndustry regions with the same name\nLimestone Coast Tourism Region\nThe words 'Limestone Coast' also used in the name of a  tourism region which occupies a similar part of South Australia.  The tourism region consists of the following local government areas: the City of Mount Gambier, The Coorong District Council, the District Councils of Grant, Kingston, Robe, Tatiara and Naracoorte Lucindale, and the Wattle Range Council.\n\nLimestone Coast Wine Zone\nThe words 'Limestone Coast' also used in the name of a wine zone which occupies a similar part of South Australia.  The wine zone is the land south of a line located at appropriately 36 degrees 50 minutes south, i.e. in line with Cape Willoughby at the east end of Kangaroo Island.  The zone includes the following wine-growing regions: Coonawarra, Mount Benson, Mount Gambier, Padthaway, Robe and Wrattonbully.\n\nLocation and description\nFrom the Victoria border to the Younghusband Peninsula this area has been settled since colonisation by  mainly European settlers in the 1840s, displacing an indigenous population that had resided in the region for thousands of years. The region currently supports farming, viticulture, forestry and tourism. Towns include Bordertown, Keith, Millicent, Mount Gambier, Penola, and Naracoorte and the coastal resorts of Beachport, Kingston SE and Robe.\nMuch of the Limestone Coast is low-lying, and was inundated by sea as recently as 2 million years ago. It had previously also been flooded 15–20 million years ago.  The plains are lined by rows of low sandhills parallel to the coast, created at times when the coastline was at that level. Prior to European settlement, much of the land between the sandhills was swamp fed by streams and subject to inundation. A network of drains totalling 1450 km has been constructed to channel the water away through the sandhills to the ocean. Important areas of wetland remain including the lakes and lagoons such as the southern end of the Coorong and Bool Lagoon. Meanwhile, areas of upland in the Limestone Coast include the volcanic craters of Mount Gambier.\nThe Mediterranean climate of this coast is cool and moist with wet winters.\n\nHistory\nThere are deep limestone deposits created from the coral and other sealife. The limestone in Victoria Fossil Cave and the other Naracoorte Caves contains are Australia's biggest source of fossils and a World Heritage Site.\n\nEcology\nFlora\nThe natural vegetation was woodland of River Red gum and other eucalyptus trees.\n\nFauna\nAlthough there are few purely endemic species the coast is rich in wildlife including possums, Cercartetus pygmy possums, Petaurus Gliding possums, and other marsupials many of which do not spread further west than here. Endemic species include reptiles such as the striped legless lizard (Delma impar) and invertebrates like an endemic cave cricket. The Naracoorte caves are occupied by the common bent-wing bat.\nThe lakes and lagoons are particularly important habitats for waterbirds such as black swan, grey teal, Pacific black duck, and especially the critically endangered orange-bellied parrot (Neophema chrysogaster) which winters here along with many other birds including the red-necked stint (Calidris ruficollis), sharp-tailed sandpiper (Calidris acuminata), and curlew sandpiper (Calidris ferruginea).\nMost of the original habitat has been cleared for agriculture and only fragments remain (particularly in areas of wetland) with Coorong National Park and Canunda National Park being the largest areas. Therefore, most indigenous wildlife has also disappeared or been severely reduced in number with introduced species of animals an ongoing threat to that which remains.\n\nSee also\nRegions of South Australia\nSouth Australian Forestry Corporation\nKanawinka Geopark\n\nExternal links\n\nRegional website - local weather, street maps, events etc* Official tourist website\nSouthAustralia.com Limestone Coast - travel guides, accommodation, online booking\nLimestone Coast - National Parks\nPassage 10:\nAlexander Mathieson & Sons\nThe firm of Alexander Mathieson & Sons was one of the leading makers of hand tools in Scotland. Its success went hand in hand with the growth of the shipbuilding industries on the Firth of Clyde in the nineteenth century and the emergence of Glasgow as the \"second city of the Empire\". It also reflected the firm's skill in responding to an unprecedented demand for quality tools by shipyards, cooperages and other industries, both locally and far and wide.\n\nEarly years\nThe year 1792 was deemed by the firm to be that of its foundation; it was in all likelihood the year in which John Manners had set up his plane-making workshop on Saracen('s) Lane off the Gallowgate in the heart of Glasgow, not far from the Saracen's Head Inn, where Dr. Johnson and James Boswell had stayed on their tour of Scotland in 1773.Alexander Mathieson (1797–1851) is recorded in 1822 as a plane-maker at 25 Gallowgate, but in the following year at 14 Saracen's Lane, presumably having taken over the premises of John Manners. The 1841 national census described Alexander Mathieson as a master plane-maker at 38 Saracen Lane with his son Thomas Adam working as a journeyman plane-maker.\n\nThomas Adam Mathieson\nGradually business grew and became more diversified, the Post-Office Glasgow Annual Directory recording that by 1847/8 Alexander Mathieson was a \"plane, brace, bit, auger & edge-tool maker\".\n\nEdinburgh\nIn 1849 the firm of James & William Stewart at 65 Nicolson Street, Edinburgh was taken over and Thomas was put in charge of the business, trading under the name Thomas A. Mathieson & Co. as plane and edge-tool makers. Thomas's company acquired the Edinburgh edge-tool makers Charles & Hugh McPherson and took over their premises in Gilmore Street. In the Edinburgh directory of 1856/7 the business is recorded as being Alexander Mathieson & Son, plane and edge-tool makers at 48 Nicolson Street and at Paul's Work, Gilmore Street.\n\nGrowth of the Glasgow business\nThe 1851 census records that Alexander was working as a tool and plane-maker employing eight men. Later that year Alexander died and his son Thomas took over the business. Under the heading of edge-tool maker in the 1852/3 Post-Office Glasgow Annual Directory the firm is now listed as Alexander Mathieson & Son, with further lines as \"turning-lathe and vice manufacturers\" added. By the early 1850s the business had moved to 24 Saracen Lane. The directory for 1857/8 records that the firm had moved again only a few years later to East Campbell Street, also off the Gallowgate, and that through further diversification was also manufacturing coopers' and tinmen's tools. The ten-yearly censuses log the firm's growth: in 1861 Thomas was a tool manufacturer employing 95 men and 30 boys; in 1871 he had 200 men working for him; and in 1881 300 men. By 1899 the firm had been incorporated as Alexander Mathieson & Sons Ltd, notwithstanding the fact that only Alexander's son Thomas appears ever to have joined the firm.\n\nTrade-mark\nIn September 1868 Thomas Mathieson put a notice in the Sheffield & Rotherham Independent and the Sheffield Daily Telegraph stating that his firm had used the trade-mark of a crescent and star \"for some time\" and that \"using or imitating the Mark would be proceeded against for infringement\". The firm had acquired its interest in the crescent-and-star mark from the heirs of Charles Pickslay, the Sheffield cutler who had registered it with the Cutlers' Company in 1833 and had died in 1852. The year 1868 seems also to be the one in which the name Saracen Tool Works was first adopted; not only does it figure at the foot of the notice in the Sheffield press, it also makes its first appearance in the firm's entry in the Post-Office Glasgow Annual Directory in the 1868/9 edition.\n\nPublic life\nAs Thomas Mathieson's business grew, so too did his involvement in local public life and philanthropy. One of the representatives of the third ward on the town council of Glasgow, he became a river bailie in 1868, a magistrate in 1870 and a preceptor of Hutcheson's Hospital in 1878. He had a passion for books and was an \"ardent Ruskinian\". He served on the committee handling the bequest for the setting up of the Mitchell Library in Glasgow. When he died at Coulter Maynes near Biggar in 1899, he left an estate worth £142,764. He is buried at the Glasgow Necropolis next to the cathedral.\n\nLater years of the firm\nBoth Thomas's sons, James Harper and Thomas Ogilvie, were involved in the continuing life of the firm. James followed in his father's footsteps in becoming a local public figure. He was appointed Deputy Lieutenant of the County of the City of Glasgow and was made a deacon of the Incorporation of the Hammermen of Glasgow in 1919. His brother Thomas Ogilvie was recorded as tool manufacturer and employer in the 1911 census. Thomas Ogilvie's son Thomas Alastair Sutherland Ogilvie \"Taso\" Mathieson born in 1908 took a rather different approach to engineering, however, by becoming a racing driver. In 1947 he wed the French film actress Mila Parély.\n\nAwards at world's fairs\nGreat Exhibition, London, 1851.

It was written by Val Valentine and J. B. Williams with uncredited assistance from Frank Launder. It was produced by Edward Black. The film's sets were designed by Walter Murton.\n\nPlot\nIt is April, 1942. Lieutenant Freddie Taylor and some crew of the submarine Sea Tiger are given a week's leave after an unsuccessful patrol. Leading Seaman Hobson goes home to save his marriage, while a reluctant Torpedo Gunner's Mate Corrigan departs for his wedding in London. When the crew are recalled early Corrigan is relieved, though later regrets not completing his marriage. Sea Tiger has been assigned the top secret mission to sink Nazi Germany's new battleship, the Brandenburg, before she transits the Kiel Canal for sea trials in the Baltic Sea. Sea Tiger must put to sea immediately.\nCrossing the North Sea, the submarine picks up three shot-down Luftwaffe pilots from a rescue buoy, and prevents their radio alert to German forces. When the submarine enters a minefield, an airman panics and reveals the Brandenburg is further ahead than thought. The airman is attacked by a countryman and subsequently dies. Taylor decides on a desperate gamble to pursue the Brandenburg into the German-controlled Baltic Sea.\nWhen the Brandenburg is spotted, Sea Tiger fires all its torpedoes, but dives before assessing their impact due to German destroyers dropping depth charges. By expelling oil and other debris including the body of the German airman, Taylor deceives the Germans into believing that the submarine has sunk. Although successfully escaped, Sea Tiger no longer has enough oil to reach Britain. The Germans, convinced that the Sea Tiger has been sunk, have Lord Haw Haw broadcast to Britain announcing the destruction of the Sea Tiger.\nTaylor decides to have his crew abandon ship on the Danish island of Hågø (which is in fact the island of Bågø). Hobson, a former merchant seaman who speaks German and knows the port on the island, persuades Taylor to let him go ashore and search for oil. He succeeds, and Sea Tiger enters the harbour under cover of darkness, using Hobson's intelligence about the harbour depth. Aided by friendly Danish sailors, they refuel while Hobson and other crewmen hold off the German garrison. Although Pincher (the cook) is killed and Oxford and Lieutenant Johnson are wounded, they get back to the re-fuelled submarine and start to leave the port. While they leave though, the tanker they were able to refuel from is hit by German shells and catches fire. Taylor, not wanting to risk the Sea Tiger any longer, continues to leave the port and makes it out to the open sea.\nWhile returning to Britain, the crew are met by an escorting trawler and learn from them that they sank the Brandenburg. The Sea Tiger returns to base, flying the Jolly Roger for the first time.\n\nCast\nJohn Mills as Lieutenant Freddie Taylor, Captain\nLouis Bradfield as Lieutenant Brace, First Officer\nRonald Millar as Lieutenant Ronnie Johnson, Third Officer\nJack Watling as Lieutenant Gordon, Navigating Officer\nReginald Purdell as C/P.O.

John Mills prepared for his role as the captain of Sea Tiger by sailing in a submarine on a training mission down the Clyde. He recalled a crash dive: The ship then seemed to stand on her nose and I felt her speeding like an arrow towards the sea bed; charts and crockery went flying in all directions; I hung on to a rail near the periscope trying to look heroic and totally unconcerned; the only thing that concerned me was the fact that I was sure that my face had turned a pale shade of pea-green.\nExterior shots of the submarines P614 and P615 were used for Sea Tiger (with the final number painted over to make \"P61\"). The vessels were a Turkish S-class submarine that had been part of a consignment ordered by the Turkish Navy from the British company Vickers in 1939. But with the outbreak of World War II, the four boats were requisitioned by the Royal Navy and designated the P611 class in the British Fleet. They were similar in design but slightly smaller than the British S class, although with a higher conning tower. The S-class boat HMS Safari also appears in the film.\n\nHome media\nThe film has been issued on VHS by Madacy Records and Timeless Multimedia among others, and on DVD by ITV DVD and Carlton.\nPassage 3:\nConey Island Baby (film)\nConey Island Baby is a 2003 comedy-drama in which film producer Amy Hobby made her directorial debut.

The low-quality special effects, the non-existent acting, the bad dubbing, and the chaotic plotting and pacing were all of a piece with what critics had been saying, erroneously, about the Godzilla movies for years.\" The review referred to the film's \"cheesy special effects and ridiculous dialogue taking on a sort of so-bad-they're-good charm\", and described the film as a \"thoroughly memorable (if not necessarily enjoyable, outside of the MST3K continuum) specimen of bad cinema.\"On October 11, 1997 the film was shown on the movie-mocking television show Mystery Science Theater 3000. In his review of the film, Bruce Eder of AllMovie described the episode as a memorable one, specifically the cast watching the repetitive aerial dogfights between spaceships, and one of the hosts remarking that \"Independence Day seems a richly nuanced movie\". Criticism of the film included excessive use of WWII stock footage in the action scenes (especially the obviously noticeable shot featuring a picture of Adolf Hitler in one building).In his book Japanese Science Fiction, Fantasy and Horror Films, Stuart Galbraith IV stated that the film \"had a few surprises\" despite a \"woefully familiar script\". Galbraith noted that the film was not as over-the-top as Prince of Space and that the opticals in the film were as strong as anything Toho had produced at the time. Galbraith suggested the effects may have been lifted from Toei's The Final War (aka World War III Breaks Out) from 1961.\n\nSee also\nList of Japanese films of 1961\nList of Mystery Science Theater 3000 episodes\nList of science fiction films of the 1960s\n\nNotes\nPassage 8:\nPistols at Dawn\nPistols at Dawn may refer to:\n\nPistols at Dawn, a 2000 album by Cauda Pavonis\nPistols at Dawn (EP), a 2004 EP by Aqueduct\nPistols at Dawn (Consumed album)\n\nSee also\nDuel\nPassage 9:\nPromise at Dawn\nPromise at Dawn may refer to:\n\nPromise at Dawn (novel), 1960 autobiographical novel by Romain Gary\nPromise at Dawn (1970 film), American film directed by Jules Dassin based on the novel\nPromise at Dawn (2017 film), Franco-Belgian film directed by Éric Barbier based on the novel\nPassage 10:\nEager Bodies\nEager Bodies (French: Les Corps impatients) is a 2003 French drama film directed by Xavier Giannoli.\n\nCast\nLaura Smet - Charlotte\nNicolas Duvauchelle - Paul\nMarie Denarnaud - Ninon\nCatherine Salviat - La Mère", "answers": ["Eager Bodies"], "length": 2422, "dataset": "2wikimqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "c37d17a5c509660a9c90556ef5c695867186af73a9ab4390"}

He was the director of the Peabody Essex Museum in Salem for 17 months, resigning December 31, 2020. He was the director of the Toledo Museum of Art in Ohio from 2010 to 2019. He was the director of the Hood Museum of Art from 2005 to 2010, and the National Gallery of Australia (Canberra) from 1997 to 2004.\n\nCareer\nBrian Kennedy currently lives and works in the United States after leaving Australia in 2005 to direct the Hood Museum of Art at Dartmouth College. In October 2010 he became the ninth Director of the Toledo Museum of Art. On 1 July 2019, he succeeded Dan Monroe as the executive director and CEO of the Peabody Essex Museum.\n\nEarly life and career in Ireland\nKennedy was born in Dublin and attended Clonkeen College. He received B.A. (1982), M.A. (1985) and PhD (1989) degrees from University College-Dublin, where he studied both art history and history.\nHe worked in the Irish Department of Education (1982), the European Commission, Brussels (1983), and in Ireland at the Chester Beatty Library (1983–85), Government Publications Office (1985–86), and Department of Finance (1986–89). He married Mary Fiona Carlin in 1988.He was Assistant Director at the National Gallery of Ireland in Dublin from 1989 to 1997. He was Chair of the Irish Association of Art Historians from 1996 to 1997, and of the Council of Australian Art Museum Directors from 2001 to 2003. In September 1997 he became Director of the National Gallery of Australia.\n\nNational Gallery of Australia (NGA)\nKennedy expanded the traveling exhibitions and loans program throughout Australia, arranged for several major shows of Australian art abroad, increased the number of exhibitions at the museum itself and oversaw the development of an extensive multi-media site.  Although he oversaw several years of the museum's highest ever annual visitation, he discontinued the emphasis of his predecessor, Betty Churcher, on showing \"blockbuster\" exhibitions.\nDuring his directorship, the NGA gained government support for improving the building and significant private donations and corporate sponsorship. However, the initial design for the building proved controversial generating a public dispute with the original architect on moral rights grounds.  As a result, the project was not delivered during Dr Kennedy's tenure, with a significantly altered design completed some years later.  Private funding supported two acquisitions of British art, including David Hockney's A Bigger Grand Canyon in 1999, and Lucian Freud's After Cézanne in 2001. Kennedy built on the established collections at the museum by acquiring the Holmgren-Spertus collection of Indonesian textiles; the Kenneth Tyler collection of editioned prints, screens, multiples and unique proofs; and the Australian Print Workshop Archive. He was also notable for campaigning for the construction of a new \"front\" entrance to the Gallery, facing King Edward Terrace, which was completed in 2010 (see reference to the building project above).\nKennedy's cancellation of the \"Sensation exhibition\" (scheduled at the NGA from 2 June 2000 to 13 August 2000) was controversial, and seen by some as censorship. He claimed that the decision was due to the exhibition being \"too close to the market\" implying that a national cultural institution cannot exhibit the private collection of a speculative art investor. However, there were other exhibitions at the NGA during his tenure, which could have raised similar concerns. The exhibition featured the privately owned Young British Artists works belonging to Charles Saatchi and attracted large attendances in London and Brooklyn. Its most controversial work was Chris Ofili's The Holy Virgin Mary, a painting which used elephant dung and was accused of being blasphemous. The then-mayor of New York, Rudolph Giuliani, campaigned against the exhibition, claiming it was \"Catholic-bashing\" and an \"aggressive, vicious, disgusting attack on religion.\" In November 1999, Kennedy cancelled the exhibition and stated that the events in New York had \"obscured discussion of the artistic merit of the works of art\". He has said that it \"was the toughest decision of my professional life, so far.\"Kennedy was also repeatedly questioned on his management of a range of issues during the Australian Government's Senate Estimates process - particularly on the NGA's occupational health and safety record and concerns about the NGA's twenty-year-old air-conditioning system. The air-conditioning was finally renovated in 2003. Kennedy announced in 2002 that he would not seek extension of his contract beyond 2004, accepting a seven-year term as had his two predecessors.He became a joint Irish-Australian citizen in 2003.\n\nToledo Museum of Art\nThe Toledo Museum of Art is known for its exceptional collections of European and American paintings and sculpture, glass, antiquities, artist books, Japanese prints and netsuke. The museum offers free admission and is recognized for its historical leadership in the field of art education.  During his tenure, Kennedy has focused the museum's art education efforts on visual literacy, which he defines as \"learning to read, understand and write visual language.\"   Initiatives have included baby and toddler tours, specialized training for all staff, docents, volunteers and the launch of a website, www.vislit.org. In November 2014, the museum hosted the International Visual Literacy Association (IVLA) conference, the first Museum to do so. Kennedy has been a frequent speaker on the topic, including 2010 and 2013 TEDx talks on visual and sensory literacy.\nKennedy has expressed an interest in expanding the museum's collection of contemporary art and art by indigenous peoples. Works by Frank Stella, Sean Scully, Jaume Plensa, Ravinder Reddy and Mary Sibande have been acquired.  In addition, the museum has made major acquisitions of Old Master paintings by Frans Hals and Luca Giordano.During his tenure the Toledo Museum of Art has announced the return of several objects from its collection due to claims the objects were stolen and/or illegally exported prior being sold to the museum.  In 2011 a Meissen sweetmeat stand was returned to Germany followed by an Etruscan Kalpis or water jug to Italy (2013), an Indian sculpture of Ganesha (2014) and an astrological compendium to Germany in 2015.\n\nHood Museum of Art\nKennedy became Director of the Hood Museum of Art in July 2005. During his tenure, he implemented a series of large and small-scale exhibitions and oversaw the production of more than 20 publications to bring greater public attention to the museum's remarkable collections of the arts of America, Europe, Africa, Papua New Guinea and the Polar regions. At 70,000 objects, the Hood has one of the largest collections on any American college of university campus. The exhibition, Black Womanhood: Images, Icons, and Ideologies of the African Body, toured several US venues. Kennedy increased campus curricular use of works of art, with thousands of objects pulled from storage for classes annually. Numerous acquisitions were made with the museum's generous endowments, and he curated several exhibitions: including Wenda Gu: Forest of Stone Steles: Retranslation and Rewriting Tang Dynasty Poetry, Sean Scully: The Art of the Stripe, and Frank Stella: Irregular Polygons.\n\nPublications\nKennedy has written or edited a number of books on art, including:\n\nAlfred Chester Beatty and Ireland 1950-1968: A study in cultural politics, Glendale Press (1988), ISBN 978-0-907606-49-9\nDreams and responsibilities: The state and arts in independent Ireland, Arts Council of Ireland (1990), ISBN 978-0-906627-32-7\nJack B Yeats: Jack Butler Yeats, 1871-1957 (Lives of Irish Artists), Unipub (October 1991), ISBN 978-0-948524-24-0\nThe Anatomy Lesson: Art and Medicine (with Davis Coakley), National Gallery of Ireland (January 1992), ISBN 978-0-903162-65-4\nIreland: Art into History (with Raymond Gillespie), Roberts Rinehart Publishers (1994), ISBN 978-1-57098-005-3\nIrish Painting, Roberts Rinehart Publishers (November 1997),  ISBN 978-1-86059-059-7\nSean Scully: The Art of the Stripe, Hood Museum of Art (October 2008), ISBN 978-0-944722-34-3\nFrank Stella: Irregular Polygons, 1965-1966, Hood Museum of Art (October 2010), ISBN 978-0-944722-39-8\n\nHonors and achievements\nKennedy was awarded the Australian Centenary Medal in 2001 for service to Australian Society and its art. He is a trustee and treasurer of the Association of Art Museum Directors, a peer reviewer for the American Association of Museums and a member of the International Association of Art Critics. In 2013 he was appointed inaugural eminent professor at the University of Toledo and received an honorary doctorate from Lourdes University.

Davis. It was filmed at Mamaroneck Harbor in Mamaroneck, NY.\n\nPlot and critical response\nTime magazine:\n\nAn extremely funny 15-minute film, may be taken as a solemn leg-pull of the recent vogue for dribble-and-splotch painters, those athletic canvas-coverers whose style owes less to Van Gogh's brush technique than to Stan Laurel's custard pie stance.  Or it may be taken as an explicit set of instructions for getting rich.\n\nThe film, a first-time effort by three ex-admen, begins with a loving shot of wharfs, fishing shacks and sounding sea-the sort of vista once sketched avidly by artists and now appreciated chiefly by retired couples who tour Cape Cod in late September.  The artist is a burly fellow (Ezra Reuben Baker), recognizably aesthetic in paint-smeared dungarees, scurrilous red sweater and combat boots.  He trundles a cart filled with paint buckets along a dock, then throws an enormous sheet of wallboard down on a mud flat ten feet below.\n\nSoberly, with exquisite skill, using first a vigorous forehand, then a precisely executed backhand, the painter slops color from buckets.  Clearly he is a master, for his stroke with the long-handled hoe is sure and strong, his touch with the dribble-stick more than Japanese in its delicacy.  And when he fills a flare pistol with paint and fires the last accent of orange at his abstraction, he does not pull the trigger.  He squeezes.\n\nWhen the thing dries, he hacks it up in random rectangles with a power saw, then carefully signs each fragment.  A seaplane, labeled \"Galerie des Abstracts, Paris-New York,\" touches down.  A man debarks whose rich, dark overcoat obviously proclaims him an art dealer.  He strokes his jaw as he examines the paintings, eventually selects a small one, shakes hands with the painter and takes off.  Pleased with himself, the painter matter-of-factly shoves the remaining works of art into the ocean.  This, as the screen truly proclaims, is the end.\nNew York Herald Tribune:\n\nA hilarious good - natured spoof of abstract-expressionist painting has been made the subject of a colored film-short called \"Day of the Painter.\" .........Without sound or sub-titles (except for a delightful musical score somewhat reminiscent of that which accompanied the Alex Guinness film, \"The Horse's Mouth\") the film begins with the artist's awakening in a crumbling shack on a rickety pier reaching out over a picturesque stream.  His \"Wall Street Journal\" is delivered by boat, and, having ascertained that his investments are doing well, he loads a wheelbarrow with assorted cans of paint, long sticks, and a spray gun, has two helpers carry his enormous blank canvas, and sets off to his muddy \"studio\" by the side of the stream.  All day long he flings, scatters, shoots, pushes paint all over his canvas and himself.  The picture grows, and, actually, turns out to be quite handsome-in the Jackson Pollock manner, of course, but attractive for all it imitativeness.  Sea gulls and swans waddle by, their expressions rather suggesting that of critics.\n\nAt last the painter is finished, carefully studies his work-and then proceeds to cut the enormous canvas up into pieces.\n\nAt the end of the day a small seaplane comes by, docks alongside the pier, while the passenger-pilot, looking like any 57th St. dealer you care to name, surveys the day's work.  He examines carefully, he ponders, and he finally selects one small segment of the canvas, places it in the plane, and takes off.\n\nThe painter takes all the other pieces, tosses them into the stream, and they float away with the gulls and swans, not unlike the unforgettable Gulley Jimson, in \"The Horse's Mouth,\" floating gallantly out to sea in his battered tugboat.\n\nAudiences, apparently, are enjoying the film-except for a group the other night who were plainly pro-abstract-expressionism, and hissed when the rest of the house applauded.  None of it was ill-natured, however, probably because the abstract-expressionism picture being kidded looks so agreeable.\n\nAwards\nDay of the Painter won an Oscar at the 33rd Academy Awards in 1961 for Best Short Subject.\nPassage 4:\nJacques Décombe\nJacques Décombe is a French author, actor and director born in 1953.\n\nBiography\nAfter he studied at the Conservatoire national d'art dramatique, he was the director of the shows of Les Inconnus at the request of Didier Bourdon and won the Molière Award for best comedy show.

In the first innings of his first match, against Lancashire at The Oval, he took five wickets for 81 runs.In his first full season, 1948, he was Surrey's leading wicket-taker and in the last home game of the season he was awarded his county cap – he celebrated by taking eight Northamptonshire wickets for 46 runs at The Oval, six of them coming in the space of 6.3 overs for seven runs. This would remain the best bowling performance of his first-class career, not surpassed, but he did equal it seven years later. In the following game, the last away match of the season, he took 10 Hampshire wickets for 150 runs in the match at Bournemouth. In the 1948 season as a whole, he took 91 wickets at an average of 28.07. As a tail-end left-handed batsman, he managed just 93 runs in the season at an average of 4.22.The emergence of Tony Lock as a slow left-arm bowler in 1949 brought a stuttering end of McMahon's Surrey career. Though he played in 12 first-class matches in the 1949 season, McMahon took only 19 wickets; a similar number of matches in 1950 brought 34 wickets. In 1951, he played just seven times and in 1952 only three times. In 1953, Lock split the first finger of his left hand, and played in only 11 of Surrey's County Championship matches; McMahon played as his deputy in 14 Championship matches, though a measure of their comparative merits was that Lock's 11 games produced 67 wickets at 12.38 runs apiece, while McMahon's 14 games brought him 45 wickets at the, for him, low average of 21.53. At the end of the 1953 season, McMahon was allowed to leave Surrey to join Somerset, then languishing at the foot of the County Championship and recruiting widely from other counties and other countries.\n\nSomerset cricketer\nSomerset's slow bowling in 1954 was in the hands of leg-spinner Johnny Lawrence, with support from the off-spin of Jim Hilton while promising off-spinner Brian Langford was on national service. McMahon filled a vacancy for a left-arm orthodox spinner that had been there since the retirement of Horace Hazell at the end of the 1952 season; Hazell's apparent successor, Roy Smith, had failed to realise his promise as a bowler in 1953, though his batting had advanced significantly.\nMcMahon instantly became a first-team regular and played in almost every match during his four years with the county, not missing a single Championship game until he was controversially dropped from the side in August 1957, after which he did not play in the Championship again.In the 1954 season, McMahon, alongside fellow newcomer Hilton, was something of a disappointment, according to Wisden: \"The new spin bowlers, McMahon and Hilton, did not attain to the best standards of their craft in a wet summer, yet, like the rest of the attack, they would have fared better with reasonable support in the field and from their own batsmen,\" it said. McMahon took 85 wickets at an average of 27.47 (Hilton took only 42 at a higher average). His best match was against Essex at Weston-super-Mare where he took six for 96 in the first innings and five for 45 in the second to finish with match figures of 11 for 141, which were the best of his career. He was awarded his county cap in the 1954 season, but Somerset remained at the bottom of the table.\nThe figures for the 1955 were similar: McMahon this time took 75 wickets at 28.77 apiece. There was a small improvement in his batting and the arrival of Bryan Lobb elevated McMahon to No 10 in the batting order for most of the season, and he responded with 262 runs and an average of 9.03. This included his highest-ever score, 24, made in the match against Sussex at Frome. A week later in Somerset's next match, he equalled his best-ever bowling performance, taking eight Kent wickets for 46 runs in the first innings of a match at Yeovil through what Wisden called \"clever variation of flight and spin\". These matches brought two victories for Somerset, but there were only two others in the 1955 season and the side finished at the bottom of the Championship for the fourth season running.At the end of the 1955 season, Lawrence retired and McMahon became Somerset's senior spin bowler for the 1956 season, with Langford returning from National Service as the main support. McMahon responded with his most successful season so far, taking 103 wickets at an average of 25.57, the only season in his career in which he exceeded 100 wickets. The bowling average improved still further in 1957 to 23.10 when McMahon took 86 wickets. But his season came to an abrupt end in mid-August 1957 when, after 108 consecutive Championship matches, he was dropped from the first team during the Weston-super-Mare festival. Though he played some games for the second eleven later in August, he regained his place in the first team for only a single end-of-season friendly match, and he was told that his services were not required for the future, a decision, said Wisden, that \"proved highly controversial\".\n\nSacked by Somerset\nThe reason behind McMahon's sacking did not become public knowledge for many years. In its obituary of him in 2002, McMahon was described by Wisden as \"a man who embraced the antipodean virtues of candour and conviviality\". It went on: \"Legend tells of a night at the Flying Horse Inn in Nottingham when he beheaded the gladioli with an ornamental sword, crying: 'When Mac drinks, everybody drinks!'\" The obituary recounts a further escapade in second eleven match at Midsomer Norton where a curfew imposed on the team was circumvented by \"a POW-type loop\" organised by McMahon, \"with his team-mates escaping through a ground-storey window and then presenting themselves again\". As the only Somerset second eleven match that McMahon played in at Midsomer Norton was right at the end of the 1957 season, this may have been the final straw. But in any case there had been \"an embarrassing episode at Swansea's Grand Hotel\" earlier in the season, also involving Jim Hilton, who was also dismissed at the end of the season. Team-mates and club members petitioned for McMahon to be reinstated, but the county club was not to be moved.\nAfter a period in Lancashire League cricket with Milnrow Cricket Club, McMahon moved back to London where he did office work, later contributing some articles to cricket magazines.\n\n\n== Notes and references ==\nPassage 3:\nIsabella Harwood\nIsabella Harwood or Ross Neil (14 June 1837 – 29 May 1888) was a British novelist who also wrote dramas in verse.\n\nBiography\nHarwood was probably born in Dorset in 1837 where her parents Phillip Harwood and his wife Isabella Neil lived. Phillip Harwood was then a Unitarian minister in Bridport.Between 1864 and 1870 she wrote four sensational novels which were published without attribution.

He had a particular fondness for \"ring riding\", and was a frequent guest at the courts in Vienna and Dresden.\nHenry II died on 23 December 1635 and was buried in the Salvator Church in Gera.

He held the island of Langeland in fief and inherited the properties of the ducal family in southern Funen, just as his uncle, Abel, Lord of Langeland, had before him. He is mentioned for the first time as responsible for the killing of the seneschal Skjalm Stigsen on 23 August 1292. The murder was probably a result of the enmity caused when King Eric VI of Denmark, after coming of age, confiscated the fief of Langeland and the properties of the ducal family in southern Funen.\nTogether with his brother, Duke Valdemar, he joined the king's enemies. In 1293, there was a clash between the two parties at Sommersted Heath near Haderslev which resulted in a compromise where Eric received Langeland as a fief.\nSubsequently, he married Sophia of Querfurt, a daughter of Jutta of Saxony, widow of King Eric IV of Denmark in her second marriage to Burchard VIII, Count of Querfurt-Rosenburg. Sophia was thus a half-sister of King Eric IV's daughters, among which were the deceased Queen Ingeborg of Norway, mother of King Eric II of Norway. The marriage thus connected Eric to the king of Norway, who knighted him, and also led to a new conflict with King Eric VI, who retained his wife's inheritance from her half-sisters.\nOn 3 February 1296 a compromise was entered in Vordingborg, in which the king promised to hand over Sophia's inheritance, but where the ducal family's properties in southern Funen, which had formerly belonged to Abel, Lord of Langeland, were kept by the king as lawfully acquired from Abel's daughter. Only the city of Rudkøbing was transferred to become part of the fief of Langeland, and Eric confirmed the city's rights on the same day.\nEric died in 1310. In 1315, Sophia, in the presence of the king and several noblemen, donated the inheritance of her sisters to Saint Agnes' Priory in Roskilde, keeping only the city of Skælskør for herself.\n\nMarriage and issue\nEric married Sophia of Querfurt, a daughter of Burchard VIII, Count of Querfurt-Rosenburg, Burgrave of Magdeburg and Jutta of Saxony, widow of Eric IV of Denmark.

In the settlement with his brother Eric after the death of their elder brother Duke Valdemar III, Abel received the cities of Svendborg, Rudkøbing, and possibly also Faaborg on the island of Funen, and as a fief the island of Langeland. Abel died on Easter Day 1279 in Svendborg and was buried in Greyfriars’ Abbey.\nAt his death, he left only a daughter Margaret, who entered the convent of Zarrentin in Mecklenburg and donated her father's properties to her relatives, the counts of Holstein.

He took part in the military campaign of 1259 which resulted in the conquest of Copenhagen.\n\nDuke of Schleswig\nAfter the death of Christopher in 1259, he was created Duke of Schleswig by the new king Eric V in 1260.\nAlready the following year, fighting with the king broke out anew. The Queen Dowager, Margaret Sambiria, acting as regent for her under age son, feared aggression from the Duke. However, Duke Eric was able to defeat the royal army at the Battle of Lohede and capture the young King Eric and his mother. As a result, he was able to obtain huge advantages for his duchy at the subsequent treaty in 1264.\nIn 1268, he acquired Gottorp Castle from Bishop Bonde of Schleswig, who then moved his residence to Schwabstedt.\nDuke Eric died 27 May 1272.\n\nMarriage and issue\nEric married Margaret of Rugia, a daughter of Jaromar II, Prince of Rugia in 1259 or 1260.

In 1350, they travelled to Hainaut to pay homage to Countess Margaret II. Somewhere between 1347 and 1350, John was appointed Burgrave of Geertruidenberg. In 1350, he purchased the Land of Breda for 43000 florins from John III, Duke of Brabant. He also acquired high justice over Breda.\nThe Hook and Cod wars started in earnest in about March 1351. Polanen Castle was besieged for 2 weeks and then demolished. Oud Haerlem Castle was taken after a siege which lasted more than 6 months, even though John van not present. The Siege of Geertuidenberg Castle lasted from October 1351 to August 1352. Here John's brother Philip commanded as his lieutenant. As a result of the war John lost the Lordship of De Lek.\n\nDuring the regency of Albert of Bavaria\nIn 1358, Albert of Bavaria became regent of Holland for his brother. This was good for the members of the old Hook faction. In 1358 John was somewhat compensated for his losses with other fiefs and possessions.\n\nIn Brabant\nWhatever the later events in Holland, John seems to have concentrated his efforts on extending his holdings in the Breda area. It made him more of a Brabant than a Holland lord.\nJohn II was captured during the 1371 Battle of Baesweiler. He was released several months later, after his relatives had paid a ransom. In 1375, he was appointed stadtholder of the Great Holme.\nJohn II died in 1378 and was buried in the Church of Our Lady in Breda.\n\nMarriages and issue\nJohn II of Polanen married three times.\nIn 1340, he married Oda of Horne-Altena (1318-1353), daughter of Willem IV of Horne. They had three children:\n\nJohn III, his heir\nBeatrice (c. 1344 – 1394); married Henry VIII, the son of Henry VII, Lord of Bautershem, who was also Lord of Bergen op Zoom as Henry I, and his wife, Maria Merxheim, Lady of Wuustwezel and Brecht\nOda (c. 1351 – 15th century), married Henry III, Burgrave of MontfoortIn 1353, he married Matilda (c. 1324 – 1366), an illegitimate daughter of John III, Duke of Brabant.  They had two sons:\n\nDirck of the Leck (d. 1416), married Gilisje of Cralingen.  He was outlawed for a while, because he was suspected of having participated in the murder of Aleid van Poelgeest\nHenry of the Leck (d. 1427), married Jeanne of Ghistelles, and was a councillor of Countess Jacqueline of HollandIn 1370, he married Margaret, a daughter of Otto, Lord of Lippe and Irmgard of the Marck.

He was the director of the Peabody Essex Museum in Salem for 17 months, resigning December 31, 2020. He was the director of the Toledo Museum of Art in Ohio from 2010 to 2019. He was the director of the Hood Museum of Art from 2005 to 2010, and the National Gallery of Australia (Canberra) from 1997 to 2004.\n\nCareer\nBrian Kennedy currently lives and works in the United States after leaving Australia in 2005 to direct the Hood Museum of Art at Dartmouth College. In October 2010 he became the ninth Director of the Toledo Museum of Art. On 1 July 2019, he succeeded Dan Monroe as the executive director and CEO of the Peabody Essex Museum.\n\nEarly life and career in Ireland\nKennedy was born in Dublin and attended Clonkeen College. He received B.A. (1982), M.A. (1985) and PhD (1989) degrees from University College-Dublin, where he studied both art history and history.\nHe worked in the Irish Department of Education (1982), the European Commission, Brussels (1983), and in Ireland at the Chester Beatty Library (1983–85), Government Publications Office (1985–86), and Department of Finance (1986–89). He married Mary Fiona Carlin in 1988.He was Assistant Director at the National Gallery of Ireland in Dublin from 1989 to 1997. He was Chair of the Irish Association of Art Historians from 1996 to 1997, and of the Council of Australian Art Museum Directors from 2001 to 2003. In September 1997 he became Director of the National Gallery of Australia.\n\nNational Gallery of Australia (NGA)\nKennedy expanded the traveling exhibitions and loans program throughout Australia, arranged for several major shows of Australian art abroad, increased the number of exhibitions at the museum itself and oversaw the development of an extensive multi-media site.  Although he oversaw several years of the museum's highest ever annual visitation, he discontinued the emphasis of his predecessor, Betty Churcher, on showing \"blockbuster\" exhibitions.\nDuring his directorship, the NGA gained government support for improving the building and significant private donations and corporate sponsorship. However, the initial design for the building proved controversial generating a public dispute with the original architect on moral rights grounds.  As a result, the project was not delivered during Dr Kennedy's tenure, with a significantly altered design completed some years later.  Private funding supported two acquisitions of British art, including David Hockney's A Bigger Grand Canyon in 1999, and Lucian Freud's After Cézanne in 2001. Kennedy built on the established collections at the museum by acquiring the Holmgren-Spertus collection of Indonesian textiles; the Kenneth Tyler collection of editioned prints, screens, multiples and unique proofs; and the Australian Print Workshop Archive. He was also notable for campaigning for the construction of a new \"front\" entrance to the Gallery, facing King Edward Terrace, which was completed in 2010 (see reference to the building project above).\nKennedy's cancellation of the \"Sensation exhibition\" (scheduled at the NGA from 2 June 2000 to 13 August 2000) was controversial, and seen by some as censorship. He claimed that the decision was due to the exhibition being \"too close to the market\" implying that a national cultural institution cannot exhibit the private collection of a speculative art investor. However, there were other exhibitions at the NGA during his tenure, which could have raised similar concerns. The exhibition featured the privately owned Young British Artists works belonging to Charles Saatchi and attracted large attendances in London and Brooklyn. Its most controversial work was Chris Ofili's The Holy Virgin Mary, a painting which used elephant dung and was accused of being blasphemous. The then-mayor of New York, Rudolph Giuliani, campaigned against the exhibition, claiming it was \"Catholic-bashing\" and an \"aggressive, vicious, disgusting attack on religion.\" In November 1999, Kennedy cancelled the exhibition and stated that the events in New York had \"obscured discussion of the artistic merit of the works of art\". He has said that it \"was the toughest decision of my professional life, so far.\"Kennedy was also repeatedly questioned on his management of a range of issues during the Australian Government's Senate Estimates process - particularly on the NGA's occupational health and safety record and concerns about the NGA's twenty-year-old air-conditioning system. The air-conditioning was finally renovated in 2003. Kennedy announced in 2002 that he would not seek extension of his contract beyond 2004, accepting a seven-year term as had his two predecessors.He became a joint Irish-Australian citizen in 2003.\n\nToledo Museum of Art\nThe Toledo Museum of Art is known for its exceptional collections of European and American paintings and sculpture, glass, antiquities, artist books, Japanese prints and netsuke. The museum offers free admission and is recognized for its historical leadership in the field of art education.  During his tenure, Kennedy has focused the museum's art education efforts on visual literacy, which he defines as \"learning to read, understand and write visual language.\"   Initiatives have included baby and toddler tours, specialized training for all staff, docents, volunteers and the launch of a website, www.vislit.org. In November 2014, the museum hosted the International Visual Literacy Association (IVLA) conference, the first Museum to do so. Kennedy has been a frequent speaker on the topic, including 2010 and 2013 TEDx talks on visual and sensory literacy.\nKennedy has expressed an interest in expanding the museum's collection of contemporary art and art by indigenous peoples. Works by Frank Stella, Sean Scully, Jaume Plensa, Ravinder Reddy and Mary Sibande have been acquired.  In addition, the museum has made major acquisitions of Old Master paintings by Frans Hals and Luca Giordano.During his tenure the Toledo Museum of Art has announced the return of several objects from its collection due to claims the objects were stolen and/or illegally exported prior being sold to the museum.  In 2011 a Meissen sweetmeat stand was returned to Germany followed by an Etruscan Kalpis or water jug to Italy (2013), an Indian sculpture of Ganesha (2014) and an astrological compendium to Germany in 2015.\n\nHood Museum of Art\nKennedy became Director of the Hood Museum of Art in July 2005. During his tenure, he implemented a series of large and small-scale exhibitions and oversaw the production of more than 20 publications to bring greater public attention to the museum's remarkable collections of the arts of America, Europe, Africa, Papua New Guinea and the Polar regions. At 70,000 objects, the Hood has one of the largest collections on any American college of university campus. The exhibition, Black Womanhood: Images, Icons, and Ideologies of the African Body, toured several US venues. Kennedy increased campus curricular use of works of art, with thousands of objects pulled from storage for classes annually. Numerous acquisitions were made with the museum's generous endowments, and he curated several exhibitions: including Wenda Gu: Forest of Stone Steles: Retranslation and Rewriting Tang Dynasty Poetry, Sean Scully: The Art of the Stripe, and Frank Stella: Irregular Polygons.\n\nPublications\nKennedy has written or edited a number of books on art, including:\n\nAlfred Chester Beatty and Ireland 1950-1968: A study in cultural politics, Glendale Press (1988), ISBN 978-0-907606-49-9\nDreams and responsibilities: The state and arts in independent Ireland, Arts Council of Ireland (1990), ISBN 978-0-906627-32-7\nJack B Yeats: Jack Butler Yeats, 1871-1957 (Lives of Irish Artists), Unipub (October 1991), ISBN 978-0-948524-24-0\nThe Anatomy Lesson: Art and Medicine (with Davis Coakley), National Gallery of Ireland (January 1992), ISBN 978-0-903162-65-4\nIreland: Art into History (with Raymond Gillespie), Roberts Rinehart Publishers (1994), ISBN 978-1-57098-005-3\nIrish Painting, Roberts Rinehart Publishers (November 1997),  ISBN 978-1-86059-059-7\nSean Scully: The Art of the Stripe, Hood Museum of Art (October 2008), ISBN 978-0-944722-34-3\nFrank Stella: Irregular Polygons, 1965-1966, Hood Museum of Art (October 2010), ISBN 978-0-944722-39-8\n\nHonors and achievements\nKennedy was awarded the Australian Centenary Medal in 2001 for service to Australian Society and its art. He is a trustee and treasurer of the Association of Art Museum Directors, a peer reviewer for the American Association of Museums and a member of the International Association of Art Critics. In 2013 he was appointed inaugural eminent professor at the University of Toledo and received an honorary doctorate from Lourdes University. Most recently, Kennedy received the 2014 Northwest Region, Ohio Art Education Association award for distinguished educator for art education.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nPassage 3:\nWilliam Dear\nWilliam Dear (born November 30, 1943) is a Canadian actor, director, producer and screenwriter.

Born with cerebral palsy, Porter's background and work was brought to the public's attention in 1995 when an Oregon-based newspaper published a series of feature stories about him.\n\nLife\nPorter was born in San Francisco, California, and at a young age moved to Portland, Oregon along with his mother. He was unable to gain employment due to his cerebral palsy, but refused to go on disability.

He eventually became Watkins' top seller, and worked for the company for over forty years.In 1995, the newspaper The Oregonian ran a feature story about Porter.

She suggests he should follow the example of a salesman and friend of hers, Keenan Wallick (Don McGuire), who works at her company. Red gets a chance to prove himself worthy sooner than he had expected when he is fired from his job as a cleaner by his boss, Gordon Trist (Nicholas Joy), because he accidentally sets a trash can on fire in the line of duty, and smashes Trist's car window. Ann gives him a chance to show his skills as a door-to-door salesman for the Fuller Brush company, and he is teamed up with her friend Keenan. Both Ann and Red are unaware that Keenan himself has a romantic interest in Ann, and wants to get Red out of the way as soon as possible, so he can pursue Ann without competition. Keenan assigns Red a list of the hardest homes, and Red fails tremendously with his task of selling to an almost impossible potential customer. He has a comical run-in with a troublesome small boy, and a beautiful model at another home tries to seduce him.\nSeeing how unsuccessful Red's sales attempts are, Keenan comes up with the idea of a bet – the winner gets to pursue Ann without interference of the other man – which he suggests to Red. The bet is that Red won't be able to sell a single brush to the households on their run. Red takes the bet, and the next household on their run is the mansion of his old boss Gordon Trist. After Red tries to hide from Gordon and the groundskeeper, Gordon recognizes Red and sends him packing, but his wife comes after Red and buys ten brushes from him.\nRed returns to Anna and Keenan in high spirits, until he realizes he forgot to collect the payment money from Mrs. Trist. When Red comes back to the Trist home, he overhears a conversation between his former boss, Keenan, Gregory Cruckston (Donald Curtis) and a few other persons, as they discuss their involvement in a racketeering operation. Red is caught eavesdropping and knocked unconscious after he is brought into the house. When he comes back to life, Gordon has been murdered in the dark, and everyone present in the house is arrested by police lieutenant Quint (Arthur Space), all suspected of murder.\nRed is released since there is no evidence pointing to him being the killer, and when he comes home he discovers Mrs. Trist (Hillary Brooke) waiting for him with the money. Soon after, Sara arrives at his home, and shortly after that Freddie Trist (Ross Ford), Gordon's son, with two armed gangsters. The gangsters hold everyone hostage as they search in vain for the murder weapon that killed Gordon. Ann and Red conclude that the weapon must have been a Fuller brush, molded into a knife-looking object. Cruckston stops them from telling policeman Quint about the weapon, and it turns out Cruckston, who is Gordon's partner in crime, is the murderer. Ann and Red escape from him and his gangsters. Cruckston is arrested and Red is the hero of the day, winning Ann's heart in the process.\n\nCast\nRed Skelton as Red Jones\nJanet Blair as Ann Elliott\nDon McGuire as Keenan Wallick\nHillary Brooke as Mildred Trist\nAdele Jergens as Miss Sharmley\nRoss Ford as Freddie Trist\nTrudy Marshall as Sara Franzen\nNicholas Joy as Commissioner Gordon Trist\nDonald Curtis as Gregory Cruckston\nArthur Space as Lieutenant Quint\n\nProduction\nThe project had been in development for four years. Producer Simon got permission from the Fuller Brush company and wrote the story with Skelton in mind but was unable to secure studio interest until the success of Miracle on 34th Street (1947) showed the benefits of commercial tie-ins for feature films. He set the project up at Columbia conditional upon MGM agreeing to loan him out.\nProducer Edward Small was owed a favour by MGM as he agreed not to make a film called D'Artagnan to clash with their production of The Three Musketeers (1948). Small and Simon then purchased a story in the Saturday Evening Post by Roy Huggins.\nFuller Brush gave their final approval provided it was clear in the final movie that the character Skelton played was an independent dealer and not an employee of the Fuller Brush company.\n\nSee also\nThe Fuller Brush Girl\nPassage 4:\nWolf Rilla\nWolf Peter Rilla (16 March 1920 – 19 October 2005) was a film director and writer of German background, although he worked mainly in the United Kingdom.Rilla is known for directing Village of the Damned (1960). He wrote many books for students, such as The Writer and the Screen: On Writing for Film and Television and The A to Z of Movie Making.\n\nEarly life and career\nRilla was born in Berlin, where his father Walter Rilla was an actor and producer. In common with many others in entertainment and the arts, Walter recognised the dangers when Hitler came to power, and the family moved to London in 1934 when Wolf was 14. He completed his schooling at the enlightened co-educational Frensham Heights School, Surrey, and went on to St Catharine's College, Cambridge. In 1942, he joined the BBC External Service's German section, beginning as a script editor, but transferred to television in the late 1940s.\n\nFilm and television career\nRilla left the BBC staff in 1952 to pursue a career making films, but continued to take on television productions as a freelance. For television, he directed episodes of series such as The Adventures of Aggie, a sitcom, and The Adventures of the Scarlet Pimpernel (both 1956), both produced for ITV, but also aimed at the American market. Later, he wrote episodes of the Paul Temple television series.Meanwhile, in the cinema he worked for Group 3, a production company set up by the National Film Finance Corporation with Michael Balcon, John Baxter and John Grierson in charge. The intention was to give young talent a chance to make modestly budgeted films (those costing less than £50,000), but the arrangement only survived until 1956. By 1960, Rilla was working regularly for MGM-British Studios.\nHis best remembered film, Village of the Damned (1960), dates from his period with the American studio's British subsidiary. Derived from John Wyndham's sci-fi novel The Midwich Cuckoos. As well as directing the film, Rilla collaborated with producer Ronald Kinnoch (using the pseudonym George Barclay) and Stirling Silliphant on the adaptation. George Sanders co-starred with Barbara Shelley. In his other film for MGM-British, Rilla directed his father, along with George Sanders and Richard Johnson, in Cairo (1963), a remake of John Huston's The Asphalt Jungle, with Tutankhamun's jewels in a Cairo museum now the target of the robbers.His novels included Greek Chorus, The Dispensable Man, The Chinese Consortium and one simply entitled Movie.\nRilla also wrote an episode of Doomwatch entitled The Devil's Demolition  however the series was cancelled before it was produced.\n\nPersonal life\nRilla married the actress and director Valerie Hanson after they appeared together in a BBC television production of The Portugal Lady; the couple had a daughter, Madeleine, in 1955. In 1967, he married Shirley Graham-Ellis, a publicist for tea suppliers Jacksons of Piccadilly and London Films. Rilla and Graham-Ellis had a son, Nico, who has been a filmmaker and chef. His daughter Madeline died in a car crash in 1985.\nAfter Rilla had held office in both the film technicians' union ACTT and the Directors' Guild, he and Shirley moved to the south of France, to buy and run a hotel at Fayence in Provence.\n\nFilmography\nNoose for a Lady (1953)\nGlad Tidings (1953)\nThe Large Rope (1953)\nMarilyn (US: Roadhouse Girl, 1953)\nThe Black Rider (1954)\nThe End of the Road (1954)\nStock Car (1955)\nThe Blue Peter (1955)\nPacific Destiny (1956)\nThe Scamp (1957)\nBachelor of Hearts (1958)\nJessy (1959)\nWitness in the Dark (1959)\nDie zornigen jungen Männer (1960)\nVillage of the Damned (1960)\nPiccadilly Third Stop (1960)\nWatch it, Sailor!

After starting his career as a door-to-door salesman and then broker, Miglin became a successful real estate developer. He was an early developer of business parks. His firm, at one point, proposed the construction of the Miglin-Beitler Skyneedle, which was planned to be the tallest building in the world. Miglin was murdered in his home in May 1997 by Andrew Cunanan, a spree\nkiller.\n\nLife and career\nMiglin was one of seven children born to a Roman Catholic family of Lithuanian descent. His father was a Czech immigrant who worked as a Central Illinois coal miner and also owned a tavern, ice cream parlor, and soda distributorship. Miglin was born in Westville, Illinois.Miglin trained as an air cadet during World War II, before attending the University of Illinois.Miglin began his professional career selling silverware door-to-door and pancake batter out of the trunk of his car. After this, he sold frozen cheesecakes, and subsequent to that sold TV dinners. He quit his salesman job to spend a six month trip across Europe. After this, he decided to make an effort to go into real estate to make substantial money.In 1956, at the age of 31, Miglin began his real estate career. In the early 1960s, he took a job as a broker with Chicago real estate magnate Arthur Rubloff. At Arthur Rubloff & Co., Miglin would first get involved with warehouse construction, later moving into office development. One of the projects he  was involved in was the development of the first two of the three towers at the President's Plaza office complex near Chicago's O'Hare International Airport. Miglin would later develop the third tower in 1985 with his firm Miglin-Beitler. Miglin was regarded as an early developer of the business park developments. He worked at Rubloff & Co. for 25 years.In 1959, Miglin married 20-year-old Marilyn Klecka, a Roman Catholic of Czech descent. Klecka, a successful entrepreneur known as the Queen of Makeovers, established a prominent perfume and cosmetics company and appeared on the Home Shopping Network. They would have two children together, Marlena (born 1968) and Duke Miglin (born 1971), the latter of whom would become an actor.Miglin formed a successful real estate development partnership with J. Paul Beitler, who had also worked at Rubloff & Co. Together, they founded the firm Miglin-Beitler Developments in 1982. Among the projects developed by the firm were Madison Plaza (200 West Madison), 181 West Madison Street, and Oakbrook Terrace Tower (the tallest building in Illinois outside of Chicago). In addition to constructing developments, the firm also managed properties.In 1988, Miglin-Beitler Developments unveiled plans to construct a 1,999 foot 125-floor skyscraper in Chicago to be called the Miglin-Beitler Skyneedle. This would have been the tallest building in the world at the time of its planned completion. However, the building was never built, with plans faltering during a 1990 downturn of Chicago's downtown office market. Miglin-Beitler had held hopes of resurrecting the project, but these hopes would be dashed by Miglin's murder.After Miglin-Beitler Developments began shifting its focus away from development and towards property management in the 1990s, Miglin gradually withdrew from the daily operations but still remained involved in the company.Miglin was a well-regarded figure in Chicago  and was known for his philanthropy.Miglin was murdered on May 4, 1997, by the spree killer Andrew Cunanan. Miglin's body was found in the garage of his home in Chicago's Gold Coast Historic District. He had been bound at the wrists, and his head was bound with tape, with only a breathing space under his nostrils. He had been tortured with a saw and a screwdriver, his ribs had been broken, he had been beaten and stabbed, and his throat had been slashed with a gardener's bow saw. Cunanan was already wanted in Minneapolis for murdering his friend Jeffrey Trail and his own ex-lover David Madson a few days earlier.\n\nLegacy\nMiglin-Beitler Developments merged in 1998 with the New York City real estate Howard and Edward Milstein to form the Chicago-based firm Miglin Beitler Real Estate (MBRE). In 2022, it was announced that Houston-based Transwestern was acquiring the firm. Some of the properties developed by Miglin are today managed by Miglin Properties, LLC.\n\nIn popular culture\nThe second season of the anthology television series American Crime Story: The Assassination of Gianni Versace, recounted the Cunanan spree. It included appearances by Miglin, portrayed by Mike Farrell.  This portrayal was based on Vulgar Favors: Andrew Cunanan, Gianni Versace, and the Largest Failed Manhunt in U.S. History by Maureen Orth, who speculated that Miglin may have been a closeted bisexual man in a secret relationship with Cunanan. The Miglin family has refuted this story, and has insisted that there was no relationship of any kind between Miglin and Cunanan. When the Federal Bureau of Investigation had investigated allegations that Cunnanan had known Miglin or a relative of Miglin's they were unable to establish any link between Miglin and Cunanan.\n\nSee also\nList of homicides in Illinois\nPassage 6:\nVictoria Burgoyne\nVictoria Burgoyne (born 3 April 1953) is an English actress.\nShe is known for being a guest actress in the infamously uncompleted 1979 Doctor Who serial Shada, the making of which was abandoned as the result of a BBC strike.

She appeared in 60 films between 1920 and 1930. She starred in the 1926 film Secrets of a Soul, which was directed by Georg Wilhelm Pabst.\n\nSelected filmography\nPassage 8:\nWilliam Richard Sutton\nWilliam Richard Sutton (1833 – 20 May 1900) was the founder of the UK's first door-to-door long distance parcel service and founder of the William Sutton housing trust.\n\nEarly life\nWilliam Richard Sutton was born in 1833 at London's Cheapside.\n\nCareer\nSutton founded the business of Sutton and Co., general carriers in 1861. He noted that the Royal Mail could carry letters from door to door, but they did not carry parcels; instead the sender had to arrange for delivery to a railway station, goods freight to a station near the destination, and then make separate arrangements for delivery to the final destination. Sutton Carriers would take care of all those stages. The railway companies obstructed this and Sutton took them to court with a case that lasted over seven years; the House of Lords ruled to break the railway companies' monopoly on pricing and allowed him to deliver packages door-to-door. At his death in 1900 his business had grown to 600 branches. Sutton Carriers was eventually nationalised in the 1950s.\nSutton also had a partnership in Sutton, Carden and Co. which was a brewer, bottler, distiller, hotelier and merchant of wines, tea, coffee, and tobacco.\n\nDeath and legacy\nSutton died at his home in Adelaide Crescent, Hove, and was buried in West Norwood Cemetery. His will bequeathed almost all of his considerable wealth into philanthropic trusts for housing of the poor, although during his life he had held no public office and did no charity work. His will was disputed by his family and by existing large landlords, among them the London County Council, who were worried that these cheap and desirable dwellings would lead to lower rents. Nonetheless, his will was proved and The Sutton Model Dwellings Trust (now known as Clarion Housing Group) built estates for the poor across England, beginning in Bethnal Green, then Chelsea, Islington, Rotherhithe, Plymouth and Birmingham.\nPassage 9:\nLive Now, Pay Later\nLive Now, Pay Later is a 1962 British black-and-white film starring Ian Hendry, June Ritchie and John Gregson. Hendry plays a smooth-talking, conniving door-to-door salesman.\n\nPlot\nUnsavoury door-to-door salesman Albert Argyle's (Ian Hendry) technique involves bedding his female customers in an attempt to seduce them to buy on credit. As well as being unfaithful to his pregnant girlfriend (June Ritchie), the unrepentant Albert is also cheating his boss (John Gregson) out of profits, and also trying his hand at a spot of blackmail.\n\nPreservation status\nThe only known print was discovered and finally made available on DVD in June 2020. The film premiered on Talking Pictures TV on 9 October 2022.\n\nCast\nProduction\nFilming locations included London, Elstree and Luton. A collection of location stills and corresponding contemporary photographs is hosted at reelstreets.com.\n\nCritical reception\nIn a contemporary review, Variety considered it to have \"many amusing moments, but overall it is untidy and does not develop the personalities of some of the main characters sufficiently\"; whereas more recently, the Radio Times gave the film four out of five stars, noting \"...a remarkably cynical and revealing portrait of Britain shifting from postwar austerity into rampant consumerism and the Swinging Sixties.\"\nPassage 10:\nOur Willi Is the Best\nOur Willi Is the Best (German: Unser Willi ist der Beste ) is a 1971 German comedy film directed by Werner Jacobs and starring Heinz Erhardt, Ruth Stephan and Rudolf Schündler.

{"input": "Where did the director of film The Little Door Into The World die?", "context": "Passage 1:\nBrian Kennedy (gallery director)\nBrian Patrick Kennedy (born 5 November 1961) is an Irish-born art museum director who has worked in Ireland and Australia, and now lives and works in the United States.  He was the director of the Peabody Essex Museum in Salem for 17 months, resigning December 31, 2020. He was the director of the Toledo Museum of Art in Ohio from 2010 to 2019. He was the director of the Hood Museum of Art from 2005 to 2010, and the National Gallery of Australia (Canberra) from 1997 to 2004.\n\nCareer\nBrian Kennedy currently lives and works in the United States after leaving Australia in 2005 to direct the Hood Museum of Art at Dartmouth College. In October 2010 he became the ninth Director of the Toledo Museum of Art. On 1 July 2019, he succeeded Dan Monroe as the executive director and CEO of the Peabody Essex Museum.\n\nEarly life and career in Ireland\nKennedy was born in Dublin and attended Clonkeen College. He received B.A. (1982), M.A. (1985) and PhD (1989) degrees from University College-Dublin, where he studied both art history and history.\nHe worked in the Irish Department of Education (1982), the European Commission, Brussels (1983), and in Ireland at the Chester Beatty Library (1983–85), Government Publications Office (1985–86), and Department of Finance (1986–89). He married Mary Fiona Carlin in 1988.He was Assistant Director at the National Gallery of Ireland in Dublin from 1989 to 1997. He was Chair of the Irish Association of Art Historians from 1996 to 1997, and of the Council of Australian Art Museum Directors from 2001 to 2003. In September 1997 he became Director of the National Gallery of Australia.\n\nNational Gallery of Australia (NGA)\nKennedy expanded the traveling exhibitions and loans program throughout Australia, arranged for several major shows of Australian art abroad, increased the number of exhibitions at the museum itself and oversaw the development of an extensive multi-media site.  Although he oversaw several years of the museum's highest ever annual visitation, he discontinued the emphasis of his predecessor, Betty Churcher, on showing \"blockbuster\" exhibitions.\nDuring his directorship, the NGA gained government support for improving the building and significant private donations and corporate sponsorship. However, the initial design for the building proved controversial generating a public dispute with the original architect on moral rights grounds.  As a result, the project was not delivered during Dr Kennedy's tenure, with a significantly altered design completed some years later.  Private funding supported two acquisitions of British art, including David Hockney's A Bigger Grand Canyon in 1999, and Lucian Freud's After Cézanne in 2001. Kennedy built on the established collections at the museum by acquiring the Holmgren-Spertus collection of Indonesian textiles; the Kenneth Tyler collection of editioned prints, screens, multiples and unique proofs; and the Australian Print Workshop Archive. He was also notable for campaigning for the construction of a new \"front\" entrance to the Gallery, facing King Edward Terrace, which was completed in 2010 (see reference to the building project above).\nKennedy's cancellation of the \"Sensation exhibition\" (scheduled at the NGA from 2 June 2000 to 13 August 2000) was controversial, and seen by some as censorship. He claimed that the decision was due to the exhibition being \"too close to the market\" implying that a national cultural institution cannot exhibit the private collection of a speculative art investor. However, there were other exhibitions at the NGA during his tenure, which could have raised similar concerns. The exhibition featured the privately owned Young British Artists works belonging to Charles Saatchi and attracted large attendances in London and Brooklyn. Its most controversial work was Chris Ofili's The Holy Virgin Mary, a painting which used elephant dung and was accused of being blasphemous. The then-mayor of New York, Rudolph Giuliani, campaigned against the exhibition, claiming it was \"Catholic-bashing\" and an \"aggressive, vicious, disgusting attack on religion.\" In November 1999, Kennedy cancelled the exhibition and stated that the events in New York had \"obscured discussion of the artistic merit of the works of art\". He has said that it \"was the toughest decision of my professional life, so far.\"Kennedy was also repeatedly questioned on his management of a range of issues during the Australian Government's Senate Estimates process - particularly on the NGA's occupational health and safety record and concerns about the NGA's twenty-year-old air-conditioning system. The air-conditioning was finally renovated in 2003. Kennedy announced in 2002 that he would not seek extension of his contract beyond 2004, accepting a seven-year term as had his two predecessors.He became a joint Irish-Australian citizen in 2003.\n\nToledo Museum of Art\nThe Toledo Museum of Art is known for its exceptional collections of European and American paintings and sculpture, glass, antiquities, artist books, Japanese prints and netsuke. The museum offers free admission and is recognized for its historical leadership in the field of art education.  During his tenure, Kennedy has focused the museum's art education efforts on visual literacy, which he defines as \"learning to read, understand and write visual language.\"   Initiatives have included baby and toddler tours, specialized training for all staff, docents, volunteers and the launch of a website, www.vislit.org. In November 2014, the museum hosted the International Visual Literacy Association (IVLA) conference, the first Museum to do so. Kennedy has been a frequent speaker on the topic, including 2010 and 2013 TEDx talks on visual and sensory literacy.\nKennedy has expressed an interest in expanding the museum's collection of contemporary art and art by indigenous peoples. Works by Frank Stella, Sean Scully, Jaume Plensa, Ravinder Reddy and Mary Sibande have been acquired.  In addition, the museum has made major acquisitions of Old Master paintings by Frans Hals and Luca Giordano.During his tenure the Toledo Museum of Art has announced the return of several objects from its collection due to claims the objects were stolen and/or illegally exported prior being sold to the museum.  In 2011 a Meissen sweetmeat stand was returned to Germany followed by an Etruscan Kalpis or water jug to Italy (2013), an Indian sculpture of Ganesha (2014) and an astrological compendium to Germany in 2015.\n\nHood Museum of Art\nKennedy became Director of the Hood Museum of Art in July 2005. During his tenure, he implemented a series of large and small-scale exhibitions and oversaw the production of more than 20 publications to bring greater public attention to the museum's remarkable collections of the arts of America, Europe, Africa, Papua New Guinea and the Polar regions. At 70,000 objects, the Hood has one of the largest collections on any American college of university campus. The exhibition, Black Womanhood: Images, Icons, and Ideologies of the African Body, toured several US venues. Kennedy increased campus curricular use of works of art, with thousands of objects pulled from storage for classes annually. Numerous acquisitions were made with the museum's generous endowments, and he curated several exhibitions: including Wenda Gu: Forest of Stone Steles: Retranslation and Rewriting Tang Dynasty Poetry, Sean Scully: The Art of the Stripe, and Frank Stella: Irregular Polygons.\n\nPublications\nKennedy has written or edited a number of books on art, including:\n\nAlfred Chester Beatty and Ireland 1950-1968: A study in cultural politics, Glendale Press (1988), ISBN 978-0-907606-49-9\nDreams and responsibilities: The state and arts in independent Ireland, Arts Council of Ireland (1990), ISBN 978-0-906627-32-7\nJack B Yeats: Jack Butler Yeats, 1871-1957 (Lives of Irish Artists), Unipub (October 1991), ISBN 978-0-948524-24-0\nThe Anatomy Lesson: Art and Medicine (with Davis Coakley), National Gallery of Ireland (January 1992), ISBN 978-0-903162-65-4\nIreland: Art into History (with Raymond Gillespie), Roberts Rinehart Publishers (1994), ISBN 978-1-57098-005-3\nIrish Painting, Roberts Rinehart Publishers (November 1997),  ISBN 978-1-86059-059-7\nSean Scully: The Art of the Stripe, Hood Museum of Art (October 2008), ISBN 978-0-944722-34-3\nFrank Stella: Irregular Polygons, 1965-1966, Hood Museum of Art (October 2010), ISBN 978-0-944722-39-8\n\nHonors and achievements\nKennedy was awarded the Australian Centenary Medal in 2001 for service to Australian Society and its art. He is a trustee and treasurer of the Association of Art Museum Directors, a peer reviewer for the American Association of Museums and a member of the International Association of Art Critics. In 2013 he was appointed inaugural eminent professor at the University of Toledo and received an honorary doctorate from Lourdes University.

N. Mathur\nS.N. Mathur was the Director of the Indian Intelligence Bureau between September 1975 and February 1980.

He was the director of the Peabody Essex Museum in Salem for 17 months, resigning December 31, 2020. He was the director of the Toledo Museum of Art in Ohio from 2010 to 2019. He was the director of the Hood Museum of Art from 2005 to 2010, and the National Gallery of Australia (Canberra) from 1997 to 2004.\n\nCareer\nBrian Kennedy currently lives and works in the United States after leaving Australia in 2005 to direct the Hood Museum of Art at Dartmouth College. In October 2010 he became the ninth Director of the Toledo Museum of Art. On 1 July 2019, he succeeded Dan Monroe as the executive director and CEO of the Peabody Essex Museum.\n\nEarly life and career in Ireland\nKennedy was born in Dublin and attended Clonkeen College. He received B.A. (1982), M.A. (1985) and PhD (1989) degrees from University College-Dublin, where he studied both art history and history.\nHe worked in the Irish Department of Education (1982), the European Commission, Brussels (1983), and in Ireland at the Chester Beatty Library (1983–85), Government Publications Office (1985–86), and Department of Finance (1986–89). He married Mary Fiona Carlin in 1988.He was Assistant Director at the National Gallery of Ireland in Dublin from 1989 to 1997. He was Chair of the Irish Association of Art Historians from 1996 to 1997, and of the Council of Australian Art Museum Directors from 2001 to 2003. In September 1997 he became Director of the National Gallery of Australia.\n\nNational Gallery of Australia (NGA)\nKennedy expanded the traveling exhibitions and loans program throughout Australia, arranged for several major shows of Australian art abroad, increased the number of exhibitions at the museum itself and oversaw the development of an extensive multi-media site.  Although he oversaw several years of the museum's highest ever annual visitation, he discontinued the emphasis of his predecessor, Betty Churcher, on showing \"blockbuster\" exhibitions.\nDuring his directorship, the NGA gained government support for improving the building and significant private donations and corporate sponsorship. However, the initial design for the building proved controversial generating a public dispute with the original architect on moral rights grounds.  As a result, the project was not delivered during Dr Kennedy's tenure, with a significantly altered design completed some years later.  Private funding supported two acquisitions of British art, including David Hockney's A Bigger Grand Canyon in 1999, and Lucian Freud's After Cézanne in 2001. Kennedy built on the established collections at the museum by acquiring the Holmgren-Spertus collection of Indonesian textiles; the Kenneth Tyler collection of editioned prints, screens, multiples and unique proofs; and the Australian Print Workshop Archive. He was also notable for campaigning for the construction of a new \"front\" entrance to the Gallery, facing King Edward Terrace, which was completed in 2010 (see reference to the building project above).\nKennedy's cancellation of the \"Sensation exhibition\" (scheduled at the NGA from 2 June 2000 to 13 August 2000) was controversial, and seen by some as censorship. He claimed that the decision was due to the exhibition being \"too close to the market\" implying that a national cultural institution cannot exhibit the private collection of a speculative art investor. However, there were other exhibitions at the NGA during his tenure, which could have raised similar concerns. The exhibition featured the privately owned Young British Artists works belonging to Charles Saatchi and attracted large attendances in London and Brooklyn. Its most controversial work was Chris Ofili's The Holy Virgin Mary, a painting which used elephant dung and was accused of being blasphemous. The then-mayor of New York, Rudolph Giuliani, campaigned against the exhibition, claiming it was \"Catholic-bashing\" and an \"aggressive, vicious, disgusting attack on religion.\" In November 1999, Kennedy cancelled the exhibition and stated that the events in New York had \"obscured discussion of the artistic merit of the works of art\". He has said that it \"was the toughest decision of my professional life, so far.\"Kennedy was also repeatedly questioned on his management of a range of issues during the Australian Government's Senate Estimates process - particularly on the NGA's occupational health and safety record and concerns about the NGA's twenty-year-old air-conditioning system. The air-conditioning was finally renovated in 2003. Kennedy announced in 2002 that he would not seek extension of his contract beyond 2004, accepting a seven-year term as had his two predecessors.He became a joint Irish-Australian citizen in 2003.\n\nToledo Museum of Art\nThe Toledo Museum of Art is known for its exceptional collections of European and American paintings and sculpture, glass, antiquities, artist books, Japanese prints and netsuke. The museum offers free admission and is recognized for its historical leadership in the field of art education.  During his tenure, Kennedy has focused the museum's art education efforts on visual literacy, which he defines as \"learning to read, understand and write visual language.\"   Initiatives have included baby and toddler tours, specialized training for all staff, docents, volunteers and the launch of a website, www.vislit.org. In November 2014, the museum hosted the International Visual Literacy Association (IVLA) conference, the first Museum to do so. Kennedy has been a frequent speaker on the topic, including 2010 and 2013 TEDx talks on visual and sensory literacy.\nKennedy has expressed an interest in expanding the museum's collection of contemporary art and art by indigenous peoples. Works by Frank Stella, Sean Scully, Jaume Plensa, Ravinder Reddy and Mary Sibande have been acquired.  In addition, the museum has made major acquisitions of Old Master paintings by Frans Hals and Luca Giordano.During his tenure the Toledo Museum of Art has announced the return of several objects from its collection due to claims the objects were stolen and/or illegally exported prior being sold to the museum.  In 2011 a Meissen sweetmeat stand was returned to Germany followed by an Etruscan Kalpis or water jug to Italy (2013), an Indian sculpture of Ganesha (2014) and an astrological compendium to Germany in 2015.\n\nHood Museum of Art\nKennedy became Director of the Hood Museum of Art in July 2005. During his tenure, he implemented a series of large and small-scale exhibitions and oversaw the production of more than 20 publications to bring greater public attention to the museum's remarkable collections of the arts of America, Europe, Africa, Papua New Guinea and the Polar regions. At 70,000 objects, the Hood has one of the largest collections on any American college of university campus. The exhibition, Black Womanhood: Images, Icons, and Ideologies of the African Body, toured several US venues. Kennedy increased campus curricular use of works of art, with thousands of objects pulled from storage for classes annually. Numerous acquisitions were made with the museum's generous endowments, and he curated several exhibitions: including Wenda Gu: Forest of Stone Steles: Retranslation and Rewriting Tang Dynasty Poetry, Sean Scully: The Art of the Stripe, and Frank Stella: Irregular Polygons.\n\nPublications\nKennedy has written or edited a number of books on art, including:\n\nAlfred Chester Beatty and Ireland 1950-1968: A study in cultural politics, Glendale Press (1988), ISBN 978-0-907606-49-9\nDreams and responsibilities: The state and arts in independent Ireland, Arts Council of Ireland (1990), ISBN 978-0-906627-32-7\nJack B Yeats: Jack Butler Yeats, 1871-1957 (Lives of Irish Artists), Unipub (October 1991), ISBN 978-0-948524-24-0\nThe Anatomy Lesson: Art and Medicine (with Davis Coakley), National Gallery of Ireland (January 1992), ISBN 978-0-903162-65-4\nIreland: Art into History (with Raymond Gillespie), Roberts Rinehart Publishers (1994), ISBN 978-1-57098-005-3\nIrish Painting, Roberts Rinehart Publishers (November 1997),  ISBN 978-1-86059-059-7\nSean Scully: The Art of the Stripe, Hood Museum of Art (October 2008), ISBN 978-0-944722-34-3\nFrank Stella: Irregular Polygons, 1965-1966, Hood Museum of Art (October 2010), ISBN 978-0-944722-39-8\n\nHonors and achievements\nKennedy was awarded the Australian Centenary Medal in 2001 for service to Australian Society and its art. He is a trustee and treasurer of the Association of Art Museum Directors, a peer reviewer for the American Association of Museums and a member of the International Association of Art Critics. In 2013 he was appointed inaugural eminent professor at the University of Toledo and received an honorary doctorate from Lourdes University. Most recently, Kennedy received the 2014 Northwest Region, Ohio Art Education Association award for distinguished educator for art education.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nPassage 7:\nPeter Levin\nPeter Levin is an American director of film, television and theatre.\n\nCareer\nSince 1967, Levin has amassed a large number of credits directing episodic television and television films.

{"input": "Which film was released earlier, Battle For Brooklyn or Crime In The Streets?", "context": "Passage 1:\nBattle for Brooklyn\nBattle for Brooklyn is a 2011 documentary that follows the stories of a Brooklyn neighborhood as the residents fight to save their homes from being destroyed by an impending real estate project. The film attempts to show the unjust outcomes that are possible when moneyed interests partner up with government entities to outweigh the rights of citizens.\n\nFilm content\nSet in the years between 2003 and 2011, the story follows graphic designer Daniel Goldstein, the last defiantly remaining homeowner in his building, as he battles Bruce Ratner's Forest City real estate company and their plans to complete the Atlantic Yards Project in the Prospect Heights neighborhood of Brooklyn. The massive building project – according to the filmmakers, the densest real estate development in U.S. history – required the procurement of 22 acres of land, and would bring a sports complex to house the New Jersey Nets along with 16 high-rise buildings to the heart of Brooklyn. Initially tasked with filling the behemoth 22 acre complex was architect Frank Gehry, who NPR calls \"American architecture's prince of wasted space\". The film documents that the land was obtained by the developers through various means including the controversial declaration of the buildings in the area as \"blighted\", and the utilization of eminent domain to seize land from businesses and homeowners in the proposed project area.\nDirector Michael Galinsky explained that it was their intention to create an immersive experience devoid of excessive commentary by \"talking heads\" in order to allow the viewer some latitude to experience the events of the film for themselves.  The result of this immersive experience after 7 years of filming can be seen as a character study of Daniel Goldstein – in the background of the story of the formation of Develop Don't Destroy Brooklyn and the fight against the development, Goldstein, through the course of the filming, experiences personal triumphs and great sadness, including the death of his mother, the breakup with his fiancée, the formation of a new relationship, and the birth of his child. The film documents his \"evolution from a bewildered property owner to sophisticated spokesman and property rights activist.\"The formation of the community activism group Develop Don't Destroy Brooklyn (DDDB) with the help of NYC Councilmember Letitia James helped bring Goldstein's cause into the public eye, quickly gaining the support of Brooklyn-based actors like Steve Buscemi, Rosie Perez and John Turturro, and conservative columnist George Will.\n\nProduction\nThe film, which was shortlisted for an Academy Award in 2012 for the 84th Academy Awards, was produced and directed by Michael Galinsky and Suki Hawley. Hawley and Galinsky began production in 2003, when they came across a flyer explaining the protest. Galinsky started shooting the very same afternoon. The film's importance extends beyond Goldstein's fight against the abuse of eminent domain, Galinsky describes the film as being \"really about the people retaking narratives from the media which is faltering ... in these situations.\"  The film received its initial financing from the New York-based non-profit Moving Picture Institute.In a 2011 interview, Galinsky described the events that led to the start of filming:\n\nI saw an article in the paper that said, \"A development project is coming to Brooklyn. Hooray!\" I thought, \"This seems a little bit weird.\" I knew the area it was coming to. It seemed it was impossible. It's in the middle of playgrounds and neighborhoods. My daughter went to daycare a block from there. So, when I saw a flyer saying, \"stop the project,\" I immediately picked it up, called the number on the flyer, and the woman who answered was Patti Hagan, who I could tell right away was an interesting character. So I started shooting that afternoon. That was eight years ago.\nOn April 30, 2011, Battle for Brooklyn premiered in Toronto at the HotDocs Film Festival.\n\nCritical reception\nAndrew O'Hehir of Salon says of the film's appeal, \"No doubt \"Battle for Brooklyn\" will be of most interest to New Yorkers, and particularly to people who live or work in the city's most populous borough. But the film's basic situation — local residents and community activists vs. the development schemes of major politicians and big business — is an archetypal element of urban life, one that can be found in almost any city, large or small, from Maine to California.\"S. James Snyder of Time Out New York writes, \"Nothing propels a documentary like injustice, and Michael Galinsky and Suki Hawley's infuriating chronicle of an outer-borough David-versus-Goliath saga plays like a marathon of inequity.\"Gary Goldstein of the Los Angeles Times said that although the film is \"not exactly even-handed, the movie proves a deft look at a reluctant crusader and how financial sway and political override can so effectively trump the power of the average citizen.\"\n\nAwards and recognition\n2011 Best Documentary & Best Film – Brooklyn Film Festival\nNew York Times Critics' Pick\n\nFilm Festivals\n2011 Chicago Underground Film Festival\n2011 Rooftop Films Summer Series\n2011 Brooklyn Film Festival (United States Premiere)\n2011 HotDocs (World Premiere)\nPassage 2:\nList of artists from Brooklyn\nBrooklyn is the most populous borough of New York City, New York.

{"input": "Where did Agnes Of Meissen's mother die?", "context": "Passage 1:\nImmilla of Turin\nImmilla (also Emilia, Immula, Ermengard, or Irmgard) (born c. 1020; died January 1078) was a duchess consort of Swabia by marriage to Otto III, Duke of Swabia, and a margravine of Meissen by marriage to Ekbert I of Meissen. She was regent of Meissen during the minority of her son, Ekbert II.\n\nLife\nImmilla was the daughter of Ulric Manfred II of Turin and Bertha of Milan and thereby a member of the Arduinici dynasty. Her older sister was Adelaide of Susa.\nHer first husband was Otto III, Duke of Swabia, whom she married c. 1036. After Otto's death in September 1057, Immilla married again (c.1058). Her second husband was Ekbert I of Meissen.In 1067, shortly before his death, Ekbert I attempted to repudiate Immilla in order to marry Adela of Louvain, daughter of Lambert II, Count of Louvain and the widow of Otto I, Margrave of Meissen. After Ekbert's death in 1068, Immilla spent some time at the imperial court with her niece Bertha, before returning to Italy. It is possible that she acted as regent for her young son, Ekbert II, at this time.Immilla died in Turin in January 10, 1078. She is sometimes said to have become a nun before her death.\n\nMarriages and children\nWith her first husband, Otto, Immilla had five daughters:\n\nBertha (or Alberada) (died 1 April 1103), married firstly Herman II, Count of Kastl, and married secondly Frederick, Count of Kastl\nGisela, inherited Kulmbach and Plassenburg, married Arnold IV, Count of Andechs\nJudith (died 1104), married firstly Conrad I, Duke of Bavaria, and secondly Botho, Count of Pottenstein\nEilika, abbess of Niedermünster\nBeatrice (1040–1140), inherited Schweinfurt, married Henry II, Count of Hildrizhausen and Margrave of the NordgauWith her second husband, Ekbert I, Immilla had the following children:\n\nEkbert II\nGertrude\nPassage 2:\nVolkold\nVolkold of Meissen (also Wolcold, Folcold, Folchold, Volhold, Volkhuld, Volchrad, Vocco; died 23 August 992) was the second Bishop of Meissen.\n\nLife\nBefore his elevation to the episcopate all that is known of Volkold's life is that he was at the court of Emperor Otto I as one of the tutors of the Emperor's son, the  future Otto II. He seems to have been appointed Bishop of Meissen in 969. Before his elevation Volkold was the patron of the young Willigis, later Saint Willigis, and used his influence to obtain for him a position in the Imperial service. In 972 Volkold attended a synod in Ingelheim.When Boleslaus II, Duke of Bohemia, besieged the Albrechtsburg and the town of Meissen in 984 in support of the Imperial ambitions of Henry II of Bavaria after the death of Otto II, Volkold was obliged to seek refuge from the Sorbs in Erfurt, under the protection of Willigis, and was not able to return to his badly-damaged headquarters until after the re-conquest by Ekkehard I, Margrave of Meissen, in 987. In that year he put the diocese under Imperial protection.Doubtless as compensation for the bishopric's many losses he received from Otto II several gifts of estates, tolls and uses.While on a visit to Prague he suffered a stroke, on Good Friday 992, and returned paralysed to Meissen, where he died on 23 August and was buried.\nPassage 3:\nAlbrecht I of Meissen\nAlbrecht I of Meissen (died 1 August 1152) was Bishop of Meissen from 1150 to 1152.\n\nLife\nAlbrecht I is not extensively documented. He was supposedly from a family of the Sorbian nobility. Before his elevation to the bishopric he was a cathedral provost. Otto von Freising mentions Albrecht in 1151 in connection with the dispute between Friedrich II of Berg and Herman van Horne over the office of bishop of Utrecht.\nWith the agreement of the Pope, the bishopric of Meissen, like that of Naumburg, was under the protection of Burggraf Conrad I of Meissen, in return for which the bishops were expected to undertake appropriate tasks from time to time. At the beginning of 1152 Conrad III entrusted Albrecht, who had the reputation of being talented at languages, with a diplomatic mission to the Byzantine Emperor Manuel I Komnenos. The bishop died either on the way to Constantinople or in the city itself.\nPassage 4:\nJohn I, Duke of Brunswick-Grubenhagen\nJohn I, Duke of Brunswick-Grubenhagen (born: before 1322; died: 23 May 1367) was provost of the St. Alexandri Minster in Einbeck.\nHe was the son of Duke Henry I \"the Marvelous\" of Brunswick-Grubenhagen and his wife Agnes of Meissen, daughter of Margrave Albert II of Meissen.\nPassage 5:\nAgnes of Waiblingen\nAgnes of Waiblingen (1072/73 – 24 September 1143), also known as Agnes of Germany, Agnes of Poitou and Agnes of Saarbrücken, was a member of the Salian imperial family.  Through her first marriage, she was Duchess of Swabia; through her second marriage, she was Margravine of Austria.\n\nFamily\nShe was the daughter of Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor, and Bertha of Savoy.\n\nFirst marriage\nIn 1079, aged seven, Agnes was betrothed to Frederick, a member of the Hohenstaufen dynasty; at the same time, Henry IV invested Frederick as the new duke of Swabia. The couple married in 1086, when Agnes was fourteen. They had twelve children, eleven of whom were named in a document found in the abbey of Lorsch:\n\nHedwig-Eilike (1088–1110), married Friedrich, Count of Legenfeld\nBertha-Bertrade (1089–1120), married Adalbert, Count of Elchingen\nFrederick II of Swabia\nHildegard\nConrad III of Germany\nGisihild-Gisela\nHeinrich (1096–1105)\nBeatrix (1098–1130), became an abbess\nKunigunde-Cuniza (1100–1120/1126), wife of Henry X, Duke of Bavaria (1108–1139)\nSophia, married Konrad II, Count of Pfitzingen\nFides-Gertrude, married Hermann III, Count Palatine of the Rhine\nRichildis, married Hugh I, Count of Roucy\n\nSecond marriage\nFollowing Frederick's death in 1105, Agnes married Leopold III (1073–1136), the Margrave of Austria (1095–1136). According to a legend, a veil lost by Agnes and found by Leopold years later while hunting was the instigation for him to found the Klosterneuburg Monastery.Their children were:\nAdalbert\nLeopold IV\nHenry II of Austria\nBerta, married Heinrich of Regensburg\nAgnes, \"one of the most famous beauties of her time\", married Wladyslaw II of Poland\nErnst\nUta, wife of Liutpold von Plain\nOtto of Freising, bishop and biographer\nConrad, Bishop of Passau, and Archbishop of Salzburg\nElisabeth, married Hermann, Count of Winzenburg\nJudith, m. c. 1133 William V of Montferrat. Their children formed an important Crusading dynasty.\nGertrude, married Vladislav II of BohemiaAccording to the Continuation of the Chronicles of Klosterneuburg, there may have been up to seven other children (possibly from multiple births) stillborn or who died in infancy.\nIn 2013, documentation regarding the results of DNA testing of the remains of the family buried in Klosterneuburg Abbey strongly favor that Adalbert was the son of Leopold and Agnes.In 1125, Agnes' brother, Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor, died childless, leaving Agnes and her children as heirs to the Salian dynasty's immense allodial estates, including Waiblingen.\nIn 1127, Agnes' second son, Konrad III, was elected as the rival King of Germany by those opposed to the Saxon party's Lothar III. When Lothar died in 1137, Konrad was elected to the position.\nPassage 6:\nMargaret of Sicily\nMargaret of Sicily (also called Margaret of Hohenstaufen or Margaret of Germany) (1 December 1241, in Foggia – 8 August 1270, in Frankfurt-am-Main) was a Princess of Sicily and Germany, and a member of the House of Hohenstaufen. By marriage she was Landgravine of Thuringia and Countess Palatine of Saxony (German: Landgräfin von Thüringen und Pfalzgräfin von Sachsen).\nShe was the daughter of Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor, King of Sicily and Germany, by his third wife, Isabella of England.  Her paternal grandparents were Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor and Constance of Sicily. Her maternal grandparents were John of England and Isabella of Angoulême.\n\nBirth\nThe date of her birth is difficult to ascertain because there is controversy over the exact number of children borne by her mother. Some sources say that she was the first or second child, born by the end of 1237; others say that she was the last child, born in December 1241, when Isabella died in childbirth. Historians commonly accept the latter date.\n\nLife\nShortly after her birth (1242), Margaret was betrothed to Albert \"the Degenerate\", eldest son and heir of Henry III \"the Illustrious\", Margrave of Meissen. The marriage took place in June 1255, the bride receiving Pleissnerland (the towns of Altenburg, Zwickau, Chemnitz and Leisnig) as her dowry.\nThe couple settled at his residence in Eckartsberga and later moved to Wartburg, where she bore five children: three sons (Henry, Frederick and Dietzmann) and two daughters (Margaret and Agnes). Through her second son Frederick – later Margrave of Meissen – Margaret was the direct ancestor of the Electors and Kings of Saxony and English Queen consorts Margaret of Anjou and Anne of Cleves.\nIn 1265 her husband received the titles of Landgrave of Thuringia and Count Palatine of Saxony (German: Pfalzgräf von Sachsen) after the abdication of his father, who retained control of Meissen.\nAfter the execution of her nephew Conradin (29 October 1268), Margaret, as the next legitimate relative, became the rightful Queen of Sicily and the general heiress of the Hohenstaufen claims over the Duchy of Swabia and the Kingdom of Jerusalem (despite the fact she was not descended from the Kings of Jerusalem, her father Frederick II had claimed the kingdom for himself). Her son Frederick assumed by some time this titles on her right.\nAfter discovering the adultery of her husband with Kunigunde of Eisenberg, Margaret left Wartburg; according to a legend, before her departure she bit her son Frederick in the cheek; he was called henceforth Frederick the Bitten (de: Friedrich der Gebissene). The flight took place on 24 June 1270. Margaret went to Frankfurt-am-Main and was supported there by the citizens. She died there six weeks later.\n\nIssue\nMargaret and Albert had five children:\n\nHenry (b. 21 March 1256 – d. 25 January/23 July? 1282), inherited the Pleissnerland in 1274.\nFrederick (b. 1257 – d.

On 7 September 1356, at the age of twenty six, she married Frederick V, Burgrave of Nuremberg in Jena. In 1357 her husband succeeded to the title, and from that time until her death in 1375, she was styled as Burgravine of Nuremberg. Together Frederick and Elisabeth had nine children, seven girls and two boys, who survived to adulthood:\n\nElisabeth (1358–26 July 1411, Heidelberg), married in Amberg 1374 to Rupert of Germany.\nBeatrix (c. 1362, Nuremberg–10 June 1414, Perchtoldsdorf), married in Vienna 1375 Duke Albert III of Austria\nAnna (c. 1364–after 10 May 1392), a nun in Seusslitz.\nAgnes (1366 – 22 May 1432), Convent in Hof (1376–1386) married in Konstance 1386 Baron Friedrich of Daber, Returned to Convent in Hof (1406) Abbess in Hof (1411–1432).\nJohn (c. 1369–11 June 1420, Plassenburg).\nFrederick (1371–1440) was the last Burgrave of Nuremberg from 1397 to 1427 (as Frederick VI), Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach from 1398, Margrave of Brandenburg-Kulmbach from 1420, and Elector of Brandenburg (as Frederick I) from 1415 until his death.

In 1184, she was elected successor to Princess-Abbess Adelaide III.\nAgnes was a significant patron of art, as well as miniaturist and engraver. During her reign, the nuns of Quedlinburg Abbey made large curtains that are indispensable in the study of the art industry of the era. She also wrote and illuminated books for divine service. However, her greatest masterpiece was the manufacture of wall-hangings, of which one set was intended to be sent to the Pope; this tapestry is the best preserved piece of Romanesque textile. She was known for combining her embroidering with her literary composition and even composed Latin verses on a piece of tapestry.She died in Quedlinburg Abbey on 21 January 1203.\n\nLegacy\nAgnes is a featured figure on Judy Chicago's installation piece The Dinner Party, being represented as one of the 999 names on the Heritage Floor.\nPassage 9:\nAlbert, Margrave of Meissen (1934–2012)\nPrince Albert Joseph Maria Franz-Xaver of Saxony, Duke of Saxony, Margrave of Meissen (30 November 1934 – 6 October 2012) was the head of the Royal House of Saxony and a German historian. The fourth child and youngest son of Friedrich Christian, Margrave of Meissen and his wife Princess Elisabeth Helene of Thurn and Taxis, he was the younger brother of Maria Emanuel, Margrave of Meissen, who was his predecessor as head of the Royal House of Saxony. Had he been King he would have been known as Albert II\n\nLife\nAlbert received his secondary education at the Federal Gymnasium in Bregenz, Austria. He passed his matura in 1954.  His parents and their children then moved to Munich, with support from his mother's relatives from the Thurn und Taxis dynasty.  In Munich, Albert studied at the Ludwig Maximilian University. He initially studied macroeconomics, and later switched to history and ethnography.  On 13 February 1961, he received his PhD for a thesis on his great-great-grandfather, King John of Saxony, and his reform of Saxon commercial law.\nOn 30 January 1960 the Studiengruppe für Sächsische Geschichte und Kultur e.V. (\"Study group for Saxon history and culture\") was founded by Albert together with his parents, his elder brother Maria Emanuel, some other Saxon nobles, the Chapter of the Military Order of St. Henry, the chapter of the association of people from Dresden, and the association of Heimatvertriebene in the history department of the University of Munich. This study group became one of the largest historical societies in West Germany. After completing his studies, Albert worked as a historian and referent. He studied the history of the Duchy of Saxony and the Kingdom of Saxony, in particular the relationship of Saxony to Bavaria.\nAt times, he was vice president of the Bund der Mitteldeutschen (\"Association of Central Germans\").  In 1972, he joined the Mitteldeutschen Kulturrat e.V. (\"Central German Culture Council\"), where he represented the interests of the Free State of Saxony.\nIn the summer of 1982, he was allowed to visit Saxony for the first time since his youth. He visited again in 1983 and 1985. He was then not allowed to enter the German Democratic Republic again, for unknown reasons, until 1989/1990. On 22 January 1990, he participated in a Monday demonstration in Dresden and was unexpectedly asked to address the crowd. He told his audience about their task to rebuild Saxony and ended with the words \"Long live Saxony, Germany, Europe and the western-Christian culture.\"\nIn the subsequent elections for the Saxon parliament, he ran as a DSU candidate; he was not elected, nor did the newly elected government of Saxony employ him as an advisor. After the German reunification, he has tried to reclaim some of his family's former possessions.\n\nMarriage\nAlbert morganatically wed Elmira Henke in a civil ceremony on 10 April 1980 in Munich, and in a religious ceremony on 12 April 1980, in the Theatine Church, also in Munich. Elmira assisted Albert with his scientific and historical studies; she specialized in ethnographic topics. Albert and Elmira had no children.\n\nSuccession\nThe headship of the Royal House of Saxony is a matter of dispute in the Saxon Royal Family. The conflict stems from the fact that the last undisputed head of the house Maria Emanuel, Margrave of Meissen, and the other princes of his generation either had no children or, in the case of Prince Timo, had children (including Prince Rüdiger of Saxony) who were deemed not to be members of the Royal House of Saxony.The first designated dynastic heir of Maria Emanuel was his and Albert's nephew Prince Johannes of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, only son of their youngest sister Princess Mathilde of Saxony by her marriage to Prince Johannes Heinrich of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, dynast of a ducal branch of the House of Wettin senior patrilineally to the royal branch. After the early death of Prince Johannes, the heirless Maria Emanuel then considered as potential heir another nephew, Alexander Afif, the eldest son of Princess Anna of Saxony and her husband Roberto Afif, despite the Afif-Saxony marriage being contrary to the traditional laws of the House of Saxony which required equal marriages for descendants to inherit dynastic rights. On 14 May 1997 the Margrave of Meissen proposed his nephew Alexander Afif as heir and drew up a document that was signed by the other male and female members of the Royal House (including previously non-dynastic spouses of princes) setting out that Alexander would succeed on his death. The document was signed by: Anastasia, Margravine of Meissen, Prince Albert and his wife, née Elmira Henke, Prince Dedo (for himself, for his brother Prince Gero and for their stepmother née Virginia Dulon – his brother Prince Timo had died in 1982), the Princesses Maria Josepha, Anna and Mathilde, and Prince Timo's third wife, née Erina Eilts. Two years later on 1 July 1999 the Margrave adopted his nephew Alexander Afif, who had used the title Alexander, Prince of Saxe-Gessaphe since 1972, based on his patrilineal descent from the once-sovereign Lebanese \"Afif\" (or Gessaphe) dynasty.The 1997 agreement proved to be controversial and in the summer of 2002 three of the signatories, Princes Albert, Dedo and Gero (the latter consented via proxy but had not personally signed the document) retracted their support for the agreement. The following year Prince Albert wrote that it is through Prince Rüdiger and his sons that the direct line of the Albertine branch of the House of Wettin will continue, and thus avoid becoming extinct. Until his death, however, the Margrave, as head of the former dynasty, continued to regard his nephew and adopted son, Prince Alexander, as the contractual heir entitled to succeed.Immediately following the death of Maria Emanuel in July 2012, Prince Albert assumed the position of head of the Royal House of Saxony. According to the Eurohistory Journal prior to the Margrave's funeral Albert met with his nephew, Alexander, and recognised him as Margrave of Meissen. However this claim is contradicted by Albert himself in his final interview, given after the funeral, where he states that he needs recognition as Margrave of Meissen. Prince Alexander, citing the 1997 agreement, has also assumed the headship. Albert, Margrave of Meissen died at a hospital in Munich on 6 October 2012 at the age of 77.\nPrior to the requiem for Margrave Maria Emanuel, Rüdiger, who had sought to be recognised by his cousin as a dynastic member of the House of Saxony but was refused, conducted a demonstration outside the cathedral with Saxon royalists in protest against the late Margrave Maria Emanuel's decision to appoint Alexander as heir. \nThe family website of Prince Rüdiger states that, prior to his death, Albert determined Rüdiger to be his successor and instituted a clear succession plan.

Prior to his current position, Govan worked as the director of the Dia Art Foundation in New York City.\n\nEarly life and education\nGovan was born in 1963 in North Adams, Massachusetts, and was raised in the Washington D.C. area, attending Sidwell Friends School.He majored in art history and fine arts at Williams College, where he met Thomas Krens, who was then director of the Williams College Museum of Art. Govan became closely involved with the museum, serving as acting curator as an undergraduate. After receiving his B.A. from Williams in 1985, Govan began an MFA in fine arts from the University of California, San Diego.\n\nCareer\nAs a twenty-five year old graduate student, Govan was recruited by his former mentor at Williams, Thomas Krens, who in 1988 had been appointed director of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation. Govan served as deputy director of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum under Krens from 1988 to 1994, a period that culminated in the construction and opening of the Frank Gehry designed Guggenheim branch in Bilbao, Spain. Govan supervised the reinstallation of the museum's permanent collection galleries after its extensive renovation.\n\nDia Art Foundation\nFrom 1994 to 2006, Govan was president and director of Dia Art Foundation in New York City. There, he spearheaded the conversion of a Nabisco box factory into the 300,000 square foot Dia:Beacon in New York's Hudson Valley, which houses Dia's collection of art from the 1960s to the present. Built in a former Nabisco box factory, the critically acclaimed museum has been credited with catalyzing a cultural and economic revival within the formerly factory-based city of Beacon. Dia's collection nearly doubled in size during Govan's tenure, but he also came under criticism for \"needlessly and permanently\" closing Dia's West 22nd Street building. During his time at Dia, Govan also worked closely with artists James Turrell and Michael Heizer, becoming an ardent supporter of Roden Crater and City, the artists' respective site-specific land art projects under construction in the American southwest. Govan successfully lobbied Washington to have the 704,000 acres in central Nevada surrounding City declared a national monument in 2015.\n\nLACMA\nIn February 2006, a search committee composed of eleven LACMA trustees, led by the late Nancy M. Daly, recruited Govan to run the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. Govan has stated that he was drawn to the role not only because of LACMA's geographical distance from its European and east coast peers, but also because of the museum's relative youth, having been established in 1961. \"I felt that because of this newness I had the opportunity to reconsider the museum,\" Govan has written, \"[and] Los Angeles is a good place to do that.\"Govan has been widely regarded for transforming LACMA into both a local and international landmark. Since Govan's arrival, LACMA has acquired by donation or purchase over 27,000 works for the permanent collection, and the museum's gallery space has almost doubled thanks to the addition of two new buildings designed by Renzo Piano, the Broad Contemporary Art Museum (BCAM) and the Lynda and Stewart Resnick Pavilion. LACMA's annual attendance has grown from 600,000 to nearly 1.6 million in 2016.\n\nArtist collaborations\nSince his arrival, Govan has commissioned exhibition scenography and gallery designs in collaboration with artists. In 2006, for example, Govan invited LA artist John Baldessari to design an upcoming exhibition about the Belgian surrealist René Magritte, resulting in a theatrical show that reflected the twisted perspective of the latter's topsy-turvy world. Baldessari has also designed LACMA's logo. Since then, Govan has also commissioned Cuban-American artist Jorge Pardo to design LACMA's Art of the Ancient Americas gallery, described in the Los Angeles Times as a \"gritty cavern deep inside the earth ... crossed with a high-style urban lounge.\"Govan has also commissioned several large-scale public artworks for LACMA's campus from contemporary California artists. These include Chris Burden's Urban Light (2008), a series of 202 vintage street lamps from different neighborhoods in Los Angeles, arranged in front of the entrance pavilion, Barbara Kruger's Untitled (Shafted) (2008), Robert Irwin's Primal Palm Garden (2010), and Michael Heizer's Levitated Mass, a 340-ton boulder transported 100 miles from the Jurupa Valley to LACMA, a widely publicized journey that culminated with a large celebration on Wilshire Boulevard. Thanks in part to the popularity of these public artworks, LACMA was ranked the fourth most instagrammed museum in the world in 2016.In his first three full years, the museum raised $251 million—about $100 million more than it collected during the three years before he arrived. In 2010, it was announced that Govan will steer LACMA for at least six more years. In a letter dated February 24, 2013, Govan, along with the LACMA board's co-chairmen Terry Semel and Andrew Gordon, proposed a merger with the financially troubled Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles and a plan to raise $100 million for the combined museum.\n\nZumthor Project\nGovan's latest project is an ambitious building project, the replacement of four of the campus's aging buildings with a single new state of the art gallery building designed by architect Peter Zumthor. As of January 2017, he has raised about $300 million in commitments. Construction is expected to begin in 2018, and the new building will open in 2023, to coincide with the opening of the new D Line metro stop on Wilshire Boulevard. The project also envisages dissolving all existing curatorial departments and departmental collections. Some commentators have been highly critical of Govan's plans. Joseph Giovannini, recalling Govan's technically unrealizable onetime plan to hang Jeff Koons' Train sculpture from the facade of the Ahmanson Gallery, has accused Govan of \"driving the institution over a cliff into an equivalent mid-air wreck of its own\". Describing the collection merging proposal as the creation of a \"giant raffle bowl of some 130,000 objects\", Giovannini also points out that the Zumthor building will contain 33% less gallery space than the galleries it will replace, and that the linear footage of wall space available for displays will decrease by about 7,500 ft, or 1.5 miles. Faced with losing a building named in its honor, and anticipating that its acquisitions could no longer be displayed, the Ahmanson Foundation withdrew its support.\nOn the merging of the separate curatorial divisions to create a non-departmental art museum, Christopher Knight has pointed out that \"no other museum of LACMA's size and complexity does it\" that way, and characterized the museum's 2019 \"To Rome and Back\" exhibition, the first to take place under the new scheme, as \"bland and ineffectual\" and an \"unsuccessful sample of what's to come\".\n\nPersonal life\nGovan is married and has two daughters, one from a previous marriage. He and his family used to live in a $6 million mansion in Hancock Park that was provided by LACMA - a benefit worth $155,000 a year, according to most recent tax filings - until LACMA decided that it would sell the property to make up for the museum's of almost $900 million in debt [2]. That home is now worth nearly $8 million and Govan now lives in a trailer park in Malibu's Point Dume region.\nLos Angeles CA 90020\nUnited States.

Since 2018, the magazine has been edited by current English professor Beth Staples. According to Shenandoah's mission statement, the magazine aims to showcase diverse voices because \"reading through the perspective of another person, persona, or character is one of the ways we practice empathy, expand our understanding of the world, and experience new levels of awareness.\"Shenandoah was founded in 1949 by a group of Washington and Lee University faculty members, including English professor Samuel Ashley Brown, who published the fiction and poetry of undergraduates including Tom Wolfe. In the 1950s Thomas H. Carter became one of the founding student editors.  During his tenure the Shenandoah corresponded with E. E. Cummings, William Carlos Williams, William Faulkner, Ezra Pound and many other Southern writers and the Shenandoah grew in stature and national prominence. From the 1960s to the 1980s, W&L faculty member James Boatwright expanded the journal and published occasional theme issues, including a 35th anniversary anthology. In 1995, R. T. Smith was selected as the first full-time editor of the journal. In 2018 after twenty-three years as editor, R. T. Smith retired, and Beth Staples took over as editor of the magazine.  Today, the magazine publishes biannually in the spring and fall. \nShenandoah is funded and supported by Washington and Lee University through the Office of the Dean of the College and is located in Mattingly House on W&L's campus. The magazine maintains a board of university advisors who offer guidance and advice, and the current editor maintains an intern program in which undergraduate students work for the journal and learn the craft of editing as an academic course in the English Department. \nRecent contributors include Wendell Berry, Joyce Carol Oates, Jacob M. Appel, Speer Morgan, Lee Smith, Claudia Emerson, May-lee Chai, and Rita Dove.  This list complements a long history of literary luminaries who have been published in Shenandoah such as W. H. Auden, James Merrill, J. R. R. Tolkien, T. S. Eliot, Ray Bradbury, and Flannery O'Connor.\nSince moving away from print in 2011, the magazine can now be found online in its entirety.\n\nFellowships and Contest\nIn the past, Shenandoah has hosted several prestigious annual contests:  the James Boatwright III Prize for Poetry, the Goodheart Prize for Fiction, the Thomas H. Carter Prize for the Essay, and the Shenandoah/Glasgow Prize for Emerging Writers. Presently, Shenandoah host the Graybeal-Gowan Prize for Virginia Writers.  In 2021, Shenandoah launched a fellowship for BIPOC editors. Through a competitive application process, the magazine selects one fellow for each issue to aid in the selection of fiction, non-fiction, poems, or comics.\n\nRecent honors, awards and reviews\n2008 Governor's Award for the Arts \n\"The Worst You Ever Feel\" by Rebecca Makkai was included in The Best American Short Stories 2008.\n\"Souvenir\" by Beth Ann Fennelly was included in The Best American Poetry 2006\n\"Death Is Intended\" by Linda Pastan was included in The Best American Poetry 2005\n\"A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Stalker\" by Kate Osana Simonian was \"noted\" in The Best American Essays 2019\n\"Volume 68 Number 1: Bodies, Bones, and the Space We Occupy\" was given \"5 Stars\" on \"The Review Review\"\n\nSee also\nList of literary magazines\nPassage 5:\nLee McGeorge Durrell\nLee McGeorge Durrell  (née McGeorge; born September 7, 1949) is an American naturalist, author, zookeeper, and television presenter. She is best known for her work at the Jersey Zoological Park in the British Channel Island of Jersey with her late husband, Gerald Durrell, and for co-authoring books with him.\n\nBiography\nLee was born in Memphis, Tennessee, and showed an interest in wildlife as a child. She studied philosophy at Bryn Mawr College near Philadelphia before enrolling in 1971 for a graduate programme at Duke University, to study animal behaviour. She conducted research for her PhD on the calls of mammals and birds in Madagascar. She met Gerald Durrell when he gave a lecture at Duke University in 1977, and married him in 1979.Lee Durrell moved to Jersey and became involved with the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust (then the Jersey Wildlife Preservation Trust). She accompanied Durrell on his last three conservation missions:\n\nMauritius, other Mascarene Islands and Madagascar (1982) (account in Gerald Durrell's Ark on the Move)\nRussia (1986) (account in Durrell in Russia, co-authored with Gerald Durrell)\nMadagascar (1990) (account in Gerald Durrell's The Aye-Aye and I)She became the honorary director of the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust after the death of her husband in 1995. She was instrumental in getting the Jersey Wildlife Preservation Trust renamed after Gerald Durrell, on the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the Jersey Zoo. She is also a member of various expert groups on conservation, and is fondly called \"Mother Tortoise\" in certain areas of Madagascar due to her work with the ploughshare tortoise.\nIn December 2005, Lee Durrell handed over a large collection of dead animals (which had originally been collected and bred by her husband Gerald Durrell) to the National Museums of Scotland to aid genetic research of the critically rare species.Lee acted as consultant for The Durrells, a 2016 ITV six-part dramatisation of My Family and Other Animals.\n\nBibliography\nDurrell is the author of three books:\n\nA Practical Guide for the Amateur Naturalist (with Gerald Durrell) (Hamish Hamilton (UK) / Alfred A.

He graduated from Poly Prep Country Day School and Franklin and Marshall College (A.B. 1965) and American University (M.A. 1966). He received an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from Franklin and Marshall in 1989. While in college he was a member of Zeta Beta Tau.\n\nPolitical career\nDuberstein began his public service on Capitol Hill as an intern for Sen. Jacob K. Javits. His other early government service included Deputy Under Secretary of Labor during the Gerald Ford Administration and Director of Congressional and Intergovernmental Affairs at the U.S. General Services Administration.During Reagan's eight years in office, he had two stints in the White House. His first was as  Deputy Assistant to the President for Legislative Affairs (1981–83). His major accomplishment of this period was pushing Reagan's economic agenda through a Democratic House, including the  1982 Tax Bill. Duberstein was described as Reagan's invisible link to Congress. He was at the center of the Administrations push for the bill, working on both sides of the political divide.   His second stint was also for two years, first as Deputy Chief of Staff and then for the final six months of the Reagan presidency as White House Chief of Staff (1988–1989). Eight days after Reagan was on TV and acknowledged the Iran-Contra affair, Duberstein took over as chief of staff. Around that time it had been revealed that Nancy Reagan had used an astrologer to determine dates for the president's public appearances. Reagan's presidency had reached a low point; approval rating was at 37%. His promotion was called a wake-up call for a \"drowsy White House.\" He came to the job with energy, loyalty, hard work and enthusiasm, having earned the nickname Duderdog; and, he made sure to call Nancy twice a day. He had Reagan give a mea culpa address to the nation; poll numbers went right up and the presidency had been turned around.Duberstein is said to have been the first Jewish person to be White House Chief of Staff.Between his White House appointments, he was vice-president and director of Business-Government Relations of the Committee for Economic Development and was a lobbyist as vice president of Timmons & Company. Prior to 1987, he served on the Commission for the Preservation of America's Heritage Abroad, succeeded by Betty Heitman, previously co-chairwoman of the Republican National Committee.\n\nLater career\nIn January 1989, Duberstein was awarded the President's Citizens Medal by President Reagan. He was the chairman of the Ethics Committee for the U.S. Olympic Committee  and served as vice chairman of the independent Special Bid Oversight Reform Commission for the U.S. Olympics Committee. He also appeared on Bloomberg alongside John Podesta, and had 23 appearances on C-SPAN. Beginning in season five Duberstein was a consultant for the tv show The West Wing.In 2013, Duberstein was a signatory to an amicus curiae brief submitted to the United States Supreme Court in support of same-sex marriage in the Hollingsworth v. Perry case. His position succeeded, as the court would go on to effectively legalize same-sex marriage in California.\n\nLobbyist\nDuberstein transitioned from the White House to lobbyist; he was successful, and his insight and advice was sought by leaders of both parties. Duberstein founded The Duberstein Group Inc. in 1987. It is a consulting services company providing corporate consulting and government relations services. Among its client are Amazon, BP and MLB. Duberstein was hired by Russian authorities, via Goldman Sachs, to lobby against the Magnitsky Bill (as known as the Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law Accountability Act), a bill in the U.S. Congress \"to impose sanctions on persons responsible for the detention, abuse, or death of Sergei Magnitsky, and for other gross violations of human rights in the Russian Federation\". Duberstein showed discretion and did not discuss his work, leading to an \"air of mystery\" about him and what he did for his clients.\n\nEducation activities\nIn 2020, he established the Public Service Internship Endowment at his alma mater, Franklin and Marshall, assisting F&M students who secure unpaid internships in public service in Washington, D.C. He was on the college's Board of Trustees from 1994 to 2010, and then became an emeritus trustee. A space at the Franklin and Marshall Patricia E. Harris Center for Business, Government and Public Policy is named for him, the \"Duberstein West Wing\". He spoke at the dedication of the center and led fund raising for the building's renovations. At Harvard Kennedy School, he chaired a senior advisory committee and was a “constant and inspiring presence” to students.\n\nPolitical adviser\nHe was an adviser to former Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage, according to syndicated columnist Robert Novak, who said that Duberstein was a source for David Corn's and Michael Isikoff's book about the Valerie Plame affair in which Armitage was found to be the one who leaked Plame's CIA status to Novak.Duberstein and Colin Powell became close during his time as chief of staff and Powell's position as National Security Advisor in the Reagan White House.  When Powell considered a 1996 presidential run, he was advised by Duberstein. Duberstein guided him to \"play the press\" and win over Republican leaders.  Powell ended up not making the run.  When Powell's reputation was damaged by his role in the 2003 Iraq War, he used Duberstein to act as a consigliere to repair his name.Duberstein guided Supreme Court Justices David Souter and Clarence Thomas through their ritualistic confirmation proceedings. Other high level appointees he advised and guided through confirmation hearings included CIA Director Robert M. Gates and Secretary of State George P. Shultz. His business partner, Michael S. Berman, a Democrat, performed similar tasks for Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer.\n\nBoards\nDuberstein enjoyed lucrative posts on countless boards of directors, including The Boeing Company, ConocoPhillips, the Fleming Companies, Inc., and The St. Paul Companies, Inc. He was also on the Board of Governors for the American Stock Exchange and NASD, and served on the Board of Directors of Fannie Mae. He served on the advisory board for Washington, DC-based non-profit America Abroad Media.\n\nPersonality\nDuberstein, a \"back-slapping Brooklyn native,\" was one of the most connected Washington people. \"A permanent Washington fixture,\" he was a regular at Washington parties and network talk shows.  A gregarious and rumpled, wise-cracking ‘people person’ of relentless optimism and energy...the consummate Washington insider and institutionalist, a big man with an easy smile and a generous laugh who could be hard-nosed, loved gossiping with reporters, believed in bipartisanship and offered his advice to anyone who asked — especially those who succeeded him in the chief of staff job. Duberstein noted that as a Brooklynite he always enjoyed working with people. As a \"cultivator\" of the press he was generally discreet, refusing to be quoted by name, even for articles about himself. He was forever loved by the Washington press for all the leaking he did during the Reagan years; and, \"he loved being Ken Duberstein.\"\n\nPolitical views\nDuberstein was a political moderate Rockefeller Republican, fiscally conservative and socially moderate.\nBefore McCain secured the 2008 Republican presidential nomination, Duberstein made inquiries about running the transition team; McCain was not interested.  He later broke from his party in the election and supported Obama; commenting on the nomination of Sarah Palin for vice-president, he said: “Even at McDonald's, you’re interviewed three times before you’re given a job.\"\n\nPersonal life, health and death\nDuberstein was married three times, with his first two marriages, to Marjorie Duberstein and Sydney Duberstein, ending in divorce. He had a daughter from the first marriage and three children from the second. He was then married to Jacqueline Fain, a former TV producer, for 18 years until his death. At their 2003 wedding, Supreme Court Justice David Souter was the officiant and Marvin Hamlisch provided the music.  He had a history of kidney disease, and in 2014, received a kidney transplant; his son was the donor. After a long illness, Duberstein died at Sibley Memorial Hospital in Washington on March 2, 2022, at the age of 77. The funeral was at Washington Hebrew Congregation\nPassage 8:\nRobert Huntley\nRobert E. R. Huntley (1929 – December 10, 2015) was an American attorney, businessman, retired law professor, and former president of Washington and Lee University.He graduated from Washington and Lee in 1950 and its law school in 1957. He obtained a master's degree in law from Harvard University in 1962. He joined the law faculty of Washington and Lee in 1958, and served as its dean from 1967 to 1968. In 1968 he was named president of the university, a post he held for 15 years.\nHe practiced law with the Richmond, Virginia law firm of Hunton & Williams from 1988 until his retirement in 1995. He also served as chairman, president and chief executive officer of Best Products. He also served on the board of directors of Altria Group.\n\nRecognition\nWashington and Lee established the endowed Robert E. R.

Didusch Center For Urologic History, located in the same country?", "context": "Passage 1:\nThe Museums at Washington and Chapin\nThe Museums at Washington and Chapin are several museums that share a campus in South Bend, Indiana. The name is derived from the location, at the corner of Washington Street and Chapin Street in South Bend. Both museums have one common entrance off Thomas Street, one block south of Washington Street. The museums currently include the History Museum and Studebaker National Museum.\n\nExternal links\nStudebaker National Museum\nThe History Museum\nPassage 2:\nWilliam P. Didusch Center for Urologic History\nThe William P. Didusch Center for Urologic History is a museum and the headquarters of the American Urological Association in Linthicum, Maryland. It is described as encompassing \"a rich and varied collection of drawings, photographs, and instruments of historical importance to urology, many displayed in the urological exhibits during the American Urological Association (AUA) conventions.\"\n\nBackground\nThe center is named in honor of William Didusch, the museum's founder and first curator. Didusch was a notable scientific illustrator, and Executive Secretary of the AUA. Didusch had begun working at Johns Hopkins University in 1915 as an illustrator and eventually a lecturer. Didusch was an artist but more committed to the drawing of illustrations, rather than paintings, of anatomy. As result he became a legend during his time after his work in Johns Hopkins Hospital. Some of his many illustrations were those of the anatomy of the urinary tract and instruments used to treat the urinary diseases. The museum was formally established in 1971 as the William P. Didusch Museum, following Didusch's gift to the American Urological Association of his many original urological drawings. It was accommodated within the headquarters buildings of the AUA, then on Charles Street in Baltimore. Didusch curated the museum until his death in 1981, when he was succeeded by Herbert Brendler. After Brendler's death in 1986, William W. Scott (a colleague of Nobel Laureate Charles Huggins at the University of Chicago) became curator of the museum. When Scott retired in 1993, the post of curator went to Rainer Engel of Johns Hopkins. In 2003 – when the AUA moved to Linthicum, Maryland – the museum also moved. Its scope was extended to relate to the topic of research in urologic history. Engel remained curator until 2011, when Michael Moran took over the position.\n\nCollection\n\nThe museum provides 300 years of the history of urology, beginning from early and extremely dangerous kidney stone surgeries to modern ultra sound treatments that \"pulverizes these jagged mineral clumps without any need to enter the body\". It includes illustrations, urological tools such as catheters, cystoscopes (includes Nitze cystoscopes made in 1890 with platinum loops for illumination and rotating cystoscopes), operating resectoscopes, laparoscopes, lithotriptors, and resectoscopes; some of this urologic equipment was sterilized using formaldehyde or cyanide. All was donated by urologists, including Ernest F. Hock of Binghamton, New York, Hans Reuter of Stuttgart, Germany and Adolf A. Kutzmann of Los Angeles.The Center also aids research in all fields of urologic history in the United States. It contains an extensive urological library, with early urological and medical texts, and the AUA archives.Current AUA Historian Engel considers the museum to show how medical history in urology evolved, and notes that the implements on display frequently scare visitors. Amongst its items are \"long, thick metal tubes that once opened the floodgates between some unfortunate soul's bladder and the outside world\", lassoes and nutcrackers on the end of steel tubes to break bladder stones, and Hugh Hampton Young's \"Prostate Punch\", which resembles a \"massively enlarged and curved hypodermic needle designed for the blind resection of prostate tissues\", used in prostate surgery (to ream out the tube of prostate tissue blindly); this last implement was used on the wealthy railway magnate Diamond Jim Brady, who—cured of a prostate problem—gave a generous donation to Johns Hopkins which enabled the establishment of the Brady Urological Institute and also the museum.A number of very large mineral samples of kidney stones are also on display. The collection in the museum also includes more than 30 microscopes dating as far back as the 18th century, along with operating manuals; this acquisition on loan from a German urology family.A popular display is the \"spermatorrhea ring\", a device from the early 20th century used to prevent ejaculations while sleeping. It is made of a double ring of metal, with the inner ring clipped over the penis and the outer ring, which is lined on the inside with an armature of blunt metal teeth, on the shaft. These teeth constitute what could be called the \"medically active ingredient\". In the event of voluntary unknowing erection while sleeping, \"the sensitive skin of the engorged part expands against the spiky outer ring, and the sleeper is pricked into consciousness in time to prevent nature from committing an unspeakable crime against itself\".\nPassage 3:\nLake City-Columbia County Historical Museum\nLake City-Columbia County Historical Museum is a living history museum at the May Vinzant Perkins House in Lake City, Florida.\n\nHistory\nThe Lake City-Columbia County Historical Museum is located in the Vinzant House. The house was built in the 1880s and purchased by John Vinzant Jr. for $450. Vinzant had come to Lake City after serving in the American Civil War as a sergeant in the 1st Florida Cavalry. Vinzant was the Columbia County Clerk of the Circuit Court and County Tax Collector. Vinzant also contributed to the Florida Agricultural College Fund when it was established about 1 mile south from the house in 1888. Vinzant was married to Mattie Vinzant and had three daughters: Cronin Ives, Birdie Livingston and May Perkins. John Vinzant died in 1907. Vinzant's youngest daughter May Perkins was married to Herbert Perkins and moved away to Washington, D.C. In 1912 May Perkins had a son but he died in infancy and then her husband died shortly afterwards. May Perkins returned to her father's house in Lake City. May Perkins' mother Mattied died in 1926 leaving her to live alone at the house until her death in 1981 at 102 years old. Perkins became a notable Lake City poet and historian. Since the death of Perkins in 1981 the house is still called the May Vinzant Perkins house. \nThe Historic Preservation Board of Lake City and Columbia County jointly bought the house with the Blue-Grey Army, Inc. in 1983. The two groups wanted to restore the house and make it a historical and cultural center as well as a museum. The house was renovated in 1984 by the Blue-Grey Army to turn the May Vinzant Perkins house into a museum as well as to save the house from being demolished since it was in poor condition. In 2000 a plaque was placed on the front of the house commemorating May Vinzant Perkins as a notable Floridian.Lake City holds an annual Battle of Olustee festival in downtown. Events are held at the Lake City-Columbia County Museum related to civil war history such as caring for wounded civil war soldiers or performing plays in relation to the civil war. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic the museum had to close from March to the second week of May 2020.\n\nBlue-Grey Army\nThe Blue-Grey Army is an organization that has collected civil war artifacts and annually sponsors the Battle of Olustee Festival in Lake City. The organization jointly bought the Vinzant house with the Lake City Columbia County Historical Society. A room in the museum holds the Blue-Grey Army's civil war artifacts and is called the Blue-Grey Army room.\n\nGallery\nPassage 4:\nHistorical Museum of Serbia\nThe Historical Museum of Serbia (Serbian: Историјски музеј Србије/Istorijski muzej Srbije, IMUS) is a public institution dedicated to documentation of history of Serbia from prehistory up to the present. The museum was established in 1963 and today it preserves over 35,000 exhibits in its collection. Over the years the museum was located at different locations around the capital city of Belgrade. In 2020, as a part of the Belgrade Waterfront development project, the museum was granted the historical building of the Belgrade Main railway station as its new permanent base. The museum is one of the leading institutions of its kind in the city and the country.\n\nHistory\nThe first unsuccessful initiative to establish the museum was taken in 1950 with the enactment of the Decree on the establishment of the History Museum of the People's Republic of Serbia. The proposal was reinitiated in 1954 with the establishment of the Serbian Revolution Museum (hosted by the Residence of Prince Miloš) commemorating the 150th anniversary of the First Serbian Uprising.The Historical Museum of Serbia was established by the decision of the People's Republic of Serbia authorities on 20 February 1963 with the new institution absorbing the Serbian Revolution Museum. The task of the Museum was defined in 1966 as follows: ″to collect, record, store, arrange, study and exhibit material from the history of the Serbian people and Serbia from the earliest times to the present day″.Until 2003 the museum published the  scientific journal Zbornik Istorijskog muzeja Srbije. Initially, from 1954 to 1965, it was published by the Serbian Revolution Museum.In November 2020 the Serbian government made the decision to relocate the museum to a far bigger building, which formerly served as Belgrade Main railway station.\n\nSee also\nList of museums in Serbia\nPassage 5:\nMuseum of the Sea (Uruguay)\nThe Museum of the Sea, opened in 1996, is a museum of natural history located in La Barra, in the department of Maldonado, Uruguay. It occupies about 2,300 m2 (25,000 sq ft) and is divided into four large halls, which are open to the public all year round.\n\nOverview\nThe museum contains over 5,000 specimens of marine fauna, all of which are clearly labelled. Among these specimens are whale skeletons, sea urchins, starfish and turtle shells. In addition, there are old photographs and an old bathing machine used by women in the early days of the 20th century, as well as telescopes and blunderbusses of the period. There is also an exhibit about the most famous pirates. This huge collection of objects, exhibits, photographs and stories is the work of the museum's creator, Pablo Etchegaray. This self-taught collector began his collection of marine-related items many years ago.\n\nExhibit halls\nThe Museum of the Sea is composed of four museums in one. In the Museum of the Sea, everything is related to marine life: whale skeletons, seashells, a deep sea room, interactive exhibits, an area where children can draw their own pictures, a section devoted to pirates and another to treasure. The Beach Resort Museum shows the history of holiday resorts, some of which are now city neighbourhoods, such as Pocitos and Carrasco, while others are tourist destinations, such as Punta del Este, La Paloma, Piriápolis, Atlántida, Mar del Plata and Copacabana. The Nostalgia Museum holds collections of vintage objects such as jars, tins, radio sets, medical remedies, photographs, and beach-related items such as beach umbrellas and pails that were used decades ago. Three collections and 38,000 specimens of insects are exhibited in the Insectarium. Most of the specimens are beetles, but there are also moths, cicadas, and grasshoppers, among other species.\nPassage 6:\nJoliet Area Historical Museum\nThe Joliet Area Historical Museum is a historical museum located in Joliet, Illinois.  The museum documents the history of Joliet and surrounding Will County.\n\nDescription and history\nThe museum adaptively reuses an urban space formerly occupied by the Ottawa Street Methodist Church, which was designed by Joliet architect G. Julian Barnes and built in 1909.  Located on one of the alternate paths of old historic U.S. Route 66, the museum's modern ground-floor addition features the Route 66 Welcome Center, which presents a permanent exhibit called the Route 66 Experience.  This newer part of the museum also connects to the historic Joliet Chamber of Commerce Clubhouse next door (now known as the Renaissance Center of the City Center campus of Joliet Junior College) and to the JJC Renaissance Center's main dining room, which is staffed by the college's hospitality and culinary school students and open to the public.During the late 20th century, formerly rural Will County townships grew rapidly, while properties in central city Joliet were threatened.  In 2002, the former church's urban space was reconfigured as a historic museum.  A separate wing is home to an exhibit about the Joliet-raised NASA engineer and JJC graduate John C. Houbolt, honored as the chief conceptualizer of the lunar orbit rendezvous segment of the U.S. Apollo program and the use of a lunar module to shuttle astronauts to and from the surface of the Moon.The museum is located at 204 N. Ottawa Street in central Joliet.  An admission fee is charged.As of 2014, the museum was seeking to establish guided tours of the landmark former Collins Street Prison for Route 66 travelers and other interested tourists. As of 2018, the museum began providing tours of the Collins Street Prison.\nPassage 7:\nAalborg Historical Museum\nAalborg Historical Museum (Danish: Aalborg Historiske Museum) is a historical and cultural museum in the city of Aalborg in Denmark. The museum was established in 1863 and is now part of The Historical Museum of Northern Jutland (Nordjyllands Historiske Museum).\n\nHistory\nAalborg Historical Museum was organized to explain the history of the city and the surrounding region for the past 1000 years. It was established in 1863, making it one of the earliest provincial museums in Denmark. The present museum was constructed in 1878 and expanded in the early 1890s to house the growing collection of items from the region's earliest inhabitants to modern times.\nAalborg Historical Museum has rotating exhibitions from its large collections and is particularly noted for its fine silver and glass collections. The museum also has a large collection of clothing and textiles items from the 18th century to the present.\nOf particular interest is the Aalborgstuen 1602. This well-preserved Renaissance paneled wooden room is claimed to be 'The best preserved middle class Renaissance interior' in Denmark.\nIn the 1950s Aalborg Historical Museum, conducted a series of archaeological excavations at Iron Age and Viking sites in the area, including Lindholm Høje, resulting ultimately in Lindholm Høje Museet at Lindholm Høje.In 1994 and 1995 the museum conducted excavations at the site of the former  Greyfriars Friary  (gråbrødrekloster)  in central Aalborg.  The excavations resulted in the creation of the \"in situ\" underground Gråbrødrekloster Museum (Gråbrødrekloster Museet).\n\nRecent history\nIn 2004 several organizations banded together to form The Historical Museum of Northern Jutland. The museum system is administered by a 12-member committee made of members from the constituent organizations which make up the museum.  These include: The Museum Society of Hadsund, the Museum Society for Hals Kommune, the Aalborg History Association, the North Jutland Association of Archaeology for Jutland, the Historical Community of Himmerland and Kjaer District, and the Cultural Historic Society of North Jutland. The umbrella organization coordinates research, outreach programs, educational programs, as well as manages the many properties in North Jutland which have been preserved by the various organizations.\n\nGallery\nPassage 8:\nHalifax Historical Museum\nThe Halifax Historical Museum displays local history from 5,000 BC to the present day in a National Register of Historic Places listed building designed by Wilbur B.

The river flows generally north by northeast through the Eungella National Park and is joined by thirteen minor tributaries, towards its mouth and empties into the Coral Sea north of Bowen. With a catchment area of 1,200 square kilometres (460 sq mi), the river descends 253 metres (830 ft) over its 60-kilometre (37 mi) course.High salinity levels have been recorded at the mouth of the river. Land use in the upper catchment is mostly beef cattle production with crops grown in the richer soils downstream.The river is crossed by the Bruce Highway via the Don River Bridge at Bowen.\n\nFlooding\nThe highest recorded flood was in 1970 when the river reached 7.25 metres (23.8 ft) at the Bowen Pumping Station. The river delta is particularly vulnerable to flooding during cyclones.Floods in 2008 left deposits of sand which raised the riverbed considerably. Approval to dredge sand was granted by the Queensland Government, however only about half of that has been removed in recent years. A flood in 2008 lead the Whitsunday Regional Council to create a channel so that similar flooding could be avoided.A management plan for the river was established late in 2008.  It included measures to encourage further sand extraction.\n\nSee also\n\nList of rivers of Australia § Queensland\nPassage 2:\nBowen River (Queensland)\nThe Bowen River is a river in North Queensland, Australia.\n\nCourse and features\nFormed by the confluence of the Broken River and the Little Bowen River near Tent Hill in the Normanby Range, part of the Great Dividing Range, the Bowen River flows in a north-westerly direction along the base of the range then flows west across Emu Plains and is crossed by the Bowen Developmental Road just north of Havilah. The river then flows north-west again between the Herbert Range and Leichhardt Range then discharges into the Burdekin River, south southeast of Ravenswood. The river descends 98 metres (322 ft) over its 129-kilometre (80 mi) course.The catchment area of the river occupies 9,452 square kilometres (3,649 sq mi) of which an area of 236 square kilometres (91 sq mi) is composed of riverine wetlands. The catchment is in poor condition with much of the riparian habitat having been cleared and prone to erosion. The area is mostly used for cattle grazing with the towns of Collinsville and Glendon both drawing their town water supply from the Bowen River Weir. The river has a mean annual discharge of 1,618 gigalitres (3.56×1011 imp gal; 4.27×1011 US gal).The Bowen River Weir supplies water to a coal mine, power station and the township of Collinsville.\n\nHistory\nThe river was named in 1861 by the Queensland Government, derived from the name of the town Bowen which was named in honour of Sir George Bowen, a  Governor of Queensland.In the 1860s, Richard Daintree made mineral discoveries along the river. Daintree made the first systematic examination of the Bowen River coal seams near Collinsville.Circa 1865, the Bowen River Hotel was built at the top of a steep bank of the river (20.534°S 147.5562°E﻿ / -20.534; 147.5562﻿ (Bowen River Hotel)). The hotel is now listed on the Queensland Heritage Register.Construction of the Bowen River Weir commenced in April 1982 and was completed in August 1983. The A$6.5 million project is situated approximately 25 kilometres (16 mi) south of Collinsville and delivers water to the Newlands Coal Mine.\n\nSee also\nList of rivers of Australia § Queensland\nPassage 3:\nAlder Creek (Siskiyou County, California)\nAlder Creek is a  river located in Siskiyou County, California.\nPassage 4:\nBighead River\nThe Bighead River is a river in Grey County in southern Ontario, Canada, that flows from the Niagara Escarpment between the communities along Ontario Highway 10 of Arnott and Holland Centre in the township of Chatsworth to empty into Nottawasaga Bay, an inlet of Georgian Bay on Lake Huron, at Meaford.\nThe river crosses the Bruce Trail in the valley between the Spey River Forest Area and the Walters Falls Conservation Area.\n\nTributaries\nEast Minniehill Creek (right)\nMinniehill Creek (right)\nRocklyn Creek (right)\nWalters Creek (right)\n\nSee also\nList of rivers of Ontario\nPassage 5:\nAibiki River\nThe Aibiki River (相引川, Aibiki-gawa) is a river located in Takamatsu, Kagawa, Japan.\n\nName\nThe river is named \"Aibiki\" (roughly translating as \"mutual pulling\") because both its source and its mouth are in the Seto Inland Sea. During low tide, the river flows towards both the mouth and the origin, making it seem like it is being pulled both ways.\nIt is also said that the name came about during the Battle of Yashima, which was fought between the Minamoto and Taira clans.\nPassage 6:\nHaughton River\nThe Haughton River is a river in North Queensland, Australia.\n\nCourse and features\nThe headwaters of the river rise in the Haughton Valley of the Leichhardt Range near Mingela and flow in a north easterly direction almost immediately crossing the Flinders Highway. The river then passes between Mount Prince Charles and Mount Norman then past Glendale. Major Creek discharges into the Haughton under Major Creek Mountain and the river continues crossing the Bruce Highway just south of Giru. The Haughton enters Bowling Green Bay National Park and finally discharges into Bowling Green Bay south of Townsville near Cungulla and then into the Coral Sea.\nThe assessed catchment area of the river varies, with one estimate of the area at 8,690 square kilometres (3,360 sq mi) and another assessed at 4,051 square kilometres (1,564 sq mi). Of this latter area, 316 square kilometres (122 sq mi) is composed of estuarine wetlands.The floodplain area of the catchment also holds valuable wetlands, parts of the Bowling Green Bay National Park and Ramsar site (QDEH 1991) are listed in the Directory of Important Wetlands. The upper part of the catchment has few permanent waterholes. An estimated 77% of the catchment is cleared, cattle grazing is the dominant land use in the area, with the production of sugarcane and other forms of horticulture taking up most of the catchment area. An area of 328 square kilometres (127 sq mi) is protected.A total of 27 species of fish have been found in the river, including the glassfish, Pacific Short-finned Eel, blue catfish, milkfish, Fly-specked hardyhead, mouth almighty, Empire gudgeon, barred grunter, barramundi, oxeye herring, mangrove jack, eastern rainbowfish, Bony bream, Freshwater Longtom and Seven-spot Archerfish.\n\nEtymology\nThe river was named in 1861 after Richard Houghton, a stockman, by his friend the pastoralist and explorer James Cassady. Originally named Houghton River it was renamed to the current spelling by the Surveyor General in 1950 at the request of local residents and the electoral office.\n\nSee also\n\nList of rivers of Australia § Queensland\nPassage 7:\nStuart River (Minnesota)\nThe Stuart River is a river located in Minnesota, in the United States.\n\nSee also\nList of rivers of Minnesota\nPassage 8:\nKakwa River\nThe Kakwa River is a tributary of the Smoky River in western Alberta, Canada.\nThe river is named for Kakwa, the Cree word for porcupine. Porcupines are abundant in Kakwa Provincial Park and Protected Area.\nTourism along the river revolves around bull trout fishing and white water rafting. Kakwa Falls (54.10913°N 119.92350°W﻿ / 54.10913; -119.92350﻿ (Kakwa Falls)) are developed in the course of the river, over a 30-metre (98 ft) high ledge formed by an outcrop of the Cadomin Formation. The area was designated a protected wildland (Kakwa Wildland Park). It can be accessed through the forestry road network south of Highway 666, approximately 35 kilometres (22 mi) south of Two Lakes Provincial Park.\n\nCourse\nThe Kakwa River originates in Kakwa Lake, north of McBride, in British Columbia, at an elevation of 1,495 metres (4,905 ft). The surrounding area is protected by Kakwa Provincial Park and Protected Area. The river flows north-east into the province of Alberta in Kakwa Wildlands Park, then flows east and north-east through the foothills. It is crossed by the Bighorn Highway before it converges into the Smoky River, at an elevation of 670 metres (2,200 ft).\n\nTributaries\nFrom its origins to its mouth, Kakwa River receives waters from:\n\nKakwa Lake\nCecilia Creek\nMouse Cache Creek\nMusreau Creek\nFrancis Peak Creek\nSouth Kakwa River\nLynx Creek\nRavine Creek\nChicken Creek\nDaniel Creek\nCopton Creek\nRedrock Creek\nRoute Creek\nPrairie Creek\n\nSee also\nList of rivers of Alberta\nPassage 9:\nDawson River (Queensland)\nThe Dawson River is a river in Central Queensland, Australia.\n\nCourse and features\nThe Dawson River rises in the Carnarvon Range, draining through the Carnarvon National Park, northwest of the settlement of Upper Dawson. The flows generally south by east, crossed by the Carnarvon Highway and then flows generally east through the settlement of Taroom where the river is crossed by the Leichhardt Highway. The river then flows in a northerly direction through the settlement of Theodore where the river is again crossed by the Leichhardt Highway. The river flows north through the settlement of Baralaba and towards Duaringa, crossed by the Capricorn Highway. A little further north, the Dawson River forms confluence with the Mackenzie River to form the Fitzroy River. From source to mouth, the river is joined by sixty-four tributaries, including the Don River, and descends 587 metres (1,926 ft) over its 735-kilometre (457 mi) course. Several weirs have been constructed along the river to provide water for cotton and dairy farming in the region. The river catchment covers an area of 50,800 square kilometres (19,600 sq mi).Expedition National Park and the Precipice National Park are protected areas along the Dawson River.\nThe Dawson River was one of a number of Queensland rivers affected by the 2010–11 Queensland floods. As the river inundated the town of Theodore it was completely evacuated, a first in Queensland's history.\n\nHistory\nGungabula (also known as Kongabula and Khungabula) is an Australian Aboriginal language of the headwaters of the Dawson River in Central Queensland. The language region includes areas within the local government area of Maranoa Region, particularly the towns of Charleville, Augathella and Blackall and as well as the Carnarvon Range.Ludwig Leichhardt explored the area in 1844 and named the river in honour of Robert Dawson, one of Leichhardt's financial backers.In the 1920s, shortly after the First World War, Australian Labor Party politician Ted Theodore (1884-1950) launched an irrigation program on the Dawson River for returning soldiers. His intentions was to provide them with arable land along the river for them to take up farming, thus eschewing a post-war recession. After the 1922 Irrigation Act was passed, he started irrigation schemes on the Dawson River, for an initial 8,000 new farmers. However, the scheme was abandoned after he realized the soil was unsuitable for farming and the returning soldiers had no agrarian skills.\n\nSee also\n\nBoggomoss\nList of rivers of Australia § Queensland\nPassage 10:\nDee River (Queensland)\nThe Dee River is a river in Central Queensland, Australia.\n\nCourse and features\nPart of the Fitzroy River system, the Dee River rises in the Razorback Range south of Bouldercombe Gorge Resources Reserve near Mount Gavial, south of Bouldercombe. The river flows generally south by west through the mining settlement of Mount Morgan, Waluml and Dululu, where the river is crossed by the Burnett Highway. The river is joined by seven minor tributaries including Limestone Creek, Horse Creek, Hamilton Creek, Nine Mile Creek, Boulder Creek, Oaky Creek and Pruce Creek.  The Dee River forms its confluence with the Don River near Rannes.\nThe largest dam on the river is Number 7 Dam, built for the Mount Morgan Mine, which has a history of acid mine discharge from gold and copper mining entering the Dee River.\n\nMine pit\nIn January 2013, the mine pit overflowed. Approximately 700 millimetres (28 in) of rain fell after ex-tropical Cyclone Oswald resulted in the 2013 Eastern Australia floods.  Towards the end of February the dam was spilling acid and heavy metals into the river.  Concerns regarding the discolouration of the river's water and fears of contamination causing irreversible damage to the river were raised in mid-2011.\n\nSee also\n\nList of rivers of Australia § Queensland", "answers": ["yes"], "length": 2049, "dataset": "2wikimqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "d0719e52ba728ca7ce774af5f3800a9096561ed96e75594e"}

The count's sister Irmgard was married to Lothair Udo III, Margrave of the Nordmark, and was the mother of Helperich's successor in ruling the margraviate, Henry II.\nHelperich inherited the title Count of Plötzkau upon his father’s death and the title Count of Walbeck from his mother, although this title was mostly ceremonial at this point.  In 1112, Emperor Henry V deposed Rudolf I as Margrave of the Nordmark because of conspiracy against the crown in his alliance with Lothair of Supplinburg, then Duke of Saxony (and later Holy Roman Emperor).  The margraviate was given to Helperich as an interim measure until Henry II, nephew of Rudolf and heir to the title, was of age.\nIn 1106, Helperich married Adele, daughter of Kuno of Northeim and Kunigunde of Weimar-Orlamünde, widow of Dietrich III, Count of Katlenburg.

However, his attention was diverted to the House of Helperich, towards Count Helperich's enticing sister Ermengardam.  He married this woman, the count's sister Irmgard, daughter of Dietrich, Count of Plötzkau, and Mathilde von Walbeck, daughter of Conrad, Count of Walbeck.  Eilika moved on and married Otto the Rich, Count of Ballenstedt, and was mother to Albert the Bear, the last Margrave of the Nordmark and first Margrave of Brandenburg.

His father Otto I promoted and directed the foundation of German settlement in the area, which had been Slavic until the 10th century.\n\nCount of Arneburg\nAlbert II was, from 1184 onwards, Count of Arneburg in the Altmark.  The Altmark belonged to Brandenburg, and his older brother Otto II claimed that this implied that the Ascanians owned Arneburg.\nWhen Henry of Gardeleggen died in 1192, he left his domains to Albert II. But that caused a conflict between himself and his brother. He was temporarily imprisoned in 1194 by Otto.\nIn 1197, he joined the German Crusade of 1197. He was present at the inaugural meeting of the Teutonic Knights in 1198 in Acre.\n\nMargrave of Brandenburg\nAlbert II inherited the Margraviate in 1205, after the death of his eldest brother Otto II.\nIn the dispute about the imperial crown between the Houses of Hohenstaufen and Guelph in the early 13th century, Albert initially supported the Hohenstaufen King Philip of Swabia, like Otto before him.  After Philip's assassination in 1208, however, he changed sides, because Emperor Otto IV had assisted him in securing the Margraviate against the Danes, and had confirmed Ascanian ownership of Brandenburg in a deed in 1212.\nDuring this period, Albert II had a lengthy dispute with Archbishop Albert I of Magdeburg. He also played an important rôle in the Brandenburg tithe dispute.\nAlbert II definitively secured the regions of Teltow, Prignitz and parts of the Uckermark for the Margraviate of Brandenburg, but lost Pomerania to the House of Griffins.\n\nDeath and succession\nAlbert II died in 1220.  At the time, his two sons were still minors.  Initially, archbishop Albert I of Magdeburg acted as regent.  In 1221, however, Albert's widow, Countess Matilda, took up the regency.  After her death in 1225, the brothers were declared legal adults and began ruling the Margraviate jointly.\n\nLegacy\nStephan Warnatsch describes Otto I's children as follows:[They] continued the territorialisation drive that had been initiated [by their father] and, from the end of the 12th Century, as the influx of settlers grew stronger, and, consequently, more people were available to develop the territory, started to expand into the areas of Ruppin, and in particular, Barnim and Teltow.  Moreover, the Oder region and the southern Uckermark were also targets of the Ascanian expansion.  In all these areas, the Ascanians ran into opposition from competing local princes.\n\nMarriage and issue\nIn 1205, Albert married Matilda of Groitzsch (1185–1225), daughter of the Count Conrad II of Lusatia, a member of the House of Wettin, and wife Elizabeth, from the Polish Piast dynasty.

In 1231, he succeeded his father as Margrave of Baden-Hachberg.  Since he was a minor at the time, he initially stood under the guardianship of his mother.  He was the first in his line of the House of Zähringen to style himself Margrave of Hachberg.  In 1232, he purchased the Lordship of Sausenburg from St. Blaise Abbey.  Soon afterwards, he built Sausenburg Castle, which was first mentioned in 1246.He had disputes with the spiritual rulers in the area and with the Counts of Freiburg about the entangled rights and privileges they had (or claimed to have) on each other's possessions.  In 1250, some imperial and Hohenstaufen possessions became available for the taking after Emperor Frederick II had died.  Henry II grabbed some of these land and managed round off his territory.\nFor several years, he supported Count Rudolph of Habsburg in his disputes against the bishops of Basel and Strasbourg.  In 1273, he supported Rudolph in his bid to become King of the Romans.  He also supported Rudolph in his dispute against the main line of the Margraves of Baden.  During the war against Bohemia, Henry II fought on the imperial side in the decisive Battle on the Marchfeld.\nHe was a patron of the monasteries Tennenbach and Adelhausen.Henry II abdicated in 1289, and joined the Teutonic Knights.\n\nMarriage and issue\nHenry II was married to Anne, a daughter of Count Rudolph II of Üsingen-Ketzingen.  They had the following children:\n\nHenry III, his successor as Margrave of Baden-Hachberg\nRudolf I, the first Margrave of Hachberg-Sausenberg\nFrederick, who also joined the Teutonic Knights\nVerena, married Egino I, Count of Fürstenberg\nHerman I, joined the Knights Hospitaller\nKunigunde, a nun at Adelhausen\nAgnes, married Walter of Reichenberg\nElisabeth, also a nun at Adelhausen\nPassage 5:\nHenry II, Margrave of the Nordmark\nHenry II (1102 – 4 December 1128), Margrave of the Nordmark, also Count of Stade (as Henry IV), son of Lothair Udo III, Margrave of the Nordmark, and  Irmgard, daughter of Dietrich, Count of Plötzkau, and Mathilde von Walbeck.\nHenry assumed the title of Margrave of the Nordmark in 1114 from Helperich of Plötzkau, who was appointed margrave until Henry came of age. The previous margrave in this dynasty was Henry’s uncle Rudolf I, who was also his guardian.  Rudolf was deposed by Emperor Henry V because of conspiracy against the crown, and was replaced by Helperich as an interim measure.  Henry assumed the titles of Count of Stade and Margrave of the Nordmark in 1114.\nHenry was married to Adelaide of Ballenstedt, a daughter of Otto, Count of Ballenstedt, and Eilika of Saxony.  Adelaide was therefore the sister of Albert the Bear. There are no known children as a result of this union.  Henry was succeeded as margrave by the son of Helperich, Conrad of Plötzkau.\n\nSources\nKrause, Karl Ernst Hermann, Lothar Udo II. und das Stader Grafenhaus. In: Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie.

He was the posthumous son of Margrave Henry I and Gertrude of Brunswick, daughter of Egbert I of Meissen. He was by inheritance also Count of Eilenburg. He was the second Meissener margrave of the House of Wettin.\nHe was initially under the regency of first his mother and after her death in 1117 under his great uncle Thimo. He died young and without children in 1123. His lands were inherited by his half-sister Richenza of Northeim. He left a widow, Adelaide, daughter of Lothair Udo III, Margrave of the Nordmark. The succession to the marches was disputed after his death.\nPassage 7:\nRudolf II, Margrave of the Nordmark\nRudolf II (died 14 March 1144), Margrave of the Nordmark, and Count of Stade, Dithmarschen and Freckleben, son of Rudolf I, Margrave of the Nordmark, and Richardis, daughter of Hermann von Sponheim, Burgrave of Magdeburg.\nRudolf, the traditional heir to the margraviate assumed the title upon the death of his predecessor Conrad von Plötzkau.\nA chronicle of the 15th century reported that Rudolf resided in Burg, Dithmarschen (Bökelnburg). He ruled with a heavy hand and demanded his grain tithe even after several years of drought. The Dithmarscher farmers used a ruse to get rid of their unpopular regent. Hidden in sacks of corn were weapons.  As agreed, they opened the bags at the sound of the battle cry \"Röhret de Hann, snidet de sac spell!\" (Shall ye touch hands, cuts the bag volumes). They set the castle on fire, killed the count and so won their freedom. This event is still recounted today in performances at the castle. His widow, Elizabeth, later married Henry V, Duke of Carinthia.Rudolf was married to Elisabeth, daughter of Leopold I the Strong, Margrave of Styria. No children are recorded of this union. With the death of Rudolf, the male line of the Margraves of the Nordmark died out.\nAfter the death of Rudolf, his brother Hartwig transferred his inheritance to the Archbishopric of Bremen in return for a regrant of a life interest, presumably to obtain a powerful protector against the aggression of Henry the Lion.  The move was ineffective, as Henry took possession of the lands and captured both Hartwig and the archbishop Adelbero, releasing them only after they agreed to recognize his claim.\nRudolf’s successor as Margrave of the Nordmark was Albert the Bear.  Upon Rudolf's death, his brother Hartwig succeeded him as Count of Stade.\nPassage 8:\nHenry I the Long, Margrave of the Nordmark\nHenry I the Long (c. 1065 – 27 June 1087), Margrave of the Nordmark, also Count of Stade (as Henry III), son of Lothair Udo II, Margrave of the Nordmark, and Oda of Werl, daughter of Herman III, Count of Werl, and Richenza of Swabia.\nHenry married Eupraxia of Kiev, daughter of Vsevolod I, Grand Prince of Kiev, and his second wife Anna.  There were no children as a result of this marriage, and Eupraxia, widowed, married next Henry IV, then King of Saxony, who became Holy Roman Emperor.\nRaffensperger suggests that Henry's motivation in marrying Eupraxia was to bring Saxony closer to Kiev.  In fact, the marriage may have been arranged by Oda of Stade, daughter of Lothair Udo I, Margrave of the Nordmark, who had married Sviatoslav II, Grand Prince of Kiev. Oda is identified as a relative of Henry’s father Lothair Udo II as well as a niece of Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor, and Pope Leo IX.\nUpon his death, Henry was succeeded as margrave and count by his brother Lothair Udo III.\n\nNotes\nSources\nVernadsky, George, Kievan Russia, Yale University Press, New Haven, Connecticut, 1948, ISBN 9780300010077\nRaffensperger, Christian, Reimagining Europe: Kievan Rus' in the Medieval World, Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 2012\nH.

He was the second son of Otto II, Margrave of Meissen and Hedwig of Brandenburg.\n\nBiography\nTheodoric, called in German Dietrich, the younger son of Otto II, Margrave of Meissen, fell out with his brother, Albert the Proud, after his mother persuaded his father to change the succession so that Theodoric was given the Margraviate of Meissen and Albrecht (although the older son) the margraviate of Weissenfels. Albert took his father prisoner to try to make him return the succession to the way it had been. After Otto obtained his release by an order of the emperor Frederick I, he had only just renewed the war when he died in 1190. Albert then took back the Meissen margraviate from his brother. Theodoric attempted to regain the margraviate, supported by Landgraf Hermann I of Thuringia, his father-in-law. In 1195, however, Theodoric left on a pilgrimage to Palestine.\n\nAlbrecht's Death\nAfter Albrecht's death in 1195, leaving no children, Meissen, with its rich mines, was seized by the emperor Henry VI as a vacant fief of the empire. Dietrich finally came into possession of his inheritance two years later on Henry's death.\nAt the time of the struggle between the two rival kings Philip of Swabia and Otto IV, Holy Roman Emperor, Phillip gave Dietrich the tenure of the march of Meißen again. After that time, Dietrich was on Phillip's side and remained true to the Staufer even after Phillip was murdered in 1208.\nDietrich became caught up in dangerous disagreements with the city of Leipzig and the Meißen nobility. After a fruitless siege of Leipzig, in 1217 he agreed to a settlement but then took over the city by trickery, had the city walls taken down and built three castles of his own within the city, full of his own men.\n\nDeath\nMargrave Dietrich died on 18 February 1221, possibly poisoned by his doctor, instigated into doing so by the people of Leipzig and the dissatisfied nobility. He left behind a widow, Jutta of Thuringia, daughter of Hermann I, Landgrave of Thuringia. Some of his children had already died.\n\nMarriages and issue\nChildren from his marriage to Jutta of Thuringia, daughter of Hermann I, Landgrave of Thuringia:\nHedwig (d. 1249) married Count Dietrich V of Cleves (1185–1260)\nOtto (d. before 1215)\nSophia (d. 1280) married Count Henry of Henneberg-Schleusingen (d. 1262)\nJutta married Mestwin II, Duke of Pomerania\nHenry the Illustrious (1218–1288) Margrave of MeissenChildren from extramarital liaisons:\n\nKonrad\nDietrich II (not the same as Dietrich von Kittlitz)\nHeinrich\nPassage 10:\nWilliam, Margrave of the Nordmark\nWilliam (died 10 September 1056) was the Margrave of the Nordmark from 1051 until his death. He was the eldest son and successor of the Margrave Bernard by a daughter of Vladimir the Great. He died fighting the Slavs in the Battle of Pritzlawa. Upon his death, he was succeeded by his half-brother Otto as Margrave of the Nordmark.\n\nSources\nBury, J. B.

Simpson's father was Robert Simpson and his mother was Mary Ann Smith Simpson.\n\nCareer\nIn about 1905, Simpson started working in the palm-oil business, trading with West Africa.\nIn 1907, Simpson emigrated to the United States. In 1916, Simpson became an editor at the Frank A. Munsey Company.  In 1917, Simpson was promoted to managing editor of The Argosy, and stayed in that role for three years.  He left in 1920 to become a free-lance writer, and returned to editing in 1925, becoming the editor of Mystery Magazine.Simpson's novels include The Bite of Benin, Swamp Breath, The Grey Charteris, Eight Panes of Glass, and Calvert of Allobar.\n\nPersonal life\nSimpson was married to Marie A. Simpson, née Socin, and they had a daughter and two sons.\nPassage 4:\nThomas Wykes (MP for Cambridgeshire)\nThomas Wykes (died c. 1430), of Stetchworth, Cambridgeshire, was an English politician.\nHe was a Member (MP) of the Parliament of England for Cambridgeshire in March 1416.\nPassage 5:\nRobert Simpson (brewer)\nRobert Simpson was a Canadian brewer and politician who served as the first mayor of Barrie from 1871 to 1872, and again as its third mayor in 1876. He also founded the Simcoe Steam Brewery, and the 21st-century Robert Simpson Brewing Company (now The Flying Monkeys Craft Brewery) was named in his honour.\nPrior to becoming mayor, the head of the governing body for Barrie was known as the reeve of Barrie. Simpson first served as the fifth reeve from 1858 to 1859, and was succeeded by Thomas David McConkey. Simpson later succeeded the seventh and final reeve, William Davis Ardagh, in 1871, to become Barrie's first mayor.\nPassage 6:\nThomas Wykes (chronicler)\nThomas Wykes (11 March 1222 – c. 1292), English chronicler, was a canon regular of Oseney Abbey, near Oxford.He was the author of a chronicle extending from 1066 to 1289, which is printed among the monastic annals edited by Henry Richards Luard for the Rolls Series. He gives an account of the Second Barons' War from a royalist standpoint, and is a severe critic of Montfort's policy. His work regarding the reign of Edward I is especially useful. His chronicles are connected with the Oseney Annals, which are printed parallel with his work by Luard, but Wykes is an independent authority between 1258 and 1278.\nPassage 7:\nLambert of St-Bertin\nLambert of Saint-Bertin (c. 1060 – 22 June 1125) was a French Benedictine chronicler and abbot.\n\nBiography\nLambert was born about 1060 of a distinguished family, and, when still young, entered the French Benedictine abbey of St-Bertin. He afterwards visited several famous schools in France, having first laid the foundation of his subsequent learning by the study in his own monastery of grammar, theology and music. For some time he filled the office of prior, and in 1095 was chosen abbot at once by the monks of St-Bertin and by the canons of St-Omer. He was thus drawn into closer relations with Cluny, and instituted through the Cluniac monks many reforms in his somewhat deteriorated monastery. Needless to say, he encountered no little opposition to his efforts, but, thanks to his extraordinary energy, he finally secured acceptance for his views, and rehabilitated the financial position of the monastery. He was a friend of St. Anselm and exchanged verses, still extant, with the poet Reginald of Canterbury (ed. Libermann in \"Neues Archiv der Gesellschaft fur altere Geschichte\", XIII, 1888, pp. 528; 531-34).  He died on 22 June 1125, at St-Bertin.\n\nWorks\nEven during his lifetime, Lambert was lauded in glowing terms for his great learning by an admirer —not a monk of St-Bertin— in the \"Tractatus de moribus Lamberti Abbatis S. Beretini\" (ed. Holder-Egger in \"Monumenta German. Histor. SS.\", XV, 2, 946-53). This work mentions several otherwise unknown writings of Lambert, e.g. \"Sermones de Vetere Testamento\", also studies on free will, the Divine prescience, original sin, origin of the soul and questions of physical science.\nAlthough the two are often confused, he is not identical with Lambert, the Canon of St. Omer who wrote the famous \"Liber Floridus\", a kind of encyclopedia of Biblical, chronological, astronomical, geographical, theological, philosophical and natural history subjects, which was completed in 1120.\n\nSources and references\n Herbermann, Charles, ed.

Simpson was a Scottish professional golfer who achieved success in winning two Western Opens in 1907 and 1911, as well as finishing fourth in the U.S. Open in 1904. Simpson was from Carnoustie, Scotland. He apprenticed under Robert Simpson, a Scottish golf club-maker and golf course architect, who was also from Carnoustie and part of a famous golf family of six brothers. The two Simpsons however were not related. Bobby Simpson did apprentice in Scotland as a club-maker under the other Robert Simpson prior to leaving for the United States to become a golf professional.\n\nProfessional career\nSimpson was part of the \"Scottish Invasion\" of golf professional of the late 1890s and 1900s. He secured positions at multiple courses in the Midwest including The Country Club of Oconomowoc, Hinsdale Country Club (Chicago, Illinois), Kent Country Club (Grand Rapids, Michigan), Memphis Country Club (Memphis, Tennessee), Kenosha Country Club (Kenosha, Wisconsin), Blue Mound Country Club (Wauwatosa, Wisconsin), Omaha Country Club (Omaha, Nebraska) and many years at Riverside Country Club (Chicago, Illinois). Many of the early golf professionals from Scotland earned an income in various ways as greenskeepers, part-time course architects, club-makers, teaching professionals, tournament players and exhibition golf players. His most notable victories came with victories in the Western Open in 1907 and 1911.\n\n1900 U.S. Open\nAt the 1900 U.S. Open held at the Chicago Golf Club in Wheaton, Illinois, Simpson carded rounds of 84-84-88-87 for a total of 343 and tied for 14th place.\n\n1901 U.S. Open\nAt the 1901 U.S. Open held at the Myopia Hunt Club in South Hamilton, Massachusetts, Simpson carded rounds of 88-87-87-87 for a total of 349 and again tied for 14th place.\n\n1904 U.S. Open\nThe 1904 U.S. Open was held July 8–9, 1904, at the Glen View Club in Golf, Illinois. Scottish professional Willie Anderson won his second consecutive, and third overall, U.S. Open title by five strokes over Englishman, Gilbert Nicholls. Simpson carded rounds of 82-82-76-76 for a total of 316 and finished tied in sixth place with Stewart Gardner and Percy Barrett. He won $53 in prize money.\n\n1907 Western Open\nSimpson won the 1907 Western Open at the Hinsdale Country Club in Clarendon Hills, Illinois, where he defeated fellow Scotsmen, Willie Anderson and Fred McLeod, by two strokes, in Match Play.\n\n1908 Western Open\nAt the 1908 Western Open at the Beverly Country Club Simpson finished third (153) behind Willie Anderson (152) and Stewart Gardner (151), with the lowest round of the tournament (73).\n\n1909 U.S. Open\nAt the 1909 U.S. Open held at the Englewood Golf Club in Englewood, New Jersey, Simpson carded rounds of 84-76-77-84 for a total of 321 and tied for 46th place.\n\n1911 Western Open\nIn 1911 Simpson won his second Western Open at the Kent Country Club, in Grand Rapids, Michigan. He defeated Thomas McNamara, two up and one to play.\nPassage 10:\nRobert Simpson (meteorologist)\nRobert Homer Simpson (November 19, 1912 – December 18, 2014) was an American meteorologist, hurricane specialist, first director of the National Hurricane Research Project (NHRP) from 1955 to 1959, and a former director (1967–1974) of the National Hurricane Center (NHC). He was the co-developer of the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale with Herbert Saffir. His wife was Joanne Simpson.\n\nEarly life\nBorn in Corpus Christi, Texas, Robert Simpson survived the devastating landfall of the 1919 Florida Keys hurricane at age six; one of his family members drowned. Simpson graduated with honors from the Corpus Christi high school in 1929. Fascinated by the weather, he went on to get a Bachelor of Science degree in physics from Southwestern University in 1933, and a Master of Science degree in physics from Emory University in 1935. Finding no work as a physicist during the Great Depression, he taught music in Texas high schools.\n\nEarly career\nOn April 16, 1940, he was hired by the United States Weather Bureau. First assigned as a junior observer of meteorology at Brownsville, Texas, he was then temporarily assigned to Swan Island. After the Pearl Harbor attack, he was promoted to forecaster at the New Orleans office. As part of a United States Weather Bureau scholarship, he did graduate work at the University of Chicago in 1943 and 1944. After a stint as a hurricane forecaster in Miami under Grady Norton, he was assigned to help create the Army Air Force weather school in Panama. There he had his first flight into a tropical cyclone. After the war, he persuaded Air Force Hurricane Hunters to allow him to fly along on what he called 'piggy back missions', where he would take scientific observations using the primitive instruments.\nFollowing VJ day and the dissolution of the weather school, Simpson returned to Miami. He was then assigned to Weather Bureau headquarters, working directly for Dr. Francis Reichelderfer. In 1949 Reichelderfer assigned Simpson to Hawaii to be in charge of consolidating the Weather Bureau's Pacific operations. There he founded a weather observation station on Mauna Loa, studied Kona lows, and flew a research mission into Typhoon Marge aboard a specifically equipped Air Force weather plane. He continually urged Weather Bureau management to fund modest levels of hurricane research, but budgets during the early 1950s didn't allow this. Then the devastating 1954 Atlantic hurricane season changed the minds of several New England congressmen, and a special appropriation was passed to improve the Weather Bureau's hurricane warning system. Reichelderfer appointed Bob Simpson to head up the National Hurricane Research Project in 1955.\n\nLate career\nFor the next four years, Simpson navigated NHRP through the shoals of bureaucratic uncertainty. Once NHRP was assured longevity in 1959, Simpson left the Project to finish his doctorate in meteorology at the University of Chicago, studying under his friend Dr. Herbert Riehl. On completing his degree in 1962, he returned to Washington to become the Weather Bureau's Deputy Director of Research (Severe Storms), where he helped establish the National Severe Storms Project (later to become the National Severe Storms Laboratory). In 1961 he obtained a National Science Foundation grant to study seeding hurricanes with silver iodide. He put together an experiment using NHRP and United States Navy aircraft to seed Hurricane Esther. The encouraging results led the Weather Bureau and the Navy to start Project Stormfury in 1962, with Simpson as Director. He headed up the Project for the next three years, including the seeding of Hurricane Beulah in 1963.

They became close, and he was one of the intermediaries who, in November 1779, patched up a temporary reconciliation between Hastings and Philip Francis. In May 1780 he was appointed to command a battalion of sepoys.\n\nPolitical agent in London\nScott was sent by Hastings to England as his political agent, and he arrived in London on 17 December 1781. Scott was profuse in his expenditure for his patron.From 1784 to 1790 Scott sat in parliament as member for West Looe, and in 1790 he was returned for Stockbridge in Hampshire. A petition was presented against him, and in February 1793 a prosecution for bribery seemed imminent, but the matter fell through.\n\nImpeachment of Hastings\nThe charges against Warren Hastings might have been allowed to drop, but Scott reminded Edmund Burke on the first day of the session of 1786 of the notice which he had given before the preceding recess of bringing them before parliament. Scott asked Burke to name the first day that was practicable; Burke opened the subject on 17 February. Fanny Burney (Diary, ed. 1842, iv. 74–5) commented on Scott \"skipping backwards and forwards like a grasshopper\".\n\nLater life\nIn 1798, by the death of his cousin, Richard Hill Waring, Scott came into the Waring estates in Cheshire, which he sold in 1800 to Peel and Yates (the company of Sir Robert Peel, 1st Baronet) for £80,000. He then assumed the name and arms of Waring. A year or two later he bought Peterborough House at Parson's Green, Fulham, and gathered around him varied company: royal princes, politicians, wits, and actresses.Scott-Waring died at Half Moon Street, Piccadilly, London, on 5 May 1819.\n\nWorks\nIn 1782 Scott published, in the interests of Hastings, his Short Review of Transactions in Bengal during the last Ten Years, and, two years later, his Conduct of his Majesty's late Ministers considered, 1784 (in it he dealt with the payments which he had made to the newspapers for the insertion of letters in defence of Hastings). Letters, paragraphs, puffs, and squibs were attributed to him.During the course of the impeachment (1788–1795) many letters, speeches, and pamphlets emanated from Scott. Scott also wrote:\nObservations on Sheridan's pamphlet, contrasting the two bills for the better government of India, 1788; 3rd ed. 1789.\nObservations on Belsham's “Memoirs of the reign of George III,” 1796.\nSeven Letters to the People of Great Britain by a Whig, 1789. In this he discussed the questions arising out of the king's illness.A memoir of Hastings by Scott is in William Seward's Biographiana, ii. 610–28.\n\nChristian mission controversy\nOn the subject of Christian missions in India Scott-Waring published Observations on the present State of the East India Company (anonymous, 1807 four editions). It contributed to a long-running debate on the religious toleration policy of the East India Company, in the face of missionary efforts. Thomas Twining (1776–1861), son of Richard Twining, wrote from 1795 against \"interfering\" in India with Christian missions. The year 1808 saw active controversy on the propagation on Christianity, in which Andrew Fuller and John Owen (1766–1822) had become involved, with Scott-Waring replying to Owen. When John Weyland wrote an open letter to Sir Hugh Inglis in 1811, Scott-Waring replied to it.A Vindication of the Hindoos from the expressions of Dr. Claudius Buchanan, in two parts by \"a Bengal Officer\" (1808), was attributed to Scott-Waring (DNB first edition). It was in fact by Charles Stuart.\n\nFamily\nScott was three times married.\n\nHis first wife, who brought him a fortune, was Elizabeth, daughter of Alexander Blackrie. She was born on 19 April 1746, and died 26 October 1796, being buried in Bromley churchyard, under a marble monument, with a long epitaph. She was the mother of two sons—Edward, a civil servant in Bengal; and Charles, who died young—and of two daughters, the elder of whom, Anna Maria, married John Reade of Ipsden House, Oxfordshire, was mother of Charles Reade and Edward Anderdon Reade, and died 9 August 1863, aged 90; the younger, Eliza Sophia, married the Rev. George Stanley Faber.\nWaring's second wife was Maria, daughter and heiress of Jacob Hughes of Cashel.\nWaring's third wife was Harriet Pye Esten, a widowed actress.", "answers": ["1459"], "length": 3218, "dataset": "2wikimqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "444af702474de881b7b810a1aa62ff8de378e213c31300fe"}

He went to the wicket early on the first day with the score at 7 for 2 and put on 99 for the third wicket with Charles Corfe before he was out with the score at 106 for 3 after a \"very fine exhibition of free hitting, combined with good defence\". Canterbury were all out for 133, but went on to win the match. His 75 came in the next season's match against Otago, when he took the score from 22 for 2 to 136 for 6. The New Zealand cricket historian Tom Reese said, \"Right from the beginning he smote the bowling hip and thigh, going out of his ground to indulge in some forceful driving.\" Canterbury won again.Moore led the batting averages in the Canterbury Cricket Association in 1877–78 with 379 runs at an average of 34.4. Also in 1877–78, he was a member of the Canterbury team that inflicted the only defeat on the touring Australians.

She is the first woman to ever hold the position. In 2007, after a 22-year career in the British Army, Cameron became one of the 35 resident Warders in the Tower of London, commonly known as the Beefeaters.\nOriginally prison guards, the Yeoman Warder's position dates back to 1485. It is now a largely ceremonial role, with responsibility for conducting guided tours and generally looking after public visitors to the Tower, as well as conducting certain other duties both inside and outside the Tower.\n\nCareer\nBritish Army\nCameron joined the Women's Royal Army Corps (WRAC) in June 1985 at the age of 20. She was trained as a Data Telegraphist with the Royal Corps of Signals before transferring to the Royal Army Pay Corps (RAPC) in 1988 to train as a Military Accountant, and in 2000 Cameron was awarded her Long Service and Good Conduct Medal. In 1992, WRAC and RAPC were replaced by the Adjutant General's Corps, and Cameron worked her way through the ranks in its Staff and Personnel Support Branch, completing 22 years service in the army in June 2007. Having seen service in England, Northern Ireland and Cyprus, Cameron ended her Army career at the rank of Warrant Officer Class 2, holding the post of Superintendent Clerk in 145 (Home Counties) Brigade in Aldershot.\n\nYeoman Warder\nCameron officially became the first ever female Yeoman Warder in July 2007 but didn't get to wear her uniform until 3 September 2007. Cameron is one of 37 Yeoman Warders based in the Tower of London, a position which dates back to 1485. Styled as Yeoman Warder Cameron, her full and proper title is Yeoman Warder of His Majesty's Royal Palace and Fortress the Tower of London, and Members of the Sovereign's Body Guard of the Yeoman Guard in the Extraordinary.Camerons' duties are mostly connected to the Tower, but can involve some outside ceremonies. Within the Tower, Cameron's role is to take care of public visitors to the Tower and perform guided tours, guard the Crown Jewels, perform the Ceremony of the Keys and look after the Ravens of the Tower. Outside the Tower, Warders duties are to attend the Coronation of the Sovereign, lying-in-state, the Lord Mayor's Show, and other state and charity functions. As a Yeoman Warder, Cameron has two tailored-to-fit uniforms, the Scarlet ceremonial dress, and the 'undress' blue uniform for day-to-day duties (each in three variants of varying thickness for different seasons).On 25 November 2009, two Yeoman Warders were dismissed after being found guilty of gross misconduct for bullying Cameron due to her gender. Three Warders had been suspended, and one was subsequently re-instated following the month-long investigation, with his role 'unproven'. One of the three also received a police caution for defacing Cameron's Wikipedia biography.Cameron retired in Autumn 2022 after having served 15 years as a Yeoman Warder.\n\nFirst female Yeoman Warder\nThe post of Yeoman Warder had never specifically been barred to women, although due to the rules governing women in the British Army, it was only in the modern era that women were able to have a career able to meet the entry requirements. To apply for the job, applicants had to be aged between 40 and 55, have completed at least 22 years' service in either the Army, Royal Air Force or Royal Marines reaching the rank of Warrant Officer or Senior Non-Commissioned Officer (NCO), and have been awarded the Long Service and Good Conduct Medal. It was announced on 3 January 2007 that an unnamed female would be replacing a retiring Yeoman Warder in September 2007, with WO2 Cameron, still in the Army at the time, publicly named as this replacement eight days later. Cameron had long been interested in the job of Yeoman Warder, and applied to an advertisement placed in Soldier Magazine in Summer 2006.

It was written by Agnes Christine Johnston and Max Marcin, based upon Selma Lagerlöf's 1914 novel The Emperor of Portugallia (MGM actually purchased the story rights in 1922). The film was supposed to be called The Emperor of Portugallia, but was later changed to The Tower of Lies.\nReleased one year after He Who Gets Slapped, the film marks the second collaboration between Sjöström, Lon Chaney and Norma Shearer. Also starring are William Haines, Ian Keith and Lew Cody.The film's sets were designed by the art director James Basevi and Cedric Gibbons. The film was shot on location in the Sacramento River Delta, Lake Arrowhead and the Laurel Canyon area of Los Angeles. It took 53 days to complete at a cost of $185,000. It grossed $653,000 worldwide.\n\"Film Mercury\" voted Chaney's performance as one of the year's best. It is considered a lost film, although rumors persist that a print may exist in Denmark. Stills exist showing Chaney in his \"Jan\" makeup, which took him three hours each day to apply.\n\nPlot\nJan (Lon Chaney) is a Swedish farmer and Glory (Norma Shearer) is his beloved daughter. When she was a child, she and her father used to role-play being the Emperor and Empress of Portugallia, a fairy tale land where dreams come true, and a neighboring farm boy named August would play the Prince. Glory grows up to be a beautiful young woman, and both August and Jan's vile landlord Lars (Iam Keith) vie for her attention.\nJan incurs some debts he cannot pay, and to save him from bankruptcy, his daughter temporarily moves to the big city supposedly to get a job (finally allowing Lars to lead her into prostitution). After a time, the landlord tells Jan his daughter has succeeded in paying off his debts, but will not tell him how she earned the money. Realizing that his daughter has been selling herself to help him avoid bankruptcy, Jan's mind slowly begins to unravel. Years pass and his daughter never returns to the farm, and every day Jan waits down by the riverboat hoping she will come home.\nEventually she does return to him, but by this time, Jan's mind has snapped and he actually believes that he is the Emperor of Portugallia and she is his Empress. Jan has taken to wearing a strange military uniform and a circus hat, and his hair and long beard have all turned gray (see photo). Glory's fine attire leads the villagers to believe that she has been living as a prostitute and they demand she leave town. Only August is willing to stand by her and protect her honor.\nGlory boards the local steamboat at the docks in order to leave town, and her father follows her, falling off the pier in his haste and drowning. When the ship's captain throws the boat into reverse in an attempt to save Jan, Lars (who is taunting Glory from the ship's deck) is thrown into the paddlewheel and crushed to death. Glory winds up marrying August and settling down in town with him.\n\nCast\nCritical Comments\n\"Notwithstanding that TOWER OF LIES is a sincerely made picture and excellent from the artistic and literary viewpoints, it is too heavy for the picture audiences. When finished the impression left is that one more prostitute has reformed and been forgiven...The acting is aces and the direction masterful. But with all this, TOWER OF LIES can never be anything more than a soggy picture made bearable by the leavening forces of Seastrom, Chaney and Shearer.\" ---Variety\n\"THE TOWER OF LIES is a beautiful production with a flash of poignant drama at its end...Chaney and Miss Shearer especially are splendid.\" ---Moving Picture World\n\"It seems as if Mr. Chaney had had too much to say about his own performance, for he overacts and his make-up, consisting largely of a rich crop of iron gray hair and whiskers and beard, seem to fit well without looking as if they belonged to him. Mr. Chaney's exaggerated actions and expressions appear to have been contagious, for Mr. Seastrom himself betrays a weakness for overemphasizing a number of points.\" ---The New York Times\"A distinctive and rare artistic achievement... A very worthy effort and yet probably not the best box office. Chaney passes by his usual grotesque characterization and does something just a bit different.\" ---Film Daily\n\"(Chaney) does not resort to the grotesque, but from the first sequences, where he appears as the tiller of the soil who neither loves nor hates....to the last when he becomes a demented old man, his interpretation is pathetically convincing.\" --- Movie Magazine\n\"Mr. Chaney's performance struck me as being a notable one. Toward the close of the film, Chaney is far more than a mere artificer. He really is Jan, the gnarled, mad old peasant.\" ---New York Tribune\"Though Mr. Seastrom's direction and the acting of the players are masterful, the theme is not very pleasant. Some picture-goers may like this picture very well, while others will not. Mr. Chaney does excellent work and awakens warm sympathy in a role that is the exact opposite in nature to thse he has been given in pictures lately.\" ----Harrison's Reports\n\nPreservation\nThe Tower of Lies is now considered a lost film. The last known surviving copy of the film was reportedly destroyed in the 1965 MGM vault fire.\n\nSee also\nList of lost films\nPassage 8:\nVictor Sjöström\nVictor David Sjöström (Swedish: [ˈvɪ̌kːtɔr ˈɧø̂ːstrœm] (listen); 20 September 1879 – 3 January 1960), also known in the United States as Victor Seastrom, was a pioneering Swedish film director, screenwriter, and actor. He began his career in Sweden, before moving to Hollywood in 1924. Sjöström worked primarily in the silent era; his best known films include The Phantom Carriage (1921), He Who Gets Slapped (1924), and The Wind (1928). Sjöström was Sweden's most prominent director in the \"Golden Age of Silent Film\" in Europe. Later in life, he played the leading role in Ingmar Bergman's Wild Strawberries (1957).\n\nBiography\nBorn in Årjäng/Silbodal, in the Värmland region of Sweden, he was only a year old when his father, Olof Adolf Sjöström, moved the family to Brooklyn, New York. His mother died in 1886, he was seven years old. Sjöström returned to Sweden where he lived with relatives in Stockholm, beginning his acting career at 17 as a member of a touring theater company.\nDrawn from the stage to the fledgling motion picture industry, he made his first film in 1912 under the direction of Mauritz Stiller. Between 1912 and 1923, he directed another forty-one films in Sweden, some of which are now lost. Those surviving include The Sons of Ingmar (1919), Karin, Daughter of Ingmar (1920) and The Phantom Carriage (1921), all based on stories by the Nobel Prize–winning novelist Selma Lagerlöf. Many of his films from the period are marked by subtle character portrayal, fine storytelling and evocative settings in which the Swedish landscape often plays a key psychological role. The naturalistic quality of his films was enhanced by his (then revolutionary) preference for on-location filming, especially in rural and village settings. He is also known as a pioneer of continuity editing in narrative filmmaking.In 1923, Sjöström accepted an offer from Louis B. Mayer to work in the United States. In Sweden, he had acted in his own films as well as in those for others, but in Hollywood he devoted himself solely to directing. Using an anglicized name, Victor Seastrom, he made the drama film Name the Man (1924) based on the Hall Caine novel, The Master of Man. He directed stars of the day such as Greta Garbo, John Gilbert, Lillian Gish, Lon Chaney, and Norma Shearer in another eight films in America before his first talkie in 1930. His 1926 film The Scarlet Letter, starring Lillian Gish as the adulterous Hester Prynne, allows Hester a certain voluptuousness; when she leaves the bare rooms of the town for a date with her lover in the verdant woods, she defiantly pulls off her scarlet letter A, takes off her cap as well, and we see her beautiful, rich head of hair.\nUncomfortable with the modifications needed to direct sound films, Victor Sjöström returned to Sweden where he directed two more films before his final directing effort, an English-language drama filmed in the United Kingdom Under the Red Robe (1937). Over the following fifteen years, Sjöström returned to acting in the theatre, performed a variety of leading roles in more than a dozen films and was a company director of Svensk Film Industri. Aged 78, he gave his final acting performance, probably his best remembered, as the elderly professor Isak Borg in Ingmar Bergman's film Wild Strawberries (1957).\n\nPersonal life\nSjöström was married three times. His daughter was actress Guje Lagerwall (1918-2019).\nVictor Sjöström died in Stockholm at the age of 80, and he was interred in the Norra begravningsplatsen (Northern cemetery).\n\nFilmography\nDirector\nActor\nPassage 9:\nThe Tower of Silence (film)\nThe Tower of Silence (German: Der Turm des Schweigens) is a 1925 German mystic melodrama directed by Johannes Guter and starring Xenia Desni and Nigel Barrie.

In an interview with Billboard, Grey revealed that she had written and recorded a demo version of the track before it had been sent to Minaj who wrote and recorded verses of her own to the song. Grey commented, \"She liked the demo of it enough to keep me on the song. I knew it was maybe gonna happen, but she released a lot of different singles first. So I didn’t really know when she was gonna drop this song. And then about a week ago I got a call from her team and they wondered if I could come to Scotland and do the song with them.\" On November 15, the full song premiered on Saturday Night Online; it was made available on iTunes the next day.\n\nComposition\n\"Bed of Lies\" is a hip hop and pop song, written in the key of B major with a moderate tempo of 86 beats per minute.  The vocals in the song span from G♯3 to B4, and the song follows a chord progression of B – F♯/A♯ – G♯m – F♯/A♯ – B.\n\nCritical reception\nDeniqua Campbell from The Source gave the song a positive review, saying Minaj has yet to let up her unrelenting push to re-ignite her rapping flame and that \"Bed of Lies\" \"appeals to Minaj's more serene nature\". Caitlin White from MTV News praised the song, saying \"Nicki has always done emotional with just the right touch of vulnerability and strength\". Christina Lee from Idolator called it \"a more pointed and detailed version of debut Pinkprint single 'Pills n Potions'\". Lindsey Weber from Vulture said \"Nicki takes a sickly sweet Skylar Grey hook and wraps a nasty ode around it\". Sharan Shetty from Slate called \"Bed of Lies\" \"perhaps the most confessional song Minaj has ever made\" and praised the fact that Minaj didn't come off as having a \"pity party\". Eliza Thompson from Cosmopolitan praised the song and said Grey's hook was \"all pretty and wistful\".\n\nCommercial performance\n\"Bed of Lies\" debuted at number seventy on the US Billboard Hot 100, in doing so it became Minaj's 56th entry on the chart, tying her with Madonna and Dionne Warwick for the third-most entries among women since the chart began in 1958. On January 16, 2015, ARIA certified the single Platinum in Australia for sales of 70,000.\n\nLive performances\nOn November 9, 2014, Minaj and Grey debuted the song performing at the 2014 MTV EMA.

He went to England at the end of World War II as a member of the Royal Air Force, and settled in Kidderminster in Worcestershire in 1947, where he worked as a civilian lorry driver for the RAF. He began playing for Kidderminster Cricket Club in the Birmingham League, and at the start of the 1952 season, opening the bowling for the club's senior team, he had figures of 7 for 9 and 7 for 37.Worcestershire invited him to play for them, and he made his first-class debut against Sussex in July 1952. He took five wickets in the match (his maiden victim being Ken Suttle) and then held on for 4 not out with Peter Richardson (20 not out) to add the 12 runs needed for a one-wicket victory after his county had collapsed from 192 for 2 to 238 for 9. A week later he claimed four wickets against Warwickshire, then a few days later still he managed 6 for 52 (five of his victims bowled) in what was otherwise a disastrous innings defeat to Derbyshire. In the last match of the season he took a career-best 6 for 51 against Glamorgan; he and Reg Perks (4 for 59) bowled unchanged throughout the first innings. Worcestershire won the game and Lobban finished the season with 23 wickets at 23.69.He took 23 wickets again in 1953, but at a considerably worse average of 34.43, and had only two really successful games: against Oxford University in June, when he took 5 for 70, and then against Sussex in July. On this occasion Lobban claimed eight wickets, his most in a match, including 6 for 103 in the first innings. He also made his highest score with the bat, 18, but Sussex won by five wickets.In 1954 Lobban made only two first-class appearances, and managed only the single wicket of Gloucestershire tail-ender Bomber Wells. In his final game, against Warwickshire at Dudley, his nine first-innings overs cost 51. He bowled just two overs in the second innings as Warwickshire completed an easy ten-wicket win. Lobban played one more Second XI game, against Glamorgan II at Cardiff Arms Park; in this he picked up five wickets.\nHe was also a professional boxer and played rugby union for Kidderminster.He later moved to Canada, where he worked as a teacher in Burnaby, British Columbia. He and his wife Celia had a son and two daughters.\nPassage 9:\nThe Last Outpost (1951 film)\nThe Last Outpost is a 1951 American Technicolor Western film directed by Lewis R. Foster, set in the American Civil War with brothers on opposite sides. The film is character actor Burt Mustin's film debut at the age of 67.\nThe film earned an estimated $1,225,000 at the US box office in 1951.  The Last Outpost had the distinction of being the most successful film for the prolific B movie company, Pine-Thomas Productions. The film was re-released in 1962 by Citation Films Inc. under the title Cavalry Charge.\n\nPlot\nIn 1862, Confederate Army Captain Vance Britton (Reagan) and his cavalry force are capturing most of the supplies sent east along the Santa Fe Trail before they reach the Union Army outpost at San Gil, Arizona, where trading post owner Sam McQuade (Ridgely) deals with the Apache Indians. Union Colonel Jeb Britton (Bennett), Vance's brother, is sent West to stop the Confederate raids, unaware that his brother is his adversary. When he arrives with only a small detachment of troops, McQuade tries to persuade Jeb to use the Apaches to subdue the Rebels, but Jeb rejects the idea, certain the Indians would kill settlers as well as Confederate soldiers.\nThat evening McQuade, believing that Jeb rather than Vance is the Britton who was once the fiancé of McQuade's lonely and unhappy wife Julie (Fleming), tries to embarrass them both socially. McQuade angrily tells Julie that she is still pining for Vance and she leaves him. Vance turns the tables on Jeb’s attempt to trap the Rebels and humiliates him. Returning to the fort on foot and bootless, Jeb is informed by McQuade that he has persuaded the government to negotiate with the Apaches. Soon afterwards McQuade is attacked and killed by Apaches. Vance finds a letter on McQuade's body stating that a Union officer is on his way from Washington, D.C. to parley with the Apache chiefs. Vance waylays the officer and takes his place, discovering that Chief Grey Cloud is actually a disgraced former Army general who married an Apache. Gray Cloud knows the real emissary and Britton admits that he is a Confederate officer trying to keep the Apaches out of the war.\nA group of Apaches is arrested for McQuade's murder. Gray Cloud gives Vance 24 hours to free the prisoners as the price of keeping the Apaches from joining forces with the Union troops. Still posing as a Yankee officer, Vance goes to the jail in San Gil, where the jailed Apaches tell him that McQuade was killed for selling them defective guns and tainted liquor. He encounters Julie, who angrily rejects his explanation that he jilted her because he chose the Confederacy. Before Vance can arrange the escape of the prisoners or seize a shipment of gold coin being sent east by stagecoach, Jeb returns from searching for the Rebels and captures his brother. Vance escapes and reluctantly decides to return to Texas.\nGrey Cloud, under a flag of truce, comes to San Gil with his warriors and promises to stay out of the white man’s war if the prisoners are released, but is killed by a civilian. Vance and his command learn of the ensuing Apache attack, and he orders his men to charge the Apaches and save the town. After the battle, Julie returns to the East, promising to reunite with Vance someday. The brothers shake hands before the Confederates ride away.\n\nCast\nRonald Reagan as Capt.

He lived in Set Maat (translated as \"The Place of Truth\"), contemporary Deir el-Medina, on the west bank of the Nile, opposite Thebes. Sennedjem had the title \"Servant in the Place of Truth\". He was buried along with his wife, Iyneferti, and members of his family in a tomb in the village necropolis. His tomb was discovered January 31, 1886. When Sennedjem's tomb was found, it contained furniture from his home, including a stool and a bed, which he used when he was alive.His titles included Servant in the Place of Truth, meaning that he worked on the excavation and decoration of the nearby royal tombs.\n\nSee also\n\nTT1 – (Tomb of Sennedjem, family and wife)\nPassage 3:\nKristján Eldjárn\nKristján Eldjárn (Icelandic: [ˈkʰrɪstjaun ˈɛltjaurtn̥]; 6 December 1916 – 14 September 1982) was the third president of Iceland, from 1968 to 1980.\n\nBiography\nKristján was born in Tjörn, Svarfaðardal, Iceland. His parents were Þórarinn Kr. Eldjárn, a teacher in Tjörn, and Sigrún Sigurhjartardóttir. He graduated in archaeology from the University of Copenhagen and taught at the University of Iceland. In 1957 he was awarded a doctorate for his research into pagan burials in Iceland. He was a teacher at the Akureyri Grammar School and the College of Navigation in Reykjavík, becoming a curator at the National Museum of Iceland in 1945 and its Director in 1947, a position he held until the 1968 presidential election.\nIn 1966–68 he hosted a series of educational TV programs on the (then new) Icelandic National Television (RÚV), in which he showed the audience some of the National Museum's artefacts and explained their historical context. These programs became quite popular, making him a well known and respected popular figure. This no doubt gave him the incentive needed to run in the 1968 presidential election as a politically non-affiliated candidate.\nStarting as the underdog in the 1968 presidential election, running against Ambassador Gunnar Thoroddsen who initially had a 70% lead in the opinion polls, Kristján won 65.6% of the vote on a 92.2% voter turnout. He was re-elected unopposed in 1972 and 1976. In 1980 he decided not to run for another term, wanting to devote his remaining years entirely to continuing his lifelong academic work.\nPresident Kristján Eldjárn died following heart surgery in Cleveland, Ohio on 13 September 1982.His son Þórarinn Eldjárn is one of Iceland's most popular authors, specializing in short stories, but also writing poetry and an occasional novel. His daughter Sigrún Eldjárn is also an author and illustrator of several children's books. Þórarinn's son, Ari Eldjárn, is Iceland's most prominent stand-up comedian.\nPassage 4:\nPlace of birth\nThe place of birth (POB) or birthplace is the place where a person was born. This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person. Practice regarding whether this place should be a country, a territory or a city/town/locality differs in different countries, but often city or territory is used for native-born citizen passports and countries for foreign-born ones.\nAs a general rule with respect to passports, if the place of birth is to be a country, it's determined to be the country that currently has sovereignty over the actual place of birth, regardless of when the birth actually occurred. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth.\nSome countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents. For example, Sweden has used the concept of födelsehemort (\"domicile of birth\") since 1947. This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant.\nSimilarly, Switzerland uses the concept of place of origin. A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother's or father's place of origin. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder's place of origin is stated, not their place of birth. In Japan, the registered domicile is a similar concept.\nIn some countries (primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase jus soli. Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality(-ies) of the baby's parents (referred to as jus sanguinis).\nThere can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality(-ies) of the parents and/or the location of the plane or ship (if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country).\nSome administrative forms may request the applicant's \"country of birth\". It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant's \"place of birth\" or \"nationality at birth\". For example, US citizens born abroad who acquire US citizenship at the time of birth, the nationality at birth will be USA (American), while the place of birth would be the country in which the actual birth takes place.\n\nReference list\n8 FAM 403.4 Place of Birth\nPassage 5:\nBeaulieu-sur-Loire\nBeaulieu-sur-Loire (French pronunciation: ​[boljø syʁ lwaʁ], literally Beaulieu on Loire) is a commune in the Loiret department in north-central France. It is the place of death of Jacques MacDonald, a French general who served in the Napoleonic Wars.\n\nPopulation\nSee also\nCommunes of the Loiret department\nPassage 6:\nPlace of origin\nIn Switzerland, the place of origin (German: Heimatort or Bürgerort, literally \"home place\" or \"citizen place\"; French: Lieu d'origine; Italian: Luogo di attinenza) denotes where a Swiss citizen has their municipal citizenship, usually inherited from previous generations. It is not to be confused with the place of birth or  place of residence, although two or all three of these locations may be identical depending on the person's circumstances.\n\nAcquisition of municipal citizenship\nSwiss citizenship has three tiers. For a person applying to naturalise as a Swiss citizen, these tiers are as follows:\n\nMunicipal citizenship, granted by the place of residence after fulfilling several preconditions, such as sufficient knowledge of the local language, integration into local society, and a minimum number of years lived in said municipality.\nCantonal (state) citizenship, for which a Swiss municipal citizenship is required. This requires a certain number of years lived in said canton.\nCountry citizenship, for which both of the above are required, also requires a certain number of years lived in Switzerland (except for people married to a Swiss citizen, who may obtain simplified naturalisation without having to reside in Switzerland), and involves a criminal background check.The last two kinds of citizenship are a mere formality, while municipal citizenship is the most significant step in becoming a Swiss citizen. \nNowadays the place of residence determines the municipality where citizenship is acquired, for a new applicant, whereas previously there was a historical reason for preserving the municipal citizenship from earlier generations in the family line, namely to specify which municipality held the responsibility of providing social welfare. The law has now been changed, eliminating this form of allocating responsibility to a municipality other than that of the place of residence. Care needs to be taken when translating the term in Swiss documents which list the historical \"Heimatort\" instead of the usual place of birth and place of residence.\nHowever, any Swiss citizen can apply for a second, a third or even more municipal citizenships for prestige reasons or to show their connection to the place they currently live – and thus have several places of origin. As the legal significance of the place of origin has waned (see below), Swiss citizens can often apply for municipal citizenship for no more than 100 Swiss francs after having lived in the same municipality for one or two years. In the past, it was common to have to pay between 2,000 and 4,000 Swiss francs as a citizenship fee, because of the financial obligations incumbent on the municipality to grant the citizenship.\nA child born to two Swiss parents is automatically granted the citizenship of the parent whose last name they hold, so the child gets either the mother's or the father's place of origin. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the citizenship, and thus the place of origin, of the Swiss parent.\n\nInternational confusion\nAlmost uniquely in the world (with the exception of Japan, which lists one's Registered Domicile; and Sweden, which lists the mother's place of domicile as place of birth), the Swiss identity card, passport and driving licence do not show the holder's birthplace, but only their place of origin. The vast majority of countries show the holder's actual birthplace on identity documents. This can lead to administrative issues for Swiss citizens abroad when asked to demonstrate their actual place of birth, as no such information exists on any official Swiss identification documents. Only a minority of Swiss citizens have a place of origin identical to their birthplace. More confusion comes into play through the fact that people can have more than one place of origin.\n\nSignificance and history\nA citizen of a municipality does not enjoy a larger set of rights than a non-citizen of the same municipality. To vote in communal, cantonal or national matters, only the current place of residence matters – or in the case of citizens abroad, the last Swiss place of residence.\nThe law previously required that a citizen's place of origin continued to bear all their social welfare costs for two years after the citizen moved away. In 2012, the National Council voted by 151 to 9 votes to abolish this law. The place of domicile is now the sole payer of welfare costs.In 1923, 1937, 1959 and 1967, more cantons signed treaties that assured that the place of domicile had to pay welfare costs instead of the place of origin, reflecting the fact that fewer and fewer people lived in their place of origin (1860: 59%, in 1910: 34%).In 1681, the Tagsatzung – the then Swiss parliament – decided that beggars should be deported to their place of origin, especially if they were insufficiently cared for by their residential community.In the 19th century, Swiss municipalities even offered free emigration to the United States if the Swiss citizen agreed to renounce municipal citizenship, and with that the right to receive welfare.\n\nSee also\nAncestral home (Chinese)\nBon-gwan\nRegistered domicile\n\n\n== Notes and references ==\nPassage 7:\nMotherland (disambiguation)\nMotherland is the place of one's birth, the place of one's ancestors, or the place of origin of an ethnic group.\nMotherland may also refer to:\n\nMusic\n\"Motherland\" (anthem), the national anthem of Mauritius\nNational Song (Montserrat), also called \"Motherland\"\nMotherland (Natalie Merchant album), 2001\nMotherland (Arsonists Get All the Girls album), 2011\nMotherland (Daedalus album), 2011\n\"Motherland\" (Crystal Kay song), 2004\n\nFilm and television\nMotherland (1927 film), a 1927 British silent war film\nMotherland (2010 film), a 2010 documentary film\nMotherland (2015 film), a 2015 Turkish drama\nMotherland (2022 film), a 2022 documentary film about the Second Nagorno-Karabakh War\nMotherland (TV series), a 2016 British television series\nMotherland: Fort Salem, a 2020 American science fiction drama series\n\nOther uses\nMotherland Party (disambiguation), the name of several political groups\nPersonifications of Russia, including a list of monuments called Motherland\n\nSee also\nAll pages with titles containing Motherland\nMother Country (disambiguation)\nPassage 8:\nValley of Death\nValley of Death may refer to:\n\nPlaces\nValley of Death (Bydgoszcz), the site of a 1939 Nazi mass murder and mass grave site in northern Poland\nValley of Death (Crimea), the site of the Charge of the Light Brigade in the 1854 Battle of Balaclava\nValley of Death (Gettysburg), the 1863 Gettysburg Battlefield landform of Plum Run\nValley of Death (Dukla Pass), the site of a tank battle during the Battle of the Dukla Pass in 1944 (World War II)\nThe Valley of Death, an area of poisonous volcanic gas near the Kikhpinych volcano in Russia\nThe Valley of Death, an area of poisonous volcanic gas near the Tangkuban Perahu volcano in Indonesia\nValley of Death, a nickname for the highly polluted city of Cubatão, Brazil\n\nOther uses\nThe Valley of Death (audio drama), a Doctor Who audio play\nThe Valley of Death (film), a 1968 western film\n\"Valley of Death\", the flawed NewsStand: CNN & Time debut program that caused the Operation Tailwind controversy\nA literary element of \"The Charge of the Light Brigade\" by Alfred, Lord Tennyson\nA reference to the difficulty of covering negative cash flow in the early stages of a start-up company; see Venture capital\n\"The Valley of Death\", a song by the Swedish heavy metal band Sabaton from the 2022 album The War to End All Wars\n\nSee also\nAll pages with titles containing Valley of Death\nDeath Valley (disambiguation)\nValley of the Shadow of Death (disambiguation)\nPassage 9:\nHalldóra Eldjárn\nHalldóra Eldjárn (24 November 1923 – 21 December 2008) was the wife of Icelandic President Kristján Eldjárn and First Lady of Iceland from 1968 to 1980.\nHalldóra Ingólfsdóttir was born and raised in Ísafjörður.

In the first innings of his first match, against Lancashire at The Oval, he took five wickets for 81 runs.In his first full season, 1948, he was Surrey's leading wicket-taker and in the last home game of the season he was awarded his county cap – he celebrated by taking eight Northamptonshire wickets for 46 runs at The Oval, six of them coming in the space of 6.3 overs for seven runs. This would remain the best bowling performance of his first-class career, not surpassed, but he did equal it seven years later. In the following game, the last away match of the season, he took 10 Hampshire wickets for 150 runs in the match at Bournemouth. In the 1948 season as a whole, he took 91 wickets at an average of 28.07. As a tail-end left-handed batsman, he managed just 93 runs in the season at an average of 4.22.The emergence of Tony Lock as a slow left-arm bowler in 1949 brought a stuttering end of McMahon's Surrey career. Though he played in 12 first-class matches in the 1949 season, McMahon took only 19 wickets; a similar number of matches in 1950 brought 34 wickets. In 1951, he played just seven times and in 1952 only three times. In 1953, Lock split the first finger of his left hand, and played in only 11 of Surrey's County Championship matches; McMahon played as his deputy in 14 Championship matches, though a measure of their comparative merits was that Lock's 11 games produced 67 wickets at 12.38 runs apiece, while McMahon's 14 games brought him 45 wickets at the, for him, low average of 21.53. At the end of the 1953 season, McMahon was allowed to leave Surrey to join Somerset, then languishing at the foot of the County Championship and recruiting widely from other counties and other countries.\n\nSomerset cricketer\nSomerset's slow bowling in 1954 was in the hands of leg-spinner Johnny Lawrence, with support from the off-spin of Jim Hilton while promising off-spinner Brian Langford was on national service. McMahon filled a vacancy for a left-arm orthodox spinner that had been there since the retirement of Horace Hazell at the end of the 1952 season; Hazell's apparent successor, Roy Smith, had failed to realise his promise as a bowler in 1953, though his batting had advanced significantly.\nMcMahon instantly became a first-team regular and played in almost every match during his four years with the county, not missing a single Championship game until he was controversially dropped from the side in August 1957, after which he did not play in the Championship again.In the 1954 season, McMahon, alongside fellow newcomer Hilton, was something of a disappointment, according to Wisden: \"The new spin bowlers, McMahon and Hilton, did not attain to the best standards of their craft in a wet summer, yet, like the rest of the attack, they would have fared better with reasonable support in the field and from their own batsmen,\" it said. McMahon took 85 wickets at an average of 27.47 (Hilton took only 42 at a higher average). His best match was against Essex at Weston-super-Mare where he took six for 96 in the first innings and five for 45 in the second to finish with match figures of 11 for 141, which were the best of his career. He was awarded his county cap in the 1954 season, but Somerset remained at the bottom of the table.\nThe figures for the 1955 were similar: McMahon this time took 75 wickets at 28.77 apiece. There was a small improvement in his batting and the arrival of Bryan Lobb elevated McMahon to No 10 in the batting order for most of the season, and he responded with 262 runs and an average of 9.03. This included his highest-ever score, 24, made in the match against Sussex at Frome. A week later in Somerset's next match, he equalled his best-ever bowling performance, taking eight Kent wickets for 46 runs in the first innings of a match at Yeovil through what Wisden called \"clever variation of flight and spin\". These matches brought two victories for Somerset, but there were only two others in the 1955 season and the side finished at the bottom of the Championship for the fourth season running.At the end of the 1955 season, Lawrence retired and McMahon became Somerset's senior spin bowler for the 1956 season, with Langford returning from National Service as the main support. McMahon responded with his most successful season so far, taking 103 wickets at an average of 25.57, the only season in his career in which he exceeded 100 wickets. The bowling average improved still further in 1957 to 23.10 when McMahon took 86 wickets. But his season came to an abrupt end in mid-August 1957 when, after 108 consecutive Championship matches, he was dropped from the first team during the Weston-super-Mare festival. Though he played some games for the second eleven later in August, he regained his place in the first team for only a single end-of-season friendly match, and he was told that his services were not required for the future, a decision, said Wisden, that \"proved highly controversial\".\n\nSacked by Somerset\nThe reason behind McMahon's sacking did not become public knowledge for many years. In its obituary of him in 2002, McMahon was described by Wisden as \"a man who embraced the antipodean virtues of candour and conviviality\". It went on: \"Legend tells of a night at the Flying Horse Inn in Nottingham when he beheaded the gladioli with an ornamental sword, crying: 'When Mac drinks, everybody drinks!'\" The obituary recounts a further escapade in second eleven match at Midsomer Norton where a curfew imposed on the team was circumvented by \"a POW-type loop\" organised by McMahon, \"with his team-mates escaping through a ground-storey window and then presenting themselves again\". As the only Somerset second eleven match that McMahon played in at Midsomer Norton was right at the end of the 1957 season, this may have been the final straw. But in any case there had been \"an embarrassing episode at Swansea's Grand Hotel\" earlier in the season, also involving Jim Hilton, who was also dismissed at the end of the season. Team-mates and club members petitioned for McMahon to be reinstated, but the county club was not to be moved.\nAfter a period in Lancashire League cricket with Milnrow Cricket Club, McMahon moved back to London where he did office work, later contributing some articles to cricket magazines.\n\n\n== Notes and references ==\nPassage 8:\nHartley Lobban\nHartley W Lobban (9 May 1926 – 15 October 2004) was a Jamaican-born first-class cricketer who played 17 matches for Worcestershire in the early 1950s.\n\nLife and career\nLobban played little cricket in Jamaica. He went to England at the end of World War II as a member of the Royal Air Force, and settled in Kidderminster in Worcestershire in 1947, where he worked as a civilian lorry driver for the RAF. He began playing for Kidderminster Cricket Club in the Birmingham League, and at the start of the 1952 season, opening the bowling for the club's senior team, he had figures of 7 for 9 and 7 for 37.Worcestershire invited him to play for them, and he made his first-class debut against Sussex in July 1952. He took five wickets in the match (his maiden victim being Ken Suttle) and then held on for 4 not out with Peter Richardson (20 not out) to add the 12 runs needed for a one-wicket victory after his county had collapsed from 192 for 2 to 238 for 9. A week later he claimed four wickets against Warwickshire, then a few days later still he managed 6 for 52 (five of his victims bowled) in what was otherwise a disastrous innings defeat to Derbyshire. In the last match of the season he took a career-best 6 for 51 against Glamorgan; he and Reg Perks (4 for 59) bowled unchanged throughout the first innings. Worcestershire won the game and Lobban finished the season with 23 wickets at 23.69.He took 23 wickets again in 1953, but at a considerably worse average of 34.43, and had only two really successful games: against Oxford University in June, when he took 5 for 70, and then against Sussex in July. On this occasion Lobban claimed eight wickets, his most in a match, including 6 for 103 in the first innings. He also made his highest score with the bat, 18, but Sussex won by five wickets.In 1954 Lobban made only two first-class appearances, and managed only the single wicket of Gloucestershire tail-ender Bomber Wells. In his final game, against Warwickshire at Dudley, his nine first-innings overs cost 51. He bowled just two overs in the second innings as Warwickshire completed an easy ten-wicket win. Lobban played one more Second XI game, against Glamorgan II at Cardiff Arms Park; in this he picked up five wickets.\nHe was also a professional boxer and played rugby union for Kidderminster.He later moved to Canada, where he worked as a teacher in Burnaby, British Columbia. He and his wife Celia had a son and two daughters.\nPassage 9:\nHenry Moore (cricketer)\nHenry Walter Moore (1849 – 20 August 1916) was an English-born first-class cricketer who spent most of his life in New Zealand.\n\nLife and family\nHenry Moore was born in Cranbrook, Kent, in 1849. He was the son of the Reverend Edward Moore and Lady Harriet Janet Sarah Montagu-Scott, who was one of the daughters of the 4th Duke of Buccleuch. One of his brothers, Arthur, became an admiral and was knighted. Their great \ngrandfather was John Moore, Archbishop of Canterbury from 1783 to 1805. One of their sisters was a maid of honour to Queen Victoria.Moore went to New Zealand in the 1870s and lived in Geraldine and Christchurch. He married Henrietta Lysaght of Hāwera in November 1879, and they had one son. In May 1884 she died a few days after giving birth to a daughter, who also died.In 1886 Moore became a Justice of the Peace in Geraldine. In 1897 he married Alice Fish of Geraldine. They moved to England four years before his death in 1916.\n\nCricket career\nMoore was a right-handed middle-order batsman. In consecutive seasons, 1876–77 and 1877–78, playing for Canterbury, he made the highest score in the short New Zealand first-class season: 76 and 75 respectively. His 76 came in his first match for Canterbury, against Otago. He went to the wicket early on the first day with the score at 7 for 2 and put on 99 for the third wicket with Charles Corfe before he was out with the score at 106 for 3 after a \"very fine exhibition of free hitting, combined with good defence\". Canterbury were all out for 133, but went on to win the match. His 75 came in the next season's match against Otago, when he took the score from 22 for 2 to 136 for 6. The New Zealand cricket historian Tom Reese said, \"Right from the beginning he smote the bowling hip and thigh, going out of his ground to indulge in some forceful driving.\" Canterbury won again.Moore led the batting averages in the Canterbury Cricket Association in 1877–78 with 379 runs at an average of 34.4. Also in 1877–78, he was a member of the Canterbury team that inflicted the only defeat on the touring Australians. In 1896–97, at the age of 47, he top-scored in each innings for a South Canterbury XVIII against the touring Queensland cricket team.\nPassage 10:\nDomenico Distilo\nDomenico Distilo (born 25 December 1978 in Rome, Lazio, Italy) is a filmmaker living and working between Rome, Italy and Berlin, Germany.\nHe graduated in film direction from the Centro Sperimentale di Cinematografia in Rome with the film Unexpected (Inatteso), a documentary on the demand for political asylum in Italy, which was screened at the Festival dei Popoli in Florence and at the Berlinale, within the section \"Forum\" in 2006.\nIn 2008, he won the national prize Premio Solinas for the screenplay of the feature film When elephants fight (Quando gli elefanti combattono), written in collaboration with Filippo Gravino and Guido Iuculano.In 2009, he joined the production company Sciara, where he works as director and producer.\nIn 2011, he directed two documentaries for RAI 3, the Italian cultural public channel: Urban extremes - Jerusalem (Estremi urbani, Gerusalemme), on the territorial conflict in Jerusalem and Romany imaginary - Minority artists (Immaginario Rom - Artisti Contro), on Romany art in Hungary.\nDistilo's works generally focus on social issues, with a special interest in various forms of contemporary art.\nIn his movie Deep time (Margini di sottosuolo) (2012), he explored the boundaries between documentary and fiction with a story on archeology and the feelings that bound people to their past.\nIn 2018 his documentary Manga Do, Igort and the way of the manga won the audience award at the Biografilm Festival in Bologna.

He was briefly adopted into the Nomura family and became known as Nomura Yakichi, though he was later restored to the Inoue family.\nMasaru Inoue was brought up as the son of a samurai belonging to the Chōshū fief. At 15, he entered the Nagasaki Naval Academy established by the Tokugawa shogunate under the direction of a Dutch naval officer. In 1863, Inoue and four friends from the Chōshū clan stowed away on a vessel to the United Kingdom. He studied civil engineering and mining at University College London and returned to Japan in 1868. After working for the government as a technical officer supervising the mining industry, he was appointed Director of the Railway Board in 1871. Inoue played a leading role in Japan's railway planning and construction, including the construction of the Nakasendo Railway, the selection of the alternative route (Tokaido), and the proposals for future mainline railway networks.In 1891 Masaru Inoue founded Koiwai Farm with Yanosuke Iwasaki and Shin Onogi.  After retirement from the government, Inoue founded Kisha Seizo Kaisha, the first locomotive manufacturer in Japan, becoming its first president in 1896.

He was the second son of Cleombrotus I, and grandfather of Areus I, who succeeded him. Although he reigned for more than 60 years, his life is completely unknown, apart from a victory at the Pythian Games in 336 BC. Several theories have been suggested by modern historians to explain such inactivity, but none has gained consensus.\n\nLife and reign\nCleomenes was the second son of king Cleombrotus I (r. 380–371), who belonged to the Agiad dynasty, one of the two royal families of Sparta (the other being the Eurypontids). Cleombrotus died fighting Thebes at the famous Battle of Leuctra in 371. His eldest son Agesipolis II succeeded him, but he died soon after in 370. Cleomenes' reign was instead exceptionally long, lasting 60 years and 10 months according to Diodorus of Sicily, a historian of the 1st century BC. In a second statement, Diodorus nevertheless tells that Cleomenes II reigned 34 years, but he confused him with his namesake Cleomenes I (r. 524–490).\n\nDespite the outstanding length of his reign, very little can be said about Cleomenes. He has been described by modern historians as a \"nonentity\". Perhaps that the apparent weakness of Cleomenes inspired the negative opinion of the hereditary kingship at Sparta expressed by Aristotle in his Politics (written between 336 and 322). However, Cleomenes may have focused on internal politics within Sparta, because military duties were apparently given to the Eurypontid Agesilaus II (r. 400–c.360), Archidamus III (r. 360–338), and Agis III (r. 338–331). As the Spartans notably kept their policies secret from foreign eyes, it would explain the silence of ancient sources on Cleomenes. Another explanation is that his duties were assumed by his elder son Acrotatus, described as a military leader by Diodorus, who mentions him in the aftermath of the Battle of Megalopolis in 331, and again in 315.Cleomenes' only known deed was his chariot race victory at the Pythian Games in Delphi in 336. In the following autumn, he gave the small sum of 510 drachmas for the reconstruction of the Temple of Apollo at Delphi, which had been destroyed by an earthquake in 373. Cleomenes might have made this gift as a pretext to go to Delphi and engage in informal diplomacy with other Greek states, possibly to discuss the consequences of the recent assassination of the Macedonian king Philip II.One short witticism of Cleomenes regarding cockfighting is preserved in the Moralia, written by the philosopher Plutarch in the early 2nd century AD:\nSomebody promised to give to Cleomenes cocks that would die fighting, but he retorted, \"No, don't, but give me those that kill fighting.\"\nAs Acrotatus died before Cleomenes, the latter's grandson Areus I succeeded him while still very young, so Cleomenes' second son Cleonymus acted as regent until Areus' majority. Some modern scholars also give Cleomenes a daughter named Archidamia, who played an important role during Pyrrhus' invasion of the Peloponnese, but the age difference makes it unlikely.\nPassage 7:\nYasuichi Oshima\nYasuichi Oshima (大島 やすいち, Ōshima Yasuichi, born 24 March 1954 in Kyoto) is a Japanese manga artist.

According to folklore gypsies are descendants of an Egyptian pharaoh. In the film, actors are dressed in ancient Egyptian costumes as they dance to flamenco music. As the story continues, the gypsies are run out of their lands and are forced to live nomadic lives, stealing and thieving as a means to survive. The Monty Pythonesque history lesson then continues to present the protagonists’ ancestors and the scene that drives the rest of the film: Trinidad’s (Lola Flores) ancestor places a spell on Enrique’s (Fernando Fernán Gómez) ancestor that will cause his descendant to fall in madly in love with her descendant.\nThe story continues to the present day, that is to say the 1950s, where Trinidad and her uncle Regalito (Miguel Ligero) are charged with stealing six hams from a shop window. This scene presents some of the most entertaining banter in the entire film as Trinidad and Regalito argue their innocence with very matter-of-fact language and mannerisms common to Andalusian gypsies. Their witty mockery, while creating uproars of laughter from the courtroom audience, causes the judges to grow more infuriated with the pair. It is then that Enrique, a lawyer, steps in to defend Trinidad and Regalito. After much deliberation, the two gypsies, after having to pay a fee, are set free.\nThe fee they are required to pay forces Trinidad to find employment. Coincidentally, she finds a job as a maid in Seville at the home of Enrique, the lawyer. Instead of dismissing Trinidad, Enrique decides to make her part of an experiment he plans to conduct. His experiment is to see if he can turn Trinidad from a thieving gypsy into a functioning member of Spanish society. He plans to track change in his Pygmalion-like experiment by playing a song and seeing how she reacts to it. The more refined she becomes, the less she should react to the folkloric music. Trinidad’s reaction to Enrique’s statement, while humorous, presents the moral of the story: she tells him that the spirit of a gypsy is something that no one can tame and that, even though she will try because he has asked her to do this for him, it is an impossible task. Fitted with new, modern clothing, Trinidad’s reaction to the music is a romping performance full of beautiful arm movements and earth-shaking stomps. Trinidad’s performance is so spell binding that, not only is Enrique entranced, but her impromptu tune is so catchy that he hums along to it the very next morning.\nAs the months go by, Enrique’s experiment grows more futile as Trinidad’s charisma wins him over. As Enrique’s coworker sees how entranced he has become by her, he plots to convince Trinidad to leave with the pretense that Enrique’s career might be jeopardized by her presence in his household.

The family moved to the United States when he was seven years old on December 4, 1892, by ferry from Windsor to Detroit, according to his naturalization petition of August 1939. His elder brother, Leo Garnet Dwan (1883–1964), became a physician.\nAllan Dwan studied engineering at the University of Notre Dame and then worked for a lighting company in Chicago. He had a strong interest in the fledgling motion picture industry, and when Essanay Studios offered him the opportunity to become a scriptwriter, he took the job. At that time, some of the East Coast movie makers began to spend winters in California where the climate allowed them to continue productions requiring warm weather. Soon, a number of movie companies worked there year-round, and in 1911, Dwan began working part-time in Hollywood. While still in New York, in 1917 he was the founding president of the East Coast chapter of the Motion Picture Directors Association.\n\nCareer\nDwan started his directing career by accident in 1911, when he was sent by his employers to California, in order to locate a company that had vanished. Dwan managed to track the company down, and learned that they were waiting for the film's director (who was an alcoholic) to return from a binge (and allowing them to return to work). Dwan wired back to his employers in Chicago, informing them of the situation, and suggested that they disband the company. They wired back, instructing Dwan to direct the film. When Dwan informed the company of the situation, and that their jobs were on the line, they responded: \"You're the best damn director we ever saw\".Dwan operated Flying A Studios in La Mesa, California, from August 1911 to July 1912. Flying A was one of the first motion pictures studios in California history. On August 12, 2011, a plaque was unveiled on the Wolff building at Third Avenue and La Mesa Boulevard commemorating Dwan and the Flying A Studios origins in La Mesa, California.\nAfter making a series of westerns and comedies, Dwan directed fellow Canadian-American Mary Pickford in several very successful movies as well as her husband, Douglas Fairbanks, notably in the acclaimed 1922 Robin Hood. Dwan directed Gloria Swanson in eight feature films, and one short film made in the short-lived sound-on-film process Phonofilm. This short, also featuring Thomas Meighan and Henri de la Falaise, was produced as a joke, for the April 26, 1925 \"Lambs' Gambol\" for The Lambs, with the film showing Swanson crashing the all-male club.\nFollowing the introduction of the talkies, Dwan directed child-star Shirley Temple in Heidi (1937) and Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm (1938).\nDwan helped launch the career of two other successful Hollywood directors, Victor Fleming, who went on to direct The Wizard of Oz and Gone With the Wind, and Marshall Neilan, who became an actor, director, writer and producer. Over a long career spanning almost 50 years, Dwan directed 125 motion pictures, some of which were highly acclaimed, such as the 1949 box office hit, Sands of Iwo Jima. He directed his last movie in 1961.Being one of the last surviving pioneers of the cinema, he was interviewed at length for the 1980 documentary series Hollywood.He died in Los Angeles at the age of 96, and is interred in the San Fernando Mission Cemetery, Mission Hills, California.\nDwan has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6263 Hollywood Boulevard.\nDaniel Eagan of Film Journal International described Dwan as one of the early pioneers of cinema, stating that his style \"is so basic as to seem invisible, but he treats his characters with uncommon sympathy and compassion.\"\n\nPartial filmography as director\nSee also\nCanadian pioneers in early Hollywood\nPassage 5:\nSaintly Sinners\nSaintly Sinners is a 1962 American comedy-drama film directed by Jean Yarbrough and starring Don Beddoe, Ellen Corby, Stanley Clements and Paul Bryar.\n\nPlot\nEx-con Joseph Braden has his car temporarily stolen by a pair of bank robbers who hide their loot in the vehicle's spare tire.

He directed a version of The Unknown Soldier in 1985, 30 years after Edvin Laine directed the original version of it. Mollberg's movie's plot was same as Laine's movie. But Mollberg used unknown actors and the movie was colourised and shot by a handhold camera.Mollberg did not begin directing films for the cinema until he was well into his forties. He made a notable splash on the international festival circuit in 1974 with The Earth Is A Sinful Song (1973), his debut feature, an earthy, erotically-charged, blood-soaked tale of a young village girl's ill-fated affair with a Lapp reindeer herdsman. Based on a novel by the late Timo K. Mukka, one of Finland's most controversial young writers, the film \"stunned Scandinavian critics and audiences alike with its simple, terrible power and its authentic sensuality\" (Peter Cowie), and went on to become one of the biggest box-office successes in the Finnish cinema's history. It also introduced Mollberg's trademark style: \"a realistic naturalism full of expressive force with which he merges the people with the scenery, stripping them bare of life's illusions and the polished veneer of culture\" (Sakari Toiviainen). Despite Peter Cowie's efforts, and the acclaim of many other critics and \"independent\" festivals, The Finnish National Film board has stubbornly sequestered this masterpiece, only releasing it in a DVD format incompatible with international viewing, and lacking English subtitles.\nDuring his career he was used to get wide audiences in Finland. His film The Earth is a Sinful Song (1973) sold 709,664 tickets and it is 11th on the list of most admissions to a Finnish film. 590,271 tickets were sold for the screenings of The Unknown Soldier (1985) making it the 17th highest-grossing movie in the history of Finland.\n\nAwards and nominations\nBerlin International Film Festival: Nominated for Golden Bear (1974 and 1981 for films The Earth is a Sinful Song and Milka).\nLocarno International Film Festival: Won Special prize for The Earth is a Sinful Song (1974).\nNapoli Film Festival: Won Best Director award for Pretty Good for a Human (1978).\nJussi Awards: Best Director award for Sotaerakko (1973), The Earth is a Sinful Song (1974), Pretty Good for a Human (1978), The Unknown Soldier (1986), Best Producer award for Milka (1981).\n\nFilmography\n\"Lapsuuteni\", 1967\nTehtaan varjossa, 1969\nSotaerakko, 1972\nMaa on syntinen laulu, 1973\nAika hyvä ihmiseksi, 1977\nMilka – elokuva tabuista, 1980\nTuntematon sotilas, 1985\nYstävät, toverit, 1990\nParatiisin lapset, 1994\nTaustan Mikon kotiinpaluu, 1999\nIson miehen vierailu, 1999\nPuu kulkee, 2000\nHeikuraisen Nauru, 2001\nKorpisen veljekset, 2002\nReissu, 2004\nPassage 7:\nLa Bestia humana\nLa Bestia humana is a 1957 Argentine film whose story is based on the 1890 novel La Bête Humaine by the French writer Émile Zola.\n\nExternal links\nLa Bestia humana at IMDb\nPassage 8:\nOhimai Amaize\nOhimai Amaize (born 9 September 1984) is a Nigerian journalist with a multi-sectoral background that spans anti-corruption, youth advocacy, civil society, political campaigns, brand development, communications strategy and governance.He was producer and anchor of Kakaaki Social – a popular social media news program on Africa Independent Television (AIT) – Nigeria's largest privately owned television network.

He also co-founded the off-off-Broadway Theatre [the Hardware Poets Playhouse] with his wife Audrey Davis Levin and was also an associate artist of The Interact Theatre Company.\nPassage 8:\nBrian Kennedy (gallery director)\nBrian Patrick Kennedy (born 5 November 1961) is an Irish-born art museum director who has worked in Ireland and Australia, and now lives and works in the United States.  He was the director of the Peabody Essex Museum in Salem for 17 months, resigning December 31, 2020. He was the director of the Toledo Museum of Art in Ohio from 2010 to 2019. He was the director of the Hood Museum of Art from 2005 to 2010, and the National Gallery of Australia (Canberra) from 1997 to 2004.\n\nCareer\nBrian Kennedy currently lives and works in the United States after leaving Australia in 2005 to direct the Hood Museum of Art at Dartmouth College. In October 2010 he became the ninth Director of the Toledo Museum of Art. On 1 July 2019, he succeeded Dan Monroe as the executive director and CEO of the Peabody Essex Museum.\n\nEarly life and career in Ireland\nKennedy was born in Dublin and attended Clonkeen College. He received B.A. (1982), M.A. (1985) and PhD (1989) degrees from University College-Dublin, where he studied both art history and history.\nHe worked in the Irish Department of Education (1982), the European Commission, Brussels (1983), and in Ireland at the Chester Beatty Library (1983–85), Government Publications Office (1985–86), and Department of Finance (1986–89). He married Mary Fiona Carlin in 1988.He was Assistant Director at the National Gallery of Ireland in Dublin from 1989 to 1997. He was Chair of the Irish Association of Art Historians from 1996 to 1997, and of the Council of Australian Art Museum Directors from 2001 to 2003. In September 1997 he became Director of the National Gallery of Australia.\n\nNational Gallery of Australia (NGA)\nKennedy expanded the traveling exhibitions and loans program throughout Australia, arranged for several major shows of Australian art abroad, increased the number of exhibitions at the museum itself and oversaw the development of an extensive multi-media site.  Although he oversaw several years of the museum's highest ever annual visitation, he discontinued the emphasis of his predecessor, Betty Churcher, on showing \"blockbuster\" exhibitions.\nDuring his directorship, the NGA gained government support for improving the building and significant private donations and corporate sponsorship. However, the initial design for the building proved controversial generating a public dispute with the original architect on moral rights grounds.  As a result, the project was not delivered during Dr Kennedy's tenure, with a significantly altered design completed some years later.  Private funding supported two acquisitions of British art, including David Hockney's A Bigger Grand Canyon in 1999, and Lucian Freud's After Cézanne in 2001. Kennedy built on the established collections at the museum by acquiring the Holmgren-Spertus collection of Indonesian textiles; the Kenneth Tyler collection of editioned prints, screens, multiples and unique proofs; and the Australian Print Workshop Archive. He was also notable for campaigning for the construction of a new \"front\" entrance to the Gallery, facing King Edward Terrace, which was completed in 2010 (see reference to the building project above).\nKennedy's cancellation of the \"Sensation exhibition\" (scheduled at the NGA from 2 June 2000 to 13 August 2000) was controversial, and seen by some as censorship. He claimed that the decision was due to the exhibition being \"too close to the market\" implying that a national cultural institution cannot exhibit the private collection of a speculative art investor. However, there were other exhibitions at the NGA during his tenure, which could have raised similar concerns. The exhibition featured the privately owned Young British Artists works belonging to Charles Saatchi and attracted large attendances in London and Brooklyn. Its most controversial work was Chris Ofili's The Holy Virgin Mary, a painting which used elephant dung and was accused of being blasphemous. The then-mayor of New York, Rudolph Giuliani, campaigned against the exhibition, claiming it was \"Catholic-bashing\" and an \"aggressive, vicious, disgusting attack on religion.\" In November 1999, Kennedy cancelled the exhibition and stated that the events in New York had \"obscured discussion of the artistic merit of the works of art\". He has said that it \"was the toughest decision of my professional life, so far.\"Kennedy was also repeatedly questioned on his management of a range of issues during the Australian Government's Senate Estimates process - particularly on the NGA's occupational health and safety record and concerns about the NGA's twenty-year-old air-conditioning system. The air-conditioning was finally renovated in 2003. Kennedy announced in 2002 that he would not seek extension of his contract beyond 2004, accepting a seven-year term as had his two predecessors.He became a joint Irish-Australian citizen in 2003.\n\nToledo Museum of Art\nThe Toledo Museum of Art is known for its exceptional collections of European and American paintings and sculpture, glass, antiquities, artist books, Japanese prints and netsuke. The museum offers free admission and is recognized for its historical leadership in the field of art education.  During his tenure, Kennedy has focused the museum's art education efforts on visual literacy, which he defines as \"learning to read, understand and write visual language.\"   Initiatives have included baby and toddler tours, specialized training for all staff, docents, volunteers and the launch of a website, www.vislit.org. In November 2014, the museum hosted the International Visual Literacy Association (IVLA) conference, the first Museum to do so. Kennedy has been a frequent speaker on the topic, including 2010 and 2013 TEDx talks on visual and sensory literacy.\nKennedy has expressed an interest in expanding the museum's collection of contemporary art and art by indigenous peoples. Works by Frank Stella, Sean Scully, Jaume Plensa, Ravinder Reddy and Mary Sibande have been acquired.  In addition, the museum has made major acquisitions of Old Master paintings by Frans Hals and Luca Giordano.During his tenure the Toledo Museum of Art has announced the return of several objects from its collection due to claims the objects were stolen and/or illegally exported prior being sold to the museum.  In 2011 a Meissen sweetmeat stand was returned to Germany followed by an Etruscan Kalpis or water jug to Italy (2013), an Indian sculpture of Ganesha (2014) and an astrological compendium to Germany in 2015.\n\nHood Museum of Art\nKennedy became Director of the Hood Museum of Art in July 2005. During his tenure, he implemented a series of large and small-scale exhibitions and oversaw the production of more than 20 publications to bring greater public attention to the museum's remarkable collections of the arts of America, Europe, Africa, Papua New Guinea and the Polar regions. At 70,000 objects, the Hood has one of the largest collections on any American college of university campus. The exhibition, Black Womanhood: Images, Icons, and Ideologies of the African Body, toured several US venues. Kennedy increased campus curricular use of works of art, with thousands of objects pulled from storage for classes annually. Numerous acquisitions were made with the museum's generous endowments, and he curated several exhibitions: including Wenda Gu: Forest of Stone Steles: Retranslation and Rewriting Tang Dynasty Poetry, Sean Scully: The Art of the Stripe, and Frank Stella: Irregular Polygons.\n\nPublications\nKennedy has written or edited a number of books on art, including:\n\nAlfred Chester Beatty and Ireland 1950-1968: A study in cultural politics, Glendale Press (1988), ISBN 978-0-907606-49-9\nDreams and responsibilities: The state and arts in independent Ireland, Arts Council of Ireland (1990), ISBN 978-0-906627-32-7\nJack B Yeats: Jack Butler Yeats, 1871-1957 (Lives of Irish Artists), Unipub (October 1991), ISBN 978-0-948524-24-0\nThe Anatomy Lesson: Art and Medicine (with Davis Coakley), National Gallery of Ireland (January 1992), ISBN 978-0-903162-65-4\nIreland: Art into History (with Raymond Gillespie), Roberts Rinehart Publishers (1994), ISBN 978-1-57098-005-3\nIrish Painting, Roberts Rinehart Publishers (November 1997),  ISBN 978-1-86059-059-7\nSean Scully: The Art of the Stripe, Hood Museum of Art (October 2008), ISBN 978-0-944722-34-3\nFrank Stella: Irregular Polygons, 1965-1966, Hood Museum of Art (October 2010), ISBN 978-0-944722-39-8\n\nHonors and achievements\nKennedy was awarded the Australian Centenary Medal in 2001 for service to Australian Society and its art. He is a trustee and treasurer of the Association of Art Museum Directors, a peer reviewer for the American Association of Museums and a member of the International Association of Art Critics. In 2013 he was appointed inaugural eminent professor at the University of Toledo and received an honorary doctorate from Lourdes University. Most recently, Kennedy received the 2014 Northwest Region, Ohio Art Education Association award for distinguished educator for art education.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nPassage 9:\nLarry Kent (filmmaker)\nLaurence Lionel \"Larry\" Kent (born May 16, 1937, in Johannesburg, South Africa) is a Canadian filmmaker, who is regarded as an important pioneer of independent filmmaking in Canada.\n\nBiography\nLarry Kent emigrated from South Africa to Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada in 1957 to study psychology and theatre at the University of British Columbia.A devout film buff and scholar, Kent made the transition from the stage to screen in the early 1960s. Kent wrote and directed the existential Canadian indie, post-beatnik, pre-hippie classic The Bitter Ash in 1962 and tirelessly toured the film despite the controversy it garnered nationwide. Filled with profanity and brief nudity, the picture was produced on a shoestring, shot silent with audio dubbed in later and featured a jazz music score.\nHis follow-up film, Sweet Substitute (1964) made money in the United States, a first for any Canadian independent picture. Together with his third picture, the proto-feminist film When Tomorrow Dies, these three movies comprise Kent's \"Vancouver Trilogy\".Kent moved to Montreal in the late 1960s, briefly working for the National Film Board of Canada before quitting to make films that exemplified the wild, drug informed spirit of the youth driven counterculture. His 1967 film High was slated to premiere at the Montreal International Film Festival, but was banned by the Quebec Censor Board at the last minute, while The Apprentice (1971) was one of the first films ever to directly address the linguistic and cultural tensions between anglophones and francophones in Montreal in that era.Although none of these early films received wide distribution, his cultural and critical esteem began to increase when several of them were included in Front & Centre, a retrospective program of historically significant Canadian films which screened at the 1984 Toronto International Film Festival. The Bitter Ash, Sweet Substitute, When Tomorrow Dies and High were also screened as a Kent retrospective at a number of venues in 2002 and 2003, including Cinematheque Ontario in Toronto, the Pacific Cinémathèque in Vancouver and the Canadian Film Institute in Ottawa.He also had occasional acting roles in other directors' films, including Q-Bec My Love (Un succès commercial) and One Man.During the 1970s and throughout the 1980s, Kent continued to explore various aspects of the human condition in his work. Though he slowed down in the 1990s, he returned in 2005 with The Hamster Cage, a black comedy/psychodrama which won the jury prize at the 2005 Austin Fantastic Fest.In 2007, Kent completed post-production work on Hastings Street, a 20-minute Vancouver drama which he had actually made in 1962 as his first-ever film but had never completed due to lack of funding.In 2023, he is slated to receive the Fantasia Film Festival's Trailblazer Award for distinguished career achievement.\n\nSelect filmography\nThe Bitter Ash (1963)\nSweet Substitute (1964)\nWhen Tomorrow Dies (1965)\nHigh (1967)\nFacade (1968)\nThe Apprentice (1971)\nKeep It in the Family (1973)\nThe Slavers (1977)\nYesterday (a.k.a.

He is caught in a love triangle between Elaine (Angela Gann), a prim and proper girl who is saving herself for marriage, and Kathy (Carol Pastinsky), a more sexually available girl whom Tom impregnates.It was a Canadian Film Award nominee for Best Picture at the 17th Canadian Film Awards in 1965, but did not win.\nIt was part of a retrospective screening of Kent's films, alongside The Bitter Ash, When Tomorrow Dies and High, which screened at a number of venues in 2002 and 2003, including Cinematheque Ontario in Toronto, the Pacific Cinémathèque in Vancouver and the Canadian Film Institute in Ottawa.", "answers": ["Johannesburg, South Africa"], "length": 3223, "dataset": "2wikimqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "214b402d003800d93cac0719cd79368392a320201cef08c9"}

The son of a German father and a Jewish mother, he was born in St. Pauli, the poorest part of Hamburg. Despite being of Jewish ancestry, Schünzel was allowed by the Nazis to continue making films for several years until he eventually left in 1937 to live abroad.\n\nLife in Germany\nReinhold Schünzel (or Schuenzel) started his career as an actor in 1915 with a role in the film Werner Krafft. He directed his first film in 1918's Mary Magdalene and in 1920 directed The Girl from Acker Street and Catherine the Great. He was one of Germany's best-known silent film stars after World War I, a period during which films were significantly influenced by the consequences of the war. Schünzel performed in both comedies and dramas, often appearing as a villain or a powerful and corrupt man.\nHe was influenced by filmmakers such as his mentor Richard Oswald and Ernst Lubitsch, for whom he worked as an actor in the film Madame Du Barry in 1919.\nSchünzel's work was very popular in Germany and the Nazi regime gave him the title of Ehrenarier or Honorary Aryan, allowing him to continue to direct and act despite his Jewish heritage (his mother was Jewish). He found that the government, first under Kaiser Wilhelm II and later under Adolf Hitler, interfered with his film projects, compelling him to leave in 1937. Schuenzel described both the Kaiser and Hitler \"persons of recognized authority and the worst possible dramatic taste.\"\nMoving to the United States, he worked in Hollywood, playing Nazis and scientists. One of many examples was the film The Hitler Gang (1944), directed by John Farrow. Made in the style of a gangster film, it depicts the rise of Hitler from a small political adventurer to the dictator of Germany. Reinhold Schünzel played the role of General Erich Ludendorff.\n\nFamily\nSchünzel had a daughter Marianne Stewart, who was born in Berlin, Germany and followed her father by becoming an actress. She appeared in Broadway plays and was known for The Facts of Life (1960), Hush...Hush, Sweet Charlotte (1964), and Time Table (1956).\n\nSchünzel in the United States\nSchünzel came to the United States in 1937, and began his American career in Hollywood at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Among the films he directed were Rich Man, Poor Girl (1938), Ice Follies (1939), Balalaika (1939), and New Wine (1941). He also acted in films like The Hitler Gang (1944), Dragonwyck (1946), and The Vicious Circle (1948), among others. His most memorable performance was as Dr. Anderson, a Nazi conspirator, in the film Notorious released in 1946. Schünzel went to New York in 1945 to make a debut on Broadway. He acted in Temper the Wind in 1946 and Montserrat in 1949.\nAmong the prizes he received was the Federal West German Film prize for the best supporting role in the movie My Father's Horses.\nHe became a U.S citizen in 1943 and he returned to Germany in 1949. Schünzel died of a heart attack in Munich, Germany. Before returning to Germany, he starred in the 1949 Clifford Odets Broadway play The Big Knife.\n\nFilmography\nGerman films\nAmerican films\nRich Man, Poor Girl (1938, director)\nThe Ice Follies of 1939 (1939, director)\nBalalaika (1939, director)\nThe Great Awakening (1941, director)\nHangmen Also Die!

Unbeknownst to the two lovers, Don Juan is watching them from one of the balconies. Horrified by the thought of Maria leaving him for Philippe, he calls upon his Jester servant for help. So that he can pay for a wedding, Juan sends the Fool into town to ask for money from the Mayor (Juan and Phillipe's father), under the false pretense that Juan needs the money to pay off medical bills. When Juan's father learns about his son's true intentions, he gives the Jester two coins so he and Juan can buy some rope to hang themselves with. Outraged by this, Don Juan murders his own father backstage and heads over to the garden where Maria and Philippe were planning to meet.\nMaria arrives shortly after, but is shocked to discover Don Juan there instead of her true love — Philippe. Demanding that she return his feelings or face the consequences, he chases after Maria but is stopped by her father, Don Vespis, who now realizes Juan is unfit to marry his daughter and threatens to have him arrested. Don Juan dispatches of Maria's father by cutting his face off, and as he lay dying, he swears his ghost will haunt Don Juan to exact his revenge.\nPhilippe soon discovers Maria mourning her dead father, and swears to avenge them both. He eventually finds Don Juan and the two engage in a duel which ends with Philippe's gory demise. The Jester then arrives to tell Juan that there is a spectral man who wants to speak with him in the cemetery. The man turns out to be the spirit of Maria's dead father, who warns Don Juan that his soul will be dragged to Hell at midnight.\nAs in the traditional Czech puppet plays, Juan urges children not to commit evil deeds like him.\nJuan's physical body keels over dead into an open grave, while his spirit is lowered into a trapdoor. Instead of being dragged into Hell as the legend suggests, the lifeless puppet merely falls into a compartment beneath the stage. Upon discovering an inanimate Don Juan, The Jester asks how he is going to get paid with his master dead.\nPassage 7:\nDon Juan in Hell (film)\nDon Juan in Hell (Spanish: Don Juan en los infiernos) is a 1991 Spanish drama film directed by Gonzalo Suárez.

He was the son of the Reverend Edward Moore and Lady Harriet Janet Sarah Montagu-Scott, who was one of the daughters of the 4th Duke of Buccleuch. One of his brothers, Arthur, became an admiral and was knighted. Their great \ngrandfather was John Moore, Archbishop of Canterbury from 1783 to 1805. One of their sisters was a maid of honour to Queen Victoria.Moore went to New Zealand in the 1870s and lived in Geraldine and Christchurch. He married Henrietta Lysaght of Hāwera in November 1879, and they had one son. In May 1884 she died a few days after giving birth to a daughter, who also died.In 1886 Moore became a Justice of the Peace in Geraldine. In 1897 he married Alice Fish of Geraldine. They moved to England four years before his death in 1916.\n\nCricket career\nMoore was a right-handed middle-order batsman. In consecutive seasons, 1876–77 and 1877–78, playing for Canterbury, he made the highest score in the short New Zealand first-class season: 76 and 75 respectively. His 76 came in his first match for Canterbury, against Otago. He went to the wicket early on the first day with the score at 7 for 2 and put on 99 for the third wicket with Charles Corfe before he was out with the score at 106 for 3 after a \"very fine exhibition of free hitting, combined with good defence\". Canterbury were all out for 133, but went on to win the match. His 75 came in the next season's match against Otago, when he took the score from 22 for 2 to 136 for 6. The New Zealand cricket historian Tom Reese said, \"Right from the beginning he smote the bowling hip and thigh, going out of his ground to indulge in some forceful driving.\" Canterbury won again.Moore led the batting averages in the Canterbury Cricket Association in 1877–78 with 379 runs at an average of 34.4. Also in 1877–78, he was a member of the Canterbury team that inflicted the only defeat on the touring Australians. In 1896–97, at the age of 47, he top-scored in each innings for a South Canterbury XVIII against the touring Queensland cricket team.\nPassage 9:\nDon Juan in Sicily\nDon Giovanni in Sicilia, internationally released as Don Juan in Sicily, is a 1967 Italian comedy-drama film directed by Alberto Lattuada.

In 1464 he ruled an apanage of several districts jointly with his brother Albert VI, but did not participate actively in administering them.\nIn 1472, John VI was engaged to Sophie, the daughter of Duke Eric II of Pomerania.  The marriage was set to be celebrated in 1474.  However, John VI died before the marriage took place.  The exact date of his death is unknown; he is last mentioned in a document dated 20 May 1474.\nHis last illness was contracted on a journey to Franconia to visit his uncle Elector Albrecht III Achilles of Brandenburg.  In Kulmbach, he was infected with the plague and died.  He was probably buried in Poor Clares monastery in Hof.\n\nExternal links\nGenealogical table of the House of Mecklenburg\nPassage 2:\nEric II, Duke of Mecklenburg\nEric II, Duke of Mecklenburg (German: Erich II., Herzog zu Mecklenburg; 3 September 1483 – 21/22 December 1508) was Duke of Mecklenburg, a son of Magnus II, Duke of Mecklenburg, and his wife Sophie of Pomerania-Stettin.\nEric ruled Mecklenburg-Schwerin jointly with his brothers Henry V and Albert VII and his uncle Balthasar after his father's death on 27 December 1503.  Eric himself probably died on 21 December or 22 December 1508. He was buried in the Doberan Minster in Bad Doberan. He never married and died childless.\nPassage 3:\nJohn I, Duke of Mecklenburg-Stargard\nJohn I, Duke of Mecklenburg-Stargard (1326 – 9 August 1392 or 9 February 1393), Duke of Mecklenburg from 1344 to 1352 and Duke of Mecklenburg-Stargard from 1352 to 1392.\n\nFamily\nHe was probably the youngest child from the second marriage of Lord Henry II \"the Lion\" of Mecklenburg and Anna of Saxe-Wittenberg, a daughter of Duke Albert II of Saxe-Wittenberg.\n\nLife\nJohn I was probably born in 1326.  His father died in 1329, and he remained under guardianship until 1344, when he came of age and began to carry a seal as a participant in the governance of Mecklenburg.  On 8 July 1348, Holy Roman Emperor Charles IV raised John and his brother Albert II to the rank of Duke in Prague.  John, Albert and Charles initially supported the False Waldemar, but in 1350 they reconciled with his supporter Duke Louis V of Bavaria.\nUpon the division of Mecklenburg on 25 November 1352, John was awarded the Lordships of Stargard, Sternbuerg and Ture.  He supported his nephew Albert III of Mecklenburg in his attempts to be recognized as King of Sweden.\n\nMarriages and issue\nJohn married three times. His first wife Rixa (background unknown) probably died soon after the wedding and the marriage remained childless.\nHis second wife Anna was a daughter of the count Adolf VII of Pinneberg and Schauenburg.  She probably died in 1358.  John and Anna had a daughter Anna, who married Wartislaw VI of Pomerania-Wolgast on 4 April 1363.\nJohn's third wife Agnes was the daughter of Ulrich II of Lindow-Ruppin and widow of Lord Nicholas IV of Werle.  They probably married in 1358 and had five children together:\n\nJohn II (died between 6 July and 9 October 1416), co-regent, then Duke of Mecklenburg-Stargard, from 1408 Lord of Sternberg, Friedland, Fürstenberg and Lychen\nUlrich I (died 8 April 1417), co-regent, then Duke of Mecklenburg-Stargard (1392–1417), from 1408 Lord of Neubrandenburg, Stargard, Strelitz and Wesenberg (with Lize)\nRudolf (died after 28 July 1415), was initially Bishop of Skara and from 1390 as Rudolf III Bishop of Schwerin\nAlbert I (died 1397), co-regent of Mecklenburg, from 1396 Coadjutor of Dorpat\nContance (born c. 1373, died 1408)\n\nExternal links\nGenealogical table of the House of Mecklenburg\nPassage 4:\nEilika of Saxony\nEilika of Saxony (c. 1080 – 16 January 1142) was a daughter of Magnus, Duke of Saxony and a member of the Billung dynasty. Through marriage to Otto of Ballenstedt, she was countess of Ballenstedt.\n\nLife\nEilika was the younger daughter of Magnus, Duke of Saxony and Sophia, daughter of King Béla I of Hungary. Since Eilika had no brothers, after her father's death in 1106, Eilika and her sister, Wulfhilde of Saxony, inherited his property. Eilika received property in Bernburg, Weißenfels, Werben and perhaps also in Burgwerden and Kreichau, as well as the Palatinate of Saxony.In 1130 Eilika was in conflict with the citizens of the city of Halle, probably because of her support for Archbishop Norbert of Magdeburg. Fighting broke out, during which Conrad of Eichstadt was killed, and from which Eilika only escaped with difficulty.  \nAround 1131 Eilika wrested the advocacy of the monastery of Goseck (monastery) from Louis of Thuringia, and took it for herself. In 1133 Eilika expelled Abbot Bertold from Goseck for incompetency. In 1134 she introduced his successor, Abbot Penther, to the abbey with a solemn address to the monks. \nIn 1138 Eilika was accused of tyranny (tyrannis), and attacked at her castle of Bernburg.\n\nMarriage and children\nEilika married Count Otto of Ballenstedt before 1095. With Otto, Eilika had two children: Albert the Bear and Adelaide of Ballenstedt, who married Henry II, Margrave of the Nordmark.\nPassage 5:\nHenry IV, Duke of Mecklenburg\nHenry IV, Duke of Mecklenburg (1417 – 9 March 1477) was from 1422 to 1477 Duke of Mecklenburg.\n\nLife\nHenry IV of Mecklenburg, because of his obesity and lavish lifestyle also called the \"Henry the Fat\", was the son of the Duke John IV of Mecklenburg and Catherine of Saxe-Lauenburg.\nHe inherited Mecklenburg when his father died in 1422.  His mother, Catherine, and his uncle, Albert V, acted as Regents until 1436.  He then ruled jointly with his brother John V, until his brothers death in 1442.  In May 1432, he married Dorothea of Brandenburg, the daughter of Elector Frederick I of Brandenburg.\nWith the death of Prince William of Werle in 1436, the male line of the Werle branch of the House of Mecklenburg died out, and Werle fell to the Duchy of Mecklenburg.  After Duke Ulrich II of Mecklenburg-Stargard died in 1471, Mecklenburg was again united under one ruler.\nThe Stettin War of Succession between the Pomeranian Dukes and the Brandenburg Electors ended in late May 1472 through Henry's mediation.\nAt the end of his life, he gradually transferred his power to his sons Albert, John and Magnus.  After Henry's death they ruled jointly, until John died in 1474 and Albert in 1483.  After Albert's death, Magnus ruled alone.  His younger brother Balthasar cared little about the business of government.\nHenry died in 1477 and was buried in the Doberan Abbey.\n\nIssue\nAlbert VI († 1483), Duke of Mecklenburg\nJohn VI († 1474), Duke of Mecklenburg\nMagnus II, Duke of Mecklenburg\nBalthasar Duke of Mecklenburg, coadjutor of the diocese of Schwerin until 1479.\n\nExternal links\nGenealogical table of the House of Mecklenburg\nPassage 6:\nJohn III, Duke of Mecklenburg-Stargard\nJohn III, Duke of Mecklenburg-Stargard (1389 – after 11 November 1438) was from 1416 to 1438 Duke of Mecklenburg, Lord of Stargard, Sternberg, Friedland, Fürstenberg, and Lychen.  To distinguish him from John V, Duke of Mecklenburg, he is sometimes called John the Elder.\n\nFamily\nHe was the oldest child of Duke John II and his wife Catherine (Wilheida) of Lithuania.\n\nLife\nJohn III was probably born in 1389.  In 1416, he took over the reign of Sternberg from his father.  He was taken prisoner by Brandenburg, for unknown reasons.  He was released on 28 June 1427, under the condition that he had to swear an oath of allegiance to the Margrave of Brandenburg.\nIn 1436, he and his cousin Henry and his remote cousin Henry IV of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, jointly inherited the Lordship of Werle.\nHe married Luttrud, the daughter of Albert IV of Anhalt-Köthen.  She was probably a sister of Anna, the first wife of William of Werle, the last Lord of Werle.  The marriage remained childless.\nJohn III died in 1438 and was probably buried in Sternberg.  His cousin Henry of Mecklenburg-Stargard inherited his possessions.\nPassage 7:\nMagnus I, Duke of Mecklenburg\nMagnus I, Duke of Mecklenburg (1345 – 1 September 1384) was Duke of Mecklenburg from 1383 until his death.

She was Duchess consort of Mecklenburg, heiress of Sweden and of Norway, and mother of King Albert of Sweden. \n(c. 1338-1412) .\n\nBiography\nEarly life\nEuphemia was born in 1317 to Eric Magnusson (b. c. 1282-1318), Duke of Södermanland, second son of King Magnus I of Sweden, and Princess Ingeborg of Norway (1300–1360), the heiress and the only legitimate daughter of King Haakon V of Norway (1270– 1319).In 1319, her infant elder brother Magnus VII of Norway (1316–1374) succeeded their maternal grandfather to the throne of Norway. That same year, Swedish nobles exiled their uncle, King Birger of Sweden, after which the infant Magnus was elected King of Sweden. Their mother Ingeborg had a seat in the guardian government as well as the position of an independent ruler of her own fiefs, and played an important part during their childhood and adolescence.The 24 July 1321 marriage contract for Euphemia was signed at Bohus in her mother's fief in Bohuslän. Her mother had plans to take control over Danish Scania, next to her duchy. The marriage was arranged with the terms that Mecklenburg, Saxony, Holstein, Rendsburg and Schleswig would assist Ingeborg in the conquest of Scania. This was approved by the council of Norway but not Sweden. When Ingeborg's forces under command of \nKnut Porse of Varberg, invaded Scania in 1322–23, Mecklenburg betrayed her and the alliance was broken. Eventually, the affair of Euphemia's marriage led to a conflict between Ingeborg and the governments of Sweden and Norway, which led to the demise of Ingeborg's political position in the guardian governments. The marriage took place anyway, after a fifteen-year engagement. Euphemia did not lack influence in Sweden. She is known to have acted as the witness of seals in several documents. In 1335, when King Magnus appointed Nils Abjörnsson (Sparre av Tofta) to drots, the condition that Euphemia would act as his adviser was included in his appointment.\n\nDuchess of Mecklenburg\nEuphemia was married in Rostock on April 10, 1336, to her distant kinsman, Albert II, Duke of Mecklenburg (1318 – 2 February 1379), a North-German lord deeply interested in obtaining some power in Scandinavia. Later the same year, the couple returned to Sweden with Rudolf of Saxony and Henry of Holstein to be present at the coronation of her brother and sister-in-law Blanche of Namur. In Germany, Euphemia's life as a Duchess consort of Mecklenburg does not appear to have affected her status in Sweden, as she was still a political factor there and her name was still placed on various documents. She was the mistress of a very expensive ducal court. In 1340–41, she convinced Magnus to grant renewed trading privileges in Norway to the Hanseatic cities of Mecklenburg, Rostock and Wismar. On 15 April 1357, she granted her the estates Hammar and Farthses  to Skänninge Abbey following the deaths of her half-brothers Haakon and Canute in 1350. She was last confirmed alive 27 October 1363, when she gave up the ownership of her dower estate in Mecklenburg. Her death year is not known, but she is confirmed dead 16 June 1370, when her widower made a vicaria to her memory. Euphemia lived  to see her own second son depose her brother from the Swedish throne, and ascend as King Albert of Sweden in 1364.\n\nIssue\nAt the time of her death, she had five surviving children:\n\nHenry III, Duke of Mecklenburg (c. 1337–1383); Married, firstly, Ingeborg of Denmark (1347–c. 1370), eldest daughter of sonless King Waldemar IV of Denmark.

His brother Magnus I and his son Albert IV took up a brief joint rule of Mecklenburg, which lasted until 1384.\n\nExternal links\nGenealogical table of the House of Mecklenburg\n\n\n== Footnotes ==\nPassage 10:\nChristopher, Duke of Mecklenburg\nChristopher, Duke of Mecklenburg-Gadebusch (30 July 1537 – 4 March 1592) was a son of Albrecht VII, Duke of Mecklenburg.  He was Duke of Mecklenburg-Gadebusch, as well as administrator of Ratzeburg and of the Commandery of Mirow.\n\nLife\nChristopher was born in Augsburg. At the urging of his elder brother John Albert I, the cathedral chapter appointed Christopher as the successor of Bishop Christopher I of Ratzeburg in 1554.  Christopher thus became the first Lutheran administrator of the Bishopric.\nIn 1555, he was also elected coadjutor of Bishop William of Riga, with the right of succession.  His election was controversial and led to armed clashes.  During a clash on 1 July 1556 in Koknese, Christoper and William were both taken prisoner.  They were released in 1557, and Christopher was recognized as coadjutor.  However, when William died in 1563, Christopher found himself unable to exercise his right of succession.  Instead, he was taken prisoner again during renewed fighting against Poland.  He was released in 1569, after he had renounced all claims on Riga.  After his release, he returned to Mecklenburg.\nHe died on 4 March 1592 at Tempzin Abbey and was buried in the northern chapel of the high choir of Schwerin Cathedral.  His widow commissioned a grave monument, which shows a couple kneeling before a prie-dieu.

{"input": "Are both directors of films It'S Never Too Late (1956 Film) and The Slaughter Rule from the same country?", "context": "Passage 1:\nThe Slaughter Rule\nThe Slaughter Rule is a 2002 independent film directed by Alex Smith and Andrew J. Smith and starring Ryan Gosling and David Morse.  The film, set in contemporary Montana, explores the relationship between a small-town high school football player (Gosling), and his troubled coach (Morse). The film was nominated for the Grand Jury Prize at the 2002 Sundance Film Festival.\n\nPlot\nRoy Chutney is a high school senior in the fictional Montana town of Blue Springs. Roy does not have an especially close relationship with his mother Evangeline and has not seen his father in years. That does not prevent Roy from feeling emotionally devastated when he learns that his father has killed himself, and Roy's self-esteem takes a beating when he is cut from the high school football team shortly afterward. Roy whiles away his time by swilling beer with his best friend, Tracy Two Dogs, and falling into a romance with Skyla, a barmaid at a local tavern, but Roy's short time on the high school gridiron seems to have impressed Gideon Ferguson, a local character who coaches an unsanctioned high school six-man football team when he is not delivering newspapers or trying to score a gig singing country songs at nearby honky-tonks.\nGideon thinks that Roy has potential and asks him to join his team; encouraged by Gideon's belief in him, Roy agrees, and he persuades Tracy and his friend Russ to tag along. While playing hardscrabble six-man football helps restore Roy's self-confidence, he finds it does not answer his questions about his future or his relationship with Skyla. When Gideon's overwhelming interest in Roy begins to lend credence to town rumors that Gideon is gay, Roy starts to wonder just why he was asked to join the team.\n\nCast\nRyan Gosling as Roy Chutney\nDavid Morse as Gideon Ferguson\nClea DuVall as Skyla Sisco\nKelly Lynch as Evangeline Chutney\nDavid Cale as Studebaker\nEddie Spears as Tracy Two Dogs\nAmy Adams as Doreen\nKen White as Russ Colfax\n\nProduction\nJay Farrar, founder of the alternative country bands Uncle Tupelo and Son Volt, composed the film's musical score. New songs were written and performed by Vic Chesnutt and Freakwater, and existing songs by Ryan Adams, Uncle Tupelo, and the Pernice Brothers were also included.Filming for the movie largely took place in Great Falls, Montana, and a series of small towns in the Great Falls vicinity.The title of the film comes from the term \"slaughter rule.\" The unofficial rule provides for an athletic competition's premature conclusion if one team is ahead of the other by a certain number of points prior to game's end. The rule helps to avoid humiliating the losing team further.\n\nRelease\nThe film premiered in January 2002 during the Sundance Film Festival. Later that year, the film entered the South by Southwest Film Festival and the AFI Film Festival. It went into limited release nationwide beginning January 2003.\n\nCritical reception\nOn review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 74% based on 31 reviews, and an average rating of 5.9/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"A bleak but original indie, The Slaughter Rule benefits from outstanding performances by Ryan Gosling and David Morse.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 65 out of 100, based on 13 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".While the performances by Morse and Gosling were generally received positively, some reviews of the film criticized the script. Reviewing the film for The New York Times, Stephen Holden praised the performances of Gosling and Morse, but opined that the film is \"confused\" and \"doesn't have much dramatic momentum\". In her review for the Los Angeles Times, Manohla Dargis praised the film's cinematography but wrote that although the film has the virtue of sincerity, the story is \"over-explained\".Joe Leydon of Variety claimed the script \"plays like a first draft\". However, Marjorie Baumgarten of The Austin Chronicle thought that the \"writing and directing team of twin brothers Alex and Andrew Smith have made an astonishingly good first feature\". J. R. Jones, writing in Chicago Reader, described the film as \"powerful\" and especially praised David Morse's performance.\n\nAccolades\nThe film received the FIPRESCI Prize at the 2002 Stockholm Film Festival and the Milagro Award at the 2002 Santa Fe Film Festival.

He was a member of a famous Scottish golfing family. His brother Willie won the U.S. Open in 1899, and Alex won it in both 1906 and 1910. Like many British professionals of his era he spent much of his adult life working as a club professional in the United States.\n\nEarly life\nSmith was born in Carnoustie, Scotland, on 28 January 1874, the son of John D. Smith and Joann Smith née Robinson. On 18 January 1895 he was married to Jessie Maiden—sister of James Maiden—and they had two daughters, Fannie and Margaret, born in 1896 and 1899, respectively. Smith was sometimes referred to as \"Alec\" Smith, especially early in his career.\n\nGolf career\nHe was the head professional at Nassau Country Club in Glen Cove, New York, from 1901 through 1909. James Maiden, who would forge a successful golf career of his own, served as assistant professional under Smith at Nassau.In 1901, Smith lost to Willie Anderson in a playoff for the U.S. Open title. Smith's 1906 U.S. Open victory came at the Onwentsia Club in Lake Forest, Illinois. His 72-hole score of 295 was the lowest at either the U.S. Open or the British Open up to that time, and he won $300. The 1910 U.S. Open was played over the St. Martin's course at the Philadelphia Cricket Club. Smith won a three-man playoff against American John McDermott and another of his own brothers, Macdonald Smith. Alex Smith played in eighteen U.S. Opens in total and accumulated eleven top ten placings.\nSmith, who partnered with C. A. Dunning in the 1905 Metropolitan Open four-ball tournament held on 16 September 1905 at Fox Hills Golf Club on Staten Island, tied for first place with George Low and Fred Herreshoff with a score of 71. A playoff wasn't held due to the fact that Smith was also competing in the medal competition which he won from Willie Anderson.Smith also won the Western Open twice and the Metropolitan Open four times.\n\nLater life\nIn 1910, Smith was a widower and lived with his two young daughters and sister-in-law, Allison Barry, in New Rochelle, New York. He was the head professional at the Westchester Country Club in Rye, New York. After the death of his brother, Willie Smith, he took over responsibility for the design of Club de Golf Chapultepec, which has hosted the Mexican Open multiple times, and the WGC-Mexico Championship since 2017.\n\nDeath and legacy\nSmith died on 21 April 1930 at a sanatorium in Baltimore, Maryland.\n\nTournament wins\nNote: This list may be incomplete1903 Western Open\n1905 Metropolitan Open\n1906 U.S. Open, Western Open\n1909 Metropolitan Open\n1910 U.S. Open, Metropolitan Open\n1913 Metropolitan Open\n\nMajor championships\nWins (2)\n1Defeated John McDermott and MacDonald Smith in an 18-hole playoff – A.

J. Lincoln. It was based on a stage adaptation of the popular 1865 novel It Is Never Too Late to Mend: A Matter-of-Fact Romance by Charles Reade about the corrupt penal system in Australia. It was called \"certainly one of the best pictures ever taken in Australia.\"The novel has been credited with exposing cruelties in the Australian prison system and having helped end the convict system.It is considered a lost film. It was filmed again in 1913 and in 1937 (the latter film being the definitive version starring Tod Slaughter as the evil squire).The film was made by the Tait family, who also made the first Australian feature film, The Story of the Kelly Gang. The Taits went on to make several more films with Lincoln, including The Mystery of a Hansom Cab (1911), The Luck of Roaring Camp (1911), Called Back (1911), The Lost Chord (May 1911), The Bells (1911) and The Double Event (1911). This was Lincoln's first film in a rather short career, as he died soon after in 1917 in Sydney, Australia at age 47.\n\nPlot\nThe film begins at Grance Farm in England, rented by Georgie and William Fileing. The farm is struggling and the brothers have to sell their new hay to stave off the landlord. The Honorable Frank Winchester contemplates going abroad and asks George to accompany him. However, George is in love with his cousin, Susan Merton, and does not want to make the trip.\nSusan is also loved by the villainous John Meadows. He refuses to lend money to Georgie and there is an eviction sale on the farm.George Fielding travels to Australia to make enough money to marry Susan. George discovers gold and a bushranger gang tries to rob him but the other miners come to George's rescue.\nThere is a subplot about a thief acquaintance of George, Tom Robinson, who is sent to gaol and suffers brutal treatment at the hands of the guards. Susan is about to marry the evil Meadows but he is unmasked at the wedding by Isaac Levy. The wedding goes ahead with Susan marrying George instead.\nThe film consisted of 60 scenes. It was issued with a summary of the story and featured chapter titles which prepared the audiences for incidents before they happened. It was also often accompanied by a lecturer.\nAccording to The Age \"Interesting phases of early Australian life are revealed, including the fascinating stories of the gold discoveries... in the construction of the story for picture purposes, the salient features of the novel have been retained and a descriptive address accompanies the production.\"\n\nCast\nStanley Walpole\n\nProduction\nStage adaptations of the novel had been popular since 1865.In February 1911 The Bulletin reported that:\n\nThe Taits are going to produce It’s Never Too Late To Mend in biograph drama form at Melbourne Glaeiarium.   \"Willie\" Lincoln, who was an Australian playwright in his youth, and is nowadays running the \"Paradise\" Pictures at St. Kilda, is understood to be responsible for this biograph version of Charles Reade’s drama.   Picture show condensations of familiar stories, also original film dramas of the sort now imported from America and Europe, might as well be locally fixed up.  There’s no better country than Australia for open-air photography, and few that are nearly as good.\nThe film was shot in Melbourne and \"enacted by a specially-selected company of Victorian artists\" who were \"a selected metropolitan company of 60 performers.\" The estimated budget was £300-£400.\n\nReception\nBox office\nThe movie debuted at the Olympia Theatre in Haymarket, Sydney in January 1911. A lecturer accompanied screenings and would explain the action that took place.\nThe movie broke box office records at the Olympia. It later drew strong crowds in Melbourne as well.\n\nCritical\nThe Bulletin called it:\n\nAn interesting piece... adapted by W.J. Lincoln for dumb show purposes, and Johnson and Gibson had prepared three or four thousand feet of photographs for reproduction on the screen. The picture promised well for the future of the Australian \"art film\" industry. Theadapter has \"potted\" the novel, rather than the drama of the same name, and done it very well. The actors look their parts and play them dramatically, and the heroine, who is a first consideration and the only girl in the piece, fills the bill quite charmingly. For about an hour   \"It’s Never Too Late To Mend \" kept a packed house interested. A man with a ripe, sonorous voice supplied brief descriptive details, and kept the story in a state of coherency, the only noticeable shortcoming being the absence of a moral tag, to the effect that the conversion of the English thief, Tom Robinson, had been fully completed in The Sunny South.\nThe Sydney Sunday Times said there \"was special performances by a company of Australian actors.\"Melbourne's Table Talk called it \"a most gratifying success in all ways. The pictures are clear and the acting is adequate, while to our ideas it is more natural, for it has not the Gallic mannerisms and excessive gesture noticeable in some of the imported pictorial dramas, which are usually interpreted by French artists.\"The Riverine Herald stated \"the cast was well chosen and well balanced, and the dramatic action of the play was finely brought out.\"The Launceston Examiner said \"in its construction the adapter has endeavoured to retain all the main and most salient features of the novel, allowing for the bridging over of many incidents, to make a natural sequence and clear-cut story.\"The Launceston Daily Telegraph said the novel had been \"exceedingly well adapted by W. J. Lincoln... [a] magnificent pictorial representation, so full of strong human interest\".\n\nUSA Release\nThe film was released in the US in August 1914.\n\nLegacy\nThe box office success of the film encouraged the Tait brothers and Millard and Johnson to appoint Lincoln as the main director for their new company, Amalgamated Pictures, which operated for over a year.\nPassage 8:\nIt's Never Too Late (1953 film)\nIt's Never Too Late (Italian: Non è mai troppo tardi) is a 1953 Italian comedy film directed by Filippo Walter Ratti. The film is based on the 1843 novella A Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens.\n\nPlot\nAntonio Trabbi is a greedy old man with a very rough personality and obsessed by money. He deprecates charity and love and has no friends or love interest, being lonely and avoided by people. On Christmas Eve he is visited by the ghost of his former business partner, who warns him about his life-style and announces the visit of three spirits, who will show Antonio past, present and future Christmas days. During the night, the three spirits actually appear to Trabbi, showing him his sad past, the bad reputation he has with everyone and the bad outcome of his actions, which will lead him to a lonely death and to terrible punishments in Hell.

However, in 2009, Rollin began preparation foe Le masque de la Méduse. Rollin originally directed the film as a one-hour short, which was screened at the Cinémathèque de Toulouse, but after the release, Rollin decided to add 20 minutes of additional scenes and then cut the film into two distinct parts, as he did with his first feature, Le Viol du Vampire.  The film was shot on location at the Golden Gate Aquarium and Père Lachaise Cemetery, as well as on stage at the Theatre du Grande Guignol, which is where the longest part of the film takes place.

Snaky, a member of his gang, kills the two Mounties guarding him, and helps him escape, but another Mountie, Jim Wilson, tracks him down and recaptures him. However, as they are making their way back to jail, more members of the gang Marlin belongs to, including the gang's leader, Jean, waylay them and free Marlin once again. Wilson and his partner, Rogers, begin tracking the gang down. The trail leads them to a general store which is owned by Duval, who is Jean's second-in-command, as well as being in love with her. Wilson hatches a plan to go undercover and impersonate a notorious thief and murderer, Benet.  When he gets to the store, he witnesses Duval kill an Indian, when the Indian refuses to sell his furs for fifty cents each. Jean tells him to get out of there, but Wilson gives her his story of being Benet, and wanting to partner with her and split the black market in the region with her. Wilson's cover is further bolstered when Rogers begins spreading a \"rumor\" around town that Wilson is Benet.  After spreading the rumor, Rogers leaves to go get more Mounties to help break up the gang. \nDuval, jealous of the attention Jean is bestowing on Wilson/Benet, as well as being upset over being shut out of their deal, begins to dig into Benet's history.  At the newspaper office, he finds out that the real Benet had been hung a short time earlier.  He takes the newspaper article to Jean, who is furious, and gathers her gang to go after Wilson. Just as they are about to hunt Wilson down, Rogers and the others Mounties arrive. Most of the gang is arrested, but Jean and Marlin escape.  Wilson takes out after the two.  As he catches up with them, Marlin gets a bead on him, but is shot and killed by Jean, who has developed feelings for Wilson.

It went into production on May 9, 1935, directed by Sam Neufeld.  It was scheduled for a June 8 release, and opened on time.\n\nReception\nThe Film Daily gave it a positive review, calling it an \"outdoor action story with better than usual attention to general production details\".  They complimented the scenery, Maynard's roping and riding skills, and felt it had enough action throughout, but went \"slightly overboard on dialogue and gunplay\".

In a brief review, the Motion Picture Herald gave it a lukewarm review, saying that the film was \"fair\", but the cinematography was \"excellent\", and Maynard's performance was \"well-liked\".\nPassage 4:\nQuerelle\nQuerelle is a 1982 West German-French English-language arthouse film directed by Rainer Werner Fassbinder and starring Brad Davis, adapted from French author Jean Genet's 1947 novel Querelle of Brest. It was Fassbinder's last film, released shortly after his death at the age of 37.\n\nPlot\nThe plot centers on the handsome Belgian sailor Georges Querelle, who is also a thief and murderer. When his ship, Le Vengeur, arrives in Brest, he visits the Feria, a bar and brothel for sailors run by the Madame Lysiane, whose lover, Robert, is Querelle's brother. Querelle has a love/hate relationship with his brother: when they meet at La Feria, they embrace, but also punch one another slowly and repeatedly in the belly. Lysiane's husband Nono works behind the bar and also manages La Feria's underhanded affairs with the assistance of his friend, the corrupt police captain Mario.\nQuerelle makes a deal to sell opium to Nono. During the execution of the deal, he murders his accomplice Vic by slitting his throat.  After delivering the drugs, Querelle announces that he wants to sleep with Lysiane.  He knows that this means he will have to throw dice with Nono, who has the privilege of playing a game of chance with all of her prospective lovers. If Nono loses, the suitor is allowed to proceed with his affair. If the suitor loses, however, he must submit to anal sex with Nono first, according to Nono's maxim that \"That way, I can say my wife only sleeps with arseholes.\" Querelle deliberately loses the game, allowing himself to be sodomized by Nono. When Nono gloats about Querelle's \"loss\" to Robert, who won his dice game, the brothers end up in a violent fight.  Later, Querelle becomes Lysiane's lover, and also has sex with Mario.\nLuckily for Querelle, a builder, Gil, murders his work mate Theo, who had been harassing and sexually assaulting him.  Gil hides from the police in an abandoned prison, and Roger, who is in love with Gil, establishes contact between Querelle and Gil in the hopes that Querelle can help Gil flee. Querelle falls in love with Gil, who closely resembles his brother.  Gil returns his affections, but Querelle betrays Gil by tipping off the police. Querelle cleverly arranged it so that the murder of Vic is also blamed on Gil.\nQuerelle's superior, Lieutenant Seblon, is in love with Querelle, and constantly tries to prove his manliness to him. Seblon is aware that Querelle murdered Vic, but chooses to protect him.  Later, Seblon reveals his love and concern to a drunken Querelle, and they kiss and embrace before returning to Le Vengeur.\n\nCast\nBrad Davis as Querelle\nFranco Nero as Lieutenant Seblon\nJeanne Moreau as Lysiane\nLaurent Malet as Roger Bataille\nHanno Pöschl as Robert / Gil\nGünther Kaufmann as Nono\nBurkhard Driest as Mario\nRoger Fritz as Marcellin\nDieter Schidor as Vic Rivette\nNatja Brunckhorst as Paulette\nWerner Asam as Worker\nAxel Bauer as Worker\nNeil Bell as Theo\nRobert van Ackeren as Drunken legionnaire\nWolf Gremm as Drunken legionnaire\nFrank Ripploh as Drunken legionnaire\n\nProduction\nAccording to Genet's biographer Edmund White, Querelle was originally going to be made by Werner Schroeter, with a scenario by Burkhard Driest, and produced by Dieter Schidor. However, Schidor could not find the money to finance a film by Schroeter, and therefore turned to other directors, including John Schlesinger and Sam Peckinpah, before finally settling on Fassbinder. Driest wrote a radically different script for Fassbinder, who then \"took the linear narrative and jumbled it up\". White quotes Schidor as saying \"Fassbinder did something totally different, he took the words of Genet and tried to meditate on something other than the story. The story became totally unimportant for him. He also said publicly that the story was a sort of third-rate police story that wouldn't be worth making a movie about without putting a particular moral impact into it\".Schroeter had wanted to make a black and white film with amateur actors and location shots, but Fassbinder instead shot it with professional actors in a lurid, expressionist color, and on sets in the studio. Edmund White comments that the result is a film in which, \"Everything is bathed in an artificial light and the architectural elements are all symbolic.\"\n\nSoundtrack\nJeanne Moreau – \"Each Man Kills the Things He Loves\" (music by Peer Raben, lyrics from Oscar Wilde's poem \"The Ballad of Reading Gaol\")\n\"Young and Joyful Bandit\" (Music by Peer Raben, lyrics by Jeanne Moreau)Both songs were nominated to the 1984 Razzie Awards for \"Worst Original Song\".\n\nRelease\nQuerelle sold more than 100,000 tickets in the first three weeks after its release in Paris, the first time that a film with a gay theme had achieved such success. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, which categorizes reviews as positive or negative only, the film has an approval rating of 57% calculated based on 14 critics comments. By comparison, with the same opinions being calculated using a weighted arithmetic mean, the rating is 6.10/10. Writing for The New York Times critic Vincent Canby noted that Querelle was \"a mess...a detour that leads to a dead end.\"\nPenny Ashbrook calls Querelle Fassbinder's \"perfect epitaph: an intensely personal statement that is the most uncompromising portrayal of gay male sensibility to come from a major filmmaker.\" Edmund White considers Querelle the only film based on Genet's book that works, calling it \"visually as artificial and menacing as Genet's prose.\" Genet, in discussion with Schidor, said that he had not seen the film, commenting \"You can't smoke at the movies.\"\nPassage 5:\nThulasi (1987 film)\nThulasi is a 1987 Indian Tamil-language romantic drama film directed by Ameerjan.

He is best known for his portrayal of Abraham Lincoln in D.W. Griffith's controversial 1915 silent historical epic The Birth of a Nation.\n\nEarly years\nHenabery was born in Omaha and raised in Los Angeles. He began acting as an amateur in California. Before he worked in films, Henabery worked for the San Pedro, Los Angeles, Salt Lake Railroad. When he was 25 years old, he became an extra for Universal Pictures.\n\nCareer\nHenabery's acting career began in The Joke on Yellentown (1914).  From 1914 to 1917 he appeared in seventeen films, including his portrayal of Lincoln in The Birth of a Nation.\nHenabery also worked as a second-unit director on Griffith's Intolerance (1916), and supervised the filming of at least one extended sequence that appeared in the film. Henabery also acted as Admiral de Coligny in the Renaissance French portion of the film depicting the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre. Throughout the rest of his career, he worked as a director. From the mid-1920s, and after professional disagreements with both Louis B. Mayer at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Adolph Zukor at Paramount Pictures, Henabery found employment as a director for smaller Hollywood studios. \nIn 1931 he joined the Vitaphone studio in New York City, where he directed dozens of short subjects for the next 10 years. Most of them were musicals and comedies, featuring a host of popular singers in 20-minute sketches. Henabery remained with Vitaphone until the New York studio closed in 1940.\nHenabery made documentaries and training films as a member of the Army Signal Corps.\n\nAs Abraham Lincoln\nAlthough Henabery's impersonation of Lincoln was a masterpiece of facial makeup, the 6'1\" (185 cm) Henabery was three inches shorter than the 6'4\" (193 cm) Lincoln. Kevin Brownlow's book The Parade's Gone By (1968) contains a photo of Henabery in costume and makeup as Lincoln, seated in a chair with planks placed on the floor under Henabery's feet so that his knees are raised several inches; this effect (with the planks kept off-camera in the movie) made Henabery's legs appear longer than they actually were.\n\nPersonal life and death\nHenabery and his wife, Lilian, had a daughter and a son. Henabery died on February 18, 1976, aged 88, at the Motion Picture Country House in Los Angeles, California.\n\nFilmography\nDirector\nActor\nThe Race War (1915) with Bessie Buskirk\nPassage 8:\nMcGuire of the Mounted\nMcGuire of the Mounted is a 1923 American crime film directed by Richard Stanton and written by George Hively.

Bill Lusk (Louis), the proprietor of the village saloon and dance hall, is in league with Decker (Johnson), who is engaged in smuggling dope over the border. They find that McGuire is on to them and plot to make him one of them so that they can continue their traffic unhampered. Katie (James), who Decker has in his power because of certain knowledge he possesses, is forced to put some drug in McGuire's punch while he is at the ball held that night in honor of the new wife (Browne) of Major Cordwell's (Lowery), who has just arrived. When McGuire wakes the next morning, he is horror-struck to learn that he is married to Katie. Katie finally comes to love McGuire, though he can never find it in him to forget his Julie. She refuses to carry on any further with the plans of Lusk and Decker, so they plan a new way of getting McGuire. They tell Katie that he is in love with Major Cordwell's wife and are ready to prove it if she will invite her to her house. They also tell the major to be present. As they had expected, the Major comes in while McGuire and Mrs. Cordwell are in a perfectly innocent, though somewhat compromising attitude. A fight ensues and Lusk, watching from the outside, fires his gun and kills the major. McGuire is accused and runs to Julie for refuge. Running back to the hotel after seeing the major killed, Katie is made a prisoner by Lusk and Henri while they prepare to make a getaway.

Many parts of the world are no better policed and the comparative freedom from fear of punishment makes these gentry bold and aggressive. Jack Holt, in the role of Robert Kendall, shows how a man who believes that the same conditions of comparative honesty and freedom from danger obtain on the island as elsewhere, and finds himself mistaken, runs into a situation where he has to take the law into his own hands. When out in one of his boats, he provides himself with a machine gun and in one encounter with pearl pirates, sinks their schooner when they try to drive him away from his own pearl concession.\"\n\nCast\nJack Holt as Robert Kendall\nSylvia Breamer as Rita Durand\nClarence Burton as Nilsson\nAnne Schaefer as Duenna\nJean De Briac as Perrier\nEdwin Stevens as Michaels\nWillard Louis as Governor of Papeete\n\nFilming troubles\nFrom a period newspaper:\n\"Famous Plea Fruitless.\n\"Don't give up the ship.\"\nThis time this was not the appeal of the famous Perry, but Clarence Burton's instructions, and he found them difficult to carry out, especially when the ship gave him up-by sinking. Burton, together with a gang of men who took the parts of pearl divers, was in command of a pearling tug in the new Paramount picture, \"The Man Unconquerable.\" As usual, Burton was the villain. Jack Holt,\nthe star of the picture, in an armed launch gave him battle. Presently the tug commenced to sink, faster than they had intended.\n\"Stick to it!\" yelled Joseph Henabery, the director, hurrying to get the close-ups. But before he could arrive on the scene the tug had gone under. The only close-ups he secured were of Burton and his pearl divers splashing about on the surface trying to remove their clothes so that they could remain afloat. One of the deck hands on the photographer's boat stood by with a boat hook to pull\nthem out when they showed signs of going down for the third time. In order to get a good \"shot\" of the sinking boat it was necessary to drag it by chains to shallow water at high tide and repair it at low tide. For four days a crew of laborers worked at the job; then they sat disgustedly on the beach while they watched the tug towed out to sea again and resunk -this time, properly and with due regard to the fans.\"\n\nFilming locations\nBeach scenes were shot along Balboa Beach in California.", "answers": ["Mcguire Of The Mounted"], "length": 3854, "dataset": "2wikimqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "0df95375e082998e11c14660675ca1d4d28cbf40c094fa47"}

This type of painting that deals with multiple rhythms, colors, and angles, offers viewers a higher-dimensional experience. Billmyer has created patterns in and out of divided planes that go in independent directions before receding back into the canvas, which is his unique adaption of Hofmann’s methods. Many of his patterns and forms appear in the film “The Hypercube: Projections and Slicing.” Billmyer has taught and lectured at the New York School of Interior Design, The Hudson River School, Spellman College, Miami Art Center,  the Naskeay School, Maine, and his own New York School.\nPassage 3:\nJohn Charles Moore Grant, 9th Baron de Longueuil\nJohn Charles Moore de Bienville Grant, 9th Baron de Longueuil was born in 1861 at Bath, Somerset.

Vignola\nRobert G. Vignola (born Rocco Giuseppe Vignola, August 7, 1882 – October 25, 1953) was an Italian-American actor, screenwriter, and film director. A former stage actor, he appeared in many motion pictures produced by Kalem Company and later moved to directing, becoming one of the silent screen's most prolific directors. He directed a handful of films in the early years of talkies but his career essentially ended in the silent era.\n\nEarly life\nVignola was born in August 7, 1882 in Trivigno, a village in the province of Potenza, Basilicata, to Donato Gaetano Vignola, a stone mason, and Anna Rosa Rago.  It is unsure why he used August 5th as his birthday in America. He had two brothers and three sisters, his oldest sister having died at the age of 19 months in Italy. Travelling with his mother and siblings, he left Italy in May 1886, at the age of three. He was raised in Albany, New York. Because of his Christian name of Rocco he was nicknamed \"Rocky\" on the family’s first census in New York. His name Rocco was later changed to Robert. Trained as a barber in his youth, Vignola by age 14 became interested in the circus, practicing contortion and slackwire. Three years later, in 1899, he found his true vocation—acting—and the following year in Albany he established a small performance company that he named \"The Empire Dramatic Club\".\n\nActing career\nIn 1901 he started acting on stage professionally and joined the \"American Stock Company\" in New York. He made his stage debut in \"Romeo and Juliet\", performing with Eleanor Robson Belmont and Kyrle Bellew. In the following years he played leads and became a character actor. Vignola's motion picture career began in 1906 with the short film The Black Hand, directed by Wallace McCutcheon and produced by Biograph Company, generally considered the film that launched the mafia genre.In 1907 he joined Kalem Studios, starring in numerous movies directed by his long-time friend Sidney Olcott often dealing with Irish culture such as The Lad from Old Ireland (1910), The Colleen Bawn (1911), and Arrah-na-Pogue (1911). Olcott would later promote him to assistant director. The Kalem Company traveled across Europe and Middle East, where Vignola did one of his most notable roles as Judas Iscariot in From the Manger to the Cross (1912), among the most acclaimed films of the silent years. According to Moving Picture World, he was the first actor who was placed upon a permanent salary by Kalem.\n\nDirecting career\nVignola directed 110 pictures from 1911 to 1937. His debut as a film director was Rory O'More (1911), co-directed with Olcott. The Vampire (1913), starring Alice Hollister, was well-received by critics and is sometimes cited as the earliest surviving \"vamp\" movie (another title with the same name produced by William Nicholas Selig in 1910 is considered lost). He returned to the theme with The Vampire's Trail (1914), featuring Alice Joyce, Tom Moore and Hollister in a secondary role. He had a long association directing the early movies of Pauline Frederick such as Audrey (1916), Double Crossed (1917), and The Love That Lives (1917).\nVignola is best known for directing Marion Davies in several romantic comedies including Enchantment (1921), Beauty's Worth (1922), and the big-budget epic When Knighthood Was in Flower (1922), which achieved critical and commercial acclaim and established Davies as a movie star. In 1920, he was offered the role of director-general for the Kinkikan Cinematograph Company in Japan and was honored as \"outstanding director of the year\" by Frederick James Smith of the Motion Picture Classic in 1921. The Woman God Changed (1921) and Adam and Eva (1923) were praised for the \"innovative\" use of shadows and lighting effects.With the arrival of the sound era, he directed Broken Dreams (1933), in competition for the Best Foreign Film at the 2nd Venice International Film Festival, and The Scarlet Letter (1934), the last film of Colleen Moore. His sound films were not successful and Vignola retired. His final film work was The Girl from Scotland Yard (1937).  Later that year he directed The Pilgrimage Play (live play in Los Angeles, not the related movie.).  Vignola was associated with the play at least to 1944.\n\nDeath\nVignola died in Hollywood, California in 1953. He was buried in St. Agnes Cemetery, Menands, New York.\n\nPersonal life\nHe lived in a mansion at Whitley Heights owned by William Randolph Hearst. According to legend, Hearst's mistress Marion Davies was allowed to stay without him at Vignola's mansion, worried that she was having affairs and considering Vignola a trusted companion for her as he was homosexual. Sidney Olcott, alone after the passing of his wife Valentine Grant, spent his later life at Vignola's home, where he died in 1949.Vignola was described by Delight Evans as \"the sanest and least temperamental of all celluloid creators. He has infinite patience. He has one quality which makes actors want to work for him: consideration.\" He once said: \"Before a director can learn to control thousands of people and big stars and big scenes, he must first learn to control himself.\" He identified himself as a Republican, although he was not much interested in politics. Vignola visited his birthplace Trivigno with his family, provided money to build the town's war monument and maintained correspondence with some of his relatives.\n\nPartial filmography\nActor\nDirector\nPassage 4:\nShe Wants Me\nShe Wants Me is a 2012 comedy film written and directed by Rob Margolies and starring Josh Gad and Kristen Ruhlin.\n\nPlot\nSam is a writer working on a feature film.

Paolo often recalls his mother and his First Communion, with which he seems to live a totalizing experience in the divine.\nIn his friend Nicola's nightclub, Paolo meets the young Francesca, back from a relationship with an Indian guru, who has just had an abortion and is alone. Intimacy develops between the two: according to Paolo, this is the victory of the ultra sex and of the fusion that completes and exalts everything, a fusion that Francesca assures him thanks to a special oriental technique, which allows the partner a state of permanent efficiency.\nThey shut themselves up in his beach house south of Rome where, after filling the fridge, they spend their time eating and making love, interrupted only by a quick incursion of Paolo's two sons visiting him and a small group of friends. But Francesca at a given moment thinks of leaving for other shores, while Paolo understands that in order to \"communicate\" there is really only one alternative: either to love each other totally, or to tear apart that voluptuous female body, put it in the fridge and eat it by the sea in front of the sun. Thus, after having made animalistic love in the kennel of the beloved dog Giovanni, Paolo's insane anxiety is satisfied: he kills Francesca, cuts her up and keeps her in the refrigerator, eating her piece by piece.\n\nCast\nSergio Castellitto - Paolo\nFrancesca Dellera - Francesca\nPhilippe Léotard\nFarid Chopel\nPetra Reinhardt\nGudrun Gundelach\nNicoletta Boris\nClelia Piscitelli\nElena Wiedermann\nSonia Topazio\nFulvio Falzarano\nPino Tosca\nEleonora Cecere\nMatteo Ripaldi\nDaniele Fralassi\nSalvatore Esposito\nPassage 7:\nDon Chaffey\nDonald Chaffey (5 August 1917 – 13 November 1990) was a British film director, writer, producer, and art director.\nChaffey's film career began as an art director in 1947, and his directorial debut was in 1953.

He started as an actor and theater director, before becoming one of the most influential German-language filmmakers during the Weimar Republic.\n\nEarly years\nPabst was born in Raudnitz, Bohemia, Austria-Hungary (today's Roudnice nad Labem, Czech Republic), the son of a railroad official. While growing up in Vienna, he studied drama at the Academy of Decorative Arts and initially began his career as a stage actor in Switzerland, Austria and Germany. In 1910, Pabst traveled to the United States, where he worked as an actor and director at the German Theater in New York City.In 1914, he decided to become a director, and he returned to recruit actors in Europe. Pabst was in France when World War I began, he was arrested and held as an enemy alien and interned in a prisoner-of-war camp near Brest. While imprisoned, Pabst organised a theatre group at the camp and directed French-language plays. Upon his release in 1919, he returned to Vienna, where he became director of the Neue Wiener Bühne, an avant-garde theatre.\n\nCareer\nPabst began his career as a film director at the behest of Carl Froelich who hired Pabst as an assistant director. He directed his first film, The Treasure, in 1923. He developed a talent for \"discovering\" and developing the talents of actresses, including Greta Garbo, Asta Nielsen, Louise Brooks, and Leni Riefenstahl.Pabst's best known films concern the plight of women, including The Joyless Street (1925) with Greta Garbo and Asta Nielsen, Secrets of a Soul (1926) with Lili Damita, The Loves of Jeanne Ney (1927) with Brigitte Helm, and Pandora's Box (1929) and Diary of a Lost Girl (1929) with American actress Louise Brooks. He also co-directed with Arnold Fanck a mountain film entitled The White Hell of Pitz Palu (1929) starring Leni Riefenstahl.\nAfter the coming of sound, he made a trilogy of films that secured his reputation: Westfront 1918 (1930), The Threepenny Opera (1931) with Lotte Lenya (based on the Bertolt Brecht and Kurt Weill musical), and Kameradschaft (1931). Pabst also filmed three versions of Pierre Benoit's novel L'Atlantide in 1932, in German, English, and French, titled Die Herrin von Atlantis, The Mistress of Atlantis, and L'Atlantide, respectively. In 1933, Pabst directed Don Quixote, once again in German, English, and French versions.\nAfter making A Modern Hero (1934) in the USA and Street of Shadows (1937) in France, Pabst (who was planning to emigrate to the United States) was caught in France in 1939, when war was declared, whilst visiting his mother, and was forced to return to Nazi Germany. Under the auspices of propaganda minister, Josef Goebbels, Pabst made two films in Germany during this period: The Comedians (1941) and Paracelsus (1943).\nPabst directed four opera productions in Italy in 1953: La forza del destino for the Maggio Musicale Fiorentino in Florence (conducted by Dimitri Mitropoulos, the cast included Renata Tebaldi, Fedora Barbieri, Mario del Monaco, Aldo Protti, Cesare Siepi), and a few weeks later, for the Arena di Verona Festival, a spectacular Aïda, with Maria Callas in the title role (conducted by Tullio Serafin, with del Monaco), Il trovatore and again La forza del destino.He directed The Last Ten Days (1955), the first post-war German feature film to feature Adolf Hitler as a character.\n\nDeath\nOn 29 May 1967, Pabst died in Vienna at the age of 81. He was interred at the Zentralfriedhof in Vienna.\n\nAwards\n1941, Venice Film Festival: Gold Medal of the Biennale for Best Director for his film The Comedians\n\nFilmography\nSee also\nMax Deutsch, composer\nPassage 10:\nDevil in the Flesh 2\nDevil in the Flesh 2 (also known as Teacher's Pet) is a 2000 erotic thriller film directed by Marcus Spiegel.

In the first innings of his first match, against Lancashire at The Oval, he took five wickets for 81 runs.In his first full season, 1948, he was Surrey's leading wicket-taker and in the last home game of the season he was awarded his county cap – he celebrated by taking eight Northamptonshire wickets for 46 runs at The Oval, six of them coming in the space of 6.3 overs for seven runs. This would remain the best bowling performance of his first-class career, not surpassed, but he did equal it seven years later. In the following game, the last away match of the season, he took 10 Hampshire wickets for 150 runs in the match at Bournemouth. In the 1948 season as a whole, he took 91 wickets at an average of 28.07. As a tail-end left-handed batsman, he managed just 93 runs in the season at an average of 4.22.The emergence of Tony Lock as a slow left-arm bowler in 1949 brought a stuttering end of McMahon's Surrey career. Though he played in 12 first-class matches in the 1949 season, McMahon took only 19 wickets; a similar number of matches in 1950 brought 34 wickets. In 1951, he played just seven times and in 1952 only three times. In 1953, Lock split the first finger of his left hand, and played in only 11 of Surrey's County Championship matches; McMahon played as his deputy in 14 Championship matches, though a measure of their comparative merits was that Lock's 11 games produced 67 wickets at 12.38 runs apiece, while McMahon's 14 games brought him 45 wickets at the, for him, low average of 21.53. At the end of the 1953 season, McMahon was allowed to leave Surrey to join Somerset, then languishing at the foot of the County Championship and recruiting widely from other counties and other countries.\n\nSomerset cricketer\nSomerset's slow bowling in 1954 was in the hands of leg-spinner Johnny Lawrence, with support from the off-spin of Jim Hilton while promising off-spinner Brian Langford was on national service. McMahon filled a vacancy for a left-arm orthodox spinner that had been there since the retirement of Horace Hazell at the end of the 1952 season; Hazell's apparent successor, Roy Smith, had failed to realise his promise as a bowler in 1953, though his batting had advanced significantly.\nMcMahon instantly became a first-team regular and played in almost every match during his four years with the county, not missing a single Championship game until he was controversially dropped from the side in August 1957, after which he did not play in the Championship again.In the 1954 season, McMahon, alongside fellow newcomer Hilton, was something of a disappointment, according to Wisden: \"The new spin bowlers, McMahon and Hilton, did not attain to the best standards of their craft in a wet summer, yet, like the rest of the attack, they would have fared better with reasonable support in the field and from their own batsmen,\" it said. McMahon took 85 wickets at an average of 27.47 (Hilton took only 42 at a higher average). His best match was against Essex at Weston-super-Mare where he took six for 96 in the first innings and five for 45 in the second to finish with match figures of 11 for 141, which were the best of his career. He was awarded his county cap in the 1954 season, but Somerset remained at the bottom of the table.\nThe figures for the 1955 were similar: McMahon this time took 75 wickets at 28.77 apiece. There was a small improvement in his batting and the arrival of Bryan Lobb elevated McMahon to No 10 in the batting order for most of the season, and he responded with 262 runs and an average of 9.03. This included his highest-ever score, 24, made in the match against Sussex at Frome. A week later in Somerset's next match, he equalled his best-ever bowling performance, taking eight Kent wickets for 46 runs in the first innings of a match at Yeovil through what Wisden called \"clever variation of flight and spin\". These matches brought two victories for Somerset, but there were only two others in the 1955 season and the side finished at the bottom of the Championship for the fourth season running.At the end of the 1955 season, Lawrence retired and McMahon became Somerset's senior spin bowler for the 1956 season, with Langford returning from National Service as the main support. McMahon responded with his most successful season so far, taking 103 wickets at an average of 25.57, the only season in his career in which he exceeded 100 wickets. The bowling average improved still further in 1957 to 23.10 when McMahon took 86 wickets. But his season came to an abrupt end in mid-August 1957 when, after 108 consecutive Championship matches, he was dropped from the first team during the Weston-super-Mare festival. Though he played some games for the second eleven later in August, he regained his place in the first team for only a single end-of-season friendly match, and he was told that his services were not required for the future, a decision, said Wisden, that \"proved highly controversial\".\n\nSacked by Somerset\nThe reason behind McMahon's sacking did not become public knowledge for many years. In its obituary of him in 2002, McMahon was described by Wisden as \"a man who embraced the antipodean virtues of candour and conviviality\". It went on: \"Legend tells of a night at the Flying Horse Inn in Nottingham when he beheaded the gladioli with an ornamental sword, crying: 'When Mac drinks, everybody drinks!'\" The obituary recounts a further escapade in second eleven match at Midsomer Norton where a curfew imposed on the team was circumvented by \"a POW-type loop\" organised by McMahon, \"with his team-mates escaping through a ground-storey window and then presenting themselves again\". As the only Somerset second eleven match that McMahon played in at Midsomer Norton was right at the end of the 1957 season, this may have been the final straw. But in any case there had been \"an embarrassing episode at Swansea's Grand Hotel\" earlier in the season, also involving Jim Hilton, who was also dismissed at the end of the season. Team-mates and club members petitioned for McMahon to be reinstated, but the county club was not to be moved.\nAfter a period in Lancashire League cricket with Milnrow Cricket Club, McMahon moved back to London where he did office work, later contributing some articles to cricket magazines.\n\n\n== Notes and references ==\nPassage 3:\nWale Adebanwi\nWale Adebanwi (born 1969) is a Nigerian-born first Black Rhodes Professor at St Antony's College, Oxford where he was, until June 2021, a Professor of Race Relations, and the Director of the African Studies Centre, School of Interdisciplinary Area Studies, and a Governing Board Fellow.

The film was awarded with the Silver Bear at the 59th Berlin Film Festival.\n\nPlot\nGitti and Chris are a young German couple on vacation at Chris's family villa in Sardinia. Gitti is much more spontaneous and light-hearted than Chris, wanting to go out and try to make friends while Chris remains introverted, preferring to stay in and read, even hiding from his neighbour; her playful demeanor often annoys him, while his guarded attitude exasperates her. When he tries to speak to Gitti about his unhappy feelings about his life and career she interrupts him to say that he muses too much over everything and should consider settling down with her. Chris is upset and insulted by her outburst. Later, Gitti and Chris admit to each other that they often worry they're not the right person for each other.\nWhile shopping for groceries Chris spots Hans, a successful old classmate, and unsuccessfully tries to hide from him. Hans invites the couple to a barbecue at his home with his wife Sana, a successful fashion designer, which Gitti tries to decline as she has already received an invitation from a bohemian couple she has recently met. Chris overrides her and accepts the invitation. While Sana and Hans appear to be the perfect, thriving couple, they quickly prove to be obnoxious, bland, and vapid. Hans eventually reveals that Chris has declined an architecture prize because his design would be melded with another architect, though Chris had previously told Gitti that he hadn't heard back from the competition, which angers Gitti. When Gitti stands up for Chris in the face of Hans's subtle insults, Chris becomes upset.\nThe following day Chris is hyper critical of Gitti, taking her on a long hike during which they get lost. Afterwards he informs her that he will be going for a drink with Hans alone, as Gitti embarrassed him the previous evening. When he asks Gitti why she can't be more normal, like Sana, Gitti argues that she doesn't want to be like everybody else. Though Gitti begs him not to leave her alone at night, he goes anyway, returning in the morning. The following day Chris informs Gitti that he is considering taking an architecture job on the island. While Chris meets with his potential client, Gitti goes exploring on her own, trying out a new makeover and choosing to keep the dress she previously regarded as too \"bourgeoisie\" in an effort to please Chris. After meeting up with Chris by chance, he suggests they invite Hans and Sana to their home. The atmosphere becomes uncomfortable when Gitti runs into the bohemian couple she had previously met; they are put off by her new, put-together appearance and are somewhat hurt that she had stood them up. When they extend the invitation again, Chris clumsily declines, which annoys Gitti.\nGitti makes an effort to tone down her appearance and mannerisms for the dinner with Hans and Sana, but it nevertheless becomes awkward as Chris starts behaving oddly in an attempt to impress the other couple. Gitti becomes more uncomfortable when Chris takes them into his mother's private dream room and mocks her interests for Hans and Sana's amusement. At the end of the night, Hans playfully throws Sana into the villa pool, leading Chris to throw Gitti in as well even as she begs him not to. Upset, she asks Sana to make an excuse so that she and Hans will leave. Chris tells Gitti he loves her and initiates sex, which she accepts dispassionately.\nThe next day, Chris overhears Gitti concocting an excuse to leave early without letting him know. After confronting her, Gitti asserts that she is leaving him, and no longer loves him anymore because he is a weakling. Chris fires back that she is a naive hypocrite and asks her to leave. While packing her things, Gitti falls to the floor and plays dead. At first worried, and then upset by her games, Chris resolves to make things work and let his guard down. He blows raspberries into her stomach, which makes her laugh, and the two finally look at each other.\n\nCast\nBirgit Minichmayr as Gitti\nLars Eidinger as Chris\nNicole Marischka as Sana\nHans-Jochen Wagner as Hans\n\nRelease\nCritical reception\nThe film received positive reviews from film critics.

{"input": "Which film whose director is younger, College Lovers or The Dixie Flyer?", "context": "Passage 1:\nVadim Vlasov\nVadim Nikolayevich Vlasov (Russian: Вадим Николаевич Власов; born 19 December 1980) is a former Russian football player.Vlasov played in the Russian Premier League with FC Lokomotiv Nizhny Novgorod.\nHe is a younger brother of Dmitri Vlasov.\nPassage 2:\nClaude Bracey\nClaude Bracey (June 8, 1909 – September 23, 1940), known variously as the \"Texas Flyer,\" the \"Dixie Flyer,\" and the \"Texas Tornado,\" was an American sprinter who tied world records in the 100-yard and 100-meter races between 1928 and 1932.  He competed for the United States at the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam and also won the 100-yard and 220-yard sprints at the 1928 NCAA Men's Track and Field Championships.\n\nEarly life\nBracey grew up in Humble, Texas and attended Humble High School.  As a boy, he participated in games of \"hare-and-hound,\" in which the children would chase each other from one end of town to the other.  Bracey was so fast that rival sides would quarrel over who which side would have him.  He gained prominence as a runner at Humble High.\n\nRice University\nBracey attended Rice Institute located in Houston, Texas.  He competed in intercollegiate track for the Rice Owls from 1927 to 1930 and for the United States at the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam.  He was regarded as \"the first man to bring Rice Institute athletic fame.\"  Bracey was considered a \"big and rangy\" runner.  Between 1928 and 1929, he gained weight and was reported in 1929 to be six feet tall and approximately 160 pounds.  In 1929, Bracey described his minimalist approach to training as follows:\"Sprinters are born, not made, and running comes natural with me.  As long as I take care of myself and eat reasonably, I get along fine. I don't train any during the summer.  That's vacation time and I make it that by spending those weeks fishing.  Laying off like that doesn't bother me.  After all, a dash man doesn't need much wind.  I only take two or three breaths in 100 yards.\"\nA feature story published in 1929 described Bracey as \"almost a recluse,\" a quiet person who rarely left campus, never wears formal clothes, and \"thinks society is all wet.\"\n\nChampionships and records\nIn June 1928, Bracey won both sprint events at the 1928 NCAA Men's Track and Field Championships with times of 9.6 seconds in the 100-yard race and 20.9 seconds in the 220-yard race.  He was the first athlete from Rice to win an NCAA track championship in any event, and it was 1938 before another Rice athlete (Fred Wolcott) accomplished the feat.He qualified for the U.S. Olympic team in 1928 and traveled with the team to the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam.  He finished fifth in the semifinals of the 100-meter race at the Olympic games with a time of 10.8 seconds. He was the first Rice athlete to compete in the Olympic games; it was 1948 before another Rice athlete competed in the Olympics.At the Texas Relays in March 1929, Bracey tied the world record in the 100-yard sprint with a time of 9.5 seconds.  The next day, he ran the event in 9.4 seconds, but the record was not recognized due to wind conditions.  Football coach Knute Rockne officiated the sprint event in which Bracey's world record was disallowed due to wind conditions.  Rockne told reporters that Bracey was the best sprinter he had seen and added: \"Bracey is a streak.  He is as good as any of them off the marks and runs the last 40 yards faster than any man I ever saw.

Adolfi. The movie stars Jack Whiting, Marian Nixon, Frank McHugh and Guinn 'Big Boy' Williams. The film was based on the story by Earl Baldwin.\n\nPlot\nGuinn 'Big Boy' Williams, a star football player, decides to leave Sanford college after he has found that his girlfriend has eloped with another man. He is driven to the train station by Russell Hopton, his best friend, and also a football player for the same college. Jack Whiting, who plays the part of the student manager of the Sanford college athletic association as well as part of the president of the student body, knows that the college needs Williams to win the important game against Colton college.\nWhiting conspires with his girlfriend, played by Marian Nixon, to stop Williams from leaving. He also makes use of Frank McHugh, who plays the part of Whiting's assistant in the film. Nixon fakes a suicide on a bridge when she notices Hopton and Williams approaching. They quickly run to help  her and both of them fall in love with her, without realizing that she really love Whiting. Williams and Hopton soon become suspicious of each other and constantly spy on each other, leaving Nixon to spend her time with Whiting. Just before the big game, Hopton and Williams have an argument and show no interest in the upcoming game. Whiting suggests that Nixon write each of them an identical love note, telling the recipient that she loves him alone.\nWhen Williams and Hopton receive these notes, they end their quarrelling, each thinking that Nixon prefers them to the other. Halfway through the game, one of them discovers the other's note and they begin  accusing each other of stealing their notes. Their fighting causes them to be benched. Colton ties the score and promises to be the winner, which so scares Hopton and Williams that they shake hands and go back into the game. When the winning touchdown for Sanford is a matter of inches away from the goal line, the two backs waste the last minute of the game trying to decide which of them will have the honor of making the final touchdown and the game ends in a tie.\n\nCast\nJack Whiting as Frank Taylor\nMarian Nixon as Madge Hutton\nFrank McHugh as Speed Haskins\nGuinn 'Big Boy' Williams as Tiny Courtley\nRussell Hopton as Eddie Smith\nWade Boteler as Coach Donovan\nPhyllis Crane as Josephine Crane\nRichard Tucker as Gene Hutton\nCharles Judels as Spectator\nPauline Wagner as Frank McHugh's girl friend\n\nProduction\nThe film was planned as a full-scale musical comedy. The majority of the musical numbers of this film, however, were cut out before general release in the United States because the public had grown tired of musicals by late 1930. Although music was mentioned when the film was first released, ads and reviews soon mentioned that, even though Jack Whiting was a musical comedy star, there was no singing in the picture. These cuts accounts for the very short length of the film. The film was marketed as a straight comedy film. The complete musical film was released intact in countries outside the United States where a backlash against musicals never occurred.\n\nSongs\nAlthough some modern sources mention the songs \"One Minute of Heaven\" and \"Up and At 'Em\" as being performed in this film, they were actually written for the 1929 musical comedy The Forward Pass. Since the film is now lost, and the music was cut from circulating prints in the United States, it is not certain what songs were written for this picture.\n\nPreservation\nNo film elements are known to survive, although there is a copy of the screenplay in the Department of Rare Books and Special Collections at  Princeton University Library. The soundtrack, which was recorded on Vitaphone disks, may survive in private hands. It is unknown whether a copy of this full version still exists.\n\nSee also\nList of lost films\nPassage 9:\nMiloš Zličić\nMiloš Zličić (Serbian Cyrillic: Милош Зличић; born 29 December 1999) is a Serbian football forward who plays for Smederevo 1924.

From the heavy industry in the east where Peters Creek enters the Monongahela River, to the commercial northeast, the suburban northern communities, and the still rural and farming south, the watershed is a veritable patchwork of land use types. There is also a county park, a turnpike, a landfill, and a coal mining legacy to add to the mix. Some communities are relatively stable while others are undergoing rapid development.

The first dam on the river is the Lake Heritage Dam just west of Lanseria International Airport. Just north of this airport is its confluence  with the Jukskei River. Further downstream into the North West province are the Hartbeespoort Dam and the Roodekoppies Dam. Beyond the Hartbeespoort Dam, the stream passes the town of Brits. The Elands River joins downstream from the Vaalkop Dam, about 20 km further the Pienaars River joins its right bank, shortly after exiting the Klipvoor Dam.\nIn Limpopo province, about 35 km further, the river passes the town of Thabazimbi and meanders for many miles through a sparsely inhabited area before joining the Marico River just west of Rooibokkraal at the limit of North West province to form the start of the Limpopo River.\n\nTributaries\nThe tributaries of the Crocodile River include the Bloubankspruit, Hennops River, Jukskei River, Magalies River, Sterkstroom River, Rosespruit, Skeerpoort River, Kareespruit, Elands River, Bierspruit River and Sundays River.\n\nPollution\nThe Crocodile River is one of the most polluted river systems in South Africa. The effects of pollution from two of South Africa's metropolitan areas, Johannesburg and Tshwane, has been detrimental to the ecology of the system. Untreated industrial, mining, agricultural and household waste has deteriorated the water quality throughout most of its course and led to massive algal blooms in the Hartbeespoort Dam and Roodekoppies Dam.

While they were studying color variation of Etheostoma stigmaeum, the speckled darter, Layman and Mayden discovered that there were populations with enough variation that they should be described as unique species.This species was one of five distinct species of fish that were named after former U.S. presidents and a vice-president, based on their leadership in conservation. E. obama was named after Barack Obama, for his work \"particularly in the areas of clean energy and environmental protection, and because he is one of our first leaders to approach conservation and environmental protection from a more global vision,\" according to Layman.\n\nDescription\nEtheostoma obama males have bright orange and iridescent blue speckles, stripes, and checked patterns, with a bright fan-shaped fin that has orange stripes. The males can reach up to 48 mm (1.9 in) long, while the females reach 43 mm (1.7 in) long. 29% of the studied fish had palatine teeth.\n\nSee also\nList of organisms named after famous people (born 1950–present)", "answers": ["yes"], "length": 1495, "dataset": "2wikimqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "6d8a1896713b9716c02241ade5e30c401dea7f0dde5294b8"}

The film stars John Cusack as a writer who adopts a strange young boy (Bobby Coleman) who believes himself to be from Mars. The film was theatrically released on November 2, 2007, by New Line Cinema.\n\nPlot\nDavid Gordon, a popular science fiction author, widowed two years prior as they were trying to adopt a child, is finally matched with a young boy, Dennis. Initially hesitant to adopt alone, he is drawn to him, seeing aspects of himself in him.\nBelieving he is from Mars, Dennis protects himself from the sun's harmful rays, wears weights to counter Earth's weak gravity, eats only Lucky Charms, and hangs upside down to facilitate circulation. He refers often to his mission to study Earth and its people, taking pictures, taking things to catalog, and spending time consulting an ambiguous toy-like device with flashing lights that produces seemingly unintelligible words.\nOnce David decides to adopt Dennis, he spends time getting to know him, patiently coaxing him out of the large cardboard box he hides in. Soon, David is cleared to take Dennis home and meet David's dog, \"Somewhere.\" In Dennis's bedroom is a projector of the solar system that he pronounces inaccurate. With the help of his friend Harlee and sister Liz, David tries to help Dennis overcome his delusion by both indulging it and encouraging him to act like everyone else. Dennis attends school but is quickly expelled for repeatedly 'stealing' items for his collection. Frustrated, David tells Liz that perhaps Dennis is from Mars.\nMeanwhile, David's literary agent, Jeff, pushes him to finish writing his commissioned sequel, which is due soon. He struggles to make time for writing, regularly pulled away from it to deal with Dennis. While sitting down to write, the flash from Dennis's Polaroid camera catches him off-guard and he accidentally breaks some glass. David picks Dennis up and carries him across the room. Upset by David's abrupt action, the boy fears he is going to be sent away. David explains that he was just worried he'd get cut by the glass and that he loves him more than his material possessions. Assuring him that he will never send him away, he encourages Dennis to break more things. They move to the kitchen and break dishes and then spray ketchup and dish detergent at each other. Lefkowitz, from Social Services, appears in the window and sees the mayhem. He rebukes David, setting up a case review.\nDavid encourages Dennis to be from Mars only at home; though he must be from Earth everywhere else. Passing his interview by saying he was pretending, he stays with David. Now his adoptive father, he insists Dennis acknowledge being from Earth, making him hurt and angry. David leaves him with Liz to attend the reveal of his new book, supposedly a sequel. He confesses to Tina, the publisher, that rather than being a sequel, it is a new book titled Martian Child, about Dennis. In her fury, Tina makes a scene, but takes the manuscript as David leaves to be with Dennis.\nMeanwhile, Dennis has left the house with his suitcase of earthly artifacts. When David arrives home, he finds the police and learns the boy is gone, he remembers the place he'd said he was found. David asks Harlee to drive him to the location, where they spot Dennis high up on the outside ledge of the museum's domed roof. David climbs up to him as the police and Liz arrive. Dennis points out a bright searchlight in a nearby cloud as someone coming to take him home, but David assures him it's just a helicopter. David professes his love for Dennis and asserts he will never ever leave him. Eventually Dennis trusts David and they hug.\nDavid's voiceover tells about the parallel of children who come into our world, struggling to understand it, being like little aliens. As Tina reads the manuscript aboard an airplane, she begins to cry.\n\nCast\nIn addition, Anjelica Huston plays Tina, David's publisher.\n\nProduction\nDespite persistent misperceptions, this film is not based on David Gerrold's 2002 semi-autobiographical novel The Martian Child, (although it shares some of the same incidents) but rather is based on his 1994 fictional Hugo and Nebula Award-winning novella of the same name, which has caused much confusion about the source material, especially for Gerrold's fans in segments of the gay community.  The short story does not specify the protagonist's sexual orientation.  Only when, years later, Gerrold rewrote and expanded his story to novella length did he choose to include his sexuality. While Gerrold had, in real life, adopted a son as an openly gay man, in the film the protagonist is straight and has a female love interest. Because of the confusion surrounding the different publication dates of the original short story and the latter novella, some members of the gay community have criticized the lead role in the film being portrayed as straight, even though the main character in the short story was never identified as gay. Gerrold has expressed disappointment that the producers forced the protagonist to be changed from a gay man to a straight widower but felt it was a worthwhile trade-off to get published a story about a child in a group home needing a parent.The film began shooting in Vancouver on May 2, 2005, and completed filming in July 2005, with the studio repeatedly pushing back the release date. Jerry Zucker was hired to direct uncredited reshoots shortly before the film's release.\n\nRelease\nBox office\nMartian Child opened in 2,020 venues on November 2, 2007 and earned $3,376,669 in its first weekend, ranking seventh in the domestic box office and third among the weekend's new releases. The film closed six weeks later on December 13, having grossed $7,500,310 domestically and $1,851,434 overseas, totaling $9,351,744 worldwide.\n\nCritical reception\nThe film received mixed reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 33% score, based on 106 reviews, with an average rating of 5/10. The site's consensus states: \"Despite some charms, overt emotional manipulation and an inconsistent tone prevents Martian Child from being the heartfelt dramedy it aspires to be.\" Metacritic reports a 48 out of 100 rating, based on 26 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".\n\nHome media\nMartian Child was released on DVD on February 12, 2008. It opened at #20 the DVD sales chart, selling 69,000 units for revenue of $1.3 million. As per the latest figures, 400,000 DVD units have been sold, acquiring revenue of $7,613,945.

He married Mary Fiona Carlin in 1988.He was Assistant Director at the National Gallery of Ireland in Dublin from 1989 to 1997. He was Chair of the Irish Association of Art Historians from 1996 to 1997, and of the Council of Australian Art Museum Directors from 2001 to 2003. In September 1997 he became Director of the National Gallery of Australia.\n\nNational Gallery of Australia (NGA)\nKennedy expanded the traveling exhibitions and loans program throughout Australia, arranged for several major shows of Australian art abroad, increased the number of exhibitions at the museum itself and oversaw the development of an extensive multi-media site.  Although he oversaw several years of the museum's highest ever annual visitation, he discontinued the emphasis of his predecessor, Betty Churcher, on showing \"blockbuster\" exhibitions.\nDuring his directorship, the NGA gained government support for improving the building and significant private donations and corporate sponsorship. However, the initial design for the building proved controversial generating a public dispute with the original architect on moral rights grounds.  As a result, the project was not delivered during Dr Kennedy's tenure, with a significantly altered design completed some years later.  Private funding supported two acquisitions of British art, including David Hockney's A Bigger Grand Canyon in 1999, and Lucian Freud's After Cézanne in 2001. Kennedy built on the established collections at the museum by acquiring the Holmgren-Spertus collection of Indonesian textiles; the Kenneth Tyler collection of editioned prints, screens, multiples and unique proofs; and the Australian Print Workshop Archive. He was also notable for campaigning for the construction of a new \"front\" entrance to the Gallery, facing King Edward Terrace, which was completed in 2010 (see reference to the building project above).\nKennedy's cancellation of the \"Sensation exhibition\" (scheduled at the NGA from 2 June 2000 to 13 August 2000) was controversial, and seen by some as censorship. He claimed that the decision was due to the exhibition being \"too close to the market\" implying that a national cultural institution cannot exhibit the private collection of a speculative art investor. However, there were other exhibitions at the NGA during his tenure, which could have raised similar concerns. The exhibition featured the privately owned Young British Artists works belonging to Charles Saatchi and attracted large attendances in London and Brooklyn. Its most controversial work was Chris Ofili's The Holy Virgin Mary, a painting which used elephant dung and was accused of being blasphemous. The then-mayor of New York, Rudolph Giuliani, campaigned against the exhibition, claiming it was \"Catholic-bashing\" and an \"aggressive, vicious, disgusting attack on religion.\" In November 1999, Kennedy cancelled the exhibition and stated that the events in New York had \"obscured discussion of the artistic merit of the works of art\". He has said that it \"was the toughest decision of my professional life, so far.\"Kennedy was also repeatedly questioned on his management of a range of issues during the Australian Government's Senate Estimates process - particularly on the NGA's occupational health and safety record and concerns about the NGA's twenty-year-old air-conditioning system. The air-conditioning was finally renovated in 2003. Kennedy announced in 2002 that he would not seek extension of his contract beyond 2004, accepting a seven-year term as had his two predecessors.He became a joint Irish-Australian citizen in 2003.\n\nToledo Museum of Art\nThe Toledo Museum of Art is known for its exceptional collections of European and American paintings and sculpture, glass, antiquities, artist books, Japanese prints and netsuke. The museum offers free admission and is recognized for its historical leadership in the field of art education.  During his tenure, Kennedy has focused the museum's art education efforts on visual literacy, which he defines as \"learning to read, understand and write visual language.\"   Initiatives have included baby and toddler tours, specialized training for all staff, docents, volunteers and the launch of a website, www.vislit.org. In November 2014, the museum hosted the International Visual Literacy Association (IVLA) conference, the first Museum to do so. Kennedy has been a frequent speaker on the topic, including 2010 and 2013 TEDx talks on visual and sensory literacy.\nKennedy has expressed an interest in expanding the museum's collection of contemporary art and art by indigenous peoples. Works by Frank Stella, Sean Scully, Jaume Plensa, Ravinder Reddy and Mary Sibande have been acquired.  In addition, the museum has made major acquisitions of Old Master paintings by Frans Hals and Luca Giordano.During his tenure the Toledo Museum of Art has announced the return of several objects from its collection due to claims the objects were stolen and/or illegally exported prior being sold to the museum.  In 2011 a Meissen sweetmeat stand was returned to Germany followed by an Etruscan Kalpis or water jug to Italy (2013), an Indian sculpture of Ganesha (2014) and an astrological compendium to Germany in 2015.\n\nHood Museum of Art\nKennedy became Director of the Hood Museum of Art in July 2005. During his tenure, he implemented a series of large and small-scale exhibitions and oversaw the production of more than 20 publications to bring greater public attention to the museum's remarkable collections of the arts of America, Europe, Africa, Papua New Guinea and the Polar regions. At 70,000 objects, the Hood has one of the largest collections on any American college of university campus. The exhibition, Black Womanhood: Images, Icons, and Ideologies of the African Body, toured several US venues. Kennedy increased campus curricular use of works of art, with thousands of objects pulled from storage for classes annually. Numerous acquisitions were made with the museum's generous endowments, and he curated several exhibitions: including Wenda Gu: Forest of Stone Steles: Retranslation and Rewriting Tang Dynasty Poetry, Sean Scully: The Art of the Stripe, and Frank Stella: Irregular Polygons.\n\nPublications\nKennedy has written or edited a number of books on art, including:\n\nAlfred Chester Beatty and Ireland 1950-1968: A study in cultural politics, Glendale Press (1988), ISBN 978-0-907606-49-9\nDreams and responsibilities: The state and arts in independent Ireland, Arts Council of Ireland (1990), ISBN 978-0-906627-32-7\nJack B Yeats: Jack Butler Yeats, 1871-1957 (Lives of Irish Artists), Unipub (October 1991), ISBN 978-0-948524-24-0\nThe Anatomy Lesson: Art and Medicine (with Davis Coakley), National Gallery of Ireland (January 1992), ISBN 978-0-903162-65-4\nIreland: Art into History (with Raymond Gillespie), Roberts Rinehart Publishers (1994), ISBN 978-1-57098-005-3\nIrish Painting, Roberts Rinehart Publishers (November 1997),  ISBN 978-1-86059-059-7\nSean Scully: The Art of the Stripe, Hood Museum of Art (October 2008), ISBN 978-0-944722-34-3\nFrank Stella: Irregular Polygons, 1965-1966, Hood Museum of Art (October 2010), ISBN 978-0-944722-39-8\n\nHonors and achievements\nKennedy was awarded the Australian Centenary Medal in 2001 for service to Australian Society and its art. He is a trustee and treasurer of the Association of Art Museum Directors, a peer reviewer for the American Association of Museums and a member of the International Association of Art Critics. In 2013 he was appointed inaugural eminent professor at the University of Toledo and received an honorary doctorate from Lourdes University.

On two occasions, Mangas refuses to sell Riva to his good friend Luke Fargo (Ben Johnson), despite being offered excellent deals for her.\nLuke brings a government representative to meet with Mangas, trying to come to terms with the Apaches. The most Mangas will promise is the Apache will not break the peace with the whites first.\nMangas desires Riva for his wife, an honor never before extended to a Mexican woman. He has to fight three braves who disagree with him, killing all three. He then tells the band that Riva will not be a squaw, but will be trained as a warrior, again breaking with custom. Following Mangas's second refusal to sell him Riva, whom Luke also wants for a wife, Luke reluctantly attends their wedding.\nMeanwhile a group of American gold seekers enter the Apache lands. After making a gold strike in a stream, they attack the Indians camped on the bank. When Mangas comes to bring the offending miners to the law, they pinion and whip him.

He goes forward to the defenses set up by the Apache under a flag of truce, and recognized by braves who know him and his friendship with Mangas, is passed inside. The friends meet and talk, and Luke leads Mangas, Riva, and their warriors out of the town.

During an extended stay in 1921 he played a major part in the creation of two shows, both produced by Charles B. Cochran, namely\n\nLeague of Notions, at the New Oxford Theatre, for which he composed the music and co-wrote, with John Murray Anderson, the lyrics;\nFun of the Fayre, at the London Pavilion, for which similarly he wrote the music and co-wrote the lyrics\n\nBack to Broadway\nBack in the US he returned to Broadway, working as\ncomposer and lyricist of Jack and Jill (1923), a musical comedy;\nmusical director of The Silver Swan (1929), a musical romance\n\nRadio plays\nIn later years he wrote plays and operettas mostly for radio, such as:\n\nSnapshots: a radioperetta (1929)\nSushannah and the Brush Wielders: a play in 1 act (1929)\nThe Magic Voice: a radio series (1933)\nMen of Action: a series of radio sketches (1933)\nSay, Uncle: a radio series (1933)\nSealed Orders: a radio drama (1934)\nSergeant Gabriel (with Hugh Abercrombie) (1945)\n\nPersonal\nIn 1897 in London he married Lizzie May Stoner.

In 1924, he became a naturalized American citizen. He died on 12 April 1947 in New York City.\n\nNote on his first name\nThe book British Musical Biography by Brown & Stratton (1897) in its entry for John Barratt refers to \"his son William Augustus Barratt\" with details that make it clear that Walter Augustus Barratt is the same person and that a \"William\" Augustus Barratt is a mistake. For professional purposes up to about 1900 he appears to have written as \"W. Augustus Barratt\", and thereafter mostly as simply \"Augustus Barratt\".", "answers": ["War Drums"], "length": 3543, "dataset": "2wikimqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "16b98a59e06d1c72b4da73f79e5c99f936e8c2fdbee29a0b"}

He was the director of the Peabody Essex Museum in Salem for 17 months, resigning December 31, 2020. He was the director of the Toledo Museum of Art in Ohio from 2010 to 2019. He was the director of the Hood Museum of Art from 2005 to 2010, and the National Gallery of Australia (Canberra) from 1997 to 2004.\n\nCareer\nBrian Kennedy currently lives and works in the United States after leaving Australia in 2005 to direct the Hood Museum of Art at Dartmouth College. In October 2010 he became the ninth Director of the Toledo Museum of Art. On 1 July 2019, he succeeded Dan Monroe as the executive director and CEO of the Peabody Essex Museum.\n\nEarly life and career in Ireland\nKennedy was born in Dublin and attended Clonkeen College. He received B.A. (1982), M.A. (1985) and PhD (1989) degrees from University College-Dublin, where he studied both art history and history.\nHe worked in the Irish Department of Education (1982), the European Commission, Brussels (1983), and in Ireland at the Chester Beatty Library (1983–85), Government Publications Office (1985–86), and Department of Finance (1986–89). He married Mary Fiona Carlin in 1988.He was Assistant Director at the National Gallery of Ireland in Dublin from 1989 to 1997. He was Chair of the Irish Association of Art Historians from 1996 to 1997, and of the Council of Australian Art Museum Directors from 2001 to 2003. In September 1997 he became Director of the National Gallery of Australia.\n\nNational Gallery of Australia (NGA)\nKennedy expanded the traveling exhibitions and loans program throughout Australia, arranged for several major shows of Australian art abroad, increased the number of exhibitions at the museum itself and oversaw the development of an extensive multi-media site.  Although he oversaw several years of the museum's highest ever annual visitation, he discontinued the emphasis of his predecessor, Betty Churcher, on showing \"blockbuster\" exhibitions.\nDuring his directorship, the NGA gained government support for improving the building and significant private donations and corporate sponsorship. However, the initial design for the building proved controversial generating a public dispute with the original architect on moral rights grounds.  As a result, the project was not delivered during Dr Kennedy's tenure, with a significantly altered design completed some years later.  Private funding supported two acquisitions of British art, including David Hockney's A Bigger Grand Canyon in 1999, and Lucian Freud's After Cézanne in 2001. Kennedy built on the established collections at the museum by acquiring the Holmgren-Spertus collection of Indonesian textiles; the Kenneth Tyler collection of editioned prints, screens, multiples and unique proofs; and the Australian Print Workshop Archive. He was also notable for campaigning for the construction of a new \"front\" entrance to the Gallery, facing King Edward Terrace, which was completed in 2010 (see reference to the building project above).\nKennedy's cancellation of the \"Sensation exhibition\" (scheduled at the NGA from 2 June 2000 to 13 August 2000) was controversial, and seen by some as censorship. He claimed that the decision was due to the exhibition being \"too close to the market\" implying that a national cultural institution cannot exhibit the private collection of a speculative art investor. However, there were other exhibitions at the NGA during his tenure, which could have raised similar concerns. The exhibition featured the privately owned Young British Artists works belonging to Charles Saatchi and attracted large attendances in London and Brooklyn. Its most controversial work was Chris Ofili's The Holy Virgin Mary, a painting which used elephant dung and was accused of being blasphemous. The then-mayor of New York, Rudolph Giuliani, campaigned against the exhibition, claiming it was \"Catholic-bashing\" and an \"aggressive, vicious, disgusting attack on religion.\" In November 1999, Kennedy cancelled the exhibition and stated that the events in New York had \"obscured discussion of the artistic merit of the works of art\". He has said that it \"was the toughest decision of my professional life, so far.\"Kennedy was also repeatedly questioned on his management of a range of issues during the Australian Government's Senate Estimates process - particularly on the NGA's occupational health and safety record and concerns about the NGA's twenty-year-old air-conditioning system. The air-conditioning was finally renovated in 2003. Kennedy announced in 2002 that he would not seek extension of his contract beyond 2004, accepting a seven-year term as had his two predecessors.He became a joint Irish-Australian citizen in 2003.\n\nToledo Museum of Art\nThe Toledo Museum of Art is known for its exceptional collections of European and American paintings and sculpture, glass, antiquities, artist books, Japanese prints and netsuke. The museum offers free admission and is recognized for its historical leadership in the field of art education.  During his tenure, Kennedy has focused the museum's art education efforts on visual literacy, which he defines as \"learning to read, understand and write visual language.\"   Initiatives have included baby and toddler tours, specialized training for all staff, docents, volunteers and the launch of a website, www.vislit.org. In November 2014, the museum hosted the International Visual Literacy Association (IVLA) conference, the first Museum to do so. Kennedy has been a frequent speaker on the topic, including 2010 and 2013 TEDx talks on visual and sensory literacy.\nKennedy has expressed an interest in expanding the museum's collection of contemporary art and art by indigenous peoples. Works by Frank Stella, Sean Scully, Jaume Plensa, Ravinder Reddy and Mary Sibande have been acquired.  In addition, the museum has made major acquisitions of Old Master paintings by Frans Hals and Luca Giordano.During his tenure the Toledo Museum of Art has announced the return of several objects from its collection due to claims the objects were stolen and/or illegally exported prior being sold to the museum.  In 2011 a Meissen sweetmeat stand was returned to Germany followed by an Etruscan Kalpis or water jug to Italy (2013), an Indian sculpture of Ganesha (2014) and an astrological compendium to Germany in 2015.\n\nHood Museum of Art\nKennedy became Director of the Hood Museum of Art in July 2005. During his tenure, he implemented a series of large and small-scale exhibitions and oversaw the production of more than 20 publications to bring greater public attention to the museum's remarkable collections of the arts of America, Europe, Africa, Papua New Guinea and the Polar regions. At 70,000 objects, the Hood has one of the largest collections on any American college of university campus. The exhibition, Black Womanhood: Images, Icons, and Ideologies of the African Body, toured several US venues. Kennedy increased campus curricular use of works of art, with thousands of objects pulled from storage for classes annually. Numerous acquisitions were made with the museum's generous endowments, and he curated several exhibitions: including Wenda Gu: Forest of Stone Steles: Retranslation and Rewriting Tang Dynasty Poetry, Sean Scully: The Art of the Stripe, and Frank Stella: Irregular Polygons.\n\nPublications\nKennedy has written or edited a number of books on art, including:\n\nAlfred Chester Beatty and Ireland 1950-1968: A study in cultural politics, Glendale Press (1988), ISBN 978-0-907606-49-9\nDreams and responsibilities: The state and arts in independent Ireland, Arts Council of Ireland (1990), ISBN 978-0-906627-32-7\nJack B Yeats: Jack Butler Yeats, 1871-1957 (Lives of Irish Artists), Unipub (October 1991), ISBN 978-0-948524-24-0\nThe Anatomy Lesson: Art and Medicine (with Davis Coakley), National Gallery of Ireland (January 1992), ISBN 978-0-903162-65-4\nIreland: Art into History (with Raymond Gillespie), Roberts Rinehart Publishers (1994), ISBN 978-1-57098-005-3\nIrish Painting, Roberts Rinehart Publishers (November 1997),  ISBN 978-1-86059-059-7\nSean Scully: The Art of the Stripe, Hood Museum of Art (October 2008), ISBN 978-0-944722-34-3\nFrank Stella: Irregular Polygons, 1965-1966, Hood Museum of Art (October 2010), ISBN 978-0-944722-39-8\n\nHonors and achievements\nKennedy was awarded the Australian Centenary Medal in 2001 for service to Australian Society and its art. He is a trustee and treasurer of the Association of Art Museum Directors, a peer reviewer for the American Association of Museums and a member of the International Association of Art Critics. In 2013 he was appointed inaugural eminent professor at the University of Toledo and received an honorary doctorate from Lourdes University. Most recently, Kennedy received the 2014 Northwest Region, Ohio Art Education Association award for distinguished educator for art education.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nPassage 5:\nDana Blankstein\nDana Blankstein-Cohen (born March 3, 1981) is the executive director of the Sam Spiegel Film and Television School.

(French: Mais où est donc passée la septième compagnie?) is a 1973 French-Italian comedy war film directed by Robert Lamoureux. The film portrays the adventures of a French Army squad lost somewhere on the front in May 1940 during the Battle of France.\n\nPlot\nDuring the Battle of France, while German forces are spreading across the country, the 7th Transmission Company suffers an air raid near the Machecoul woods, but survive and hide in the woods. Captain Dumont, the company commander, sends Louis Chaudard, Pithiviers and Tassin to scout the area. After burying the radio cable beneath a sandy road, the squad crosses the field, climbs a nearby hill, and takes position within a cemetery. One man cut down the wrong tree for camouflage, pulling up the radio cable and revealing it to the passing German infantry. The Germans cut the cable, surround the woods, and order a puzzled 7th Company to surrender. The squad tries to contact the company, but then witness their capture and run away.\nCommanded by Staff Sergeant Chaudard, the unit stops in a wood for the night. Pithiviers is content to slow down and wait for the end of the campaign. The next day, he goes for a swim in the lake, in sight of possible German fighters. When Chaudard and Tassin wake up, they leave the camp without their weapons to look for Pithiviers. Tassin finds him and gives an angry warning, but Pithiviers convinces Tassin to join him in the lake. Chaudard orders them to get out, but distracted by a rabbit, falls into the lake. While Chaudard teaches his men how to swim, two German fighter planes appear, forcing them out of the water. After shooting down one of the German planes, a French pilot, Lieutenant Duvauchel, makes an emergency landing and escapes before his plane explodes. PFC Pithiviers, seeing the bad shape of one of his shoes, destroys what is left of his shoe sole. Tassin is sent on patrol to get food and a new pair of shoes for Pithiviers. Tassin arrives in a farm, but only finds a dog, so he returns and Chaudard goes to the farm after nightfall. The farmer returns with her daughter-in-law and Lt Duvauchel, and she welcomes Chaudard. Duvauchel, who is hiding behind the door, comes out upon hearing the news and decides to meet Chaudard's men.\nWhen Chaudard and Duvauchel return to the camp, Tassin and Pithiviers are roasting a rabbit they caught. Duvauchel realizes that Chaudard has been lying and takes command.\nThe following day, the men leave the wood in early morning and capture a German armored tow truck after killing its two drivers. They originally planned to abandon the truck and the two dead Germans in the woods, but instead realized that the truck is the best way to disguise themselves and free the 7th Company. They put on the Germans' uniforms, recover another soldier of the 7th Company, who succeeded in escaping, and obtain resources from a collaborator who mistook them for Germans.\nOn their way, they encounter a National Gendarmerie patrol, who appear to be a 5th column. The patrol injures the newest member of their group, a young soldier, and then are killed by Tassin. In revenge, they destroy a German tank using the tow truck's cannon gun.\nThey planned to go to Paris but are misguided by their own colonel, but find the 7th Company with guards who are bringing them to Germany. Using their cover, they make the guards run in front of the truck, allowing the company to get away. When Captain Dumont joins his Chaudard, Tassin, and Pithiviers in the truck, who salute the German commander with a great smile.\n\nCasting\nJean Lefebvre : PFC Pithiviers\nPierre Mondy : Staff Sergent Paul Chaudard\nAldo Maccione: PFC Tassin\nRobert Lamoureux: Colonel Blanchet\nErik Colin: Lieutenant Duvauchel\nPierre Tornade: Captain Dumont\nAlain Doutey: Carlier\nRobert Dalban : The peasant\nJacques Marin: The collaborationist\nRobert Rollis: A French soldier\n\nProduction\nThe film's success spawned two sequels:– 1975 : On a retrouvé la septième compagnie (The Seventh Company Has Been Found) by Robert Lamoureux;\n– 1977 : La Septième Compagnie au clair de lune (The Seventh Company Outdoors)) by Robert Lamoureux.The story is set in Machecoul woods, but it was actually filmed near Cerny and La Ferté-Alais, as well as Jouars-Pontchartrain and Rochefort-en-Yvelines.

It is one of the most celebrated compositions in the popular genre of Rebetiko. It has been described as \"a sort of unofficial national anthem\".\n\nContent\n\"Cloudy Sunday\" is a love song with a strongly melancholy tone. The lyrics emphasize the protagonist's emotion while providing provides little or no factual detail. A. A. Fatouros notes that no name is provided for the female character and that it contains no obvious social or political context. However, he argues that \"[f]or those who have heard it, for those who have danced to its music or sang it, when happy, sad, drunk or nostalgic, the feeling it expresses has a life of its own, an existence independent of any precise cause\". Its first verses read, in Fatouros's translation:\n\nTsitsanis composed the song at Thessaloniki (Salonica) in German-occupied Northern Greece. At the time, he regularly performed to small audiences in a bar he owned as the German occupation authorities considered Rebetiko essentially degenerate and limited its outlets. It is thought to have been composed in 1943 or 1944 in the aftermath of the Great Famine (1941–42). Tsitsanis later wrote that \"I wrote the Synnefiasmeni Kyriaki ('Cloudy Sunday') based on the tragic incidents that happened then in our country: starvation, misery, fear, depression, arrests, executions. The lyrics I wrote were inspired by this climate. The melody came out of the 'cloudy' occupation, out of the frustration we all suffered - then, when everything was shadowed under terror and was crushed by slavery.\"Tsitsanis made several recordings of \"Cloudy Sunday\" from 1948. In spite of its limited audience during the occupation period itself, it is strongly associated with it in Greek popular culture.\nPassage 9:\nManousos Manousakis\nManousos Manousakis (Greek: Μανούσος Μανουσάκης), is a well-known Greek director, producer, writer and actor.

Other cast members include Lucie Mannheim, Raymond Lovell and Herbert Lom. It was based on Eric Ambler's 1938 novel Epitaph for a Spy. Unusually, it was both directed and produced by a trio: Lance Comfort, Mutz Greenbaum and Victor Hanbury. It was shot at Denham Studios with sets designed by the art director William C. Andrews. The film was produced and distributed by the British branch of RKO Pictures.\n\nPlot\nIn 1938, refugee Peter Vadassy decides to take a holiday at the Hotel Reserve to celebrate both his completion of medical school and his impending French citizenship. When he goes to pick up some photographs at the local pharmacy, he is taken away and questioned by Michel Beghin of French naval intelligence. When his negatives had been developed, some of them turned out to be of French military installations. It is discovered that while the camera is the same make as Peter's, the serial number is different. Peter is released on condition that he find out which other hotel guests have cameras like his.\nPeter does some snooping and eavesdrops on a suspicious conversation between Paul Heimberger and the hotel's proprietor, Madame Suzanne Koch. He searches Heimberger's room and finds several passports, all with different names and nationalities. Heimberger catches him in the act, but eventually matters are straightened out. Heimberger explains that he was originally a Social Democratic newspaper publisher who was anti-Nazi and been sent to a concentration camp for two years. After he was released, he joined an underground movement against the German regime.\nPeter spots his camera in the pocket of a dressing-gown belonging to Odette and Andre Roux, a couple on their honeymoon. Andre first tries to bribe Peter into giving him the negative and, when that fails, threatens him with a pistol. The police arrive at that moment and arrest Peter for espionage.\nThe Rouxs leave the hotel, but find Heimberger trying to disable the hotel's car. Andre shoots him dead and the couple speed off to Toulon, unaware that they are being tracked by the police. Beghin had known the identity of the spies all along and merely used Peter to further his true goal; to find out who the Rouxs are reporting to. The spy ring is captured. Andre gets away, but is caught on a roof by Peter. Andre slips and falls to his death.\n\nCast\nJames Mason as Peter Vadassy\nLucie Mannheim as Madame Suzanne Koch\nRaymond Lovell as Robert Duclos, a hotel guest given to exaggeration\nJulien Mitchell as Michel Beghin\nHerbert Lom as Andre Roux\nMartin Miller as Walter Vogel\nClare Hamilton as Mary Skelton, a hotel guest who is attracted to Peter.

A non-Jewish fugitive after he refused to pledge his allegiance to the Nazis, Poley was the first person hidden from the Nazis in the Ten Boom House, which is today a museum in Haarlem, Netherlands.  The film is adapted, in part, from Poley's book, Return to the Hiding Place (1993),  personal recollections, relayed to screenwriter Dr. Peter C. Spencer, and research from the Dutch National Archives. The film is neither a prequel nor is it a sequel to the 1975 film The Hiding Place, instead, it is a congruent accounting of the Dutch underground's resistance efforts from Poley's perspective.  It was directed by Peter C. Spencer and starred John Rhys-Davies, Mimi Sagadin and Craig Robert Young.\n\nBackground\nOn May 15, 1940, German occupation of the Netherlands begins with the nation's surrender, food and materials are rationed and evening curfews are imposed, gradually tightening from 10:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. Persecution of the Jewish population also is gradually implemented, starting with the requirement of wearing a yellow star bearing the word \"Jew\" and attacks against Jewish businesses and places of worship and culminating in the mass transport of Jewish citizens to unknown locations. Conspiracy theories begin to emerge on the fate of those being transported to the concentration camps.Corrie ten Boom (15 April 1892 – 15 April 1983) and her family are actively involved in the Dutch underground, invite the persecuted to live in their home and create a hidden room to conceal them during searches. Hans Poley, a young Christian, is the first guest and benefactor of the ten Boom family's extraordinary hospitality in May 1943.Poley's persecution begins with his refusal to sign the Nazi Manifesto, which reads in part:\n\n23. We demand legal opposition to known lies and their promulgation through the press. In order to enable the provision of a German press, we demand, that:a. All writers and employees of the newspapers appearing in the German language be members of the race;\nb. Non-German newspapers be required to have the express permission of the State to be published. They may not be printed in the German language;\nc. Non-Germans are forbidden by law any financial interest in German publications, or any influence on them, and as punishment for violations the closing of such a publication as well as the immediate expulsion from the Reich of the non-German concerned. Publications that are counter to the general good are to be forbidden. We demand legal prosecution of artistic and literary forms which exert a destructive influence on our national life, and the closure of organizations opposing the above-made demands.24. We demand freedom of religion for all religious denominations within the state so long as they do not endanger its existence or oppose the moral senses of the Germanic race. The Party as such advocates the standpoint of a positive Christianity without binding itself confessionally to any one denomination. It combats the Jewish-materialistic spirit within and around us, and is convinced that a lasting recovery of our nation can only succeed from within the framework: The good of the state before the good of the individual.25. For the execution of all of this we demand the formation of a strong central power in the Reich. Unlimited authority of the central parliament over the whole Reich and its organizations in general. The forming of state and profession chambers for the execution of the laws made by the Reich within the various states of the confederation. The leaders of the Party promise, if necessary by sacrificing their own lives, to support the execution of the points set forth above without consideration.\n\nCast\nCast overview, first billed only:\n\nFilming locations\nHaarlem, North Holland, Netherlands\nHolland, Michigan, USA\nManistee, Michigan, USA\n\nAwards\nSee also\nReturn to the Hiding Place, by Hans Poley, Lifejourney Books (1993) ISBN 0781409322\nThe Hiding Place, a 1971 autobiography by Corrie ten Boom\nThe Hiding Place, a 1975 film based on the book by Corrie ten Boom\nPassage 8:\nReserve\nReserve or reserves may refer to:\n\nPlaces\nReserve, Kansas, a US city\nReserve, Louisiana,  a census-designated place in St. John the Baptist Parish\nReserve, Montana, a census-designated place in Sheridan County\nReserve, New Mexico, a US village\nReserve, Wisconsin, a census-designated place in the town of Couderay\nReserve Mines, a community in Cape Breton Regional Municipality, Nova Scotia, Canada\n\nAuctions\nAuction reserve, a minimum amount of money bid required for a sale, e.g., in an English auction\nNo-reserve auction (NR), also known as an absolute auction, an auction in which the item for sale will be sold regardless of price\n\nEconomics and finance\nReserve (accounting), any part of shareholders' equity, except for basic share capital\nActuarial reserves, a liability equal to the present value of the future expected cash flows of a contingent event\nBank reserves, holdings of deposits in central banks plus currency that is physically held in bank vaults\nForeign-exchange reserves, the foreign currency deposits held by central banks and monetary authorities\nReserve currency, a currency which is held in significant quantities as part of foreign exchange reserves\nMineral reserve, natural resources that are economically recoverable\nOfficial gold reserves, gold held by central banks as a store of value\nReserve study, a long-term capital budget planning tool\n\nLand management\nGame reserve, land set aside for maintenance of wildlife, for tourism or hunting\nIndian reserve, a tract of land reserved for the use and benefit of a band\nIndian colony, the concept in the United States\nIndian reservation, equivalent concept in the United States\nIndian reserve, equivalent concept in Canada\nUrban Indian reserve, equivalent concept in Canada\nNature reserve, a protected area of importance for wildlife, flora, fauna or features of geological or other special interest\nOpen space reserve, an area of protected or conserved land or water on which development is indefinitely set aside\n\nMilitary\nMilitary reserve, military units not initially committed to battle\nMilitary reserve force, a military organization composed of citizens who combine a military role with a civilian career\nReserve fleet, a collection of partially or fully decommissioned naval vessels not currently needed.\n\nSports\nReserve (sport), a player not in the starting lineup\nInjured reserve list, a list of injured players temporarily unable to play\nReserve clause, part of a player contract in North American professional sports\nReserve team, the second team fielded by a sports club\n\nOther uses\nAboriginal reserve, historical government-run settlement in Australia\nCourse reserve, library materials reserved for particular users\nDynamic reserve, the set of metabolites that an organism can use for metabolic purposes\nFuel reserve, an extra fuel tank, or extra fuel in the main fuel tank\nInjury Reserve, an Arizona hip hop trio formed in 2013\nReserve Police Officers, auxiliary police officers\nReserve power, a power that may be exercised by the head of state without the approval of another branch of the government\nReserve wine, a wine that is specially designated\nReserved, a Polish clothing store chain\nStockpile, a reserve of bulk materials for future use\n\nSee also\nHold\nLayaway\nNative Reserve (disambiguation)\nPreserve (disambiguation)\nReserva (disambiguation)\nReservation (disambiguation)\nReservoir (disambiguation)\nWestern Reserve (disambiguation)\nAll pages with titles beginning with Reserve \nAll pages with titles containing Reserve\nPassage 9:\nSituation Hopeless... But Not Serious\nSituation Hopeless... But Not Serious is a 1965 oddball comedy film shot in black and white directed by Gottfried Reinhardt and starring Alec Guinness, Mike Connors and Robert Redford. It is based on the 1960 novel The Hiding Place by Robert Shaw.\nThe title is a derived from Viennese Alfred Polgar's quip, \"The situation is desperate but not serious.\"\n\nPlot\nOn 27 November 1944, during World War II, two American fliers, Captain Hank Wilson and Sergeant Lucky Finder, have to bail out over Germany. They land in the small town of Altheim, where Wilhelm Frick reads his horoscope and it says an exciting change will happen that day.\nIn town, the fliers hide in Frick's cellar. He initially locks them in and is going to inform the authorities when one claims German descent and he softens. They sing German songs together. Frick decides to hide them from the authorities. He leaves them locked there and goes to his job as the pharmacist's assistant at Drogerie Neusel. His boss listens to the radio regarding the Allied advance: the Germans have lost Aachen ... the end of the war is close. American troops march through Altheim outside Frick's work.\nThe two Americans (Finder and Wilson) share the cellar with Frick's cats. They get hobbies: one sketching cartoons while the other does metalwork, which enables him to make a lockpick and they unlock themselves just as Frick returns. Finder has Frick's gun and turns it on him. They debate what will happen if they leave. He convinces them to stay. To ensure they stay, he puts them in shackles while they sleep. He tells them they must stay until the end of the war. He gives them the key to unlock themselves.\nHe brings them a very pretty little Christmas tree. The story then jumps to VE Day (May 1945) with Frick listening to the radio announcement regarding the end of the war.\nThe two have to reshackle themselves when Frick brings them food. On VE Day, he brings a large bottle of 10 year old Swiss kirsch and is about to tell them the news. By the third tumbler of kirsch, Frick is spilling as he pours and all are singing. Frick offers to give them cushions, books... and sunshine.\nFrick's boss is arrested as a Nazi sympathiser. Finder grows a long beard. Outside, this part of Germany comes under American occupation. Frick tries to barter for extra supplies from the local American quartermaster.\nIn his struggle to keep them entertained, Frick lets slip some Americanisms and Finder queries how he knows them. Frick gives them a false history of the war and simply says that the Americans have captured Strasbourg. He gives them an orange stamped with the word California and they become suspicious. Struggling to explain, he distracts them by saying Paris is totally destroyed.\nFinder demands a woman and Frick starts to search. He peers in the window of the Daffodil Club and gets invited inside. Inside, he meets Lissie, a madam, who offers him a choice of girls at the bar. He prefers to use her and starts to explain things to her. His conversation in her back office worries her so much that she presses her silent alarm and he gets thrown out.\nFrick seems to go a bit crazy and is put in a hospital, but security is lax and he steals a bike and goes home. His house is dilapidated... it is unclear how long he has been gone. He unlocks the men. Two police appear outside (for the stolen bike). They ask if Switzerland is still neutral.\nFinder steals Frick's luger pistol and runs off into the night. The police pursue him presuming he is a robber. In daylight, the two men end in an old ruined castle above a river. The police still pursue them. Frick appears and stops a shooting.\nNext, the two Americans are hiding in large pipes. They find a scrap of newspaper discussing President Truman and the Iron curtain.\nThe authorities investigate Frick's house and conclude he has had two people imprisoned.\nThe two men try to steal a small boat and are spotted by Wanda, the daughter of the owner. She presumes they have escaped from the American stockade. She invites them in for a \"crazy time\". They pay $750 to be taken over the Rhine and offer $1000 for a telephone. A boat of SS troops appears - but they are making a movie. They start to realise things are not as they think.

W. Botha, declared his maternity ward extraterritorial land, to ensure that Leka was born on Albanian soil. Leka is the only child of Leka, Crown Prince of Albania and his wife Susan, Crown Princess of Albania. He is the only grandchild of King Zog I of the Albanians, succeeding as head of the royal house upon the death of his father in 2011. He has worked as an official at the country's interior and foreign ministries. He also served as a political advisor to the Albanian President from 2012 to 2013.In May 2010, Leka became engaged to Elia Zaharia, an Albanian actress and singer. They married on 8 October 2016 in Tirana.\n\nEarly life\nLeka is the son of the pretender to the defunct throne of Albania, Crown Prince Leka, and his Australian wife Crown Princess Susan.\nHe was named in honour of Egyptian president Anwar El Sadat, his grandfather King Zog I, Emperor Mohammed Reza of Iran, and Baudouin I, King of the Belgians. Msiziwe is a Zulu term meaning 'the one who was assisted'. Leka is a member of the House of Zogu.\n\nEducation and activities\nLeka's was educated in South Africa at St Peter's College, Johannesburg, and in the United Kingdom at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, where he was named Best Foreign Student of the Academy, being congratulated by the Albanian Minister of Defence. He was also educated at the Skanderbeg Military Academy in Albania, at the Università per Stranieri in Perugia, where he studied the Italian language, and in Kosovo, where he studied international relations.Leka resides in Tirana. He speaks Albanian, English, some Zulu, and Italian. He owns boxer dogs, and his interests include martial arts, volleyball, and swimming. He is fond of wildlife and has taken part in mountain climbing, abseiling, and target shooting.On 5 April 2004, Leka accepted the Mother Teresa Medal on behalf of his late grandmother, Queen Géraldine, for her humanitarian efforts.Leka is known to have worked with youth organizations, like MJAFT!, and supported a wide range of humanitarian efforts in Albania, but he maintains that he only supports self-help projects to stimulate Albanian and Kosovar economic growth, Gazeta Sot.Leka is known as a supporter of Kosovar independence from Serbia and has close ties to the Kosovar leadership in Pristina.Leka founded the youth leadership of the Movement for National Development, which was a movement created by his father in 2005 to change the political face of Albania.On 24 June 2010, Prince Leka unveiled a blue plaque at Parmoor House in Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom, which was the home of King Zog during his wartime exile.\n\nPublic service\nOn 21 August 2007, Foreign Minister Lulzim Basha announced that Leka had been appointed to his office. The prince intended to pursue a career in diplomacy. After three years he had been transferred to the office of the Minister of Interior. After the election of Bujar Nishani as president in 2012, Leka was appointed as political adviser to the President.Leka was considered as a candidate in the 2022 Albanian presidential election, though the position ultimately went to Bajram Begaj.\n\nPersonal life\nLeka met Elia Zaharia in Paris, and in May 2010 they were engaged. Since then she has accompanied him on most of his visits and meetings with members of royal families. She is also head of the Queen Geraldine Foundation, which is a humanitarian, charitable and non-profit organisation, created by the Royal Court. The foundation aims to be close to the Albanian families who need help and to children who need care. It has reconstructed numerous schools and kindergartens in northern Albania, especially in the Mat District, from where the Zogu Family comes.\nOn 27 March 2016 it was announced by Skënder Zogu (born 1933), a member of the Zogu family, that the couple would be married on 8 October 2016 in the Royal Palace in Tirana.\n\nWedding\nLeka was married on Saturday 8 October 2016 in Tirana. The ceremony was a semi-official ceremony, held in Tirana in the Royal Palace, with many guests including members of other noble and royal families. The event was a civil wedding officiated by the Mayor of Tirana, Erion Veliaj. A blessing was given by the five religious leaders of Albania representing the faiths of Sunni Islam, Bektashi, and the Christian traditions of Orthodox, Catholic and Protestant. This tradition of the Albanian royal family is part of the tradition of religious tolerance in Albania.Wedding guests included friends and relatives from around the world including relatives of his mother from Australia. Guests also included members of other royal families from neighbouring countries and further afield. These included Queen Sofía of Spain and Prince and Princess Michael of Kent. Prince Michael of Kent is a first cousin of Queen Elizabeth II and his wife Princess Michael of Kent is related to Prince Leka through her mother, Countess Marianne Szapáry, who was a 5th cousin of Queen Géraldine and had been a bridesmaid at her wedding to King Zog in 1938. Other royal guests included Empress Farah of Iran, Crown Prince Alexander and Crown Princess Katherine of Yugoslavia, Crown Princess Margareta of Romania, Custodian of the Crown and Prince Radu of Romania, Nicholas, Prince of Montenegro, Prince Guillaume of Luxembourg together with Princess Sibilla, Georg Friedrich, Prince of Prussia, Princess Léa of Belgium and other members from the royal families of Russia, Liechtenstein, Romania, Greece, Georgia, Morocco and members of other noble families.

Their daughter was named Geraldine in her honour. On 28 January 2023, on the day of her baptism, her full name is Geraldine Sibilla Francesca Susan Marie.\n\nHonours and awards\nHonours\nNational dynastic honours\nHouse of Zogu: Sovereign Knight with Collar of the Royal Order of Albania\n House of Zogu: Sovereign Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Fidelity\n House of Zogu: Sovereign Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Skanderbeg\n Albanian Royal Family: Sovereign of the Military Order and Medal of Bravery\n\nForeign honours\nItalian Royal Family: Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus\n Two Sicilian Royal Family: Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Order of Francis I\n Russian Imperial Family: Knight Grand Cross of the Imperial Order of Saint Andrew\n Royal House of Ghassan: Knight Grand Collar of the Equestrian Order of Michael Archangel\n Sovereign Military Order of Malta : Grand Cross pro Merito Melitensi – civilian special class –\n\nAwards\nAlbania – Honored Citizen of the City of Burrel (2012)\n Albania – Honored Citizen of the Commune of Bërdicë (2012)\n USA – Key to City of New Orleans (2011)\n USA – Honorary Mayor of the City of Baton Rouge\n\nSee also\nHeads of former ruling families\nPassage 9:\nSusan of Albania\nSusan, Crown Princess of Albania (née Susan Barbara Cullen-Ward, formerly Williams; 28 January 1941 – 17 July 2004) was the Australian-born wife of Leka, Crown Prince of Albania.\nHer husband, known as King Leka, had been proclaimed King of the Albanians by the anti-communist Albanian government-in-exile in 1961, upon the death of his father King Zog. Meanwhile, Albania itself was a communist republic.\n\nEarly life\nSusan Cullen-Ward was born in the Sydney suburb of Waverley. Her mother was Phyllis Dorothea Murray-Prior and her father was Alan Robert Cullen-Ward, a pastoralist. Susan Cullen-Ward was a great-granddaughter of the Queensland politician Thomas Lodge Murray-Prior (1819–1892).\nCullen-Ward grew up on her father's sheep station. She attended Presbyterian Ladies' College at Orange, then studied at Sydney Technical College before teaching art at a private studio.She was married to Richard Williams from 1965 to 1970. Susan Cullen-Ward was an Anglican.\n\nMarriage to the Crown Prince of Albania\nSusan Cullen-Ward met Leka, Crown Prince of Albania, the only child of King Zog I of the Albanians, at a dinner party in Sydney. In October 1975, they married in a civil ceremony in Biarritz, France. The couple were later married in a religious ceremony in Madrid.\nAustralian authorities refused to recognise her as a queen but, in a compromise when Andrew Peacock was foreign minister, issued a passport in the name of \"Susan Cullen-Ward, known as Queen Susan\".She lived a turbulent life after marrying Leka, as they moved from one country to another, having no permanent residence or fixed point of reference. In the first few years of their marriage, the couple lived in Spain. They later settled in Rhodesia (now known as Zimbabwe). After a falling out with the government of Robert Mugabe, the couple moved again, this time to South Africa where their son, Leka, was born in 1982. She also had a stillborn daughter while resident in Rhodesia.\n\nDeath\nThe Crown Princess of Albania died of lung cancer on 17 July 2004 in Tirana, Albania. After her death, she lay in state in a chapel outside Tirana. She is buried next to her mother-in-law, Queen Geraldine, her husband, Crown Prince Leka, and his father, whose body was reburied in 2012.\n\nSources\n\"Queen Susan of the Albanians (obituary)\".

He played college football at St. Louis University.\nPassage 2:\nCarlo I Cybo-Malaspina\nCarlo I Cybo-Malaspina (18 November 1581 - 13 February 1662) was an Italian nobleman, who was prince of Massa and marquis of Carrara from 1623 until his death.\nBorn in Ferrara, he was the son of Alderano Cybo-Malaspina and Marfisa d'Este. He was also Duke of Ferentillo and held other patrician positions in several of the numerous Italian states of the time. In 1605, he married the Genoese noblewoman Brigida Spinola, from whom he had numerous children.\nThe eldest of them, Alberico, succeeded him after his death in 1662.\nPassage 3:\nAbd al-Muttalib\nShayba ibn Hāshim (Arabic: شَيْبَة إبْن هَاشِم; c. 497–578), better known as ʿAbd al-Muṭṭalib, (Arabic: عَبْد ٱلْمُطَّلِب, lit. 'Servant of Muttalib') was the fourth chief of the Quraysh tribal confederation. He was the grandfather of the Islamic prophet Muhammad.\n\nEarly life\nHis father was Hashim ibn 'Abd Manaf,: 81  the progenitor of the distinguished Banu Hashim, a clan of the Quraysh tribe of Mecca. They claimed descent from Ismā'īl and Ibrāhīm. His mother was Salma bint Amr, from the Banu Najjar, a clan of the Khazraj tribe in Yathrib (later called Madinah). Hashim died while doing business in Gaza, before Abd al-Muttalib was born.: 81 His real name was \"Shaiba\" meaning 'the ancient one' or 'white-haired' because of the streak of white through his jet-black hair, and is sometimes also called Shaybah al-Ḥamd (\"The white streak of praise\").: 81–82  After his father's death he was raised in Yathrib with his mother and her family until about the age of eight, when his uncle Muttalib ibn Abd Manaf went to see him and asked his mother Salmah to entrust Shaybah to his care. Salmah was unwilling to let her son go and Shaiba refused to leave his mother without her consent. Muṭṭalib then pointed out that the possibilities Yathrib had to offer were incomparable to Mecca. Salmah was impressed with his arguments, so she agreed to let him go. Upon first arriving in Mecca, the people assumed the unknown child was Muttalib's servant and started calling him 'Abd al-Muttalib (\"servant of Muttalib\").: 85–86\n\nChieftain of Hashim clan\nWhen Muṭṭalib died, Shaiba succeeded him as the chief of the Hāshim clan. Following his uncle Al-Muṭṭalib, he took over the duties of providing the pilgrims with food and water, and carried on the practices of his forefathers with his people. He attained such eminence as none of his forefathers enjoyed; his people loved him and his reputation was great among them.: 61 \n'Umar ibn Al-Khaṭṭāb's grandfather Nufayl ibn Abdul Uzza arbitrated in a dispute between 'Abdul-Muṭṭalib and Ḥarb ibn Umayyah, Abu Sufyan's father, over the custodianship of the Kaaba. Nufayl gave his verdict in favour of 'Abdul-Muṭṭalib. Addressing Ḥarb ibn Umayyah, he said:\nWhy do you pick a quarrel with a person who is taller than you in stature; more imposing than you in appearance; more refined than you in intellect; whose progeny outnumbers yours and whose generosity outshines yours in lustre? Do not, however, construe this into any disparagement of your good qualities which I highly appreciate. You are as gentle as a lamb, you are renowned throughout Arabia for the stentorian tones of your voice, and you are an asset to your tribe.\n\nDiscovery of Zam Zam Well\n'Abdul-Muṭṭalib said that while sleeping in the sacred enclosure, he had dreamed he was ordered to dig at the worship place of the Quraysh between the two deities Isāf and Nā'ila. There he would find the Zamzam Well, which the Jurhum tribe had filled in when they left Mecca. The Quraysh tried to stop him digging in that spot, but his son Al-Ḥārith stood guard until they gave up their protests. After three days of digging, 'Abdul-Muṭṭalib found traces of an ancient religious well and exclaimed, \"Allahuakbar!\" Some of the Quraysh disputed his claim to sole rights over water, then one of them suggested that they go to a female shaman who lived afar. It was said that she could summon jinns and that she could help them decide who was the owner of the well. So, 11 people from the 11 tribes went on the expedition. They had to cross the desert to meet the priestess but then they got lost. There was a lack of food and water and people started to lose hope of ever getting out. One of them suggested that they dig their own graves and if they died, the last person standing would bury the others. So all began digging their own graves and just as Abdul-Muṭṭalib started digging, water spewed out from the hole he dug and everyone became overjoyed. It was then and there decided that Abdul-Muttalib was the owner of the Zam Zam well. Thereafter he supplied pilgrims to the Kaaba with Zam Zam water, which soon eclipsed all the other wells in Mecca because it was considered sacred.: 86–89 : 62–65\n\nThe Year of the Elephant\nAccording to Muslim tradition, the Ethiopian governor of Yemen, Abrahah al-Ashram, envied the Kaaba's reverence among the Arabs and, being a Christian, he built a cathedral on Sana'a and ordered pilgrimage be made there.: 21  The order was ignored and someone desecrated (some saying in the form of defecation: 696 note 35 ) the cathedral. Abrahah decided to avenge this act by demolishing the Kaaba and he advanced with an army towards Mecca.: 22–23 There were thirteen elephants in Abrahah's army: 99 : 26  and the year came to be known as 'Ām al-Fīl (the Year of the Elephant), beginning a trend for reckoning the years in Arabia which was used until 'Umar ibn Al-Khaṭṭāb replaced it with the Islamic Calendar in 638 CE (17 AH), with the first year of the Islamic Calendar being 622 CE.\nWhen news of the advance of Abrahah's army came, the Arab tribes of Quraysh, Kinānah, Khuzā'ah and Hudhayl united in defence of the Kaaba. A man from the Ḥimyar tribe was sent by Abrahah to advise them that he only wished to demolish the Kaaba and if they resisted, they would be crushed. \"Abdul-Muṭṭalib told the Meccans to seek refuge in the nearest high hills while he, with some leading members of Quraysh, remained within the precincts of the Kaaba. Abrahah sent a dispatch inviting 'Abdul-Muṭṭalib to meet him and discuss matters. When 'Abdul-Muṭṭalib left the meeting he was heard saying, \"The Owner of this House is its Defender, and I am sure He will save it from the attack of the adversaries and will not dishonour the servants of His House.\": 24–26 It is recorded that when Abrahah's forces neared the Kaaba, Allah commanded small birds (abābīl) to destroy Abrahah's army, raining down pebbles on it from their beaks. Abrahah was seriously wounded and retreated towards Yemen but died on the way.: 26–27  This event is referred to in the following Qur'anic chapter:\n\nHave you not seen how your Lord dealt with the owners of the Elephant?\nDid He not make their treacherous plan go astray?\n\nAnd He sent against them birds in flocks, striking them with stones of baked clay, so He rendered them like straw eaten up.\nMost Islamic sources place the event around the year that Muhammad was born, 570 CE, though other scholars place it one or two decades earlier. A tradition attributed to Ibn Shihab al-Zuhri in the musannaf of ʽAbd al-Razzaq al-Sanʽani places it before the birth of Muhammad's father.\n\nSacrificing his son Abdullah\nAl-Harith was 'Abdul-Muṭṭalib's only son at the time he dug the Zamzam Well.: 64  When the Quraysh tried to help him in the digging, he vowed that if he were to have ten sons to protect him, he would sacrifice one of them to Allah at the Kaaba. Later, after nine more sons had been born to him, he told them he must keep the vow. The divination arrows fell upon his favourite son Abdullah. The Quraysh protested 'Abdul-Muṭṭalib's intention to sacrifice his son and demanded that he sacrifice something else instead. 'Abdul-Muṭṭalib agreed to consult a \"sorceress with a familiar spirit\". She told him to cast lots between Abdullah and ten camels. If Abdullah were chosen, he had to add ten more camels, and keep on doing the same until his Lord accepted the camels in Abdullah's place. When the number of camels reached 100, the lot fell on the camels. 'Abdul-Muṭṭalib confirmed this by repeating the test three times. Then the camels were sacrificed, and Abdullah was spared.: 66–68\n\nFamily\nWives\nAbd al-Muttalib had six known wives.\n\nSumra bint Jundab of the Hawazin tribe.\nLubnā bint Hājar of the Khuza'a tribe.\nFatima bint Amr of the Makhzum clan of the Quraysh tribe.\nHalah bint Wuhayb of the Zuhrah clan of the Quraysh tribe.\nNatīla bint Janab of the Namir tribe.\nMumanna'a bint Amr of the Khuza'a tribe.\n\nChildren\nAccording to Ibn Hisham, ʿAbd al-Muṭṭalib had ten sons and six daughters.: 707–708 note 97  However, Ibn Sa'd lists twelve sons.: 99–101 By Sumra bint Jundab:\n\nAl-Ḥārith.: 708  He was the firstborn and he died before his father.: 99 \nQuthum.: 100  He is not listed by Ibn Hisham.By Fatima bint Amr:\n\nAl-Zubayr.: 707  He was a poet and a chief; his father made a will in his favour.: 99  He died before Islam, leaving two sons and daughters.: 101 : 34–35 \nAbu Talib, born as Abd Manaf,: 99 : 707  father of the future Caliph Ali.

One day Muhammad's mother, Amina, wanted to go to Yathrib, where her husband, Abdullah, died. So, Muhammad, Amina, Abd al-Muttalib and their caretaker, Umm Ayman started their journey to Medina, which is around 500 kilometres away from Makkah. They stayed there for three weeks, then, started their journey back to Mecca. But, when they reached halfway, at Al-Abwa', Amina became very sick and died six years after her husband's death. She was buried over there. From then, Muhammad became an orphan. Abd al-Muttalib became very sad for Muhammad because he loved him so much. Abd al-Muttalib took care of Muhammad. But when Muhammad was eight years old, the very old Abd al-Muttalib became very sick and died at age 81-82 in 578-579 CE.\nShaybah ibn Hāshim's grave can be found in the Jannat al-Mu'allā cemetery in Makkah, Saudi Arabia.\n\nSee also\nFamily tree of Muhammad\nFamily tree of Shaiba ibn Hashim\nSahaba\nPassage 4:\nJohn Westley\nRev. John Wesley (1636–78) was an English nonconformist minister. He was the grandfather of John Wesley (founder of Methodism).\n\nLife\nJohn Wesly (his own spelling), Westley, or Wesley was probably born at Bridport, Dorset, although some authorities claim he was born in Devon, the son of the Rev. Bartholomew Westley and Ann Colley, daughter of Sir Henry Colley of Carbery Castle in County Kildare, Ireland. He was educated at Dorchester Grammar School and as a student of New Inn Hall, Oxford, where he matriculated on 23 April 1651, and graduated B.A. on 23 January 1655, and M.A. on 4 July 1657. After his appointment as an evangelist, he preached at Melcombe Regis, Radipole, and other areas in Dorset. Never episcopally ordained, he was approved by Oliver Cromwell's Commission of Triers in 1658 and appointed Vicar of Winterborne Whitechurch.The report of his interview in 1661 with Gilbert Ironside the elder, his diocesan, according to Alexander Gordon writing in the Dictionary of National Biography, shows him to have been an Independent. He was imprisoned for not using the Book of Common Prayer, imprisoned again and ejected in 1662. After the Conventicle Act 1664 he continued to preach in small gatherings at Preston and then Poole, until his death at Preston in 1678.\n\nFamily\nHe married a daughter of John White, who was related also to Thomas Fuller. White, the \"Patriarch of Dorchester\", married a sister of Cornelius Burges. Westley's eldest son was Timothy (born 1659). Their second son was Rev. Samuel Wesley, a High Church Anglican vicar and the father of John and Charles Wesley. A younger son, Matthew Wesley, remained a nonconformist, became a London apothecary, and died on 10 June 1737, leaving a son, Matthew, in India; he provided for some of his brother Samuel's daughters.\n\nNotes\nAdditional sources\nMatthews, A.

Morgan falls in love with his mistress, much to the dismay of her father, who punishes him by sentencing him to a life of hard labor aboard a Spanish galleon. \nMorgan leads his fellow slaves in mutiny, takes command of the ship, and becomes a pirate, without knowing that Doña Inez was on board, on her way to Spain. She becomes his prisoner, but spurns him when he declares his love in Tortuga. Not long after, Morgan's daring exploits on the Spanish Main pique the interest of King Charles II of England, and Morgan agrees to attack only Spanish vessels in return for English ships and men. \nFearing for the security of Doña Inez, after the pirates discover her identity, he permits her to return to Panama. Once there, she warns Don José of Morgan's planned invasion, and the pirate ships are either easily sunk or routed by the alerted Spanish.

The striking cinematography, filmed in garish Eastmancolor, is by the award-winning Tonino Delli Colli who has lensed such art house classics as Pasolini's The Gospel According to St. Matthew (1964), Marco Bellocchio's China Is Near (1967), and Sergio Leone's Once Upon a Time in the West (1968). And the amusing, Ravel-inspired score by Franco Mannino strikes the perfect mock-epic tone. Among the more memorable set pieces are an exotic voodoo dance performed by Cuban sex bomb Chelo Alonso (a former dancer at the Folies Bergère in Paris), a battle at sea in which Morgan's men, disguised as women, storm a Spanish galleon in full drag, and the bloody, climactic sacking of Panama with shootings, stabbings and explosions galore.\"\nPassage 5:\nPrem Mhanje Prem Mhanje Prem Asta\nPrem Mhanje Prem Mhanje Prem Asta (Marathi: प्रेम म्हणजे प्रेम म्हणजे प्रेम असतं) is a Marathi drama film released on 19 April 2013.

On his forays he hijacks ships and kidnaps the women captured on the ships in order to later sell them as slaves to Turkish human traffickers in North Africa. The rogue pirate only becomes weak when it comes to one woman: the glow-eyed princess Miriam, ruler of a desert tribe of Arabs. One day, Drakut makes a crucial mistake when he raids the \"San Luca\" and kidnaps Bianca, who is traveling with him. She is the daughter of the governor of Rhodes, which currently belongs to the Republic of Venice. There were also several secret papers from the Doge of Venice on board. The governor is in dire need, as he has to assume that his Bianca could also be bartered away to some lecherous Arab despot. But he is lucky in his misfortune, because a certain Roberto Diego, a notorious adventurer and son of the once feared \"Red Corsair\", offers his father his help.  \nDiego has just been sentenced to incarceration because of high debts, but is willing to risk his life to save the beautiful little daughter and the secret documents for the good of Bianca and the Doge of Venice if his sentence is released. However, the governor has no idea that Roberto has very personal motives for bringing himself up as a rescuer and liberator. Because Roberto still has a score to settle with Drakut: He was once responsible for the death of Roberto's father. The governor agrees to this bargain, and Diego joins Drakut's crew on board. In the Catalan painter Francesco he found his only ally. As a newcomer on board, Roberto has to be very careful because people are very suspicious of him. When he tries to flirt with Bianca, Drakut's right hand man, the brutal Gamal, notices and flogs the Red Corsair's son. Soon, the general emotional chaos puts the whole rescue operation in danger, because Roberto falls in love with Drakut's hostage Bianca, while Miriam, the pirate captain's lover, falls in love with Roberto.     \nArriving on North Africa's shores, Drakut travels on to an oasis. Miriam is the sole ruler here so far. Drakut, who once owed her his life, also has other reasons for being on good terms with Miriam, since he hopes to rule over her desert kingdom one day. In order to get rid of the annoying competitor for the favor of the exotic beauty, Drakut uses an opportunity to let Roberto die of thirst on the way to the oasis. But he is brave and tough enough to fight his way through to the saving goal. Diego begins to play a double game: on the one hand he loves the kidnapped Bianca, but he also keeps Miriam warm because he needs her help for his plan to finally put an end to Drakut.  In fact, Roberto's battle plan succeeds: he can save the kidnapped girls from the hands of greedy Turkish slave traders, wins Bianca's heart en passant and achieves that Drakut sinks in the sea with his pirate ship, which is set on fire, together with Miriam, who was killed in battle.\n\nCast\nLex Barker as The Dragon Drakut\nChelo Alonso as Princess Miriam\nMassimo Serato as Roberto Diego\nGraziella Granata as  Bianca\nLuigi Tosi  as Francisco\nBruno Corelli as  Selim\nMichele Malaspina as Gouvernor of Rhodes\nAnna Arena as  Zaira\nEnzo Maggio as  Candela\nDaniele Vargas as  Gamal\nFranco Fantasia as  Captain Volan\nIgnazio Balsamo\nUbaldo Lay\nGianni Rizzo\nUgo Sasso\nErminio Spalla\nAmedeo Trilli\nPassage 9:\nThe Wonderful World of Captain Kuhio\nThe Wonderful World of Captain Kuhio (クヒオ大佐, Kuhio Taisa, lit. \"Captain Kuhio\") is a 2009 Japanese comedy-crime film, directed by Daihachi Yoshida, based on Kazumasa Yoshida's 2006 biographical novel, Kekkon Sagishi Kuhio Taisa (lit. \"Marriage swindler Captain Kuhio\"), that focuses on a real-life marriage swindler, who conned over 100 million yen (US$1.2 million) from a number of women between the 1970s and the 1990s.The film was released in Japan on 10 October 2009.\n\nCast\nMasato Sakai - Captain Kuhio\nYasuko Matsuyuki - Shinobu Nagano\nHikari Mitsushima - Haru Yasuoka\nYuko Nakamura - Michiko Sudo\nHirofumi Arai - Tatsuya Nagano\nKazuya Kojima - Koichi Takahashi\nSakura Ando - Rika Kinoshita\nMasaaki Uchino - Chief Fujiwara\nKanji Furutachi - Shigeru Kuroda\nReila Aphrodite\nSei Ando\n\nAwards\nAt the 31st Yokohama Film Festival\nBest Actor – Masato Sakai\nBest Supporting Actress – Sakura Ando\nPassage 10:\nTPB AFK\nTPB AFK: The Pirate Bay Away From Keyboard is a 2013 Swedish documentary film directed and produced by Simon Klose.

Filming began sometime in 2008, and concluded on 28 February 2012.\n\nProduction\nThe film's website was launched on 28 August 2010, along with a Kickstarter campaign to raise US$25,000 to hire an editor after the Court of Appeal trial. The campaign was fully funded within three days and raised $51,424 in total.

Whilst he likes the technical side of the documentary, he has issues with some scenes and general attitude of the documentary; this includes too much focus put on the trial, too dark depiction of it, and portraying himself beyond self-recognition. Despite having such different views on the subject, he regards the director as a friend.\n\nCensorship by Hollywood\nIn May 2013, Hollywood studios – such as Viacom, Paramount, Fox and Lionsgate – started to censor Google Search links pointing to the documentary, an action criticized by Simon Klose. In June, after the initial controversy, HBO and Lionsgate sent additional bogus DMCA takedown notices to Google requesting the removal of links related to TPB AFK. In response, Simon Klose contacted Chilling Effects, who recommended him to file a DMCA counter-notice once he had found out whether Google had taken down the links or not. Two months later, the censored links were reinstated only after public complaints made by Klose.\n\nSee also\nGood Copy Bad Copy\nPiracy is theft\nMay 2006 police raid of The Pirate Bay\nRiP!: A Remix Manifesto\nSteal This Film", "answers": ["The Pirate'S Dream"], "length": 2804, "dataset": "2wikimqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "07263575ae94e0561ab9d85e1227eadf18812836bc4f1dd8"}

In the same year, Aquila obtained the praetorian insignia. He also erected a monument honouring the emperor Claudius in Asia Minor (modern Turkey) known as the Kuşkayası Monument.\nPassage 2:\nMaximus of Tyre\nMaximus of Tyre (Greek: Μάξιμος Τύριος; fl. late 2nd century AD), also known as Cassius Maximus Tyrius, was a Greek rhetorician and philosopher who lived in the time of the Antonines and Commodus, and who belongs to the trend of the Second Sophistic.  His writings contain many allusions to the history of Greece, while there is little reference to Rome; hence it is inferred that he lived longer in Greece, perhaps as a professor at Athens. Although nominally a Platonist, he is really a sophist rather than a philosopher, although he is still considered one of the precursors of Neoplatonism.\n\nWritings\nThe Dissertations\nThere exist 41 essays or discourses on theological, ethical, and other philosophical subjects, collected into a work called The Dissertations. The central theme is God as the supreme being, one and indivisible though called by many names, accessible to reason alone:\nIn such a mighty contest, sedition and discord, you will see one according law and assertion in all the earth, that there is one God, the king and father of all things, and many gods, sons of God, ruling together with him.\nAs animals form the intermediate stage between plants and human beings, so there exist intermediaries between God and man, viz. daemons, who dwell on the confines of heaven and earth. The soul in many ways bears a great resemblance to the divinity; it is partly mortal, partly immortal, and, when freed from the fetters of the body, becomes a daemon. Life is the sleep of the soul, from which it awakes at death. The style of Maximus is superior to that of the ordinary sophistical rhetorician, but scholars differ widely as to the merits of the essays themselves.Dissertation XX discusses \"Whether the Life of a Cynic is to Be Preferred\". He begins with a narrative of how Prometheus created mankind, who initially lived a life of ease \"for the earth supplied them with aliment, rich meadows, long-haired mountains, and abundance of fruits\" – in other words, a Garden of Eden that resonates with Cynic ideas. It was \"a life without war, without iron, without a guard, peaceful, healthful unindigent\".\nThen, taking perhaps from Lucretius, he contrasts that Garden to mankind's \"second life\", which started with the division of the earth into property, which they then enclosed into fortifications and walls, and started to wear jewellery and gold, built houses, “molested the earth by digging into it for metals”, and invaded the sea and the air (killing animals, fish and birds), in what he described as a “slaughter and all-various gore, pursuing gratification of the body”. Humans became unhappy and, to compensate, sought wealth, “fearing poverty...dreading death...neglecting the care of life...They blamed base actions but did not abstain from them and “the hated to live, but dreaded to die”.He then contrasts the two lives – that of the original Garden and of the “second life” he has just described and asks, which man would not choose the first, who “knows that by the change he shall be liberated from a multitude of evils” and what he calls “a dreadful prison of unhappy men, confined to a dreadful prison of unhappy men, confined in a dark recess, with large iron fetters round their feet, a great weight about their neck…passing their time in filth, in torment, and in weeping”. He asks, “Which of these images shall we proclaim blessed”? He goes on to praise Diogenes of Sinopeus, the Cynic, for choosing his ascetic life, but only because he avoided the often fearful fates of other philosophers – such as Socrates being condemned. But there is no mention of he himself taking up the ascetic life himself; rather he only talks about how the Garden would be preferable to the life mankind has made for itself. So it is unlikely he was a Cynic, but was just envious of that idealised pre-civilisation Life in the Garden.Maximus of Tyre must be distinguished from the Stoic Claudius Maximus, tutor of Marcus Aurelius.\n\nAncient Greek Text\nMaximus Tyrius, Philosophumena, Dialexeis - Edited by George Leonidas Koniaris, Publisher Walter de Gruyter, 1995, DOI: https://doi.org/10.1515/9783110882568 - this critical edition presents the Ancient Greek text of Maximus of Tyre.\n\nTranslations\nTaylor, Thomas, The Dissertations of Maximus Tyrius.

Unlike the others songwriters who wrote about the town improvements and mentioned changes to layout, street plans, new buildings etc., Charlton concentrated on the social changes brought about by the work, and sometimes not too kindly.\nThe same song without any comment, except the author's name, appears on page 159 of The Tyne Songster published by W & T Fordyce published in 1840 and on page 151 of A Collection of Songs, Comic, Satirical, and Descriptive published by Thomas Marshall published in 1829\nNothing more appears to be known of this person, or their life, or even their Christian name or sex.\n\nSee also\nGeordie dialect words\n(Geordie) Rhymes of Northern Bards by John Bell Junior\nJohn Bell (folk music)\nPassage 4:\nMubarak Khwaja\nMubarak Khwaja (Kazakh: Мүбәрәк Қожа, Persian: مبارک خواجه) was the khan of White Horde in 1320–1344.

He lived in Tamsui District, New Taipei City.\n\nBiography\nHe was born Chou Chi-shu in Xichuan County, Henan in 1921. In 1948, Chou joined the China Youth Corps and was forced to drop out of school. He was sent to Taiwan following the defeat of Chiang Kai-shek's army in the Chinese Civil War, leaving his wife, two sons, and daughter behind in Mainland China. He settled in Tamsui District, New Taipei City.\nChou started writing in the Central Daily News and publishing poetry in 1952. He retired from the army in 1955.\nIn 1959, he started selling books outside the Cafe Astoria in Taipei and published his first book of poetry entitled Lonely County. Chou's book stall became a gathering spot for well-known writers, such as Huang Chun-ming, Pai Hsien-yung, and Sanmao. Chou wrote often on the subjects of time, life, and death, and was influenced by Buddhism.In 1980, the American magazine Orientations praised him as the \"Amoy Street Prophet\".  During the same year, he was forced to close his book stall in front of Cafe Astoria due to gastric ulcer surgery. He was the first recipient of the National Culture and Arts Foundation Literature Laureate Award in 1997.Chou died of pneumonia in New Taipei City on May 1, 2014 at the age of 92. His funeral was held twelve days later, with writers and politicians including Chang Show-foong, Lung Ying-tai, Timothy Yang, and Hsiang Ming in attendance.A bilingual selection from Chou's poetry with English translations by Lloyd Haft, Zhou Mengdie: 41 Poems, was published by Azoth Books (Taiwan) in 2022.\nPassage 6:\nZhou Youguang\nZhou Youguang (Chinese: 周有光; pinyin: Zhōu Yǒuguāng; 13 January 1906 – 14 January 2017), also known as Chou Yu-kuang or Chou Yao-ping, was a Chinese economist, banker, linguist, sinologist, Esperantist, publisher, and supercentenarian, known as the \"father of Pinyin\", a system for the writing of Mandarin Chinese in Roman script, or romanization, which was officially adopted by the government of the People's Republic of China in 1958, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1982, and the United Nations in 1986.\n\nEarly life and career\nZhou was born Zhou Yaoping in Changzhou (Changchow), Jiangsu Province, on 13 January 1906 to a Qing Dynasty official. At the age of ten, he and his family moved to Suzhou, Jiangsu Province. In 1918, he entered Changzhou High School, during which time he first took an interest in linguistics. He graduated in 1923 with honors.Zhou enrolled that same year in St. John's University, Shanghai where he majored in economics and took supplementary coursework in linguistics. He was almost unable to attend due to his family's poverty, but friends and relatives raised 200 yuan for the admission fee, and also helped him pay for tuition. He left during the May Thirtieth Movement of 1925 and transferred to Guanghua University, from which he graduated in 1927.On 30 April 1933, Zhou married Zhang Yunhe (张允和). The couple went to Japan for Zhou's studies. Zhou started as an exchange student at the University of Tokyo, later transferring to Kyoto University due to his admiration of the Japanese Marxist economist Hajime Kawakami, who was a professor there at the time. Kawakami's arrest for joining the outlawed Japanese Communist Party in January 1933 meant that Zhou could not be his student. Zhou's son, Zhou Xiaoping (周晓平), was born in 1934. The couple also had a daughter, Zhou Xiaohe (周小禾).In 1937, due to the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War, Zhou and his family moved to the wartime capital Chongqing, and his daughter died. He worked for  Sin Hua Bank before entering public service as a deputy director at the National Government's Ministry of Economic Affairs, agricultural policy bureau (经济部农本局). After the 1945 Japanese defeat in World War II, Zhou went back to work for Sin Hua where he was stationed overseas: first in New York City and then in London. When he was in New York, he met Albert Einstein twice while visiting friends at Princeton University.Zhou participated for a time in the China Democratic National Construction Association. After the founding of the People's Republic was established in 1949 he returned to Shanghai, where he taught economics at Fudan University for several years.\n\nDesigning Pinyin\nBecause of his friendship with Zhou Enlai who recalled the economist's fascination with linguistics and Esperanto, he summoned Zhou to Beijing in 1955 and tasked his team with developing a new alphabet for China. The Chinese government placed Zhou at the head of a committee to reform the Chinese language to increase literacy. \nWhile other committees oversaw the tasks of promulgating Mandarin Chinese as the national language and creating simplified Chinese characters, Zhou's committee was charged with developing a romanization to represent the pronunciation of Chinese characters. Zhou said the task took about three years, and was a full-time job. Pinyin was made the official romanization in 1958, although (as now) it was only a pronunciation guide, not a substitute writing system. Zhou's team based Pinyin on several preexisting systems: the phonemes were inspired by Gwoyeu Romatzyh of 1928 and Latinxua Sin Wenz of 1931, while the diacritic markings representing tones were inspired by zhuyin.In April 1979, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in Warsaw held a technology conference. Speaking on behalf of the People's Republic of China, Zhou proposed the use of the \"Hanyu Pinyin System\" as the international standard for the romanization of Chinese. Following a vote in 1982 the scheme became ISO 7098.\nIn the modern era Pinyin has largely replaced older romanization systems such as Wade-Giles.\n\nLater activities\nDuring the Cultural Revolution, Zhou was sent to live in the countryside and to be \"reeducated\", as were many other intellectuals at that time. He spent two years at a labor camp.After 1980, Zhou worked with Liu Zunqi and Chien Wei-zang on translating the Encyclopædia Britannica into Chinese, earning him the nickname \"Encyclopedia Zhou\". Zhou continued writing and publishing after the creation of Pinyin; for example, his book 中国语文的时代演进 (Zhōngguó yǔwén de shídài yǎnjìn), translated into English by Zhang Liqing, was published in 2003 as The Historical Evolution of Chinese Languages and Scripts. Beyond the age of 100, he published ten books, some of which have been banned in China.In 2011, during an interview with NPR, Zhou said that he hoped to see the day China changed its position on the Tiananmen Square killings in 1989, an event he said had ruined Deng Xiaoping's reputation as a reformer. He became an advocate of political reform and democracy in China, and was critical of the Communist Party of China's attacks on traditional Chinese culture when it came into power.In early 2013, both Zhou and his son were interviewed by Dr. Adeline Yen Mah at their residence in Beijing. Mah documented the visit in a video and presented Zhou with a Pinyin game she created for the iPad. Zhou became a supercentenarian on 13 January 2016 when he reached the age of 110.Zhou died on 14 January 2017 at his home in Beijing, one day after his 111th birthday; no cause was given. His wife had died in 2002, and his son had died in 2015.Google honored what would have been his 112th birthday with an animated version of its logo in Mandarin.\n\nBooks\nZhou was the author of more than 40 books, some of them banned in China and over 10 of them published after he turned 100 in 2006.\n\nGallery\nSee also\nYuen Ren Chao\nList of centenarians (educators, school administrators, social scientists and linguists)\nPassage 7:\nFredy Schmidtke\nFredy Schmidtke (1 July 1961 – 1 December 2017) was a German track cyclist. He won a gold medal in the 1000 metres time trial at the 1984 Summer Olympics and finished eighth in the sprint.Schmidtke died of a heart attack on 1 December 2017, at the age of 56.\nPassage 8:\nFred H. Frank\nFred H. Frank (July 1, 1895 in Lessor, Wisconsin – July 10, 1957) was a member of the Wisconsin State Assembly who lived in Appleton. During World War I, he served with the First Army of the American Expeditionary Forces. From 1940 to 1945, Frank was Sheriff of Outagamie County, Wisconsin.\n\nPolitical career\nFrank first served in the Assembly from 1945 to 1949. He was re-elected to the Assembly in 1956 and remained a member until his death. Previously, Frank had been a member of the Outagamie County Board from 1930 to 1936. He was a Republican.\nPassage 9:\nZou Yixin\nZou Yixin or Chou Yi-Hsin (1911–1997) was a Chinese astronomer, who has been called \"the first female astronomer in China\".\nPassage 10:\nJustin (historian)\nJustin (Latin: Marcus Junianus Justinus Frontinus; fl. c. 2nd century) was a Latin writer and historian who lived under the  Roman Empire.\n\nLife\nAlmost nothing is known of Justin's personal history, his name appearing only in the title of his work. He must have lived after Gnaeus Pompeius Trogus, whose work he excerpted, and his references to the Romans and Parthians' having divided the world between themselves would have been anachronistic after the rise of the Sassanians in the third century. His Latin appears to be consistent with the style of the second century. Ronald Syme, however, argues for a date around AD 390, immediately before the compilation of the Augustan History, and dismisses anachronisms and the archaic style as unimportant, as he asserts readers would have understood Justin's phrasing to represent Trogus' time, and not his own.\n\nWorks\nJustin was the author of an epitome of Trogus' expansive Liber Historiarum Philippicarum, or Philippic Histories, a history of the kings of Macedonia, compiled in the time of Augustus.  Due to its numerous digressions, this work was retitled by one of its editors, Historia Philippicae et Totius Mundi Origines et Terrae Situs, or Philippic History and Origins of the Entire World and All of its Lands.  Justin's preface explains that he aimed to collect the most important and interesting passages of that work, which has since been lost.  Some of Trogus' original arguments (prologi) are preserved in various other authors, such as Pliny the Elder.  Trogus' main theme was the rise and history of the Macedonian Empire, and like him, Justin permitted himself considerable freedom of digression, producing an idiosyncratic anthology rather than a strict epitome.\n\nLegacy\nJustin's history was much used in the Middle Ages, when its author was sometimes mistakenly conflated with Justin Martyr.\n\nNotes", "answers": ["Chou Meng-Tieh"], "length": 2903, "dataset": "2wikimqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "e1439b2d77ce90280f85c9b3aaca79d8880aa1f7d97545ea"}

He was an innovative composer of instrumental music as well as songs, and was the composer of the earliest surviving music for the guitar.\n\nBiography\nThe place of his birth is not recorded, but he grew up in Guadalajara, and probably received his musical training there.  He most likely went to Italy in 1529 with Charles V, in the company of the fourth Duke of the Infantado, Íñigo López de Mendoza, marqués de Santillana.  When he returned to Spain he became a priest, receiving the post of canon at the cathedral in Seville in 1546, where he remained for the rest of his life.  While at the cathedral, he directed all of the musical activities; many records remain of his musical activities there, which included hiring instrumentalists, buying and assembling a new organ, and working closely with composer Francisco Guerrero for various festivities.  Mudarra died in Seville, and his sizable fortune was distributed to the poor of the city according to his will.\n\nMudarra wrote numerous pieces for the vihuela and the four-course guitar, all contained in the collection Tres libros de musica en cifras para vihuela (\"Three books of music in numbers for vihuela\"), which he published on December 7, 1546 in Seville.  These three books contain the first music ever published for the four-course guitar, which was then a relatively new instrument. The second book is noteworthy in that it contains eight multi-movement works, all arranged by \"tono\", or mode.\nCompositions represented in this publication include fantasias, variations (including a set on La Folia), tientos, pavanes and galliards, and songs. Modern listeners are probably most familiar with his Fantasia X, which has been a concert and recording mainstay for many years.   The songs are in Latin, Spanish and Italian, and include romances, canciones (songs), villancicos, (popular songs) and sonetos (sonnets).  Another innovation was the use of different signs for different tempos:  slow, medium, and fast.\n\nReferences and further reading\nJohn Griffiths: \"Alonso Mudarra\", Grove Music Online ed. L.

He is best known as the composer of the theme music for the original Star Trek series.\n\nEarly life\nCourage was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He received a music degree from the Eastman School of Music in Rochester, New York, in 1941. He served in the United States Army Air Forces in the western United States during the Second World War. During that period, he also found the time to compose music for the radio. His credits in this medium include the programs Adventures of Sam Spade Detective, Broadway Is My Beat, Hollywood Soundstage, and Romance.\n\nCareer\nCourage began as an orchestrator and arranger at MGM studios, which included work in such films as the 1951 Show Boat (\"Life Upon the Wicked Stage\" number); Hot Rod Rumble (1957 film); The Band Wagon (\"I Guess I'll Have to Change My Plan\"); Gigi (the can-can for the entrance of patrons at Maxim's); and the barn raising dance from Seven Brides for Seven Brothers.\nHe frequently served as an orchestrator on films scored by André Previn (My Fair Lady, \"The Circus is a Wacky World\", and \"You're Gonna Hear from Me\" production numbers for Inside Daisy Clover), Adolph Deutsch (Funny Face, Some Like It Hot), John Williams (The Poseidon Adventure, Superman, Jurassic Park, and the Academy Award-nominated musical films Fiddler on the Roof and Tom Sawyer), and Jerry Goldsmith (Rudy, Mulan, The Mummy, et al.).  He also arranged the Leslie Bricusse score (along with Lionel Newman) for Doctor Dolittle (1967).Apart from his work as a respected orchestrator, Courage also contributed original dramatic scores to films, including two westerns: Arthur Penn's The Left Handed Gun (1958) and André de Toth's Day of the Outlaw (1959), and the Connie Francis comedy Follow the Boys (1963). He continued writing music for movies throughout the 1980s and 1990s, including the score for Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987), which incorporated three new musical themes by John Williams in addition to Courage's adapted and original cues for the film. Courage's score for Superman IV: The Quest for Peace was released on CD in early 2008 by the Film Music Monthly company as part of its boxed set Superman - The Music, while La-La Land Records released a fully expanded restoration of the score on May 8, 2018, as part of Superman's 80th anniversary.\nCourage also worked as a composer on such television shows as Daniel Boone, The Brothers Brannagan, Lost in Space, Eight Is Enough, and Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea. Judd, for the Defense, Young Dr. Kildare and The Brothers Brannagan were the only television series besides Star Trek for which he composed the main theme.\nThe composer Jerry Goldsmith and Courage teamed on the long-running television show The Waltons in which Goldsmith composed the theme and Courage the Aaron Copland-influenced incidental music. In 1988, Courage won an Emmy Award for his music direction on the special Julie Andrews: The Sound of Christmas.  In the 1990s, Courage succeeded Arthur Morton as Goldsmith's primary orchestrator.Courage and Goldsmith collaborated again on orchestrations for Goldsmith's score for the 1997 film \"The Edge.\"\nCourage frequently collaborated with John Williams during the latter's tenure with the Boston Pops Orchestra.\n\nFamily\nAt the age of 35, Courage married Mareile Beate Odlum on October 6, 1955.\nMareile, born in Germany, was the daughter of Rudolf Wolff and Elisabeth Loechelt. After Wolff's suicide Elisabeth married Carl Wilhelm Richard Hülsenbeck, renowned for his involvement in the Dada movement in Europe. Hülsenbeck brought his wife (Elisabeth), son (Tom) and step-daughter (Mareile) to the United States in 1938 to avoid the political situation rapidly developing in Europe. After arriving in the US he changed his last name to Hulbeck.\nMareile's marriage to Courage was her third. Her second marriage was to Bruce Odlum (son of financier Floyd Odlum) in 1944. That union produced two sons, Christopher (1947) and Brian (1949). When Courage married Mareile he accepted the responsibility of acting stepfather to them. The family originally lived together on Erskine Dr. in Pacific Palisades, but later moved to a mountainside home on Beverly Crest Drive in Beverly Hills.\nAside from his musical abilities Courage was also an avid and accomplished photographer. He took many dramatic photos of bullfights and auto racing. He was a racing enthusiast, and his interest in that sport and photography brought him into contact with many racing personalities of the era, notably Phil Hill and Stirling Moss, both of whom he considered friends. Moss paid at least one social visit to the Erskine residence.\nThough a dedicated stepfather to Christopher and Brian, Courage's musical career took precedence over his familial responsibilities. He sought to interest his step-children in music, and was responsible for arranging Brian's first musical lessons, on alto saxophone. Later in life Brian became a composer of serious electronic music, though the vocation was not apparent during his childhood, as he was a poor saxophone student.\nAlexander and Mareile were divorced April 1, 1963. Courage subsequently married Kristin M. Zethren on July 14, 1967. That marriage also ended in divorce in 1972.\n\nStar Trek theme\nCourage is best known for writing the theme music for the original Star Trek series, and other music for that series. Courage was hired by Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry to score the original series at Jerry Goldsmith's suggestion, after Goldsmith turned down the job.  \nCourage went on to score incidental music for episodes \"The Man Trap\" and \"The Naked Time\" and some cues for \"Mudd's Women.\"\nCourage reportedly became alienated from Roddenberry when Roddenberry claimed half of the theme music royalties. Roddenberry wrote words for Courage's theme, not because he expected the lyrics to be sung on television, but so that he (Roddenberry) could receive half of the royalties from the song by claiming credit as the composition's co-writer. Courage was replaced by composer Fred Steiner who was then hired to write the musical scores for the remainder of the first season. \nAfter sound editors had difficulty finding the right effect, Courage himself made the iconic \"whoosh\" sound heard while the Enterprise flies across the screen.He returned to Star Trek to score two more episodes for the show's third and final season, episodes \"The Enterprise Incident\" and \"Plato's Stepchildren,\" allegedly as a courtesy to Producer Robert Justman.\nNotably, after later serving as Goldsmith's orchestrator, when Goldsmith composed the music for Star Trek: The Motion Picture,  Courage orchestrated Goldsmith's adaptation of his original Star Trek theme.\nFollowing Star Trek: The Motion Picture, Courage's iconic opening fanfare to the Star Trek theme became one of the franchise's most famous and memorable musical cues. The fanfare has been used in multiple motion pictures and television series,  notably Star Trek: The Next Generation and the four feature films based upon that series, three of which were scored by Goldsmith.\n\nDeath\nCourage had been in declining health for several years before he died on May 15, 2008, at the Sunrise assisted-living facility in Pacific Palisades, California. He had suffered a series of strokes prior to his death. His mausoleum is in Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery.\nPassage 7:\nShue Ming-fa\nShue Ming-fa (born 2 November 1950) is a former Taiwanese cyclist. He competed in three events at the 1972 Summer Olympics.\nPassage 8:\nPetrus de Domarto\nPetrus de Domarto (fl. c. 1445–1455) was a Franco-Flemish composer of the Renaissance.  He was a contemporary and probable acquaintance of Ockeghem, and was the composer of at least one of the first unified mass cycles to be written in continental Europe.\n\nLife\nDomarto's life is poorly documented.  He was listed as a singer at the Church of Our Lady in Antwerp in 1449, five years after Ockeghem was known to be there, and there is evidence he was in Tournai in 1451.  He had a high reputation (which makes the lack of documentation on his life curious), but even so was passed over for a post as master of the choirboys (in favor of Paulus Iuvenis).  No other documentation on his life has yet come to light.\n\nMusic and reputation\nDomarto's two mass settings, the Missa Spiritus almus and a Missa sine nomine, were famous at the time.  The latter of the two may have been one of the earliest cyclic masses composed on the continent, most likely in the 1440s, and imitates some features of contemporary English composers such as Leonel Power.  The Missa Spiritus almus, likely dating from the 1450s, is a cantus-firmus mass, with the melody always in the tenor, but with a changing rhythmic profile as it changes mensuration throughout the piece.  The procedure was evidently influential on the next generation of composers, for it was still being copied in the 1480s, and Busnois may have based one of his own masses on the same method (the Missa O crux lignum). The theorist and writer Johannes Tinctoris criticised it for exactly the features that inspired other composers.\nThe two surviving secular compositions by Domarto are both rondeaux, formes fixes of the type popular with the Burgundian School.\n\nWorks\nMasses\nMissa Spiritus almus (four voices)\nMissa sine nomine (three voices)\n\nSecular\nRondeaux, each for three voices:\n\nChelui qui est tant plain de duel\nJe vis tous jours en esperance\n\nNotes\nPassage 9:\nAlexandru Cristea\nAlexandru Cristea (1890–1942) was the composer of the music for \"Limba Noastră\", current national anthem of Moldova.\n\nBiography\nA choir director, a composer and music teacher. Taught at the  \"Vasile Kormilov\" music school (1928) with Gavriil Afanasiu and the  \"Unirea\" Conservatory (1927–1929) in Chişinău with Alexandru Antonovschi (canto), he was the master of vocal music from Chişinău (1920–1940), professor of music and conductor of the choir in the boys gymnasium \"Ion Heliade Rădulescu\" in București (1940–1941). Later, between 1941 and 1942, he directed the choir at the \"Queen Mother Elena\" high school from Chişinău. In 1920, he was ordained as a deacon of the St. George Church in Chişinău, from 1927 to 1941 was a deacon holds the Metropolitan Cathedral of Chişinău.\n\nCreation\nHis main creation is considered the music for \"Limba Noastră\", current national anthem of Moldova, composed in the lyrics of the priest-poet Alexei Mateevici. He was awarded the “Răsplata muncii pentru biserică”.\nPassage 10:\nClaudio Mattone\nClaudio Mattone (born 28 February 1943) is an Italian composer, lyricist and music producer.\nBorn in Santa Maria a Vico, Caserta, Mattone approached music at young age, as a jazz pianist. After leaving the university he moved to Rome, where he debuted in 1968 as a singer-songwriter with the song \"E' sera\", that premiered without any success at Cantagiro '68. Focusing on composition, between late sixties and early eighties he successfully teamed with the lyricist Franco Migliacci and signed several hits, contributing to launch the careers of Nada and Eduardo De Crescenzo; also working as music producer and as lyricist of his songs, in nineties Mattone launched the careers of Neri per caso and Syria, that respectively won the 1994 and 1995 editions of the Sanremo Music Festival in the \"giovani\" category.In 1990 Mattone won a David di Donatello and a Nastro d'Argento for the soundtrack of the 1989 film Scugnizzi.

The film is directed by Michael Joy from a screenplay co-written with John L. Simpson.\n\nPlot\nThe film follows the lives of six men over a period of months as they convene weekly in a self-help style group. Meeting at the home of Paul, the men include Freddy, a depressed stand-up comedian; the elderly Cecil; businessman Lucas; the bereaved Anthony; taciturn Moses; and talkative, middle-aged Alex. As trust grows between the men they gradually begin to open up and learn to listen to each other, discovering they are not alone in their fears as they had presumed. When a tragedy befalls the group, the men realize they must take responsibilities for their own lives and those of their loved ones.\n\nCast\nGrant Dodwell as Alex\nPaul Gleeson as Paul\nSteve Le Marquand as Lucas\nDon Reid as Cecil\nSteve Rodgers as Freddy\nPaul Tassone as Moses\nWilliam Zappa as Anthony\n\nProduction\nDevelopment\nThe concept of the film was conceived by Michael Joy and John L. Simpson, while working together on another project dealing with men's issues and their inability to communicate. At that time, director Michael Joy was experiencing depression and attended a men's support group on the advice of a telephone counsellor. Joy was struck by the pain of the men in the room and the safe environment in which they could express what they were going through.\n\nFilming\nJoy worked with each of the actors separately, workshopping the script over two months. Using this technique, Michael and John L. would create scenes from key character points and events. Only then was a comprehensive screenplay drafted and delivered to the heads of departments.The actors were not allowed to see the screenplay prior to shooting, and had little or no idea of other characters' story lines. The filmmakers did this to capture the actors' first responses to what was unfolding in front of them. There was only one take for each shot that appears in the film, and the shoot lasted only 14 days. It was shot in sequence, so the filmmakers could not go back to reshoot. Before each scene, Joy spent time talking to the actors quietly and individually about their lives at that point, trying to get them to speak about specific things that needed to happen in the film.The film was a micro-budget production, created on a reverse finance model, with each key crew member and actor taking an equity position in the film.\n\nReception\nThe film was praised and is particularly recognised for the strong performances by the lead actors. Anton Bitel of Eye for Film wrote the film \"represents a refreshing examination of the collective male psyche through pure drama\", and added the improvisational nature of the film results in an \"ensemble performances of searing, warts-and-all realism, so utterly believable that viewers themselves will feel like silent members of the party, compelled by the power of the proceedings to watch, listen, learn – and maybe join in the conversation after the credits have rolled.\" On At the Movies, Margaret Pomeranz awarded the film four stars and David Stratton awarded it three and a half stars.On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, Men's Group has an approval rating of 86% based on 7 reviews.\n\nAFI Fellowship and Tour\nFollowing the theatrical release of the film by Titan View, John L. Simpson was approached by men's health groups who wished to screen the film and use it as a tool to prompt discussions about men's mental health. With this interest, Simpson proposed to tour the film around Australia to non-theatrical venues for community group screenings, and in the process create a map of all venues in Australia suitable to screen from. For this proposal he was awarded the 2008 AFI Fellowship.The program has allowed the film to tour to towns such as Tamworth, Armidale, Bellingen, Dorrigo, Bowraville, and Bowral.\nIn early March 2009, Men’s Group was screened to men's and women's prisons in Tasmania.\n\nAwards and nominations\nFilm Critics Circle of Australia\n2009: Nominated, Best Actor – Grant DodwellInside Film Awards\n\n2008: Won, Best Actor – Grant Dodwell\n2008: Won, Best Feature Film – John L.

The film faithfully traced the course of this humorous and enterprising attempt to wake up the populace, filling out the basic plot with irreverent patriotic gags.\nPassage 5:\nTimes of Joy and Sorrow\nTimes of Joy and Sorrow (USA title), The Lighthouse (UK title), or\n喜びも悲しみも幾歳月 (Yorokobi mo Kanashimi mo Ikutoshitsuki), is a 1957 color Japanese film directed by Keisuke Kinoshita, who shot on location at 10 different lighthouses throughout Japan, including opening scenes at Kannonzaki, the site of the country's first lighthouse.\n\nPlot\nIn 1932, a young lighthouse keeper returns from his father's funeral with a new bride, who quickly learns the importance of the marital bond to members of her husband's profession, which is often characterized by the hardships of physical isolation and sudden reassignment. Over the next 25 years they transfer to ten different lighthouses throughout Japan, raising two children and befriending multiple colleagues and their families. They endure wartime attacks on the strategically relevant lighthouses as well as a tragedy involving one of their children, ultimately celebrating the other's marriage and settling together into middle age.\n\nCast\nHideko Takamine as Kiyoko Arisawa\nKeiji Sada as Shiro Arisawa\nTakahiro Tamura as Mr. Nozu\nKatsuo Nakamura as Kotaro\nYōko Katsuragi as Fuji Tatsuko\nKōji Mitsui as Mr. Kanemaki\nKuniko Igawa as Itoko Suzuki\nShizue Natsukawa as Mrs. Natori\nMasako Arisawa as Yukino\nHiroko Itō as Masako\nNoboru Nakaya as Shingo Natori\nTakeshi Sakamoto as Postmaster\nRyūji Kita as Natori\nMutsuko Sakura as Mrs. Kanemaki\n\nFeatured Lighthouses\nKannonzaki Lighthouse - Miura Peninsula, Kanagawa\nIshikari Lighthouse - Ishikari, Hokkaido\nIzu Oshima Lighthouse - Izu Ōshima, Izu Islands\nMizunokojima Lighthouse - Bungo Channel, Oita\nMeshima Lighthouse - Gotō Islands, Nagasaki\nHajiki Saki Lighthouse - Sado Island, Niigata\nOmaesaki Lighthouse - Omaezaki, Shizuoka\nAnorisaki Lighthouse - Shima, Mie\nOgijima Lighthouse - Seto Inland Sea, Kagawa\nHiyoriyama Lighthouse - Otaru, Hokkaido\n\nLegacy\nThe highly-popular film has been remade three times for Japanese television, and in 1986 Kinoshita himself reworked it as Big Joys, Small Sorrows, the Western version of its actual title (新・喜びも悲しみも幾歳月), which translates roughly as New Times of Joy and Sorrow.Its rousing, eponymous theme song was a major hit for Akira Wakayama and became a cultural touchstone of 1950s Japan.In 1993 a statue depicting the movie's two stars in an iconic pose from publicity materials was erected at Hajikizaki Lighthouse on Sato Island, one of the filming sites, as a tribute to lighthouse staff nationwide.\n\nAvailability\nAlthough the film has not been released on disc or for streaming in the United States, Kinoshita's remake Big Joys, Small Sorrows was among the inaugural films available in Spring 2019 for streaming on The Criterion Channel.\nPassage 6:\nEve's Leaves\nEve's Leaves is a 1926 American silent romantic comedy film starring Leatrice Joy and William Boyd.

DeMille and directed by Paul Sloane It is based upon the 1925 play of the same name by Harry Chapman Ford.\n\nPlot\nCaptain Corbin (Edeson), who operates the tramp cargo ship Garden of Eden, has raised his daughter Eve (Joy) as a boy. After learning about men after reading some romance novels belonging to the cook Cookie (Harris), she goes ashore in a Chinese port to find her true love and spies American Bob Britton (Boyd), whom she then has kidnapped to augment the ship's crew. Pirate Chang Fang (Long) and his pirates capture the ship seeking passage to his stronghold. With Cookie's help, Eve remakes herself using an outfit made from a curtain and some beads, which draws the interest of both Chang and Bob. In the end, Eve saves the day and she and Bob are married on board by a missionary (Hoyt).\n\nCast\nProduction\nLeatrice Joy had impulsively cut her hair short in 1926, and DeMille, whom Joy had followed when he set up Producers Distributing Corporation, was publicly angry as it prevented her from portraying traditional feminine roles. The studio developed projects with roles suitable for her “Leatrice Joy bob”, and Eve's Leaves was the second of five films before she regrew her hair. In both Eve's Leaves and The Clinging Vine (1926), Joy's character is mistaken as being male in at least one scene. In 1928, a professional dispute would end the Joy / Demille partnership and she signed with MGM.\nIntertitles featuring quotes from stereotype Chinese characters are in a racist fictional Asian dialect that today would be considered offensive.\n\nPreservation\nA 16mm print of Eve's Leaves is preserved film at the UCLA Film and Television Archive and the film has been released on DVD.\nPassage 7:\nWasted Time\nWasted Time(s) may refer to:\n\nSongs\n\"Wasted Time\" (Fuel song), 2007\n\"Wasted Time\" (Keith Urban song), 2016\n\"Wasted Time\" (Kings of Leon song), 2003\n\"Wasted Time\" (Skid Row song), 1991\n\"Wasted Time\" (Vance Joy song), 2014\n\"Wasted Times\" (The Weeknd song), 2018\n\"Wasted Time\", by Bret Michaels from Custom Built, 2010\n\"Wasted Time\", by Cloves, 2018\n\"Wasted Time\", by the Eagles from Hotel California, 1976\n\"Wasted Time\", by Europe from Wings of Tomorrow, 1984\n\"Wasted Time\", by Heavenly from Virus, 2006\n\"Wasted Time\", by Holy Knights from Between Daylight and Pain, 2012\n\"Wasted Time\", by Lionel Richie from Renaissance, 2000\n\nOther uses\nThe Wasted Times, a 2016 Chinese-Hong Kong film\n\nSee also\nWasting Time (disambiguation)\nWasting My Time (disambiguation)\n\"Waste Time\", a song by the Fire Theft from their self-titled album\nPassage 8:\nCity of Joy (2016 film)\nCity of Joy is a 2016 documentary film directed and written by Madeleine Gavin.

In the film, women band together at the leadership center to find a way to handle the horrible experiences that they had to live and to come out on the other side to be leaders and inspirations for other women in the region.\nPassage 9:\nTalentime\nTalentime is a 2009 Malaysian drama film written and directed by Yasmin Ahmad. Yasmin, in her blog, has described it \"as a story full of joy and pain, hope and despair, a host of beautifully-written songs, and rich characters\". A Hindu open cremation and a scene reminiscent of the 2001 Kampung Medan riots are included in the film.The film was released on 26 March 2009 in Malaysia and marks Yasmin's last feature film prior to her death on 25 July 2009.\n\nPlot\n\"The music teacher, who is herself a great performer is organising an inter-school talentime. Through the days of auditions, rehearsals and preparations, running up to the big day of the contest, the characters get embroiled in a world of heightened emotions - ambition, jealousy, human comedy, romance, heartbreak - all of which culminate in a day of great music and performances.\" Yasmin also mentioned that the idea behind Talentime was that as humans, we have to go through a lot of pain and some measure of suffering before we can reach greater heights.A talent search competition has matched two hearts - that of Melur, a Malay-mixed girl and an Indian male student, Mahesh. Melur, with her melodious voice, singing whilst playing the piano is one of the seven finalists of the Talentime competition of her school organised by Cikgu Adibah. Likewise Hafiz, enthralling with his vocalist talent while playing the guitar, dividing his time between school and mother, who is hospitalised for brain tumor.\nIt all started after Mahesh, amongst the students assigned to get the finalists to school for practice, delivered the notice of successful audition to Melur's house. His handsome looks attracted the girl. Early on in their relationship, tragedy struck Mahesh's family when his uncle Ganesh who had been the care-taker of the family since the loss of Mahesh's father, was stabbed to death on his wedding day. Melur thinking that Mahesh's silence was due to his grief over the tragedy became furious when she was continuously ignored. She regretted it however after Hafiz revealed Mahesh's situation.\nThat changed Melur's perception of Mahesh. Likewise Mahesh, who grew comfortable with the presence of the girl who often quotes beautiful poetry. Mahesh, realising that the relationship will be opposed, kept it hidden from his mother, still grieving over the death of Ganesh. At last, the secret was exposed and Mahesh was assaulted before Melur's very eyes. Just a day before the competition, is Melur resilient enough to sing the poetic lyrics of her song when her heart is tormented by the thoughts of Mahesh? What about Mahesh who has found his first love? On Talentime night, everything unfolds.\n\nCast\nMahesh Jugal Kishor as Mahesh, a hearing impaired Indian boy who becomes Melur's love interest.\nPamela Chong as Melur, a Eurasian girl in the Talentime finals who sings and plays the piano.\nSyafie Naswip as Hafiz, a Malay boy in the Talentime finals who sings and plays the guitar.\nJaclyn Victor as Bhavani, Mahesh's elder sister who has a penchant for picking on him.\nHoward Hon Kahoe as Kahoe, a Chinese boy in the Talentime finals who plays the erhu and resents Hafiz.\nAmelia Henderson as Melati, Melur's younger sister.\nAdibah Noor as Cikgu Adibah, the teacher in charge of organising the Talentime.\nAzean Irdawaty as Embun, Hafiz's mother who is diagnosed with terminal brain cancer.\nHarith Iskander as Harith, Melur's comical father.\nSukania Venugopal as Mahesh's mother.\nJit Murad as Ismael, A patient who befriends Embun at the hospital during her final days.\nMislina Mustaffa as Melur's mother.\nTan Mei Ling as Mei Ling, a Chinese Muslim convert who works as a maid for Melur's family.\nIda Nerina as Datin Kalsom, a friend of Melur's mother who distrusts Mei Ling.Sharifah Amani was supposed to be cast as Melur in the film. However, due to clash of schedules, she was replaced by Pamela Chong. She did, however, play a role as the 3rd Assistant Director for the film. This would mark the first time that Sharifah Amani has played a behind-the-scene role in Yasmin Ahmad's films.\n\nMusic\nThe film score was composed by Pete Teo. Songs include:\n\nO Re Piya by Rahat Fateh Ali Khan, taken from the Bollywood movie, Aaja Nachle\nI Go by Aizat Amdan.\nJust One Boy by Aizat Amdan.\nAngel by Atilia.\nKasih Tak Kembali by Atilia.All songs were written and produced by Teo himself, except Kasih Tak Kembali which was written by Ahmad Hashim.\nThe original soundtrack album was released by Universal Music, which also includes Malay language versions of many of the principal songs in the film. This includes I Go (as 'Pergi'), Angel, and Just One Boy (as 'Itulah Dirimu').\n\nScreening\nAs in all of Yasmin's previous works, Talentime opens with the basmalah (Bismillahirahmanirrahim, \"In the name of God, the most Gracious and most Merciful\"). Like Muallaf, the verse is displayed in a language and script different from Arabic in Talentime, i.e. in Tamil - பிஸ்மில்லாஹிர்ரஹ்மானிர்ரஹீம்.\n\nAwards and nominations\nPassage 10:\nKomaligal\n\"Komaligal\" (1976) (Tamil: கோமாளிகள், \"The Clowns\") is a Sri Lankan Tamil language film written by S.Ramdas and produced by M.Mohamed.   This was the remake of the most popular radio comedy drama, \"Komaligalin Kummalam\" which was broadcast in Radio Ceylon in the mid 1970s. It was written by S. Ramdas who acted in lead role.\n\nDevelopment\nM. Mohamed, a businessman, who used to listen this radio drama weekly, was attracted by it. Thus he thought to make it as a film. He expressed his idea to S.Ramdas. He also agreed and film was started.  Story and dialogues were written by S.Ramdas who acted as Marikkar in lead role. Film was directed by Ramanathan, an experienced person in the Sinhala film industry.\n\nCasting\nThe highlight of the film was the performances of S.Ramdas, a Brahmin in real life, who played the role of a Muslim, and B.H.Abdul Hameed, a Muslim in real life, who played a Brahmin role. Also T.Rajagopal acted as a role of \"Appukutty\", S.Selvasekaran as \"Upali\" and Sillaiyur Selvarajan and his wife Kamalini Selvarajan acted as lovers in the film.

{"input": "Where was the place of death of Salin Mibaya's husband?", "context": "Passage 1:\nSalin Mibaya\nSalin Mibaya (Burmese: စလင်း မိဖုရား, pronounced [səlɪ́ɴ mḭbəjá]; also known as Narapati Medaw, (နရပတိ မယ်တော်)) was the chief queen of Viceroy Thado Dhamma Yaza II of Prome (r. 1551–1588).\nThe second daughter of King Bayin Htwe of Prome and his chief queen Shwe Zin Gon was married three times. Her marriage to her first cousin Min Ba Saw—a son of her maternal uncle—was cut short when her brother King Narapati had him executed. Narapati then married her off to Sithu Kyawhtin, then governor of Salin, a powerful figure in the Confederation of Shan States, in a marriage of state in the late 1530s. (Prome was then a de facto vassal state of the Confederation, which controlled all of Ava territories except Toungoo in Upper Burma.) Her stay at Salin lasted until January 1544 when the city was captured by Toungoo forces under Gen. Bayinnaung. Her husband escaped to Ava (Inwa) but she was captured and sent to Pegu (Bago). In 1545, she was married to Nanda Yawda, a younger brother of Bayinnaung, at the coronation ceremony of Tabinshwehti at the Pegu Palace.She returned to her native Prome as queen in 1551 when her husband was appointed viceroy of the region by King Bayinnaung. She had two daughters by Nanda Yawda, now styled as Thado Dhamma Yaza II. Their elder daughter Hsinbyushin Medaw became the chief queen of Nawrahta Minsaw, the viceroy (and later king) of Lan Na.

He lived in Set Maat (translated as \"The Place of Truth\"), contemporary Deir el-Medina, on the west bank of the Nile, opposite Thebes. Sennedjem had the title \"Servant in the Place of Truth\". He was buried along with his wife, Iyneferti, and members of his family in a tomb in the village necropolis. His tomb was discovered January 31, 1886. When Sennedjem's tomb was found, it contained furniture from his home, including a stool and a bed, which he used when he was alive.His titles included Servant in the Place of Truth, meaning that he worked on the excavation and decoration of the nearby royal tombs.\n\nSee also\n\nTT1 – (Tomb of Sennedjem, family and wife)\nPassage 5:\nPlace of origin\nIn Switzerland, the place of origin (German: Heimatort or Bürgerort, literally \"home place\" or \"citizen place\"; French: Lieu d'origine; Italian: Luogo di attinenza) denotes where a Swiss citizen has their municipal citizenship, usually inherited from previous generations. It is not to be confused with the place of birth or  place of residence, although two or all three of these locations may be identical depending on the person's circumstances.\n\nAcquisition of municipal citizenship\nSwiss citizenship has three tiers. For a person applying to naturalise as a Swiss citizen, these tiers are as follows:\n\nMunicipal citizenship, granted by the place of residence after fulfilling several preconditions, such as sufficient knowledge of the local language, integration into local society, and a minimum number of years lived in said municipality.\nCantonal (state) citizenship, for which a Swiss municipal citizenship is required. This requires a certain number of years lived in said canton.\nCountry citizenship, for which both of the above are required, also requires a certain number of years lived in Switzerland (except for people married to a Swiss citizen, who may obtain simplified naturalisation without having to reside in Switzerland), and involves a criminal background check.The last two kinds of citizenship are a mere formality, while municipal citizenship is the most significant step in becoming a Swiss citizen. \nNowadays the place of residence determines the municipality where citizenship is acquired, for a new applicant, whereas previously there was a historical reason for preserving the municipal citizenship from earlier generations in the family line, namely to specify which municipality held the responsibility of providing social welfare. The law has now been changed, eliminating this form of allocating responsibility to a municipality other than that of the place of residence. Care needs to be taken when translating the term in Swiss documents which list the historical \"Heimatort\" instead of the usual place of birth and place of residence.\nHowever, any Swiss citizen can apply for a second, a third or even more municipal citizenships for prestige reasons or to show their connection to the place they currently live – and thus have several places of origin. As the legal significance of the place of origin has waned (see below), Swiss citizens can often apply for municipal citizenship for no more than 100 Swiss francs after having lived in the same municipality for one or two years. In the past, it was common to have to pay between 2,000 and 4,000 Swiss francs as a citizenship fee, because of the financial obligations incumbent on the municipality to grant the citizenship.\nA child born to two Swiss parents is automatically granted the citizenship of the parent whose last name they hold, so the child gets either the mother's or the father's place of origin. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the citizenship, and thus the place of origin, of the Swiss parent.\n\nInternational confusion\nAlmost uniquely in the world (with the exception of Japan, which lists one's Registered Domicile; and Sweden, which lists the mother's place of domicile as place of birth), the Swiss identity card, passport and driving licence do not show the holder's birthplace, but only their place of origin. The vast majority of countries show the holder's actual birthplace on identity documents. This can lead to administrative issues for Swiss citizens abroad when asked to demonstrate their actual place of birth, as no such information exists on any official Swiss identification documents. Only a minority of Swiss citizens have a place of origin identical to their birthplace. More confusion comes into play through the fact that people can have more than one place of origin.\n\nSignificance and history\nA citizen of a municipality does not enjoy a larger set of rights than a non-citizen of the same municipality. To vote in communal, cantonal or national matters, only the current place of residence matters – or in the case of citizens abroad, the last Swiss place of residence.\nThe law previously required that a citizen's place of origin continued to bear all their social welfare costs for two years after the citizen moved away. In 2012, the National Council voted by 151 to 9 votes to abolish this law. The place of domicile is now the sole payer of welfare costs.In 1923, 1937, 1959 and 1967, more cantons signed treaties that assured that the place of domicile had to pay welfare costs instead of the place of origin, reflecting the fact that fewer and fewer people lived in their place of origin (1860: 59%, in 1910: 34%).In 1681, the Tagsatzung – the then Swiss parliament – decided that beggars should be deported to their place of origin, especially if they were insufficiently cared for by their residential community.In the 19th century, Swiss municipalities even offered free emigration to the United States if the Swiss citizen agreed to renounce municipal citizenship, and with that the right to receive welfare.\n\nSee also\nAncestral home (Chinese)\nBon-gwan\nRegistered domicile\n\n\n== Notes and references ==\nPassage 6:\nValley of Death\nValley of Death may refer to:\n\nPlaces\nValley of Death (Bydgoszcz), the site of a 1939 Nazi mass murder and mass grave site in northern Poland\nValley of Death (Crimea), the site of the Charge of the Light Brigade in the 1854 Battle of Balaclava\nValley of Death (Gettysburg), the 1863 Gettysburg Battlefield landform of Plum Run\nValley of Death (Dukla Pass), the site of a tank battle during the Battle of the Dukla Pass in 1944 (World War II)\nThe Valley of Death, an area of poisonous volcanic gas near the Kikhpinych volcano in Russia\nThe Valley of Death, an area of poisonous volcanic gas near the Tangkuban Perahu volcano in Indonesia\nValley of Death, a nickname for the highly polluted city of Cubatão, Brazil\n\nOther uses\nThe Valley of Death (audio drama), a Doctor Who audio play\nThe Valley of Death (film), a 1968 western film\n\"Valley of Death\", the flawed NewsStand: CNN & Time debut program that caused the Operation Tailwind controversy\nA literary element of \"The Charge of the Light Brigade\" by Alfred, Lord Tennyson\nA reference to the difficulty of covering negative cash flow in the early stages of a start-up company; see Venture capital\n\"The Valley of Death\", a song by the Swedish heavy metal band Sabaton from the 2022 album The War to End All Wars\n\nSee also\nAll pages with titles containing Valley of Death\nDeath Valley (disambiguation)\nValley of the Shadow of Death (disambiguation)\nPassage 7:\nBeaulieu-sur-Loire\nBeaulieu-sur-Loire (French pronunciation: ​[boljø syʁ lwaʁ], literally Beaulieu on Loire) is a commune in the Loiret department in north-central France.

Having begun his military career in the service of King Tabinshwehti, the youngest full brother of Bayinnaung was part of the small core group loyal to Bayinnaung, following the assassination of Tabinshwehti in 1550. Alongside his brothers Bayinnaung, Minye Sithu, Minkhaung II, Thado Minsaw and his nephew Nanda, he fought in nearly every campaign between 1550 and 1584 that rebuilt, expanded and defended the Toungoo Empire.\n\nEarly life\nHe was born in the Toungoo Palace precincts to Mingyi Swe and Shin Myo Myat, royal household servants of Crown Prince Tabinshwehti. He had an elder sister, Dhamma Dewi, two elder brothers, Bayinnaung and Minye Sithu, and two younger half-brothers, Minkhaung II and Thado Minsaw who were born to his aunt (his mother's younger sister) and his father. He grew up in the palace precincts, and received a military-style education there.\n\nCareer\nTabinshwehti era (1534–1550)\nHe participated in the Toungoo–Hanthawaddy War (1534–1541), and by 1540 had achieved the rank of regimental commander with the style of Nanda Yawda (နန္ဒယော်ဓာ). He was appointed governor of Thamyindon (သမြင်းတုံ) in the Irrawaddy delta in 1541 by Tabinshwehti. He served as a regimental commander in Toungoo's campaigns against Prome (1541–1542), led a naval squadron in the Arakan campaign (1546–1547), and commanded an elephant battalion in the invasion of Siam (1548–1549). In January 1550, he joined his brothers Bayinnaung and Minye Sithu on the campaign to suppress the rebellion of Smim Htaw.\n\nBayinnaung era (1550–1581)\nHe was a key member of Bayinnaung's drive to restore the Toungoo Empire which had fallen apart after Tabinshwehti was assassinated on 30 April 1550. He led a regiment in Bayinnaung's 1550–1551 assault on the city of Toungoo, whose ruler Minkhaung II was their own half-brother. He was given a royal title of Thado Dhamma Yaza on 11 January 1551 by Bayinnaung after Minkhaung II surrendered and was pardoned on the same day. He commanded the Irrawaddy flank in the Prome campaign (March–August 1551). Prome was taken on 30 August 1551, and Bayinnaung appointed him as the viceroy of Prome.Thado Dhamma Yaza II was one of the four deputies of Bayinnaung in the king's campaigns between 1552 and 1565 that greatly expanded the Toungoo Empire. The original four were Bayinnaung's four brothers: Minye Sithu, Thado Dhamma Yaza, Minkhaung and Thado Minsaw. After Minye Sithu's death in 1556, Bayinnaung's eldest son Nanda took his place. Thado Dhamma Yaza participated in every campaign except for Manipur (1560) and Lan Xang (1565). Bayinnaung had built the largest empire in the history of Southeast Asia. After a brief respite, he faced serious rebellions in Lan Xang and Siam in 1568, later joined by northern Shan states in the 1570s. Thado Dhamma Yaza along with the other three deputies of the king were called upon to suppress the rebellions.The following is a list of campaigns in which he participated during the reign of Bayinnaung.\n\nHe proved to be a loyal brother. He built the Prome gate of Pegu (Bago) when the capital was rebuilt between 1565 and 1568. (Each of the twenty gates of the new capital was built by key vassal rulers.) For their loyal service, Thado Dhamma Yaza II, Minkhaung II and Thado Minsaw were all honored by their brother the king on 3 March 1580.\n\nNanda era (1581–1588)\nBayinnaung died on 10 October 1581, and was succeeded by his son Nanda. The new king faced an impossible task of maintaining an empire ruled by autonomous viceroys who were loyal to Bayinnaung, not the kingdom of Toungoo. Nanda particularly distrusted his uncle Thado Minsaw of Ava. When two Chinese Shan states Sanda and Thaungthut revolted in August/September 1582, the high king asked Thado Dhamma Yaza II and Nawrahta Minsaw of Lan Na to lead two 8000-strong armies to quell the rebellion. (The king conspicuously did not ask Thado Minsaw to take part in the campaign although Ava contributed troops and the Shan states were closer to Ava.) The two armies laid siege to Sanda (present-day Baoshan prefecture) for nearly five months until the starving city surrendered. The armies arrived back to Pegu in April 1583.Nanda's slight of Thado Minsaw did not go unnoticed. In June/July 1583, Thado Minsaw sent secret embassies to Prome, Toungoo and Chiang Mai to launch a simultaneous revolt against Nanda. He also sent missions to Shan states for their support. Thado Dhamma Yaza and the other viceroys sided with Nanda. When Nanda marched to Ava in March 1584, he along with the rulers of Toungoo and Chiang Mai also marched to Ava. Ava turned out to be Thado Dhamma Yaza's last campaign. He did not participate in the ensuing campaigns against Siam, which revolted in May 1584.\nThado Dhamma Yaza II died in November/December 1588. He was succeeded by Mingyi Hnaung, one of Nanda's sons, styled as Thado Dhamma Yaza III of Prome.\n\nFamily\nHis chief queen was Salin Mibaya, who was a daughter of King Bayin Htwe of Prome and a descendant of Ava royalty. They were married in 1545 in Pegu at the coronation ceremony of Tabinshwehti. He had two daughters by his chief queen. The elder daughter Hsinbyushin Medaw became the chief queen of Nawrahta Minsaw, the viceroy (and later king) of Lan Na. The younger daughter Min Taya Medaw was a major queen of Nanda.He also had seven sons and a daughter by minor queens and concubines. They were:\nNanda Yawda (birth name Shin Zin), who married his first cousin Myat Myo Hpone Wai (daughter of Bayinnaung) and became governor of Sagaing.

This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person. Practice regarding whether this place should be a country, a territory or a city/town/locality differs in different countries, but often city or territory is used for native-born citizen passports and countries for foreign-born ones.\nAs a general rule with respect to passports, if the place of birth is to be a country, it's determined to be the country that currently has sovereignty over the actual place of birth, regardless of when the birth actually occurred. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth.\nSome countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents. For example, Sweden has used the concept of födelsehemort (\"domicile of birth\") since 1947. This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant.\nSimilarly, Switzerland uses the concept of place of origin. A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother's or father's place of origin. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder's place of origin is stated, not their place of birth. In Japan, the registered domicile is a similar concept.\nIn some countries (primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase jus soli. Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality(-ies) of the baby's parents (referred to as jus sanguinis).\nThere can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality(-ies) of the parents and/or the location of the plane or ship (if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country).\nSome administrative forms may request the applicant's \"country of birth\". It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant's \"place of birth\" or \"nationality at birth\". For example, US citizens born abroad who acquire US citizenship at the time of birth, the nationality at birth will be USA (American), while the place of birth would be the country in which the actual birth takes place.\n\nReference list\n8 FAM 403.4 Place of Birth", "answers": ["Pyay"], "length": 3817, "dataset": "2wikimqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "3cd55b0826fed3ba2514f1f3477412ceb1d54c958b74d2a1"}

His grandfather, Pandit Ram Prasad Sharma, imparted music knowledge to thousands of aspirants, many of whom are amongst today's top musicians. His father, Naresh Sharma, was a leading expert of musical arrangements, having worked with almost all of the top composers in more than two hundred movies. Mithoon's father and his uncle Pyarelal-ji (Pyarelal Ramprasad Sharma) formed one-half of the legendary composer duo Laxmikant-Pyarelal.Mithoon started learning music at the age of eleven. Since his father remained busy, he sent him to knowledgeable people to train himself. His father observed him closely and would often notice what he was practicing. His father often listened to the tunes that he created as well. On 6 November 2022, he married playback singer Palak Muchhal.\n\nCareer\nMithoon began his career with two recreations: \"Woh Lamhe\" in Zeher and \"Aadat\" in Kalyug. In 2006, Mithoon's friend recommended his name to Onir, (director of Bas Ek Pal), who wanted an electro-based title track. This led to his first original song as a composer, \"Bas Ek Pal\" with singer KK, and was followed by \"Tere Bin\" (by singer Atif Aslam) in 2006.

He was an innovative composer of instrumental music as well as songs, and was the composer of the earliest surviving music for the guitar.\n\nBiography\nThe place of his birth is not recorded, but he grew up in Guadalajara, and probably received his musical training there.  He most likely went to Italy in 1529 with Charles V, in the company of the fourth Duke of the Infantado, Íñigo López de Mendoza, marqués de Santillana.  When he returned to Spain he became a priest, receiving the post of canon at the cathedral in Seville in 1546, where he remained for the rest of his life.  While at the cathedral, he directed all of the musical activities; many records remain of his musical activities there, which included hiring instrumentalists, buying and assembling a new organ, and working closely with composer Francisco Guerrero for various festivities.  Mudarra died in Seville, and his sizable fortune was distributed to the poor of the city according to his will.\n\nMudarra wrote numerous pieces for the vihuela and the four-course guitar, all contained in the collection Tres libros de musica en cifras para vihuela (\"Three books of music in numbers for vihuela\"), which he published on December 7, 1546 in Seville.  These three books contain the first music ever published for the four-course guitar, which was then a relatively new instrument. The second book is noteworthy in that it contains eight multi-movement works, all arranged by \"tono\", or mode.\nCompositions represented in this publication include fantasias, variations (including a set on La Folia), tientos, pavanes and galliards, and songs. Modern listeners are probably most familiar with his Fantasia X, which has been a concert and recording mainstay for many years.   The songs are in Latin, Spanish and Italian, and include romances, canciones (songs), villancicos, (popular songs) and sonetos (sonnets).  Another innovation was the use of different signs for different tempos:  slow, medium, and fast.\n\nReferences and further reading\nJohn Griffiths: \"Alonso Mudarra\", Grove Music Online ed. L.

{"input": "Which film has the director who was born earlier, Born Into Brothels or Dr. Goldfoot And The Bikini Machine?", "context": "Passage 1:\nBorn into Brothels\nBorn into Brothels: Calcutta's Red Light Kids is a 2004 Indian-American documentary film about the children of prostitutes in Sonagachi, Kolkata's red light district. The widely acclaimed film, written and directed by Zana Briski and Ross Kauffman, won a string of accolades including the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature in 2005.\n\nPlot\nBriski, a documentary photographer, went to Kolkata to photograph prostitutes. While there, she befriended their children and offered to teach the children photography to reciprocate being allowed to photograph their mothers. The children were given cameras so they could learn photography and possibly improve their lives. Their photographs depicted a life in the red light district through the eyes of children typically overlooked and sworn off to do chores around the house until they were able to contribute more substantially to the family welfare.  Much of their work was used in the film, and the filmmakers recorded the classes as well as daily life in the red light district. The children's work was exhibited, and one boy was even sent to a photography conference in Amsterdam. Briski also recorded her efforts to place the children in boarding schools although many of the children did not end up staying very long in the schools they were placed in. Others, such as Avijit and Kochi, not only went on to continue their education but were graded well.\n\nAftermath\nThere is debate about the extent to which the documentary has improved the lives of the children featured in it.The filmmakers claim that the lives of children appearing in Born into Brothels have been transformed by money earned through the sale of photos and a book on them. Ross Kauffman, co-director of the documentary, says that the amount earned is $100,000 (about Rs.4.5 million), which will pay for their tuition and for a school in India for children of prostitutes. Briski has started a non-profit organization to continue this kind of work in other countries, named Kids with Cameras. A film is being made on the life story of a high-profile trio of call girl sisters, Shaveta, Khushboo and Himani, born in one of the brothels of Haryana.\nIn November 2006, Kids with Cameras provided an update on many of the children's conditions, asserting that they had entered high schools or universities in India and the United States or found employment outside of prostitution. Kids with Cameras continues to work toward improving the lives of children from the Calcutta red light district with the plan to build a Hope House. Updates for 2010 and 2009  were also published.In 2004, REACT to FILM organized a screening for Born into Brothels  at the SoHo House in Manhattan, NY.  In 2010, the film's director, Zana Briski, joined the advisory board of REACT to FILM.\n\nCriticisms\nThe Durbar Mahila Samanwaya Committee, a prostitutes' organization active in Sonagachi, has criticized the film for presenting the children's parents as abusive and for ignoring the prostitutes' efforts to provide  education programs and career building activities for their children. In addition, the film has been criticized in India for perceived racist stereotyping, and has also been viewed as exploiting the children for the purposes of Indophobic propaganda in the West. A review in Frontline, India's national magazine, summarized this criticism, remarking:\n\nIF Born Into Brothels were remade as an adventure-thriller in the tradition of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, its posters might read: \"New York film-maker Zana Briski sallies forth among the natives to save souls.\nSome critics joined the Sonagachi prostitute-advocacy groups in condemning the film for exploitation of the plight of the prostitutes for profit. Other criticisms were raised about \"ethical and stylistic\" problems, by Partha Banerjee, interpreter between the filmmakers and the children.\n\nReception\nCritical response\nBorn into Brothels has an approval rating of 95% on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 108 reviews, and an average rating of 7.83/10. The website's critical consensus states, \"A powerful and uplifting documentary\". Metacritic assigned the film a weighted average score of 78 out of 100, based on 32 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".\n\nAwards\n2004 Bermuda International Film Festival Audience Choice Award - Briski, Kauffman; Documentary Prize - Briski, Kauffman\n2004 Cleveland International Film Festival Best Film - Briski, Kauffman\n2004 Full Frame Documentary Film Festival Audience Award - Briski, Kauffman (tied with Word Wars)\n2004 International Documentary Association Award for Feature Documentaries - Briski, Kauffman, Geralyn Dreyfous-White, Pamela Boll (tied with Fahrenheit 9/11)\n2004 National Board of Review Award for Best Documentary Feature - Zana Briski and Ross Kauffman\n2004 Seattle International Film Festival Golden Space Needle Award for Best Documentary - Briski, Kauffman\n2004 Sundance Film Festival Audience Award, Documentary - Kauffman\n2005 Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature Briski, Kauffman\n2005 Raindance Film Festival Closing Night Film\n\nNominations\n2005 Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directorial Achievement in Documentary - Briski, Kauffman\n2005 Golden Satellite Award for Best Motion Picture, Documentary\n2004 Los Angeles Film Critics Association Awards for Best Documentary/Non-Fiction Film - Kauffman, Briski\n2004 Sundance Film Festival Grand Jury Prize, Documentary - Kauffman, Briski\n2013 Calcutta Film Festival (funded by Walt Disney Pictures), Documentary - Spielberg, Steven.

As a child Zee was forbidden from watching cinema because his father believed movies were a bad influence on children.\nAt age 13, Doctor Zee got his start in the world of entertainment at Radio Pakistan where he wrote and produced radio dramas and musical programs.  It was then that he realized his passion for storytelling At the age of 26, Doctor Zee earned his medical doctorate degree and did his residency in a burn unit at the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences. He cared for women who were victims of  \"Bride Burning,\" the archaic practice used as a form of punishment against women who fail to provide sufficient dowry to their in-laws after marriage or fail to provide offspring.  He also witnessed how his country’s transgender and intersex people, called “hijras”, were banned from having jobs and forced to beg to survive. These experiences inspired Doctor Zee to tackle the issues of women’s empowerment and gender inequality in his films.In 1999, he came to San Francisco to pursue his dream of filmmaking and made San Francisco his home\n\nEducation\nHe received his early education from Jinnah Public School, Chakwal. He got his medical doctor degree at Rawalpindi Medical College, Pakistan.\n\nFilm career\nDoctor Zee's first film titled Night of Henna was released in 2005. The theme of the film dealt with \"the conflict between Old World immigrant customs and modern Western ways...\" Night of Henna focused on the problems of Pakistani expatriates who found it hard to adjust in American culture. Many often landed themselves in trouble when it came to marrying off their children.\nHis second film Bicycle Bride came out in 2010, which was about \"the clash between the bonds of family and the weight of tradition.\" His third film House of Temptation that came out in 2014 was about a family which struggles against the temptations of the Devil. His fourth film “Good Morning Pakistan”, concerned a young American’s journey back to Pakistan where he confronts the contradictory nature of a beautiful and ancient culture that's marred by economic, educational and gender inequality His upcoming fifth film, \"Ghost in San Francisco\" is a supernatural thriller starring Felissa Rose, Dave Sheridan, and Kyle Lowder where a soldier comes home from Afghanistan to discover that his wife is having an affair with his best friend. While battling with his inner ghosts and demons, he meets a mysterious woman in San Francisco who promises him a ritual for his cure.\nPassage 4:\nDr. Goldfoot and the Bikini Machine\nDr. Goldfoot and the Bikini Machine is a 1965 Pathécolor comedy film directed by Norman Taurog and distributed by American International Pictures. Starring Vincent Price, Frankie Avalon, Dwayne Hickman, Susan Hart and Jack Mullaney, and featuring Fred Clark, the film is a parody of the then-popular spy trend (the title is a spoof of two James Bond films: the 1962 film Dr. No and the 1964 hit Goldfinger), made using actors from AIP's beach party and Edgar Allan Poe films. The film was retitled Dr G. and the Bikini Machine in England due to a threatened lawsuit from Eon, holder of the rights to the James Bond series.\nDespite its low production values, the film has achieved a certain cult status for the appearance of horror legend Price and AIP's beach party film alumni, its in-jokes and over-the-top sexuality, the claymation title sequence designed by Art Clokey, and a title song performed by The Supremes. Its success led to a sequel, produced in 1966, entitled Dr. Goldfoot and the Girl Bombs.\n\nPlot\nPrice plays the titular mad scientist who, with the questionable assistance of his resurrected flunky Igor, builds a gang of female robots who are then dispatched to seduce and rob wealthy men. Avalon and Hickman play the bumbling heroes who attempt to thwart Goldfoot's scheme. The film's climax is an extended chase through the streets of San Francisco.\n\nCast\nCast notes\n\nFrankie Avalon and Dwayne Hickman play the same characters they did in the previous year's Ski Party, except that the characters' names were swapped.\nAnnette Funicello makes a brief cameo appearance as a girl locked in medieval stocks in Dr. Goldfoot's lair. Frankie Avalon lifts her head, then looks at the camera and says, \"It can't be!\"  Pregnant with her first child at the time, Funicello was placed in the stocks in order to hide her stomach.\nHarvey Lembeck also makes a cameo appearance as his Eric Von Zipper character, enchained along with his motorcycle in Goldfoot's lair. Lembeck also appeared as Goldfoot's assistant, Hugo, in the TV special The Wild Weird World of Dr. Goldfoot.\nAmong the girls who play Goldfoot's robots are Deanna Lund, three years before joining the cast of Irwin Allen's science fiction series Land of the Giants; China Lee, a former Playboy Playmate married to Mort Sahl; Luree Holmes and Laura Nicholson, the daughters of James H. Nicholson; and Alberta Nelson, who was also in all seven of AIP's Beach Party films as a member of Eric Von Zipper's motorcycle gang, The Rat Pack.\n\nProduction\nDevelopment\nThe original idea for this motion picture came from James H. Nicholson, the President of American International Pictures, who wanted to showcase the versatile talents of AIP contract player Susan Hart. Nicholson provided the story, and is credited as \"James Hartford\". He hired Robert Kaufman to write the first draft. Director Norman Taurog hired Elwood Ullman to do a rewrite, and Taurog remained intimately involved with the content. Deke Heyward later claimed, without substantiation, that he completely rewrote Robert Kaufman's script.The original title was announced as Dr Goldfoot and the Sex Machine, and the film was to be directed by William Asher. Taurog shortly thereafter assumed the helm as director, and Dwayne Hickman joined the cast. Filming began in late summer 1965, with one of AIP's largest-ever budgets. It was the first AIP movie to cost over a million dollars.Vincent Price stated in a 1987 interview with David Del Valle that the original script was a camp musical, comparing it to Little Shop of Horrors. Price stated, \"It could have been fun, but they cut all the music out\", though it is not clear whether the footage was actually shot or the idea was abandoned during production. According to Susan Hart:\n\nOne of the best scenes I've seen on film was Vincent Price singing about the bikini machine – it was excellent. And I was told it was taken out because Sam Arkoff thought that Vincent Price looked too fey. But his character was fey! By taking that particular scene out, I believe they took the explanation and the meat out of that picture... It was a really unique explanatory scene and Vincent Price was beautiful in it, right on the money.\nAccording to Norman Taurog's biographer:\n\nThe original plan had been to follow the AIP formula and have songs integrated throughout the film, but Norman brought in Elwood Ullman to do a rewrite ... and the final script read like a good-natured spoof on the James Bond films with no songs. This apparently disappointed Vincent Price, who had been looking forward to singing.\n\nShooting\nThe film is notable for its scenic photography of San Francisco. The streetcar scene was filmed at the West Portal tunnel. Filming went for over 30 days, taking place on location in San Francisco and on the backlots at the Producers Studio and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios. The day after the company returned from San Francisco, rioting broke out in Watts in South Los Angeles. On August 30, the unit moved to MGM Studios Lot 2 to shoot on their \"New York Street\" set for a couple of days before returning to the Producers Studio.The climactic chase sequence was filmed in the Bay Area. The stuntmen included Carey Loftin, Paul Stader, Troy Melton, Jerry Summers, Ronnie Ron-dell, Bob Harris, Louis Elias, David Sharpe, Harvey Parry, and Bill Hickman.When designing Goldfoot's lair, Daniel Haller re-used some of his designs from 1961's The Pit and the Pendulum.  Stock footage of battleships from another AIP release, Godzilla vs. The Thing appears during the climax.\nSusan Hart's hair was done by Jon Peters.\n\nAccident\nDuring filming in Los Angeles, the city was gripped by a heatwave. Sometimes temperatures on one of the sound stages reached over 100 °F (38 °C) by mid-afternoon. On the afternoon of August 15, 1965, the company was returning from lunch when one of the electricians, Roy Hicks, passed out from the heat and fell to his death from a catwalk.\n\nTheme song\nThe theme song was recorded by The Supremes as a single-sided unreleased promotional single.\n\nReception\nThe film had its premiere at the Golden Gate Theatre in San Francisco, where Nicholson had been a manager. The key cast members embarked on a 30-day tour of 18 cities in 13 countries to promote the film.\n\nBox office\nAccording to Norman Taurog's biographer, the film \"was a moderate success in the United States, but did quite well in Europe, particularly in Italy\".\n\nCritical response\nThe Los Angeles Times said the film \"has enough fresh, amusing gags to make it entertaining... Price is splendid\".\n\nSequel\nAIP Television produced a musical TV special episode promoting Doctor Goldfoot and the Bikini Machine that appeared for one night in temporary place of the ABC scheduled show Shindig! This show, called The Wild Weird World of Dr. Goldfoot, starred Vincent Price, Tommy Kirk and Susan Hart, and featured many songs that may have been cut from the cinema release. Louis M. Heyward and Stanley Ross wrote the 30-minute short comedy musical TV special which aired Nov 18, 1965 on the ABC network.\nIn July 1965, a sequel was announced to be made the following year called Dr. Goldfoot for President, to begin filming on May 14, 1966, for a September 14 release. Vincent Price returned for the 1966 sequel, Dr. Goldfoot and the Girl Bombs, directed by Mario Bava.\n\nSee also\nList of American films of 1965\nPassage 5:\nZana Briski\nZana Briski (born 25 October 1966) is a British photographer and filmmaker, best known for Born into Brothels, the 2004 Oscar winner of the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature, which she directed. She founded Kids with Cameras, a non-profit organization that teaches the art of photography to marginalized children in communities throughout the world. Her interest in photography began at age 10.After earning a master's degree at the University of Cambridge, she studied documentary photography at International Center of Photography in New York. In 1995, she made her first trip to India, producing a story on female infanticide. In 1997, Briski returned to India and began her project on the prostitutes of Calcutta's red-light district, which led to her work with the children of prostitutes.Her latest project Reverence is an experiential multimedia exhibit about transformation. Inspired by dreams of a praying mantis, she was led around the world to collaborate with living insects, taking their portraits in photographs and film. \"My work is a tribute to insects, to their intelligence, personality and elegant beauty,\" she says. The project raised initial funds through the crowdsourcing site Kickstarter in 2010.\nBriski has won numerous awards and fellowships including the Open Society Institute Fellowship, the Alicia Patterson Journalism Fellowship in 2000 to research and photograph in the Brothels of India, a New York Foundation for the Arts Fellowship, the Howard Chapnick Grant and 1st Prize in 1999 in the World Press Photo foundation competition in the category \"Daily Life stories\". Briski and co-director Ross Kauffman were awarded grants from the Sundance Institute, the Jerome Foundation, and the New York State Council on the Arts for Born into Brothels.\nPassage 6:\nDr Victor\nVictor Khojane, better known as Dr Victor or Dr Vic, is a reggae and R&B musician, who was born in Kimberley, South Africa.\n\nCareer\nKhojane began playing when he was a student, in a band called CC Beat, mainly influenced by afropop stars such as Blondie and Papa, Harare Mambo Band and Jonathan Butler, as well as some Afro-American acts (mainly the Jackson Five). In 1984, CC Beat began playing nightclubs in Johannesburg; at the time, they managed to sign with label CCP Records (an affiliate of EMI), but the contract was later dismissed. Another label, Dephon Records, put them under contract shortly thereafter. CC Beat changed their name to 'Taxi' and did sessions for Lucky Dube and other bands.\nIn 1991, the band changed label again, signing for independent label CSR. They recorded their first album, an Eddy Grant tribute entitled The Rasta Rebels. This work was highly successful, to the point that they decided to change the name of the band to Rasta Rebels. At about the same time, Khojane adopted the pseudonym Dr Victor.\nDr Victor then recorded a few solo albums, such as Badayo, Hello Afrika, and One Goal, One Wish. All these works were quite successful in South Africa, and Dr Victor was invited to open for international stars such as Paul Simon, Gloria Estefan and Janet Jackson. In 1997, Dr Victor's album Faya was his first work to get international attention, selling well in France, Mexico, Japan and the Middle East.\nAt the end of the 1990s, Dr Victor reunited the Rasta Rebels, and a collection, The Best of the Rasta Rebels with one unreleased track, \"I Love to Truck\", was released. Both the collection and the new song, published as a single, sold well. In the following years, Dr Victor has alternated solo productions (such as Sunshine Daze in 2003 and If You Wanna Be Happy in 2004) and Rasta Rebels albums (When Somebody Loves You Back, 2006).\n\nDiscography\nThe Rasta Rebels (1991)\nBadayo\nHello Afrika\nFaya (1997)\nThe Best of the Rasta Rebels (raccolta)\nStress (2000)\nSunshine Daze (2003)\nIf You Wanna Be Happy (2004)\nWhen Somebody Loves You Back (2006), Electromode\nPassage 7:\nMicheline Bernardini\nMicheline Bernardini (born 1 December 1927) is a French former nude dancer at the Casino de Paris who agreed to model, on 5 July 1946, Louis Réard's two-piece swimsuit, which he called the bikini, named four days after the first test of an American nuclear weapon at the Bikini Atoll.\n\nRéard's bikini\nDesigner Louis Réard could not find a runway model willing to showcase his revealing design for a two-piece swimsuit. Risqué for its time, it exposed the wearer's navel and much of her buttocks. He hired Bernardini, an 18-year-old nude dancer from the Casino de Paris, as his model. He introduced his design, a two-piece swimsuit with a g-string back made out of 30 square inches (194 cm2) of cloth with newspaper type pattern, which he called a bikini, at a press conference at the Piscine Molitor, a popular public pool in Paris in July 1946.Photographs of Bernardini and articles about the event were widely carried by the press. The International Herald Tribune alone ran nine stories on the event. The bikini was a hit, especially among men, and Bernardini received over 50,000 fan letters.\n\nLater life\nBernardini later moved to Australia. She appeared from 1948 to 1958 in a number of revues at the Tivoli Theatre, Melbourne.  Footage of her 1946 modeling appearance was featured in an episode of the reality television series Love Lust titled The Bikini, in 2011.Bernardini posed at age 58 in a bikini for photographer Peter Turnley, in 1986.\nPassage 8:\nDr. Goldfoot and the Girl Bombs\nDr. Goldfoot and the Girl Bombs (Italian: Le spie vengono dal semifreddo, lit. \"The spies who came in from the cool\") is a 1966 Eurospy comedy film, made in Technicolor and directed by Mario Bava. Serving as a sequel to two unrelated films, Dr. Goldfoot and the Bikini Machine and Two Mafiosi Against Goldginger, the film stars Vincent Price, Fabian, Francesco Mulé, Laura Antonelli, and the Italian comic duo Franco and Ciccio.The film was shot in Italy by cinematographer Antonio Rinaldi, and released in both English and Italian versions. The Italian release is markedly different from the English-language edition, with more screen time spent on the antics of Franco and Ciccio, and less on Vincent Price and the other cast members. Additionally, the film's Italian title is entirely different, spoofing the 1965 film The Spy Who Came in from the Cold.\n\nPlot\nPrice plays the titular mad scientist who is working with the Chinese government to use exploding female robots to disrupt a scheduled NATO war-game by blowing up the various generals involved in the exercise (one of whom looks exactly like Goldfoot, and whom Goldfoot later impersonates). Fabian is the hero who works to thwart the plot, that is, when he is not busy chasing women such as Laura Antonelli's character. The film ends with an extended frantic chase through the streets of Rome, and Goldfoot attempting to start World War III between Russia and the United States by dropping a nuclear bomb on Moscow.\n\nCast\nProduction\nDevelopment\nFulvio Lucisano, the head of Italian International Film, wanted to make a sequel to the Franco and Ciccio film Two Mafiosi Against Goldginger. American International Pictures agreed to co-finance, provided it could be turned into a sequel to Dr. Goldfoot and the Bikini Machine.To satisfy the multinational financial backers, two versions of the film were eventually produced: the Italian version places greater emphasis on Franco and Ciccio, while the American film puts forward Vincent Price's Goldfoot.Mario Bava was signed to direct. He had no interest in the film but was hired because Lucisano had him under contract, and he did not participate in the post-production phase of the American version.AIP's executive supervising the shoot was Louis M. Heyward who had worked with Bava on Planet of the Vampires.\n\nCasting\nFrankie Avalon was originally intended to reprise his role as Craig Gamble from the first film, but he pulled out due to the impending birth of his third child, and Fabian Forte was cast in his place. Fabian said Jim Nicholson of AIP came to him and said \"Frankie's having another baby and wants to stay at home... and we have this picture shooting in Italy... [he] was so sweet about it\".At one stage, the film was titled Dr. Goldfoot and the Love Bomb (a reference to How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb, the strapline of Dr. Strangelove), and Dr. Goldfoot and the S Bomb (a tongue-in-cheek reference to the phrase \"sex bomb\").\n\nFilming\nFilming started in April 1966 and took place in Rome, mostly at Cinecitta Studios but also such locations as Parco di Principe, the Rome Cavalieri Hilton, and Luna Park.Louis M. Heyward estimates the script was rewritten about nine times just prior to production and says there were difficulties satisfying the Italian and American backers; some different scenes were shot for each country, including emphasising brunettes in the Italian version and blondes in the American version.Heyward later said: \"We had one person speaking Portuguese, several of them speaking Italian. Vincent would shake his head in disbelief and say 'What is happening to me?' Not only did he not understand the Italians or the Portuguese or the Spanish; he didn't understand Fabian\".When Price was asked about working with Bava he said: \"I don't know what happened on the one we did together but perhaps it was not his fault\".Bava made a cameo as an angel.\n\nReception\nTwo versions of the film were released, one in Italy which emphasized the Italian stars and relegated Price to a \"guest star\". The American version focused on Goldfoot/Price and was re-edited by Ronald Sinclair, re-scored, and re-written in the dubbing, all without Bava's input. Tim Lucas says the Italian version was \"the far more entertaining\" but \"aside from some charmingly naive special effects\" which Bava supervised the movie \"cannot really be considered a Mario Bava film\".The film was not particularly successful, and is considered by many critics to be director Bava's worst film.Samuel Z. Arkoff said that the film's commercial reception was hurt by the refusal of female lead Laura Antonelli to take her clothes off. Arkoff claims she was originally willing to, but then his nephew, Ted Rusoff, who was sent to supervise the film, developed a crush on her and persuaded her not to do it.Price later called the film \"the most dreadful movie I've ever been in. Just about everything that could go wrong, did\".Fabian said \"I hid in the back seat of my car at the drive in when I went to go see it\".\n\nBibliography\nBlake, Matt; Deal, David (2004).

From 1920 to 1968, Taurog directed 180 films. At the age of 32, he received the Academy Award for Best Director for Skippy (1931). He is the second youngest person ever to win the award after Damien Chazelle, who won for La La Land in 2017. He was later nominated for Best Director for the film Boys Town (1938). He directed some of the best-known actors of the twentieth century, including his nephew Jackie Cooper, Spencer Tracy, Mickey Rooney, Judy Garland, Deanna Durbin, Fred Astaire, Gene Kelly, Deborah Kerr, Peter Lawford, Dean Martin, Jerry Lewis, and Elvis Presley. Taurog directed six Martin and Lewis films, and nine Elvis Presley films, more than any other director.\nFor his contribution to the motion picture industry, Taurog has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1600 Vine Street.\n\nEarly life\nNorman Taurog was born February 23, 1899, in Chicago, Illinois, to Jewish parents Arthur Jack Taurog and Anita (originally \"Annie\") Taurog (née Goldsmith).  His father's naturalization records claim that Arthur was born in the Russian Empire in 1872 or 1873 and naturalized as a minor, while his mother was from New York. Later census records claimed that Arthur's parents were from Germany, and Anita's were from England. The couple were married in Chicago in 1896.\nNorman became a child performer on the stage at an early age, making his movie debut at the age of 13 in the short film Tangled Relations, produced by Thomas Ince's studios. In the eight years until his next screen credit, he worked in theater, mostly off-Broadway.\n\nFilm career\nIn 1919, Taurog returned to the film industry as a director, collaborating with Larry Semon in The Sportsman (1920). In the coming decade, he made 42 silent films, mostly shorts. During this time, he developed his style, his forte being light comedy although he could also deal with drama and maintain complex narratives. In early 1928, he directed his first feature-length film, The Ghetto starring George Jessel, which was expanded in late 1928 with musical and dialogue portions directed by Charles C. Wilson for eventual release as Lucky Boy (1929).\nIn 1931, Taurog made his breakthrough, directing Skippy, for which he won an Academy Award for Best Director. In February 2012, Taurog's Oscar award statue sold for $301,973 at an auction in Beverly Hills.  Taurog's nephew Jackie Cooper was also nominated for his acting performance; in his 1981 autobiography Please Don't Shoot My Dog, Cooper wrote that during Skippy's filming, Cooper could not cry on cue in a movie scene. Taurog then had a studio security guard pretend to shoot Cooper's dog behind a prop wall, to make the child actor cry. (While this autobiography was being written, attempts were made by Cooper's editor to get Taurog's version of events; Taurog declined to participate.) Skippy tells of the adventures of the eponymous hero, his antics and adventures with his friend Sooky as they try to come up with a license for Sooky's dog, save his shantytown from demolition, sell lemonade and save for a new bike.  Based on a popular comic strip character, its sentiment, comedy and moral didacticism (common with movies of the time), added to a gritty realism made it a huge success, so much so that the studio immediately scheduled a sequel, Sooky, for the following year.\nThe next few years saw Taurog enter the third chapter of his career, as an established director who could work in a number of genres. He directed a series of well-received films, including If I Had a Million (1932), which showed his ability to work with an all-star cast—Gary Cooper, George Raft, Charles Laughton, and W. C. Fields. In 1934, he directed We're Not Dressing, starring Bing Crosby, Carole Lombard, George Burns, Gracie Allen, and Ray Milland. In 1935, he directed the star-studded musical showcase The Big Broadcast of 1936 starring Bing Crosby and George Burns and Gracie Allen.\nIn 1938, Taurog brought all his skill and experience to bear with one of the liveliest and most successful adaptations of classic literature; The Adventures of Tom Sawyer was an artistic and commercial triumph.  The year also brought Boys Town, showing Taurog to be more than capable of sustaining a dramatic narrative and earning him another Academy Award nomination.  It wasn't all success, though. Lucky Night (1939) starring Myrna Loy and Robert Taylor was a turkey, and while Taurog shot test scenes for 1939's cinematic extravaganza The Wizard of Oz, Victor Fleming was chosen to direct. Taurog was reassigned to work on The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, a change which he had little to no say in. However, Taurog went on to earn a Best Director nomination for Boys Town later that year, despite losing out on directing Oz. He did, however, helm the last of MGM's big pre-war musical showcases, 1940's Broadway Melody, starring Fred Astaire and Eleanor Powell.  He expanded his range into biographies, working with Mickey Rooney again, in the well-received Young Tom Edison (1940).  He directed Judy Garland three times in the early 1940s, in Little Nellie Kelly (1940), the 'small-town-girl-gets-big-break' Presenting Lily Mars (1943), and the Gershwin musical Girl Crazy (1943).After directing re-takes for a wartime propaganda film, Rationing (1944), Taurog entered new territory with a docudrama of the atom bomb, The Beginning or the End (1947). It was back to his metier of light comedy for his next couple of outings, The Bride Goes Wild with Van Johnson and June Allyson, and Big City, both in 1948. Remarkably, he also directed a third film that year combining the genres of comedy, drama and biography and dealing with an all-star cast; Words and Music was a fictionalized biopic of the relationship between Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart.  It starred, among others, Judy Garland, Gene Kelly, Mickey Rooney and Cyd Charisse. By now, Taurog had established a reputation as a director who was comfortable working in the musical and comedy genre, and who could be relied upon to work with slight material—qualities which would be useful later in his career.\nDean Martin and Jerry Lewis had been a double-act since 1946 and had made five films together, three Martin and Lewis top-liners, before Taurog directed Jumping Jacks (1952), regarded by many Martin and Lewis fans as the finest of their films. Taurog worked well with the duo and he went on to direct them in The Stooge (1953), The Caddy (1954), Living It Up (1955), You're Never Too Young (1954), and their penultimate film together, Pardners (1956). Taurog worked with Lewis alone twice more, in Don't Give Up the Ship (1959) and Visit to a Small Planet (1960).\nIn 1960, Taurog directed his first Elvis Presley film, G.I. Blues. This was a turning point for Elvis. Up until then, he had harbored ambitions of being a James Dean figure, playing brooding rebel roles in Loving You (1957), Jailhouse Rock (1957), and King Creole (1958). However, Colonel Tom Parker had different plans for the singer. G.I. Blues was Elvis's first film in two years, following his return from the army, and would set the tone for future films—a few girls, a few adventures, and a few songs along the way with weak plots and uninspired acting. When well-made, this was an entertaining, light-hearted formula and Taurog, now in his sixties, was an old hand at it. So impressed was Parker with his work that over the next eight years, Taurog directed Elvis in eight more films: Blue Hawaii (1961), Girls! Girls! Girls! (1962), It Happened at the World's Fair (1963), Tickle Me (1965), Spinout (1966), Double Trouble (1967), Speedway (1968), and Live a Little, Love a Little (1968).  Although some were better than others—and some were almost identical—Taurog ensured that the films had pace, the comedy was delivered well, and the songs were well executed. Live a Little, Love a Little was his last film.\n\nLater years\nIn 1968, Taurog retired from directing. He later taught at the University of Southern California School of Cinema and remained a board member of the Directors Guild of America. He owned a camera shop in Canoga Park, California.\nToward the end of his life, he became blind. In his last years, he served as director of the Braille Institute in Los Angeles.\nTaurog died on April 7, 1981, in Palm Desert, California, at the age of 82. His ashes were scattered into the Pacific Ocean.\nTaurog has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1600 Vine Street for his contribution to the motion picture industry.\nTaurog supported Barry Goldwater in the 1964 United States presidential election.\n\nAwards and nominations\n1931 Academy Award for Best Director (Skippy)\n1938 Venice Film Festival Mussolini Cup for Best Film (The Adventures of Tom Sawyer)\n1939 Academy Award Nomination for Best Director (Boys Town)\n1960 Star on the Walk of Fame for Motion Pictures, dedicated on February 8, 1960, at 1600 Vine Street\n1966 Laurel Award Nomination for Director, fourth place\n1967 Laurel Award Nomination for Director, fifth place\n1968 Laurel Award Nomination for Director, eighth place\n\nFilmography\nFrom 1920 to 1968, Taurog directed 180 films.

He spent $16,000 of his own money to prepare a visual presentation of the film and arranged for a script for be written by Sidney Carroll. During the course of research he discovered that the book was not based on a true story although it was inspired by the Aaron Burr conspiracy.He eventually succeeded in getting sponsorship from Eastman Kodak.\"Casting was so essential,\" said Rosemont. \"We had to find an actor who could age 60 years on screen. The makeup was the easiest. Making him look young was the hardest.\"Rosemont approached Cliff Robertson, although the actor had not done television for years. \"But when he saw our research it turned him on.\" he said. \"It's a dream part for an actor.\"Cliff Robertson signed to make the film in August 1972 and filming began in September. \"We had to change our schedule to fit Cliff's,\" said Rosemont. \"It cost me a lot of money but it was worth it.\"Filming took place in Mystic, Connecticut, Newport, Rhode Island and Fort Niagara, New York.Director Delbert Mann says Robertson was \"very difficult to work with\" on the film. He gave an instance where Robertson kept emphasising the word \"United\" when referring to the \"United States\" (\"he thought the young people would reject the patriotism aspects\"). \"We went for about 20 takes, he never changed it, but he modified it on the last take, which we used in the picture. He still wouldn't change it in post-production dubbing. It was a matter of taking the best take we had and going with it.\"Filming was expensive. \"I do my own work,\" said Rosemont. \"If there's a deficit I pay for it. My money is on the line. I put it on screen. Hopefully it will enjoy many repeats; it's an ageless story, a potential TV perennial.\"\n\nLocations\nIn the summer of 1972, the replica of HMS Rose (later renamed HMS Surprise for another film) was hired for the film, a made-for-television production. Norman Rosemont Productions was unable to find the money to take the ship out sailing, so all the filming was shot with sails set, as the ship was securely moored to the pier, next to the causeway to Goat Island. During filming Cliff Robertson had to hide that he had a broken leg at the time.\n\nReception\nMann said, \"The end result was fascinating. The older audience took to the picture and the critics were marvelous. People saying, look at the unfeeling government, crushing this man. The young people got what they wanted and others saw it as love of country. We had it both ways.\"\n\nAwards\nThe film was nominated for Best Cinematography for Entertainment Programming – For a Special or Feature Length Program Made for Television at the 26th Primetime Emmy Awards.\nPassage 2:\nNick Stahl\nNicolas Kent Stahl (born December 5, 1979) is an American actor. Starting out as a child actor, he gained recognition for his performance in the 1993 film The Man Without a Face, co-starring Mel Gibson. \nHe later transitioned into his adult career with roles in the films Disturbing Behavior, The Thin Red Line, In the Bedroom, Bully, Sin City, and Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines in the role of John Connor, as well as on the HBO series Carnivàle in the role of Ben Hawkins. He also starred as Jason Riley on the AMC television series Fear the Walking Dead. In April 2023, he starred as Lucas on the Hulu television series Tiny Beautiful Things.\n\nEarly life\nStahl was born in Harlingen, Texas, the son of Donna Lynn (née Reed), a brokerage assistant, and William Kent Stahl, a businessman. He was raised in Dallas along with his two sisters by his mother, who struggled to make ends meet.\n\nCareer\nHis first professional casting was in Stranger at My Door (1991), although he had been acting in children's plays since he was four years old. The 1993 film The Man Without a Face, co-starring Mel Gibson, helped boost his career at the age of 13. The following year, he had a supporting role in the ensemble film Safe Passage. In 1996, he played the role of Puck in Benjamin Britten's opera A Midsummer Night's Dream at The Metropolitan Opera in New York. In 1998 he played a doomed young soldier during the World War II Pacific War in The Thin Red Line. He scored critical and box office success again with his role in the 2001 movie In the Bedroom, which starred Sissy Spacek as his mother. He scored another box office hit in Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (2003) as John Connor (replacing Edward Furlong from Terminator 2: Judgment Day), co-starring with Arnold Schwarzenegger and Claire Danes. In 2003, he starred in the HBO series Carnivàle, which drew a loyal audience as well as rave reviews. The show lasted two seasons, ending in 2006.\nStahl has played two villains to good reviews: Bobby Kent in the film Bully (2001) and Roark Jr./Yellow Bastard in Sin City (2005). Stahl did not reprise his role as John Connor in Terminator Salvation with Christian Bale taking over instead. Stahl noted the film's concept as \"a jump to the future, so [John Connor] will be quite a bit older.\" Other roles included How to Rob a Bank (2007), Sleepwalking (2008), and Quid Pro Quo (2008).\nIn 2010, Stahl starred as Max Matheson in Mirrors 2, the sequel to Mirrors, directed by Victor Garcia and penned by Matt Venne. Among his more recent films are On the Inside (2010) and Afghan Luke (2011), and Away from Here (2014).\nIn 2019, Stahl portrayed serial killer Glen Edward Rogers in The Murder of Nicole Brown Simpson. Filming commenced over the summer in 2018 and the film was released in the UK on December 9, 2019.\nAlso in 2019, Stahl appeared in The Lumineers’ short film, III, which is based on their new album. Stahl played the character Jimmy Sparks, who is a father and gambling addict.\nIn November 2021, The Hollywood Reporter reported that Stahl would star alongside Sean Bean and Famke Janssen in the film Knights of the Zodiac, a live-action adaptation of the Saint Seiya manga series. The film will be released on May 12, 2023.In April 2023, he starred as Lucas on the Hulu television series Tiny Beautiful Things, opposite Kathryn Hahn.\n\nPersonal life\nStahl married actress Rose Murphy in June 2009. They have a daughter, Marlo, born in 2010. They separated in 2012.In May 2012, Stahl's wife reported him missing. It was later reported that Stahl had checked into rehab. On December 27, 2012, Stahl was arrested at an adult film store in Hollywood, California, on suspicion of committing a lewd act. No charges were filed due to insufficient evidence. On June 28, 2013, Stahl was arrested in Hollywood for alleged possession of methamphetamine.In a 2017 interview at the Dallas Comic Show, Stahl stated he had moved to Texas and was taking a leave of absence from acting to concentrate on family and sobriety. Stahl returned to acting in 2018 when filming of The Murder of Nicole Brown Simpson began.\n\nFilmography\nFilm\nTelevision\nMusic videos\nPassage 3:\nErnest C. Warde\nErnest C.

The film ends with the spirits of Nolan and Anne together with an American flag.\n\nCast\nPassage 5:\nAndrew Laszlo\nAndrew Laszlo A.S.C. Hungarian: László András (January 12, 1926 – October 7, 2011) was a Hungarian-American cinematographer best known for his work on the cult film classic The Warriors. He earned Emmy nominations for The Man Without a Country in 1973 and TV miniseries Shōgun in 1980.\n\nEarly life (1926–1941)\nI never believed I was anybody special. I still don't think so, nor did I ever believe that anyone would give a hoot hearing about who I was, where I came from, what I did at various stages of my life, and why. I am convinced the world would function equally well, or equally badly, with or without me. - Andrew Laszlo, Footnote to History, 2002\nSo begins a section of Andrew Laszlo's recount of his early years and speaks of the man who survived atrocities during that time and accomplished much in his later life.\n\nHe was born László András in 1926 in the vicinity of Pápa, Hungary, the town where his family finally settled about the time that Andrew was three years old. Until World War II began to affect life in Hungary, his life was relatively carefree and was spent in relative comfort although the family had to move several times into smaller or bigger quarters depending on the financial circumstances of his father. He was close to his older brother, Alex, with whom he often dreamed up exciting adventures sometimes leading to catastrophe.\nOf his many early experiences, one that served as a prelude to later tragedies, was seeing the Graf Zeppelin fly over Papa. Inquiring about the symbol painted on the tail of the airship, Andrew's father said that it was a swastika. That is all he wanted to tell his young son at the time.\nAndrew Laszlo was an avid swimmer and skater during his early school years and became accomplished at fencing in high school. It was also during this time that his interest in photography began and led later to a small business printing photos for his classmates.\nIn the late 1930s, Laszlo's father, Leslie (Hungarian: Laci), was called up to serve in the Hungarian Army. This effectively ruined his business, forcing Laszlo to learn the fine art of lampshade manufacture to help support the family. This was a successful undertaking even though Laszlo was still a full-time high school student. Then, as for everyone else, World War II turned everything up-side-down.\n\nThe War Years (1941-1947)\nIn June 1941, the Hungarian city of Kassa (today Košice in Slovakia) was bombed by air. Although several theories are still debated about the real perpetrators, the Hungarian government used the incident as the reason for declaring war on the Soviet Union. From then on, Hungary was irreversibly tied to the Axis Powers and Germany/Hitler in particular. Antisemitism that had been simmering for years now came to the fore in Hungary. In 1944, a part of Papa was turned into a Ghetto and all Jews were forced to move there, including the Laszlo family. In early June, Andrew was forced to join a Labor Camp and was taken there in a railroad cattle car. On June 29, his family (excepting his brother, Alex) was taken from Papa and sent to Auschwitz. Andrew was then taken to another labor camp in what is now Romania and put to work laying railroad track. After one more move to another camp, Andrew received a final postcard from his brother, Alex.\nFollowing an air raid on the labor camp, Andrew deserted and found his way to Budapest. After a short stay in City Park (Hungarian: Varosliget) he and hundreds of others were herded onto boxcars and sent to the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. This was the winter of 1944. Here, he survived for months in an atmosphere of cold, starvation, beatings, outright murder, lice infestation and constant reminders of death. Near his 19th birthday, he spotted his Aunt Alice in the camp. She perished there not much later.\nIn March 1945, with the pressure on the Germans in Norway increasing, Andrew was shipped to the concentration camp at Theresienstadt. Here, like thousands of others, he came down with typhoid fever. It was here that he was reunited with his father, someone he thought of as long dead. Finally, on May 8, 1945, Theresienstadt was liberated by the Soviet army. As part of returning to humanity, Andrew found a piano at the camp and asked his fellow Hungarian, pianist George Feyer, to play for the liberators and the liberated.\nOn his return to Papa, he found the town to be a much different place, including it being run by the Soviet Army. Being entrepreneurial, he restarted his photography business with the Russian soldiers being great customers. After taking the final exam, Andrew got his high school diploma and then moved to Budapest where a job at the Hungarian Film Bureau was waiting for him. Unfortunately, this job was not very exciting and paid little. Andrew realized that it would take years for the Hungarian movie business to return to its former self and did not want to wait that long. So, he went back to Papa and began to plan for his immigration to the United States at the urging of his uncle, George Laszlo, who was already living in New York and was willing to sponsor him. He found his way to New York by way of Ulm, Germany, where he survived by selling American cigarettes (sent to him by Uncle George) to the locals. After a brief but obligatory stop in Frankfurt, Andrew was given the right to enter the United States. He did so on January 17, 1947, by walking down the gangplank of the SS Ernie Pyle after it had docked on the west side of Manhattan. He had turned 21 just five days earlier.\n\nLife and Career in the United States (1947-1996)\nOn arrival, Andrew was taken under the wings of his Uncle, George Laszlo, who was a painter, inventor and lithographer already living in New York City. Andrew quickly adjusted to life in Manhattan. As he stated in his own words for the documentary Cinematographer Style:\n\nMy main objective was to keep my head above water, work and have enough money to live, learn the language, the faster the better, because that was the most essential element in getting work. Most importantly, I was trying to get work that was in some ways connected with photography.\nFor some time I worked in the laboratory of a company that printed textiles and wallpaper with a photographic process. I worked in the darkroom, as I put it, to keep my fingers in the developer. At one time, I worked as a door-to-door baby photographer. I had a camera and a few lights I could do the work with.\nThen the greatest break of my life came. I was the number one person from New York City to be drafted by the army for the Korean War. I wound up in the U.S. Army motion picture school, which was wonderful. We not only had all the equipment, the school insisted we shoot 35mm motion picture film, day-in and day-out, thousands of feet and, of course, doing it is the greatest way to learn.\n\nWhen I came out of the army it was a little bit rough. I was a young fellow, trying to enter the industry, which was very difficult because I had no track record. I tried absolutely everything to get work. In fact, I resorted to gags that nowadays I’m actually a bit self-conscious to talk about. I was turned down by so many producers, even smalltime ones; I couldn’t even get past secretaries. At one point, I sent out hand-printed résumés on sandpaper just so they would remember it. I sent out résumés on shirt cardboard so they couldn’t crumple it up and toss it in the wastebasket. The breaks finally came. I took any job offered to me, as long as I had a chance to be behind a camera, do some lighting, experiment with lenses and so on. Then better jobs were offered and that is how I got started. As I said earlier, the important thing is to stick with it.\nShortly before his discharge from the US Army Signal Corps, Andrew married his New York-born sweetheart, Ann Granger. Soon, the family grew to three with the arrival of his first son, also named Andrew. With perseverance, he landed a job as a camera operator on The Phil Silvers Show. This was followed by a number of other TV shows, including Naked City where he served as the Director of Photography. With greater opportunities came the necessity to work on locations around the world. Resisting the temptation to move to Hollywood, Andrew settled with his family in the suburbs of New York where three more children (Jim, Jeffrey and Elizabeth) arrived in quick succession.\nAndrew started to work with TV personality Ed Sullivan in 1953 and filmed programs in Portugal, Alaska, and Ireland. In 1959, Ed 'kidnapped' Andrew to Havana, Cuba under the pretense that they would be filming a segment in the Dominican Republic. Ed's real goal was to do an interview with Fidel Castro who had just overthrown Fulgencio Batista's government. Ed, unfortunately, did not realize that the electrical system in Cuba would not support the camera equipment and lighting normally used in the United States. This created enormous technical issues for the crew with the possibility that the equipment could cause a blackout in the entire neighborhood. Somehow, the footage turned out OK if only passably so.\nIn 1962, Andrew was offered his first feature film, One Potato, Two Potato, a controversial film about the interracial marriage of a black man and white divorcee. In 1966, he filmed Francis Ford Coppola's You're A Big Boy Now, with Geraldine Page receiving an Oscar nomination as Best Supporting Actress. This was followed in 1968 by The Night They Raided Minsky's, a big-budget musical marred by the mid-production death of Bert Lahr.\nOn August 15, 1965, The Beatles were scheduled to give a concert at Shea Stadium in New York City. Andrew took on this Ed Sullivan production with trepidation and excitement since it would be the first extremely large rock concert to be filmed for television. Even with careful preparation, the film crew was not prepared for the piercing screams of an audience made up of 56,000 teenagers. The sound system was completely overwhelmed, making it necessary to dub much of the song tracks in post-production. Nevertheless, and using 14 cameras scattered through the place, the crew managed to film not just the Beatles but much of the audience in the stands and the security detail that was hoping that a major stampede would not break out. When all was said and done, the crew had recorded over 200,000 feet of film of which only 10,800 made it into the finished documentary. As a long-lasting effect, Andrew's hearing was never to be normal again.\nIn 1979, he filmed Walter Hill's cult film The Warriors. This movie gave Andrew the opportunity to devise several cinematic techniques, including the innovative lighting used for subway car interior shots. Musing in his 2000 book \"Every Frame a Rembrandt,\" he says:\n\nIf made today, The Warriors would probably be an altogether different movie. The availability of fast and more sensitive, more forgiving negative and positive film stocks, faster lenses in all focal ranges, smaller, more powerful lights, electronic postproduction - all would add up to different photographic techniques, which would negate the need for the same ingenuity in dealing with the difficulties of cinematography in 1978.\nReturning to television, Andrew was the cinematographer on the 1980 five-part NBC miniseries Shōgun starring Richard Chamberlain. Filmed entirely on location in Japan, the production had many difficulties including the challenge of conversation with and direction to actors and extras who spoke no English. An unfortunate but funny anecdote often retold by Andrew was the premature kickoff of a fierce action sequence in Osaka harbor including guns blazing, extras jumping into the water, bombs exploding and boats sinking everywhere. Unfortunately, the cameras were not rolling. The whole scene had to be reshot at great cost of time and money. The details of this incident are recalled in Adrew's book \"It's a Wrap.\"His last feature film Newsies, filmed in 1991, was about a newspaper delivery-boy's strike that took place in 1899. The film starred Christian Bale and Robert Duvall. Although the movie was a box-office flop, it gained a cult following and was turned into a stage musical at the Paper Mill Playhouse in New Jersey. It will move to Broadway for a limited run from March to June, 2012.\nWith Newsies in the can, Andrew decide that it was time to change his focus from TV and film production to teaching, fly-fishing, and woodworking.\n\nThe Later Years (1996-2011)\nWith the movie business behind him, Andrew spent his time giving lectures to film students throughout the United States. This gave him the opportunity to write two books about the art and science of cinematography. With a knack for storytelling and a great imagination, Andrew wrote and published several works of fiction. The Rat Catcher was published in 2004. A Fight of No Consequence appeared in 2006 and concerns an ex-fighter trying for a comeback. His experiences in Japan while filming Shogun, let to the writing of the fictional book Banjin\" When not lecturing or writing, Andrew used his time on various wood- and metal-working projects. When visiting his ranch in Montana, he often took advantage of the first-class fly-fishing streams and rivers in the area. Above all else, he enjoyed spending time with his wife, children and grandchildren. After a sudden illness diagnosed mid-year, he died at his home on October 7, 2011, in Bozeman, Montana, age 85.\n\nFeature motion pictures\nTelevision programs\nNote: In some cases the Year represents the date of production, not airing.\nPassage 6:\nEdward Everett Hale\nEdward Everett Hale (April 3, 1822 – June 10, 1909) was an American author, historian, and Unitarian minister, best known for his writings such as \"The Man Without a Country\", published in Atlantic Monthly, in support of the Union during the Civil War. He was the grand-nephew of Nathan Hale, the American spy during the Revolutionary War.\n\nLife and career\nHale was born on April 3, 1822, in Boston, Massachusetts, the son of Nathan Hale (1784–1863), proprietor and editor of the Boston Daily Advertiser, and Sarah Preston Everett; and the brother of Lucretia Peabody Hale, Susan Hale, and Charles Hale. Edward Hale was a nephew of Edward Everett, the orator and statesman, and grand-nephew of Nathan Hale (1755–1776), the Revolutionary War hero executed by the British for espionage. Edward Everett Hale was also a descendant of Richard Everett and related to Helen Keller.\nHale was a child prodigy who exhibited extraordinary literary skills. He graduated from Boston Latin School at age 13 and enrolled at Harvard College immediately after. There, he settled in with the literary set, won two Bowdoin Prizes and was elected the Class Poet. He graduated second in his class in 1839 and then studied at Harvard Divinity School. Decades later, he reflected on the new liberal theology there:\n\nThe group of leaders who surrounded Dr. [William Ellery] Channing had, with him, broken forever from the fetters of Calvinistic theology. These young people were trained to know that human nature is not totally depraved. They were taught that there is nothing of which it is not capable... For such reasons, and many more, the young New Englanders of liberal training rushed into life, certain that the next half century was to see a complete moral revolution in the world.\n\nHale was licensed to preach as a Unitarian minister in 1842 by the Boston Association of Ministers. In 1846 he became pastor of the Church of the Unity in Worcester, Massachusetts. Hale married Emily Baldwin Perkins in 1852; she was the niece of Connecticut Governor and U.S. Senator Roger Sherman Baldwin and Emily Pitkin Perkins Baldwin on her father's side and Lyman Beecher, Harriet Beecher Stowe and Henry Ward Beecher on her mother's side. They had nine children: Alexander, b & d 1853; Ellen Day, 1854–1939; Arthur, 1859–1939;Charles Alexander, 1861–1867;  Edward Everett Jr., 1863–1932; Philip Leslie Hale, 1865–1931; Herbert Dudley, 1866–1908; Henry Kidder, 1868–1876; Robert Beverly, 1869–1895.Hale left the Unity Church in 1856 to become pastor at the South Congregational Church, Boston, where he served until 1899.\nIn 1847 Hale was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society, and he would be involved with the society for the rest of his life, taking up various positions in the service of the society.  He served two non-consecutive terms on its board of councilors, from 1852 to 1854, and a lengthy term from 1858 to 1891, and as recording secretary from 1854 to 1858.  He served as vice-president of the society from 1891 to 1906, served a shorter term as president from 1906 to 1907, then again took up the position of vice-president from 1907 to 1909.Hale first came to notice as a writer in 1859, when he contributed the short story \"My Double and How He Undid Me\" to the Atlantic Monthly. He soon published other stories in the same periodical. His best known work was \"The Man Without a Country\", published in the Atlantic in 1863 and intended to strengthen support for the Union cause in the North. As in some of his other non-romantic tales, he employed a minute realism which led his readers to suppose the narrative a record of fact. These two stories and such others as \"The Rag-Man and the Rag-Woman\" and \"The Skeleton in the Closet\", gave him a prominent position among short-story writers of 19th century America. His short story \"The Brick Moon\", serialized in the Atlantic Monthly, is the first known fictional description of an artificial satellite. It was possibly an influence on the novel The Begum's Fortune by Jules Verne. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1865. In 1870, we was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society.In recognition of his support for the Union during the American Civil War, Hale was elected as a Third Class Companion of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States.\nHale assisted in founding the Christian Examiner, Old and New in 1869 and became its editor. The story \"Ten Times One is Ten\" (1870), with its hero Harry Wadsworth, contained the motto, first enunciated in 1869 in his Lowell Institute lectures: \"Look up and not down, look forward and not back, look out and not in, and lend a hand.\"  This motto was the basis for the formation of Lend-a-Hand Clubs, Look-up Legions and Harry Wadsworth Clubs for young people. Out of the romantic Waldensian story \"In His Name\" (1873) there similarly grew several other organizations for religious work, such as King's Daughters, and King's Sons. In 1875, the Christian Examiner merged with Scribner's Magazine. In 1881, Hale published the story \"Hands Off\" in Harper's New Monthly Magazine. In the tale, a narrator goes through time to alter events in the past, thereby creating an alternate timeline. Paul J. Nahin writes that this story makes Hale a pioneer in emerging science fiction, time travel, and stories about changing the past.In the early 1880s Harriet E. \"Hattie\" Freeman became one of Hale's volunteer secretaries. Her family had been connected with Hale's church since 1861. As Hattie and Hale worked together they grew closer and closer. According to historian Sara Day, their relationship became loving and intimate. Day came to this conclusion after studying 3,000 Hale-Freeman love letters (1884–1909) held by the Library of Congress. The letters, donated to the library in 1969, had held their secrets until 2006 when Day realized that the intimate passages were written in Towndrow's shorthand.In 1886, Hale founded Lend a Hand, which merged with the Charities Review in 1897, and the Lend a Hand Record. Throughout his life he contributed many articles on a variety of subjects to the periodicals of his day including the North American Review, the Atlantic Monthly, the Christian Register, the Outlook, and many more. He was the author or editor of more than sixty books—fiction, travel, sermons, biography and history.Hale retired as minister from the South Congregational Church in 1899 and chose as his successor Edward Cummings, father of E. E. Cummings. By the turn of the century, Hale was recognized as among the nation's most important men of letters. Bostonians asked him to help ring in the new century on December 31, 1900, by presenting a psalm on the balcony of the Massachusetts State House.In 1903 he became Chaplain of the United States Senate, and joined the Literary Society of Washington. The next year, he was elected as a member of the Academy of Arts and Sciences.\nHale lived from 1869 to his death at the Edward Everett Hale House in Roxbury.\nHe maintained a summer home in South Kingstown, Rhode Island where he and his family often spent summer months.\nHale died in Roxbury, by then part of Boston, in 1909. He was buried at Forest Hills Cemetery in Jamaica Plain, Suffolk County, Massachusetts. A life-size likeness in bronze statue memorializing the man and his works stands in the Boston Public Garden.\n\nBeliefs\nCombining a forceful personality, organizing genius, and liberal practical theology, Hale was active in raising the tone of American life for half a century. He had a deep interest in the anti-slavery movement (especially in Kansas), as well as popular education (involving himself especially with the Chautauqua adult-education movement), and the working-man's home.\nHe published a wide variety of works in fiction, history and biography. He used his writings and the two magazines he founded, Old and New (1870–75) and Lend a Hand (1886–97), to advance a number of social reforms, including religious tolerance, the abolition of slavery and wider education. Writer-educator Mary Lowe Dickinson served as Hale's associate editor for Lend a Hand.Hale supported Irish immigration in the mid-19th century, as he felt the new workers freed Americans from performing menial, hard labor. In a series of letters in the Boston Daily Advertiser, he noted the \"inferiority\" of immigrants: \"[it] compels them to go the bottom; and the consequence is that we are, all of us, the higher lifted.\"Edward Everett Hale's story \"The Man Without a Country\" (1863) opened with the sentence: \"I was stranded at the old Mission House in Mackinaw, waiting for a Lake Superior steamer which did not choose to come.\" In his 1893 and 1900 reminiscences, Hale states that 'To write the story of \"The Man Without a Country\" and its sequel, \"Philip Nolan's Friends,\" I had to make as careful a study as I could of the history of the acquisition of Louisiana by the United States.'\n\nSee also\nInternational Order of the King's Daughters and Sons\nPassage 7:\nTheodred II (Bishop of Elmham)\nTheodred II was a medieval Bishop of Elmham.\nThe date of Theodred's consecration unknown, but the date of his death was sometime between 995 and 997.\nPassage 8:\nThe Man Without a Country (1917 film)\nThe Man Without a Country is a 1917 American silent film adaptation of Edward Everett Hale's short story The Man Without a Country. It was directed by Ernest C. Warde, and starred Florence La Badie, Holmes Herbert, and J. H. Gilmour, and released by Thanhouser Film Corporation.The film follows closely to the storyline of the book, and was a success in film theaters. The original story, with its strong patriotic theme, was written during the American Civil War in order to increase public support for the Union cause. The film had a like function with regard to the First World War, which the United States had joined a few months prior to the film's release.\nThe film was released on September 9, 1917, and was the last film role of Florence La Badie, who would die in October 1917 from injuries sustained in an automobile crash in August 1917, just days before the film's premiere.\n\nPlot\nAs described in a film magazine, Barbara Norton (La Badie) and her brother Tom (Marlo), orphaned children of a veteran who gave his life for his country, go to live with their uncle Phineas (Howard) and aunt (Hastings) in the city. It is just before the entrance of the United States into the European war and the uncle is a pacifist. He holds meetings at home where Barbara assists him. Barbara's brother is a loyal American and is greatly troubled by the uncle's expectations to count on him. Barbara meets John Alton (Herbert), who wins her promise to be his wife. They are very happy until war is declared and Barbara cannot bear the thought of her future husband not doing service for his country. His \"Peace at Any Price\" button is the last straw and she gives him a choice of either joining the \"colors\" or breaking the engagement. John declares that he is a true pacifist and Barbara, believing that a man who cannot support his country is that country's enemy, breaks the engagement publicly. Her fiance becomes very unpopular at his club because of his views and is taken to task by one of his father's friends. Having lost Barbara and his popularity makes him resent the constant references to the United States and his debt to his country, and he curses his native land. Barbara enlists as a Red Cross nurse and her brother as a soldier. Later, an old friend of John's family, Pop Milton (Dundan), gives him a copy of The Man Without a Country and asks him to read it and rise above his treasonous views. He does so, and as he reads the immortal story the patriotic spirit of Barbara comes to him in a vision of Columbia who tells him that in a previous life he was the Philip Nolan of the story. She takes him back to historic times and shows him a succession of scenes from the book. The man of today sees with horror the famous court martial in which he was sentenced to never hear of the United States again, the tragedy of the careful carrying out of the sentence, and the pitiful death of the man, made easier by the humanity of Captain Danforth (Gilmour), who gives him a brief history of the land he learns to bless before he dies. John's spirit returns from the allegorical journey and he responds to the new and vigorous manhood within and enlists at once, thereby winning Barbara, who was at home on sick leave from her nursing work in France.\n\nCast\nFlorence La Badie as Barbara Norton\nHolmes Herbert as John Alton / Lt.

It is based on the short story The Man Without a Country by Edward Everett Hale. It was distributed by Metro Pictures.\nThe original story, with its strong patriotic theme, was written during the American Civil War in order to increase public support for the Union cause; the film had a like function with regard to World War I, in which the United States was deeply involved at the time.\n\nPlot\nAs described in a film magazine, Philip Noloan (Daly) is a young American who entertains pacifist views about the American entry into World War I because of his selfish desire to maintain his own comfort. His father, to arouse his duty to his country, tells him the tragic story of his ancestor the first Philip Nolan's (Daly) treason by relating the incidents from the story The Man Without a Country. His father then tells of incidents from the American Civil War where a later ancestor, also named Philip Nolan (Daly), did all he could to wipe the stain of that treason from the family name. At the conclusion, Philip has become so thrilled by the great deeds of his family that he rises to the occasion and offers his services to his country to make the world safe for democracy.\n\nCast\nReception\nLike many American films of the time, My Own United States was subject to cuts by city and state film censorship boards.

{"input": "Who is the mother-in-law of Queen Insun?", "context": "Passage 1:\nMaria Thins\nMaria Thins (c. 1593 – 27 December 1680) was the mother-in-law of Johannes Vermeer and a member of the Gouda Thins family. She was raised in a devout Dutch Catholic family with two sisters and a brother. Outliving her parents and siblings, she received inheritances over the years, making her a wealthy woman. She married a prosperous brickmaker, Reynier Bolnes, in 1622. They had three children together, Catharina, Willem, and Cornelia. By 1635, Bolnes verbally and physically abused his wife and daughters. Thins moved to Delft with her daughters. Her son Willem stayed with his father. Thins was a wealthy woman due to the separation settlement of her husband in 1649 and the estates she inherited from her family. \nHer daughter Catharina married Johannes Vermeer, an artist, art dealer, and operator of the family's inn in Delft. Vermeer and Catharina lived at Thins house by 1660. The couple had fifteen children, four of whom died in infancy. Raising nearly a dozen children strained Vermeer financially. He relied on the support from his mother-in-law. During the Franco-Dutch War (1672–1674), Vermeer became impoverished. Thins reduced the money she provided to Catharina and her husband due to the loss of income during that period. Vermeer died in 1675, and Thins died five years later. Catharina was the only one of Thins' children to survive her. Thins drew up her will to maximize what she could provide for her grandchildren and their education, while limiting how much might be taken by Catharina's creditors. Catharina died in 1687.\n\nEarly life\nMaria was born c. 1593 in Gouda to a prominent Dutch Catholic family, Catharina van Hensbeeck (d. 1633) and William Thin (d. 1601). They lived in the house named De Trapjes (The Little Steps) in Gouda. Maria had three siblings, none of whom were married. Her sister Elisabeth became a nun. She also had a sister Cornelia and a brother Jan. Since none of her siblings married, Thins ultimately inherited a large estate. The family conducted mass in their home, while at the time it was illegal for a group of Roman Catholics to assemble in Gouda. The local sheriffs broke up a religious meeting at their house in 1619.Garrit Camerling (d. 1627) of Delft became her stepfather in 1605 when he married Catharina van Hensbeeck. She was related to Abraham Bloemaert (1566–1651) through her cousin Jan Geensz Thins. Before her marriage, Thins lived in Delft with a prosperous young woman who was her friend.\n\nMarriage and children\nIn 1622, Maria Thins married Reynier Bolnes (ca. 1593–1676), a prominent and prosperous brickmaker. Thins was an heiress when she married, and she collected art, including several in the style of Utrecht Caravaggists.\n\nChildren\nThins had three children, the youngest of whom was Catharina Bolnes (c. 1631–1688), nicknamed Trijntge. She also had a son Willem, and a daughter Cornelia. Around 1635, Reynier became verbally and physically abusive with her and her children. At the age of nine, Catharina ran to neighbors because she thought that Reynier's abuse of Cornelia could kill her. Reynier confessed that he physically abused Cornelia and would do it again if Thins beat their son Willem. Reynier and Willem began eating separately from the female members of the family, and the father encouraged his son to be abusive and noncompliant with Thins.\n\nDivided family\nThins moved to Delft in 1642 to get away from her abusive husband. Jan Geensz Thins, who was her guardian and cousin, purchased a home for her there the prior year. Jan became Thin's guardian following the early death of her father. Thins attained custody of her daughters in 1641 and moved with them to Delft. William stayed with his father, whose business began to fail. Thins lived on Oude Langendijk next to the Jesuit Catholic Church in the Catholic section of Delft called paepenhoek (the Papists' Corner).Thins received half of her husband's assets, a substantial amount, in 1649. By 1653, Reynier Bolnes was bankrupt. Thins derived income from annuities, interest income, and property rentals, including farmland. She also lived off of the capital of her investments. Thins and her sister Cornelia Thins (d. 1661) received a sizeable inheritance from their brother Jan Willemsz Thins following his death in 1651. Thins attained a comfortable standard of living of 15,000 or more guilders a year in the 1660s.Cornelia died in 1649. In 1664, Thin's son Willem, a jobless bachelor, was locked up in an institution after an argument with his mother, and for attacking Catharina, his pregnant sister, with a stick. In 1665, Maria Thins was entrusted with her son's property. She wrote a will, which limited Willem's share to the legal minimum of one sixth of her estate. She mentioned that he had been calling her names since his youth. Willem died in 1676.\n\nThe Vermeers\nThin's daughter, Catharina, came to know Johannes Vermeer and wished to marry him. Her mother disapproved of the marriage because he was not Catholic, and also likely because he was of a lower artisan class. By 1652, Vermeer helped his mother run the family's inn and was an art dealer, taking over his deceased father's business. Before they married, Thins stated that although she did not approve, she would not prevent Catharina and Vermeer from marrying. Vermeer likely converted from Reformed Protestant to Catholicism by the time of their union. Catharina and Vermeer married in Schipluy (present-day Schipluiden) on 20 April 1653. By December 1660, the Vermeers lived in the large house of his wealthy mother-in-law Maria Thins, described as a \"strong-willed\" woman. It was unusual at the time for married men and women to settle into the houses of their parents. Vermeer relied on Thin's residence and financial support to take care of his family.Vermeer painted in the artist's studio and sold art from the house. His works portray subjects with clothing and furnishings more luxurious than his own. Biographer Anthony Bailey claims that since Vermeer used models from his household, it is likely that he made a painting of his wife. He asserts that Catharina is depicted in A Lady Writing a Letter due to her \"fond expression\" and \"concentrated gaze of the unseen painter.\"Thins played an essential role in their life. She was a devotee of the Jesuit order in the nearby Catholic Church, and this seems to have influenced Johannes and Catharina.They had eleven children at the time of Vermeer's death, four of their children died young between 1660 and 1673. Most of their children were born at Thin's house. Their third son was called Ignatius, after the founder of the Jesuit Order. Catharina inherited the Ben Repas estate following her Aunt Cornelia's death in February 1661.Thins hired Vermeer to manage financial issues for her in 1667 and 1675. He collected monies owed her, and he handled her investments. The Rampjaar (disaster year) following the outbreak of the Franco-Dutch War (1672–1674) was particularly hard on Vermeer's ability to make money as an artist and an art dealer. He had to take a loss on sales of works of art and was unable to sell his own works. His mother-in-law was financially strained during this period due to the loss of rental income from farmland due to the war. In one instance, she rented out land near Schoonhoven that was flooded to prevent the French army from crossing the Dutch Water Line. The farmland was not arable for a time. Thins reduced the money that she spent to support the Vermeers. In 1675, Vermeer went on several business trips for his mother-in-law, first to Gouda, when her husband had died, and then to Amsterdam. There Vermeer borrowed money by fraudulently using her name.Vermeer died and was buried on 15 December 1675. Unable to pay their debts, Catharina blamed the financial fallout of the war for their losses and petitioned for bankruptcy in April 1676. Ten of their eleven children were still underage when Vermeer died. Catharina continued to live at her mother's house with their children. After Vermeer's death, Maria Thins received The Art of Painting for her financial support of Catharina's family. Catharina paid off other debts with paintings or used them as surety until she paid off debts.\n\nLater years and death\nThins died and was buried on 27 December 1680. The burial record states that she was the widow of Reijnier Bolnes. Thins crafted her will to maximize her grandchildren's support and education, preventing her estate from going to Catharina's creditors. The grandchildren were assigned a guardian, Hendrick van Eem, to look out for their interests. Catharina, considered responsible, was encouraged by her mother to ensure that her children were educated so that they could support themselves. Her daughter Catharina moved to Breda. Catharina Bolnes received \"Holy Oil\" on 23 December 1687, before being buried on 2 January 1688.\n\nSee also\nWriting to Vermeer an opera depicting Maria Thins and Catharina Bolnes\nPassage 2:\nBaroness Gösta von dem Bussche-Haddenhausen\nBaroness Gösta von dem Bussche-Haddenhausen (German: Freiin Gösta Julie Adelheid Marion Marie von dem Bussche-Haddenhausen; 26 January 1902 – 13 June 1996)  was the mother of Prince Claus of the Netherlands, who was the Prince Consort of Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands, thus making her the mother-in-law of the former Dutch Queen. She is also the paternal grandmother of King Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands, who is the current Dutch King.\n\nEarly life\nGösta was born at Döbeln, Kingdom of Saxony, German Empire (now Saxony, Germany), the second child and daughter of Baron George von dem Bussche-Haddenhausen (1869–1923), and his wife, Baroness Gabriele von dem Bussche-Ippenburg (1877–1973). Her father belonged to the Bussche-Haddenhausen branch of the Bussche family, her mother belonged to the Bussche-Ippenburg branch. Both descended from Clamor von dem Bussche (1532–1573).\nHer mother was the heir of Dötzingen estate near Hitzacker, which her maternal grandfather had inherited from the counts von Oeynhausen after 1918. Gösta's father was an officer in the Royal Saxon Army. Dötzingen estate later passed on to her brother Baron Julius von dem Bussche-Haddenhausen (1906–1977). After her return from Africa, and her husband's death in 1963, she spent the rest of her life in Dötzingen.\n\nMarriage\nGösta married on 4 September 1924 at Hitzacker to Claus Felix von Amsberg (1890–1963), son of Wilhelm von Amsberg and Elise von Vieregge.\nTogether they had six daughters and one son:\n\nSigrid von Amsberg (Hitzacker-Dötzingen, 26 June 1925 – 1 April 2018), married in 1952 to Ascan-Bernd Jencquel (17 August 1913 – 4 November 2003), had issue.\nClaus von Amsberg (Hitzacker-Dötzingen, 6 September 1926 – Amsterdam, 6 October 2002), married in 1966 to Beatrix of the Netherlands (b. 31 January 1938), had issue.\nRixa von Amsberg (Hitzacker-Dötzingen, 18 November 1927 – 6 January 2010), married to Peter Ahrend (17 April 1920 – 2011), no issue.\nMargit von Amsberg (Bumbuli, 16 October 1930 – 1988), married in 1964 to Ernst Grubitz (14 April 1931 – 5 June 2009), had issue.\nBarbara von Amsberg (Bumbuli, 16 October 1930), married in 1963 to Günther Haarhaus (22 October 1921 – 9 February 2007), had issue.\nTheda von Amsberg (Tanga, 30 June 1939), married in 1966 to Baron Karl von Friesen (b. 1933), had issue.\nChristina von Amsberg (Salisbury, 20 January 1945), married in 1971 to Baron Hans Hubertus von der Recke (b. 1942), had issue.\n\nLife in Africa\nHer husband had returned from the Tanganyika Territory, a German colony (now Tanzania) during World War I to become manager of Dötzingen estate in 1917. Shortly after, the estate passed on to the Bussche family. In 1924 he married his employer's daughter, and in 1926, their son Claus war born at Dötzingen. In 1928 the family moved to Tanganyika where they remained during the outbreak of World War II. Her husband was manager of a German-British tea and sisal plantation. Her son was sent back to a German boarding school in 1933, but returned to Africa in 1936; in 1938 Gösta returned to Germany, and Claus was sent to a boarding school in Misdroy, before becoming drafted by the army. Her husband returned to Germany in 1947.\n\nDeath\nShe died, aged 94, in Hitzacker, Germany.\n\nFamily relations\nGösta was a second cousin of Dorothea von Salviati (wife of Kronprinz Wilhelm's eldest son Prince Wilhelm of Prussia), both being great-granddaughters of Heinrich von Salviati and Caroline Rahlenbeck. Her younger and only brother Julius (1906-1977) was married to Anna-Elisabeth von Pfuel (1909-2005).\nHer family's home, Dötzingen castle, Lower Saxony, had passed to her maternal grandfather Eberhard Friedrich Gustav von dem Bussche-Ippenburg from the counts von Oeynhausen. It was at a dinner party of a distant cousin, the count von Oeynhausen-Sierstorpff in Bad Driburg, on New Year's Eve 1962 that her son Claus met crown-princess Beatrix for the first time, herself also being a cousin of the host: Beatrix' paternal grandmother Armgard von Cramm was a daughter of Baron Aschwin von Sierstorpff-Cramm (1846–1909) and his wife, Baroness Hedwig von Sierstorpff-Driburg (1848–1900), and Armgard von Cramm had first been married to count Bodo von Oeynhausen, before marrying Prince Bernhard of Lippe-Biesterfeld (1872–1934), Beatrix' grandfather; Armgard's elder sister Baroness Hedwig von Sierstorpff-Cramm (1874–1907) was the heir of her mother's family's estate Driburg, and she also married a count von Oeynhausen, Wilhelm Karl Ludwig Kuno Graf von Oeynhausen-Sierstorpff (1860–1922), whose descendants still own Driburg estate.\n\nAncestry\nNotes and sources\nthePeerage.com - Gosta Freiin von dem Bussche-Haddenhausen\nDie Ahnen Claus Georg von Amsberg, Limburg a.d.

She was the mother of Queen Margaret Leijonhufvud and the second cousin and mother-in-law of King Gustav Vasa.\n\nLife\nEbba was the daughter of the nobles riksråd Erik Karlsson Vasa (1436–1491) and Anna Karlsdotter (Vinstorpa). Her father was a cousin of Erik Johansson Vasa, father of King Gustav Vasa, and she was thus the second cousin of the future king. She married riksråd Erik Abrahamsson Leijonhufvud on 18 January 1512 in Söderköping. She was, as other women of her position in contemporary Sweden, referred to as Fru Ebba ('Lady Ebba').\n\nWidowhood\nIn 1520, her spouse was executed during the Stockholm Bloodbath. During the bloodbath, Ebba and her children were guests in Västerås Abbey, where they had been lodged by her spouse for their safety when he departed for the coronation of Christian I in Stockholm. She and her children, therefore, avoided being taken to Denmark as hostages as the other women and children related to the executed of the bloodbath, such as Christina Gyllenstierna, Cecilia Månsdotter and Margareta Eriksdotter Vasa. Ebba was allowed to keep the family estates despite the execution of her spouse for heresy, likely because of the unstable political situation. She mainly resided at Lo Castle in Västergötland.\nIn 1523, her second cousin Gustav I became king of Sweden. She was granted certain privileges by him, such as the right to keep certain fines of the crown, and as a widow and head of her family, she performed the same duties as any noble vassal and equipped knights for the king's army. In 1525, her sister and brother-in-law Margareta von Melen and Berend von Melen became involved in the suspected attempt of Christina Gyllenstierna and Søren Norby to conquer the throne, and as a reward for her loyalty, lady Ebba was granted the confiscated property of her exiled sister in Sweden. As the king's second cousin, she likely belonged to those \"highest lords and ladies of the realm\" summoned to escort the new queen, Catherine of Saxe-Lauenburg to Sweden and attend the wedding of the king, during which her daughter Brita was married to the kings favored courtier Gustaf Olofsson till Torpa.\n\nCourt life\nIn October 1536, the king married her daughter Margaret, making her mother-in-law to her second cousin the king, who addressed her as \"Dearest Mother\" and seem to have had a good relationship with her. \nAs the in-laws of the monarch, she and her children often attended court and was given favored roles to play in ceremonial court life. At the baptism of her granddaughter princess Cecilia in 1540, for example, she participated in the procession directly after her daughter the queen, who was escorted by her eldest son Abraham and the king, while she herself was escorted by two male members of the aristocracy.Her son's were given offices, and she and her mother were granted land and several privileges, such as the right to some of the royal taxes from their tenants and the support of the king in most of their many court cases regarding land rights, and the right granted after the Swedish Reformation to retract land donated to the church by their ancestors in accordance with the Reduction of Gustav I of Sweden.Reportedly, Ebba had a great deal of influence at court during the first years of her daughter's tenure as queen and did not hesitate to ask her son-in-law for favors: in February 1537, for example, the king issued a pardon in a court case \"after the many prayers of our hearths dearest wife and her dearest mother\". She was also issued assignments from the king, such as to examine whether the complaints of the governor of Alvastar was correct, and when he, during the Dacke War, asked her to prevent any abuse of the overseers of her son Sten (at that point his envoy in France) of the peasantry, so as not to provoke them to join the rebellion.It is unknown whether she was ever given a court office, as the court staff from this period is only fragmentary known, but according to the list describing who occupied which room in the royal castles, Ebba was, alongside Christina Gyllenstierna, one of two women often given the best rooms closest to the queen when attending court.  During the royal couple's trips around the country, Ebba and Christina Gyllenstierna, was on several occasions given the responsibility for the royal children, such as for example in 1540, when they were left in her care in Örebro Castle, while the king and queen visited Älvsborg. The royal children were regardless always in the care of their personal staff the cunning woman Brigitta Lars Anderssons, lady Margareta and Ingrid Amundsdotter.Ebba was a stern Catholic, and in 1536 the king gave her Vreta Abbey in Östergötland, which was given her protection during the Swedish Reformation. Eventually, Ebba retired to Vreta Abbey, where she died of the plague in 1549.\n\nIssue\nAbraham Eriksson Leijonhufvud (1512–1556), riksråd\nBirgitta \"Brita\" Eriksdotter Leijonhufvud  (1514–1572), mother of Queen Catherine Stenbock.\nMargaret Leijonhufvud  (1516–1551), Queen\nAnna Leijonhufvud (1517–1540)\nSten Eriksson Leijonhufvud (1518–1568), chamberlain\nMartha Leijonhufvud (1520–1584), known as \"King Martha\"\nPassage 4:\nPriscilla Pointer\nPriscilla Marie Pointer (born May 18, 1924) is an American retired actress.

He was the second son of Jungjong, and his mother was Queen Munjeong, who was Jungjong's third queen.\nHe became king in 1545 at the age of 12 following the death of his half-brother, Injong. Since he was too young to rule the kingdom, Queen Munjeong governed the nation in his name.\n\nBiography\nPolitical factions\nThere were two political factions at the time Myeongjong came to power; Greater Yun, headed by Yun Im, Injong's maternal uncle, and Lesser Yun, headed by Myeongjong's maternal uncles, Yun Won-hyeong and Yun Wonro. (Yun Im and Yun Brothers were close relatives by that period's standards - Yun Im was a third cousin once removed of Yun Brothers.)  Greater Yun took power in 1544, when Injong succeeded Jungjong; but they failed to wipe out their opposition, since Queen Munjeong protected the Lesser Yun faction and other opposition officials.\nAfter the death of Injong in 1545, Lesser Yun replaced Greater Yun as the majority in the royal court and brutally ousted their adversaries in the Fourth Literati Purge of 1545. Yun Im was executed, as were many of his followers.\n\nRise of Yun Won-hyeong\nThe Lesser Yun faction continued to attack their opposition. In 1546, Yun Won-hyeong impeached his older brother, Yun Won-ro, who was executed a few days later along with his followers. Facing no opposition from the government, Yun Won-hyeong became Minister of Personnel 이조판서 in 1548, Left State Councilor in 1551 and ultimately Chief State Councilor 영의정  in 1563.\nDespite Yun Won-hyeong's violent rule, Queen Munjeong was an effective administrator, distributing to the common people land formerly owned by the nobility. However, she held on to rule even after the king reached his majority at the age of 20.\n\nDeath of Queen Munjeong\nAfter the death of Queen Munjeong in 1565, the king decided to rule the kingdom by himself and had his uncle Yun Won-hyeong put to death, along with his second wife Jeong Nan-jeong, who also rose to power due to her close friendship and being second sister-in-law to Queen Munjeong. Yun Won-hyeong allowed corruption to flourish in the government; while the kingdom was unstable, Jurchens, Japanese, and rebellious troops rampaged at will and threatened the government itself. Rebel leader Im Kkeok-jeong was arrested and executed in 1552, but outside invasion continued; the Joseon Dynasty had to re-mobilize its army and navy along to protect its borders.\n\nDeath and succession\nMyeongjong tried to reform the government after taking power into his own hands by recalling and reinstating Sarim scholars who were exiled in the purge, but died only two years later without any male issue. King Seonjo, his half-nephew, succeeded to the throne in 1567.\n\nFamily\nFather: King Jungjong of Joseon (16 April 1488 – 29 November 1544) (조선 중종)\nGrandfather: King Seongjong of Joseon (19 August 1457 – 20 January 1494) (조선 성종)\nGrandmother: Queen Jeonghyeon of the Papyeong Yun clan (21 July 1462 – 13 September 1530) (정현왕후 윤씨)\nMother: Queen Munjeong of the Papyeong Yun clan (2 December 1501 – 5 May 1565) (문정왕후 윤씨)\nGrandfather: Yun Ji-Im (1475 – 14 April 1534) (윤지임)\nGrandmother: Lady Lee of the Jeonui Lee clan (1475 – 1511) (전의 이씨)\nConsorts and their Respective Issue(s):Queen Insun of the Cheongsong Shim clan (27 June 1532 – 12 February 1575) (인순왕후 심씨)Yi Bu, Crown Prince Sunhoe (1 July 1551 – 6 October 1563) (이부 순회세자)\nRoyal Noble Consort Gyeong of the Jeonui Lee clan (1541 – June 1595) (경빈 이씨)\nRoyal Noble Consort Sun of the Jeong clan (? – 1593) (순빈 정씨)\nRoyal Consort Gwi-in of the Geochang Shin clan (귀인 신씨)\nRoyal Consort So-ui of the Pyeongsan Shin clan (1533 – 1565) (소의 신씨)\nRoyal Consort Suk-ui of the Han clan (숙의 한씨) (? - 1594)\nRoyal Consort Suk-ui of the Onyang Jeong clan (숙의 정씨)\nRoyal Consort Suk-ui of the Dongrae Jeong clan (숙의 정씨)\n\nPopular culture\nPortrayed by Seo Dong-hyun in the 2013 KBS2 TV series The Fugitive of Joseon.\nPortrayed by Lee David in the 2016 JTBC TV series Mirror of the Witch.\nPortrayed by Seo Ha-joon in the 2016 MBC TV series The Flower in Prison.\n\nNotes\nExternal links\nhttp://www.koreandb.net/Koreanking/html/person/pki60013.htm\nhttp://chosonsillok.org/inspection/insp_king.jsp?id=kma\nPassage 6:\nVera Miletić\nVera Miletić (Serbian Cyrillic: Вера Милетић; 8 March 1920 – 7 September 1944) was a Serbian student and soldier.

She is the mother-in-law of 44th U.S. President Barack Obama.\n\nAncestry and early life\nMarian Shields was born in Chicago in 1937, the fourth of seven children—five girls, followed by two boys—born to Purnell Nathaniel Shields, a house painter and carpenter, and his wife Rebecca Jumper, a licensed practical nurse. Both parents had multi-racial ancestry. Her mother's grandfather, Dolphus T. Shields (c. 1860–1950), was a direct descendant of slavery, with his mother a slave and his white father the heir of the slaveowner; he had moved from rural Georgia to Birmingham, Alabama, where he established his own carpentry and tool sharpening business. His descendants would eventually move to Chicago during the Great Migration.\n\nPersonal life\nShields married Fraser Robinson III on October 27, 1960, in Chicago. They had two children together, Craig Malcolm and Michelle LaVaughn, named after Fraser's mother. She worked as a secretary for mail-order retailer Spiegel, the University of Chicago, and a bank. In the late 60's, Shields lived with her family in a rented second floor apartment of a brick bungalow the South Side of Chicago that belonged to her aunt Robbie and her husband Terry. This is where she raised her two children, Michelle and Craig, and continued to live until she eventually moved to the White House with the Obamas. Michelle Obama, in her book Becoming, describes her mother's strong attachment to her Chicago home and her commitment to raising her children as a stay at home mother. Shields resumed work as an executive assistant at a bank when her daughter Michelle started high school.\n\nRelationship with Michelle Obama\nMichelle describes her mother as forthright and honest, and speaks of her implacability and her silent support as a child and beyond. Shields used to take her daughter Michelle to the library long before she started school and used to sit beside her as she learned to read and write. Usually the kind of mother who expected her children to settle their own disputes, Shields was quick to see real distress and stepped in to help when needed. For example, when Michelle was in second grade and was distressed because of being devalued by a teacher, Shields advocated for her and was instrumental in getting her daughter better learning opportunities at school. Shields encouraged her children to communicate with her about all subjects by being available when needed and giving practical advice. She entertained Michelle's school friends when they visited and enabled her to make her own choices in important matters.\n\nObama campaign and life in the White House\nWhile Michelle and Barack Obama campaigned for his candidacy as president in 2008, Robinson helped them by providing support to her granddaughters, Malia and Sasha Obama. During Barack Obama's presidency, Robinson was living at the White House with the First Family.\nPassage 9:\nEldon Howard\nEldon Howard was a British screenwriter.

Nearby where her mother-in-law, Queen Munjeong, is buried, the Queen is buried with her husband in Kangreung.\n\nTrivia\nQueen Insun eventually became the 5th great-grandaunt of Queen Danui, King Gyeongjong's first wife.

{"input": "What is the place of birth of Princess Amalia Of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach's husband?", "context": "Passage 1:\nPrince Hermann of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach (1886–1964)\nPrince Hermann of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach (14 February 1886 – 6 June 1964) was a member of the House of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach. He was heir to his relative William Ernest, Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach until 1909, when he was disinherited of his royal status. From that point onwards, Hermann was commonly referred to with the lesser style, Graf von Ostheim (Count of Ostheim).\n\nEarly life\nPrince Hermann of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach was born on 14 February 1886 in Düsseldorf. He was educated by a tutor until deemed old enough to enter the Imperial German Army. He joined the Cuirassiers of the Guard in Berlin, where he was separated from the guidance of his family and tutor, and began to build up a reputation as a spendthrift like his father. He was given $10,000 a year to spend, and he and those he bought items from realized that any debts contracted would eventually be paid by his family, thus increasing the amount Hermann could spend. By the end of the year, Hermann was a quarter of a million dollars in debt, which his family duly paid; he was sent to a small town as a disciplinary measure. He persuaded his family that he was ill, and was able to travel to Paris, racking up more debts along the way; one rumor said he sold his mother's jewels en route to France.\n\nHeir to Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach\nWilliam Ernest, Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach remained childless for much of his early life, fueling speculation of the succession to his duchy. As a descendant of Charles Augustus, Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach through a younger son, firstly Hermann and secondly his brother were heir presumptives until the birth of Charles Augustus, Hereditary Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach in 1912.\n\nLoss of inheritance\nA lifelong spendthrift, Prince Hermann was heir presumptive to the duchy of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach until his disinheritance on 2 August 1909. The ducal family forced him to renounce his rights of succession to the Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach throne, as well as his royal status, title and prerogatives, granting him a lesser, noble title, Count Ostheim, along with a small allowance on the grounds that he stay out of the duchy. Herman was not the only member of his family to have a bad reputation; his father Prince William as well as their cousin Prince Bernhard were all viewed with displeasure, so much so, that the still-living Prince William had been overlooked concerning the duchy's succession. Hermann had a younger brother, Prince Albert, who took up his position as next-in-line to the duchy. Hermann was also driven out of the German army \"for all sorts of unsavory scrapes\", as he was wanted in both England and Austria for debts, and for being a \"common swindler\". His Austrian arrest warrant was issued soon after his younger sister Princess Sophie of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach was denied permission to enter into a morganatic marriage; she committed suicide soon after, on 18 September 1913.In 1921 Count Hermann claimed in a lawsuit with Grand Duke William Ernest that he and his mother were induced by a ruse and told that he would be forcibly expelled from Paris unless he agreed to travel from there to Germany; instead Hermann was confined in an insane asylum. He was only freed after signing documents renouncing all claims to Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach and assuming the style Count Ostheim. Hermann went on to claim that the Grand Duke was guilty of usury, as he was lent certain sums of money to pay off his debts in exchange for renouncing 48,000 marks appanage in favor of William Ernest. During that time, the German government had been completing negotiations for a settlement on the former royal family (their titles had been abolished in 1918); thus had Hermann not been disinherited, he would have stood to inherit quite a large bit of money.\n\nMarriage\nBefore he became disinherited, Prince Hermann desired to marry Princess Marie Bonaparte, a great heiress; he might have succeeded but for his unsavory reputation. Though there was a chance he would succeed to the Grand Ducal throne, Marie's father disliked Hermann for possessing an \"evil\" reputation, and consequently allowed her instead to marry Prince George of Greece and Denmark. Before her refusal, however, Hermann was able to obtain a great deal of money, as it was assumed he would soon have a great deal of wealth to spend; when it became clear there was to be no marriage, a \"crash\" came. It was these money troubles, along with other problems, that led to his disinheritance.Despite being disinherited, Hermann openly boasted he would travel to the United States in search of a wealthy wife, and then return to Germany and pay off his debts within a year; all this was said while staying in Zurich awaiting funds from his family. Instead, Hermann, now Count Ostheim, morganatically married Wanda Paola Lottero, an Italian stage actress, on 5 September 1909 in London. They visited the United States on several occasions. They were divorced two years later, on 22 June 1911 after Wanda grew tired of supporting him with her earnings and divorced him on the grounds of financial \"non-support\", \"cruelty\", and \"infidelity\". Wanda later gained notoriety for having a short-lived affair with King Konstantínos I of the Hellenes in 1912.On 4 August 1918, Hermann married secondly to Suzanne Aagot Midling at Heidelberg. They had one surviving child before her death on 16 October 1931:\n\nAlexander Kyrill Graf von Ostheim (born 7 August 1922); he died unmarried in Stockholm on 28 March 1943On 16 November 1932, Hermann's engagement with Isabel Neilson, daughter of former British MP and prominent actor and author Francis Neilson, was announced. Hermann and Isabel were married civilly and religiously in Paris on 28 November 1932. A small family luncheon accompanied the wedding; afterwards, the couple honeymooned to Spain and North Africa. They had no children.\nHermann died in London on 6 June 1964 at the age of 78.\n\nAncestry\nPassage 2:\nPrince Wilhelm of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach\nPrince Wilhelm Karl Bernhard Hermann of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach (21 December 1853 – 15 December 1924) was a member of the House of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach.\n\nLife\nPrince Wilhelm of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach was born on 21 December 1853 in Stuttgart. He was the eldest son of the Prince Hermann of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach and Princess Augusta of Württemberg (1826-1898). Prince Wilhelm also has had his own financial problems, and has been forced by the Grand Duke to live outside Weimar. Wilhelm is heir presumptive to the throne as the young Grand Duke Wilhelm Ernst is a widower. His wife, Karoline of Reuss died in January 1905.\nPrince William had a problem with his eldest son. Prince Hermann morganatically married Wanda Paola Lottero on 5 September 1909 in London. Lottero was an Italian stage actress, and due to Hermann's rollicking lifestyle, the ducal family forced him to renounce his rights of succession to the Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach throne, as well as his royal status, title and prerogatives, granting him a lesser, noble title, Count Ostheim, along with a small allowance on the grounds that he stay out of the duchy. Prince Wilhelm also had a bad reputation. His behavior aroused the dissatisfaction of the head of the family. Prince Wilhelm fled to the United States in his youth, served as a riding master, clerk, book agent and even as a restaurant waiter in New York City, but was finally persuaded to return to Germany, marry his second cousin, and live on a small pension from the head of the house.\n\nMarriage and family\nPrince Wilhelm married Gerta Princess of Ysenburg and Büdingen (1863-1945), daughter of Ferdinand Maximilian I, Prince of Ysenburg and Büdingen (1824-1903) and Auguste Marie Gertrude Princess of Hanau and Horowitz (1829-1887), on 11 April 1885 at Wächtersbach, Germany. Augusta Marie Gertrude was daughter of Frederick William, Elector of Hesse. Wilhelm and Gerta had three children:\n\nPrince Hermann of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach (14 February 1886 – 6 June 1964)\nPrince Albrecht of Sachsen-Weimar-Eisenach (23 December 1886 - 9 September 1918), killed in action during World War I\nPrincess Sophie of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach (25 July 1888 - 18 September 1913)\n\nHonours and arms\nHe received the following orders and decorations:\n Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach: Grand Cross of the White Falcon, 1853\n   Ernestine duchies: Grand Cross of the Saxe-Ernestine House Order, 1878\n Schaumburg-Lippe: Cross of Honour of the House Order of Lippe, 1st Class\n Siam: Grand Cross of the White Elephant\n Württemberg: Grand Cross of the Württemberg Crown, 1871\n\nAncestry\nPassage 3:\nMichael, Prince of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach\nMichael, Prince of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach  (German: Michael Prinz von Sachsen-Weimar-Eisenach; born 15 November 1946) is the current head of the Grand Ducal House of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, as well as the most senior agnate of the entire House of Wettin.\n\nPrince of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach\nPrince Michael was born in Bamberg, Bavaria, the only son of Hereditary Grand Duke Charles Augustus of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach and Baroness Elisabeth von Wangenheim-Winterstein (1912–2010). Among his godparents were Queen Juliana of the Netherlands and the Grand Duchess Anastasia of Russia imposter, Anna Anderson, who was living with his aunt Princess Luise of Saxe-Meiningen.When his father died on 14 October 1988, Prince Michael succeeded him as Head of the House of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach. On 13 February 1991, he inherited the leadership in the House of Saxe-Altenburg, as that line became extinct, and since 23 July 2012 he regards the Albertine royal Saxon line to be extinct. However, Prince Michael has also stated that he \"[does not] believe in historical carnival\" and that \"Germany should have done it like Austria long ago and abolished all titles.\"In 2004, he withdrew his claim for restitution of numerous properties, archives (partly including those of Schiller and Goethe) as well as priceless artwork in a settlement with the Free State of Thuringia and acquired some forest estates in exchange.Since Prince Michael has no sons, the current heir to the headship of the grand ducal house is his elder (by age) first cousin, Prince Wilhelm Ernst (b. 10 August 1946), whose only son Prince Georg-Constantin (13 April 1977 – 9 June 2018), a banker who was married but without issue, was killed in a horse riding accident on 9 June 2018 while riding with Jean Christophe Iseux von Pfetten. Therefore, the Grand Ducal House of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach will most likely become extinct in the male line.\n\nMarriages\nPrince Michael married Renate Henkel (b. Heidelberg, 17 September 1947), daughter of industrialist Konrad Henkel and wife Jutta von Hülsen and sister of Christoph Henkel, in a civil ceremony on 9 June 1970 at Hamburg-Eimsbüttel, and religiously on 4 July 1970 at Linnep bei Breitscheid. The marriage was childless and dissolved by divorce at Düsseldorf on 9 March 1974.\nHe was married secondly to Dagmar Hennings (b. Niederpöcking, 24 June 1948), daughter of Henrich Hennings and wife Margarethe Schacht, in London on 15 November 1980. They have one daughter: \n\nLeonie Mercedes Augusta Silva Elisabeth Margarethe of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach (b. Frankfurt, 30 October 1986). She graduated with her Abitur from high school at Schule Schloss Salem, where she became involved in theatre and hockey and was a Student Representative (Schulsprecher), between 2001 and 2006, after which she obtained a Bachelor's degree in Media and Cultural Studies from the University of the Arts London from 2007 to 2010. Meanwhile, she was employed as an Intern Photographer of Contemporary Art for Sotheby's London between January and June 2007, as an Intern for \"BILD\" at Axel Springer SE at Frankfurt and surrounding area in September 2008, as an Intern at \"Tatler\" in April 2009 and then as an Intern for \"Vogue Russia\" in June 2009 both at Condé Nast International, and then again at Axel Springer SE as an Intern at the Editorial Team of \"ICON Welt am Sonntag\" at Berlin and surrounding area in September 2009. After graduating, she worked at n-tv The News Channel - Der Nachrichtensender, firstly as an Intern between August and December 2010 and then as a Title Editor and Reporter between January 2011 and December 2013, both of the Editorial Office \"5th Avenue\", after which she went to Media Group RTL Germany, where she worked firstly as an Editor and Reporter at the RTL \"Punkt 12 VIP\" between January and October 2014 and afterwards as an Editor and Reporter at the RTL \"Capital Studio People\" and Lifestyle Editorial Office at Berlin and surrounding area since November 2014.\n\nHonours and awards\nNongovernmental organizations\nSlovakia, Servare et Manere\n\n Memorial Medal of Tree of Peace, Special class with rubies, (May 12, 2022).\n\nAncestry\nPassage 4:\nPrincess Amalia of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach\nPrincess Amalia of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach (Amalia Maria da Gloria Augusta; 20 March 1830 – 1 May 1872) was a Dutch princess as the first wife of Prince Henry of the Netherlands, son of king William II of the Netherlands.\n\nLife\nFamily\nShe was the daughter of Prince Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach and Princess Ida of Saxe-Meiningen.\n\nPrincess of the Netherlands\nShe first met Henry, alongside his brother Alexander on the island of Madeira in 1847. She married Henry in Weimar on 19 May 1853. They divided their time between Walferdange Castle in Luxembourg, where Henry was stadhouder, and the Soestdijk Palace during the summer.\nThe marriage remained childless but was described as a happy one, with Amalia acting as the confidante, support and adviser of Henry, and as an intermediary during family conflicts. She may have influenced Henry's defense of the independent position of Luxemburg during the conflict of 1866–1870.As she had been before her marriage, she had a great interest in charity, which made her popular in Luxemburg. It was thanks to her that kindergartens (initiated by Friedrich Fröbel) were introduced into the area.\nOn her death in 1872 she was buried in the Nieuwe Kerk at Delft. In 1876 the city of Luxembourg unveiled a statue of her in Henry's presence.\nPassage 5:\nErnest Augustus I, Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach\nErnest Augustus I, Duke of Saxe-Weimar (German: Ernst August I; 19 April 1688 – 19 January 1748), was a duke of Saxe-Weimar and, from 1741, of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach.\n\nBiography\nHe was the second but eldest surviving son of Johann Ernst III, Duke of Saxe-Weimar and his first wife Sophie Auguste of Anhalt-Zerbst.\nWhen his father died in 1707, Ernst August became co-ruler (Mitherr) of Saxe-Weimar, along with his uncle Wilhelm Ernst, but his title was only nominal, since Wilhelm Ernst was the actual ruler of the duchy. Only when Wilhelm Ernst died in 1728 did Ernst August begin to exercise true authority over Saxe-Weimar.\n\nExcesses\nErnst August was a splendor-loving ruler, and his extravagances contributed to the eventual financial ruin of his duchy. Desperately in need of funds, he resorted to the practice of arresting wealthy subjects without cause, and setting them free only after they had renounced their fortunes to the duke, or had paid exorbitant ransoms. Some of the victims, who considered this behaviour illegal, made claims against the duke at the Imperial Court in Vienna or in the Imperial Chamber Court of Appeal in Wetzlar. Ernst August lost all the legal proceedings mounted against him. The process lasted for many years and eventually led to the duchy's bankruptcy.\nThe duke maintained a standing army that was disproportionately large for the duchy's population or financial resources. Some of the soldiers were rented to the Electorate of Saxony or to the Holy Roman Emperor. Ernst August's mania for building led to the construction of the Kleinode, the small Schloss Belvedere and the Rococo Schloss of Dornburg, a lavish residence for the duke. His passion for the hunt was likewise extravagant; when he died, Ernst August left 1,100 dogs and 373 horses. The duke maintained a standing \"harem,\" in which two noble \"Ladies of Honour\" (Ehrenfräulein) and three \"Chamber Women\" (Kammerfrauen) of low birth attended to his desires.\n\nMarriages and children\nIn Nienburg on 24 January 1716, Ernst August married Eleonore Wilhelmine of Anhalt-Köthen, daughter of Emmanuel Lebrecht, Prince of Anhalt-Köthen. They had eight children:\n\nWilliam Ernest (b. Weimar, 4 July 1717 – d. Halle, 8 June 1719), Hereditary Prince of Saxe-Weimar.\nWilhelmine Auguste (b. Weimar, 4 July 1717 – d. Weimar, 9 December 1752), twin of Wilhelm Ernst.\nJohn William (b. Weimar, 10 January 1719 – d. Weimar, 6 December 1732), Hereditary Prince of Saxe-Weimar.\nCharlotte Agnes Leopoldina (b. Weimar, 4 December 1720 – d. Weimar, 15 October 1724).\nJohanna Eleonore Henriette (b. Weimar, 2 December 1721 – d. Weimar, 17 June 1722).\nErnestine Albertine (b. Weimar, 28 December 1722 – d. Alverdissen, 25 November 1769), married on 6 May 1756 to Philipp II, Count of Schaumburg-Lippe.\nBernhardina Christina Sophia (b. Weimar, 5 May 1724 – d. Rudolstadt, 5 June 1757), married on 19 November 1744 to John Frederick, Prince of Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt.\nEmmanuel Frederick William Bernard (b. Weimar, 19 December 1725 – d. Weimar, 11 June 1729).After the death of his first wife in 1726, the duke decided to not marry again, choosing to live quietly with his Ladies of Honor and Chamber Women. But in 1732 the situation changed unexpectedly: his only surviving son, the hereditary prince (Erbprinz) Johann Wilhelm, died. This made it necessary for him to find a new wife and sire sons in order to perpetuate the dynasty.\nIn Bayreuth on 7 April 1734, Ernst August married his second wife, Sophie Charlotte of Brandenburg-Bayreuth, daughter of George Frederick Charles, Margrave of Brandenburg-Bayreuth. They had four children:\n\nCharles Augustus Eugen (b. Weimar, 1 January 1735 – d. Weimar, 13 September 1736), Hereditary Prince of Saxe-Weimar.\nErnst August II Konstantin, Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach (b. Weimar, 2 June 1737 – d. Weimar, 28 May 1758).\nErnestine Auguste Sophie (b. Weimar, 4 January 1740 – d. Hildburghausen, 10 June 1786), married on 1 July 1758 to Ernst Frederick III Karl, Duke of Saxe-Hildburghausen.\nErnest Adolph Felix (b. and d. Weimar, 23 January 1741 / b. Weimar, 1742 – d. Weimar, 1743) [?].The duke also had an illegitimate son with Friederike von Marschall:\n\nErnest Frederick (b. 1731 - d. 1810), created Freiherr von Brenn; married to Beate Helene Bormann, his line died out in the male line in 1849.\n\nSaxe-Weimar-Eisenach and absolutism\nIn 1741 the branch of Saxe-Eisenach-Jena became extinct with the death of Wilhelm Heinrich, Duke of Saxe-Eisenach. As the only surviving kinsman of the late duke, Ernst August inherited his estates; the union between Saxe-Weimar and Saxe-Eisenach-Jena now became permanent. One of the duke's few wise decisions was the institution of primogeniture in Saxe-Weimar (confirmed in 1724 by the Emperor Karl VI); this stopped further land divisions in the future. From 1741 his new duchy took the name of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach (Jena was merged by Eisenach), but the union was by this time only personal. The new state consisted of two larger areas around the two official residences in Weimar and Eisenach, which were not connected, and a patch of smaller areas and towns between them.\nThe annexation of Saxe-Eisenach was favorable to the hunt-loving duke; he possessed a large swath of woods in the Eisenach region, which seemed suitable to him for hunting. He left the Hereditary Prince in Weimar in the Schloss Belvedere, under the guardianship of his Hofmarschall, and moved permanently to Eisenach. After this, the duke rarely asked for his son, and sent the most unreasonable written instructions from Eisenach to Weimar in order to supervise his son's education. The Hereditary Prince saw his father for the last time in 1743.\nErnst August tried to implement Absolutism in Saxe-Weimar on the French model. The secret Ratskollegium —a consultative organ national formed by nobles— was dissolved. In 1746 the citizens of Eisenach presented the duke a memorandum detailing national prerogatives, in which he was denounced for constant offences against traditional rights. The gesture demonstrated that the citizens of the duchy were resisting the introduction of absolutism, thus certain policies that Ernst August had planned could not be completely carried out. The duke's death prevented a terrible controversy between the national nobles and the citizens of Eisenach.\n\nDeath\nUpon his death, Ernst August left a financially ruined duchy, and a successor to the throne (Ernst August II) who was still under age.\n\nAncestors\nPassage 6:\nPrince Henry of the Netherlands (1820–1879)\nPrince William Frederick Henry of the Netherlands (Dutch: Willem Frederik Hendrik; 13 June 1820 – 13 January 1879) was the third son of King William II of the Netherlands and his wife, Grand Duchess Anna Pavlovna of Russia. He was born at Soestdijk Palace.\nPrince Henry became Governor of Luxembourg in 1850, in which capacity he served until his death in 1879.  During his tenure, he worked with the government to launch the reactionary Coup of 1856, which consolidated power in the monarchy and the executive.  However, most of the changes were reversed by the new constitution issued in 1868 after the 1867 Luxembourg Crisis, during which the crown tried to sell the grand duchy to France.\n\nCareer\nPrince Henry was appointed an officer in the navy in his teens, and served many years, whence the sobriquet de Zeevaarder (\"the Navigator\"), after the Portuguese Prince Henry the Navigator.  He visited the Dutch East Indies in 1837, remaining there for seven months.\n\nPersonal life\nHe married twice. On 9 May 1853, in Weimar, he married Amalia Maria da Gloria Augusta of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach (Ghent, 20 May 1830 - Walferdange Castle, 1 May 1872). On 24 August 1878, in Potsdam, he married Marie Elisabeth Louise Frederica of Prussia (Marmorpalais, 14 September 1855 – Schloss Albrechtsberg, 20 June 1888). Both marriages were childless. At the time of his death at Walferdange Castle from measles, he was third in line of succession to the Dutch throne.\nThroughout his life, his title was His Royal Highness Prince Henry of the Netherlands, Prince of Orange-Nassau.\n\nLegacy\nThe Prins Hendrikkade, a major street in Amsterdam, was named after Prince Henry following his death in 1879. A bust of Henry stands on the street.\nThe Prins Hendrik Stichting, a charity founded by Prince Henry in 1871 and named after him, provides care to sailors and their widows.In Luxembourg, an oak tree in Grünewald forest was planted and named after him following his death in 1879.

The duke neglected his son and heir, so that Ernst August II Konstantin spent his early years under the supervision of the Hofmarschall of Schloss Belvedere in Weimar.\n\nErnst August I died in 1748, when Ernst August II Konstantin was eleven years old. Since he was still a minor, the dukes Frederick III of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg and Franz Josias of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld assumed the regency of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach on Ernst August II Konstantin's behalf. The young duke came to live with Duke Frederick in Gotha, who made sure that Ernst August II Konstantin received an appropriate education.\nIn 1755 Ernst August II Konstantin assumed the reins of government. He appointed his former tutor, the Imperial Count (Reichsgräf) Heinrich von Bünau, as his new chancellor. Because the young duke had been a sickly child, he was encouraged to marry quickly in order to ensure an heir for the duchy.\n\nMarriage\nIn Brunswick on 16 March 1756, Ernst August II Konstantin married Anna Amalia of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel. They had two sons:\n\nKarl August, Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, Grand Duke from 21 April 1815 (b. Weimar, 3 September 1757 – d. Graditz, 14 June 1828).\nFrederick Ferdinand Constantine (b. posthumously, Weimar, 8 September 1758 – d. Wiebelskirchen, 6 September 1793) who died unmarried.When Ernst August II Konstantin died, the hereditary prince Karl August was still an infant. Ernst August Konstantin's widow, the duchess Anna Amalia, presided as regent over an excellent tutelary government which propelled Weimar into the classical period.\n\n\n== Ancestry ==\nPassage 8:\nPrincess Marie of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach (1808–1877)\nPrincess Marie Luise Alexandrina of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach (3 February 1808 in Weimar – 18 January 1877 in Berlin) was a princess of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, by birth, and, by marriage, a princess of Prussia. She was the daughter of Charles Frederick, Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach and Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna of Russia.\n\nYouth\nPrincess Marie was the eldest daughter of Prince, and later Grand Duke, Charles Frederick of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach and his wife, Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna, who was the sister of Emperor Alexander I of Russia. Her father was a shy man, whose favourite reading material were fairy tales until the end of his life.  Her mother, by contrast, was \"one of the most significant women of her time\", according to Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. Marie and her younger sister Augusta, who became German Empress, received a comprehensive education, which focused on the courtly ceremonial duties they were to have as adults. This education included painting lessons by the court painter Louise Seidler and music lessons by the court conductor Johann Nepomuk Hummel.\nMarie grew up at the court in Weimar, which was considered one of the most liberal in Germany.  Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach adopted a constitution in 1816. The court was very receptive towards literature and other art forms, due to the influence of the late Duchess Anna Amalia, who had died in 1807. Goethe had been managing the court theater in Weimar until 1817 and remained a welcome guest at the ducal court afterwards.\nMarie's grandfather, Duke Charles August was raised to Grand Duke in 1815, due to the influence of the Tsar and his own attitude at the Congress of Vienna. This allowed Marie to use the style Royal Highness. Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach also achieved a considerable territorial expansion during the Congress of Vienna.\n\nMarriage\nNegotiating a marriage\nMarie was 16 years old when she first met her future husband, Prince Charles of Prussia, in Frankfurt an der Oder in 1824. He was the third son of King Frederick William III of Prussia and Louise of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna and her two daughters were travelling to Russia and had arranged to meet her brother, Grand Duke, and later Tsar, Nicholas, and his wife Alexandra Feodorovna in Frankfurt. When they arrived in Frankfurt, they were welcomed by Prince Charles and his brother William I.\nKing Frederick William III was in favour of Charles marrying Marie and immediately contacted the courts in Saint Petersburg and Weimar to negotiate a marriage arrangement. At the time, Maria Feodorovna, the mother of the Tsar, was still the authority in family matters. Neither she, nor Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna, gave the response that Frederick William III had hoped for. Both courts were hoping that Marie could marry an heir to the throne, albeit a throne of a smaller country. The third son of a king was not quite what they had in mind.\nThe Russians proposed that Marie could marry William and his younger brother Charles would marry her younger sister Augusta. This would be a better fit in terms of age and would certainly satisfy the court in Weimar, and William liked Marie more than he did Augusta. Frederick William III, however, saw nothing in this proposal, which completely ignored the feelings of his sons.\nThings were further complicated by William's being in love with Princess Elisa Radziwill. Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna tried to defame Ms. Radziwiłł with every means available. Outwardly, she did not want to base her daughter's marriage on the ruins of William's happiness. She hoped that William would marry Elisa morganatically, not have a legitimate heir, and the Prussian throne would be inherited by the heirs of Charles and Marie. So she would not actually have been very happy if William were to break off his relationship with Elisa and marry a lady of his own rank and have legitimate heirs.  An ally in her quest to paint Elisa as lower nobility was Grand Duke George of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, brother of Charles and William's late mother Queen Louise.\nNegotiations had already lasted more than two years when Maria Feodorovna managed to persuade her daughter to agree to a marriage between Charles and Marie, without putting any conditions on William.\n\nTwo marriages\nOn 26 May 1827, Princess Marie married Prince Charles of Prussia in Charlottenburg (now part of Berlin). Their son, Frederich Charles, was born 10 months later. Marie's sister Augusta and Charles' brother Wilhelm (William) gave in to dynastic pressure and married two years later. Their marriage, however, was complex and privately happy one. William regarded his wife as an \"outstanding personality\", but also as less charming than her older sister; he wrote \"the Princess is nice and clever, but she leaves me cold.\". Augusta, on the other hand, did at first like her husband and was full of hope for a happy marriage. She was aware of his unrequited love of Elisa Radziwiłł, but she was able to replace her in ways.\n\nIssue\nCharles and Marie had three children:\n\nPrince Frederick Charles of Prussia (1828–1885); married Princess Maria Anna of Anhalt-Dessau\nPrincess Louise of Prussia (1829-1901); married Alexis, Landgrave of Hesse-Philippsthal-Barchfeld (1828–1905)\nPrincess Anna of Prussia (1836–1918); married Frederick William, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel\n\nCourt life\nMarie's younger sister Augusta was married to the then Crown Prince Wilhelm (William) of Prussia. Marie consequently had lower status, being married to a mere Prince. She and her husband always resented their inferior position at court. While Charles took out his frustrations on womanizing and political schemes, Marie vied with Augusta over clothes, wigs, and jewels. Charles and Marie ran a fashionable household, surrounding themselves with high society, unlike the sober Wilhelm and intellectual Augusta.Marie loathed both her sister and her successor Victoria, Princess Royal (married to the then Crown Prince Frederick). As Victoria was British, most of the vehemently anti-British court was in agreement with Marie that it would have been better had the marriage never occurred. In one letter, Victoria wrote her mother Queen Victoria stating that she overheard Marie being told by her sister-in-law the Grand Duchess of Mecklenburg-Schwerin how \"she never ceased regretting that there is an Englishwoman in the family\".\n\nLife in Berlin and Glienicke\nFrom 1829, the young family lived in their winter residence Prince Charles Palace at Wilhelmplatz No. 8–9 in Berlin, which had been rebuilt according to a design by Karl Friedrich Schinkel.\nIn 1824, Prince Charles had purchased a country house in today's Volkspark Glienicke. Between 1824 and 1826, it was rebuilt by Karl Friedrich Schinkel and became Glienicke Palace. This was Charles' and Marie's favourite residence. They added a casino, and the Kleine Neugierde, which was decorated with antique mosaics from Carthage. In 1835, the rotunda Große Neugierde was added and, in the following years, the park was extended.\nIn 1859, Charles purchased Jagdschloss Glienicke for his son Frederick Charles.\n\nSecond Schleswig War\nOn 7 December 1865, King William I appointed Princess Marie as Royal Colonel of the First Westphalian Field Regiment No. 7, in recognition of the regiment's achievements during the Second Schleswig War, against Denmark in 1864. Her son Frederick Charles was a General of the cavalry during this war and had commanded the Prussian troops during the decisive Battle of Dybbøl.\n\nDeath\nMarie died on 18 January 1877 in Berlin, at the age of 69. Her husband had a vault constructed under the church of Ss. Peter and Paul in the Glienicke park. On his own death in 1883, he was buried beside her.\n\nAncestry\nFootnotes\nPassage 9:\nPrince Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach (1878–1900)\nPrince Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach (Bernhard Carl Alexander Hermann Heinrich Wilhelm Oscar Friedrich Franz Peter; 18 April 1878 – 1 October 1900) was a member of the Grand Ducal House of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach and a Lieutenant in the Prussian Army. He bore the titles \"Prince of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, Duke of Saxony\" with the style \"Highness\".\n\nBirth and family\nPrince Bernhard was born in Weimar the second son of Charles Augustus, Hereditary Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach and his wife Princess Pauline of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach. He was the younger brother of the last Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, William Ernest. His grandparents on his father's side were the reigning Grand Duke Charles Alexander and his wife Princess Sophie of the Netherlands, through whom he was in the line of succession to the Dutch throne.\n\nSuitor to Dutch Queen Wilhelmina\nClosely related to the Dutch Royal Family from a young age Prince Bernhard was seen as the ideal husband to the young Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands and was brought up to look upon himself as her future consort, with her mother Queen Emma a proponent of the match. Although an engagement was reported to be close on numerous occasions the young Queen was not a fan of the match describing her cousin Prince Bernhard as \"not handsome\" and \"not sensible\".When Queen Wilhelmina did not return Prince Bernhard's affection he was reported to have become depressed, dying at the age of 22 in Weimar. His sudden death was reported to be the result of tuberculosis although there were rumors he may have committed suicide. Shortly after his death Queen Wilhelmina's engagement was announced to Duke Henry of Mecklenburg-Schwerin.\n\nAncestry\nPassage 10:\nPrincess Pauline of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach\nPrincess Pauline of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach (Pauline Ida Marie Olga Henriette Katherine; 25 July 1852 – 17 May 1904) was the wife of Charles Augustus, Hereditary Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach.\n\nEarly life\nShe was a daughter of Prince Hermann of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach and his wife, Princess Augusta of Württemberg.\n\nHereditary Grand Duchess\nOn 26 August 1873 at Friedrichshafen, Baden-Württemberg, Pauline married Charles Augustus, Hereditary Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach. They were second cousins, as she was the paternal granddaughter of Prince Bernhard, younger brother of the Charles Frederick, Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, the grandfather of Karl August.\nPauline and Charles Augustus had two sons:\n\nWilhelm Ernst Karl Alexander Friedrich Heinrich Bernhard Albert Georg Hermann, Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach (Weimar, 10 June 1876 – Heinrichau, 24 April 1923); married firstly Princess Caroline Reuss of Greiz (no issue), and secondly Princess Feodora of Saxe-Meiningen (had issue).\nPrince Bernhard Karl Alexander Hermann Heinrich Wilhelm Oscar Friedrich Franz Peter (Weimar, 18 April 1878 – Weimar, 1 October 1900); died unmarried at the age of 22.Charles Augustus died on 22 November 1894 of inflammation of the lungs, at the age of 50. He never succeeded as Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach. Consequently, Pauline was always known as Hereditary Grand Duchess, or after his death, Dowager Hereditary Grand Duchess. Their elder son William Ernest succeeded as Grand Duke.\n\nWidowhood\nIn her final years, Pauline spent a lot of time in Italy, and was a frequent visitor to the Italian court. It was rumored that she entered into a morganatic marriage with her chamberlain. This marriage did not appear in the Almanach de Gotha, and was not approved by her son the Grand Duke. Consequently, the marriage was not sanctioned by the Saxe-Weimar government. She continued to be styled as Dowager Hereditary Grand Duchess only by courtesy, as she was unpopular with her family and her son's subjects.Though she lived much of her widowhood away from the Saxe-Weimar court, Pauline \"contributed even from a distance, to create the difficulties which rendered the position of her daughter-in-law, the present Grand Duchess, so extremely difficult during the first few months of marriage\". She was described as \"extraordinarily fat, and one of the most plain-featured princesses of Germany, her homeliness being of the crabbed and sour order rather than of a genial nature\".On 17 May 1904, Pauline died suddenly of heart disease while on a train en route from Rome to Florence. Her body was taken to Florence.\n\nHonours\nRussian Empire: Grand Cross of the Order of St. Catherine, in Diamonds\n Württemberg: Dame of the Order of Olga, 1871\n\nAncestry", "answers": ["Soestdijk Palace"], "length": 6147, "dataset": "2wikimqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "9b357d3b583cd0dd72575f76173c48b9f8704ce7af37cac3"}

Johan Staël von Holstein and Julia Helena von der Pahlen. He was a member of the Staël von Holstein noble house which had then only recently joined the Swedish nobility.\nDuring his captivity in Russia he married the Countess Ingeborg Christina Horn af Rantzien in 1710, a daughter of the Field Marshal Henning Rudolf Horn von Rantzien, who had been taken captive with his daughters by the Russians during the Great Northern War.\nIn 1722 Staël von Holstein planned a marriage with Sofia Elisabeth Ridderschantz. However, the marriage was broken off because his wife Ingeborg from Russia, where she had been held captive to that point, returned. In 1731 Staël von Holstein was raised to the rank of baron.In 1761 his first wife died, and Staël married Sofia Elisabeth Ridderschantz. Anna Helena Juliana, the daughter of George Bogislaus Staël von Holstein, died at the age of five. With her this branch of the Staël von Holstein noble family died out.\n\nMilitary career\nStaël von Holstein began his military career on 20 February 1700 as a volunteer in the Swedish household guard. He was promoted to Unteroffizier (roughly equivalent to corporal) in the artillery. Staël von Holstein became a cornet in the Dragoon regiment of the province Ingria which was under the command of Otto Vellingk. He participated in the campaign in Livonia against the Russian and Saxon armies. He was promoted to Lieutenant in 1702 and a year later to Captain in the infantry regiment of Adam de la Gardie. This regiment was used in 1704 to free the besieged city of Narva from Russian troops. In April he was appointed commander of the grenadier company of this regiment.\nThe Swedish attack failed and Staël von Holstein was captured. He was held captive in prison camps in Siberia and later in the region of Moscow. Staël von Holstein succeeded in being exchanged for a Russian officer in 1711. His wife, her sisters and his father-in-law were not allowed to leave Russia, however. After his return Staël von Holstein was under the direct command of the Swedish King Charles XII, who was in exile in Bender and was dispatched by him to the Skaraborg regiment.\nIn 1713 Staël von Holstein was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel and in 1715 he invaded Schonen with the Skaraborg regiment. Two years later he was appointed colonel. In 1718 he participated with his regiment in the campaign against Norway and took part in the Siege of Frederiksten.\nIn 1719 the Skaraborg regiment was garrisoned in Göteborg. The attack of the Danish captain Peter Wessel Tordenskiold on the fortress of Nya Elfsborg was repulsed by his commander Johan Abraham Lillie with all his forces. The artillery division of the Skaraborg regiment began a counter-attack on the Danish navy on 24 July. They were so taken by surprise by artillery fire from land that the fleet withdrew and repulsed the attack.In 1720 Staël parted from the Swedish army and served in the following years under Duke Karl Friedrich von Holstein. He was a major general and commander in his bodyguard.\nIn 1733 Staël von Holstein was appointed colonel and commandant of Kalmar Castle. A year later he was governor of Kalmar.\nStaël was appointed major-general in 1734. In 1742 he was the leader of the political group the Caps.In 1743 Staël von Holstein was promoted to lieutenant general. He was also a Knight in the Royal Order of the Seraphim. In 1754 he was appointed governor of Malmöhus län and commandant of Malmö. He remained in this position until his death.\n\nCivilian life\nIn 1737 Staël built a textile factory in Kalmar. In 1742 he founded the glasswork company Kosta Glasbruk together with the governor of Kronobergs län, Anders Koskull Kosta. Later Staël bought in the province of Halland a large property as a family seat. This was situated in the neighborhood of Vapnö and is still in the property of his family.\nPassage 3:\nMathilda Staël von Holstein\nChristina Mathilda Staël von Holstein (1876–1953) was a Swedish lawyer. She was the second woman to become a lawyer in Sweden, the first being Eva Andén. She was known as a feminist throughout her lifetime.\n\nBiography\nShe was born in Kristianstad as the daughter of the nobleman and Colonel Axel Staël von Holstein and Cecilia Nordenfeldt and grew up in Värmland. She was orphaned early and left with responsibility for her eleven siblings, and never married.\nShe was a correspondent at a law firm, then an assistant and an accountant at the Stockholm City Health Board. She became a Candidate of Law in Stockholm in 1918. She was also a member of the Fredrika Bremer Association and chairman of the Stockholm Women's Association. From 1919 to 1923 she was a partner in Eva Andén's law firm. As a lawyer, she primarily worked on family law and property issues.One of the biggest problems for women to obtain government office during this time was that the law defined the applicant for such jobs as a \"Swedish man\". The Ministry of Justice formed a committee in 1919 to investigate and remove this barrier from the law through a change of constitution. The chairman of the committee was Emilia Broomé, the first woman to chair a government committee. Staël von Holstein was a committee member.

After the death of his mother, who died young, he was brought up by the Baroness Auguste de Staël, née Vernet. This aunt, although also a Protestant, exerted herself \"to make a large-minded Christian of him in the Church to which she did not belong\" (Monseigneur d'Hulst in Le Correspondant, 25 May 1895).\nBroglie studied at the École Polytechnique, leaving in 1855. Still young, he entered the navy; he was appointed ensign in 1857 and soon after lieutenant. After a voyage to New Caledonia in which he came in contact with active missions, he felt himself called to the religious life. He entered the Seminary of Saint Sulpice in Paris in 1867. After completing his studies there he was ordained priest on 18 October 1870. He was named professor of apologetics at the Institut Catholique in 1879. His teaching, which included philosophical, theological, biblical and historical themes, were intended to defend the Catholic faith from perceived attacks from Positivism and Rationalism. He maintained the harmony and autonomy of the two spheres of knowledge, religion and reason.\nIn his numerous publications the Abbé de Broglie was always a faithful defender of Catholic dogma. At the time of his death, which resulted from the violence of an insane person he had taken under his protection, he was preparing a book on the agreement of reason and faith.\nHis most important work is Problèmes et conclusions de l'histoire des religions (Paris, 1886). Of his other writings, some of which were pamphlets or articles in reviews, the following may be mentioned:\n\nLe positivisme et la science expérimentale (2 vol., París 1880-81)\nCours d’apologétique chrétienne (1883)\nLa Morale évolutionniste (1885)\nLa Morale sans Dieu (1886)\nLa Réaction contre le positivisme (1894)\n\"Religion de Zoroastre et religion védique\"\n\"Le bouddhisme\"\n\"Religions neo-brahmaniques de l'Inde\"\n\"L'islamisme\"; \"La vraie définition de la religion\"\n\"La transcendence du christianisme\"\n\"L'histoire religieuse d'Israël\"\n\"Les prophètes et les prophéties, d'après les travaux de Kuenen\"\n\"L'idée de Dieu dans l'Ancien et le Nouveau Testament\"\n\"Le présent et l'avenir du catholicisme en France\"Two posthumous publications, Religion et critique (1896) and Questions bibliques (1897)  were edited by the Abbé Piat.\nPassage 8:\nAlexander von Staël-Holstein\nAlexander Wilhelm Freiherr Staël von Holstein (Chinese: 鋼和泰, January 1, 1877, in Testama manor, Livonia, Russian Empire – March 16, 1937, in [[Beiping]], China); was a Baltic German aristocrat, Russian and Estonian orientalist, sinologist, and Sanskritologist specializing in Buddhist texts.\n\nLife\nRelated to Germaine de Staël's husband, the future baron was born in the Governorate of Livonia of the Russian Empire (present-day Estonia),in an aristocratic family (with widespread relations in other German Baltic provinces of the Russian Empire, Sweden and Northern Germany) on New Year's Day. He was educated at home during his childhood. When he reached 15, he was sent to a Gymnasium in the town of Pernau (now Pärnu). He pursued his higher education at the Dorpat University (Tartu), where some of his families had studied, majoring in comparative philology. After his graduation, he left for Germany, studying oriental languages in the Berlin University.\nPrussian public records of 1898 show that the young Baron was involved in a duel in Berlin, which he apparently survived. In his second year in Berlin, as the only male heir he inherited the family estate in Testama (now Tõstamaa) and the baronage. In 1900, he gained his doctorate with his dissertation Der Karmapradīpa, II. Prapāthaka from the University of Halle-Wittenberg. The first Prapāṭhaka of the Karmapradīpa had been translated in 1889 by  Friedrich Schrader, also as a dissertation in Halle. The supervisor of both dissertations was Professor Richard Pischel, at that time the world's leading expert on Prakrit, the ancient form of Sanskrit, and long-time head of the \"Deutsche Morgenländische Gesellschaft\", the German Orientalist Society.\nDuring the following years, Baron de Stael traveled widely and studied with the best oriental scholars in Germany, England and India.\nHe started his academic career in 1909 when he was appointed assistant professor of Sanskrit in the University of St. Petersburg and the member of the Russian Committee for the Exploration of Central and Eastern Asia. In 1912, he visited the US and lived in Harvard for some time to study Sanskrit.\nHe was in the Republic of China when the October Revolution broke out. The government of the new Estonian Republic, established in 1918 after the Treaty of Versailles, left him only a small part of his inherited estate. He then accepted an Estonian citizenship but remained in Beijing. With the recommendation of his friend Charles Eliot, the then principal of the University of Hong Kong, he was invited by Hu Shih to teach Sanskrit, Tibetan, and the History of Indian Religion at Peking University as lecturer from 1918 to 1921 and as professor from 1922 to 1929. He helped set up the Sino-Indian Institute in Beijing in 1927. In 1928 he was a visiting scholar at Harvard University, helping the Harvard-Yenching Institute to collect books. In 1932, he was selected an Honorary Fellow of the Institute of History and Philology (歷史語言研究所), Academia Sinica.\nBesides his works on Indian and Tibetan religions, he also contributed to the field of historical Chinese phonology. His influential \"The Phonetic Transcription of Sanskrit Works and Ancient Chinese Pronunciation\" was translated by Hu Shih into Chinese and was published in Guoxue Jikan (Chinese: 國學季刊) in 1923.\n\nSelected works\nThe Kāçyapaparivarta: a Mahāyānasūtra of the Ratnakūṭa class, edited in the original Sanskrit, in Tibetan and in Chinese, Shanghai: Shangwu Yinshuguan, 1926\nOn a Tibetan text translated into Sanskrit under Ch'ien Lung (XIII cent.) and into Chinese under Tao Kuang (XIX cent.), Bulletin of the National Library of Peiping, 1932\nOn two Tibetan pictures representing some of the spiritual ancestors of the Dalai Lama and of the Panchen Lama, Bulletin of the National Library of Peiping, 1932\nA commentary to the Kāçcyapaparivarta, edited in Tibetan and in Chinese, Peking: published jointly by the National Library and the National Tsinghau University, 1933\nOn a Peking edition of the Tibetan kanjur which seems to be unknown in the West, Peking: Lazarist Press, 1934\nOn two recent reconstructions of a Sanskrit hymn transliterated with Chinese characters in the X century A.D, Peking: Lazarist Press, 1934\nTwo Lamaistic pantheons, edited with introduction and indexes by Walter Eugene Clark from materials collected by the late Baron A. von Staël-Holstein, Harvard-Yenching Institute monograph series 3 and 4, Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1937\n\nSee also\nList of Baltic German scientists\n\nNotes\nPassage 9:\nErik Magnus Staël von Holstein\nBaron Erik Magnus Staël von Holstein, (25 October 1749, Loddby, Sweden – 9 May 1802, Poligny, France) was a Swedish diplomat, soldier and courtier best known for being Sweden's Ambassador to France during the end of the Ancien Regime and the early years of the French Revolution, as well as being the husband of Madame de Staël. Erik Magnus assisted Gustav III during the Swedish Revolution of 1772 and was later named Chamberlain to Queen Sophia Magdalena. In 1783, he was appointed chargé d'affaires to the Court of France, and in 1785 he was named Ambassador. On 21 January 1786, he married the daughter of the French Minister of Finance, Jacques Necker, mademoiselle Anne Louise Germaine Necker, who was to achieve fame as \"Madame de Staël\".\n\nEarly life\nErik Magnus was born on 25 October 1749 as the seventh child of Mathias Gustav Staël von Holstein, the scion of an ancient noble family originally from the Rhineland. As a young officer, Staël participated in the 1772 coup that brought Gustav III to power. For his services, he was made a knight of the Order of the Sword and chamberlain to the Queen. He was later assigned to the Swedish embassy to France, serving under the ambassador, Gustaf Philip Creutz. Staël's charming manners, good looks and affable disposition soon impressed Creutz and many members of the French court, including Queen Marie Antoinette herself.\n\nLife and marriage\nAfter five years of negotiation between Staël, the King of Sweden, Marie Antoinette, and Jacques Necker, Staël agreed to marry Germaine. He obtained a dowry of 650,000 livres, was made permanent Swedish ambassador to the Court of Louis XVI, and was invested with the Order of the Polar Star.The marriage solved Staël’s financial problems (he was a prolific gambler) but was largely loveless, although not acrimonious. Baron and Madame de Staël pursued other love interests, and were often at odds over politics, but remained friendly to each other. Staël remained ambassador to France through the early convulsions of the French Revolution. Staël had a stormy relationship with Gustav III and he often found himself caught between the interests of his politically active and liberal wife, the ever-changing government of Republican France, and the counter-revolutionary position of the King of Sweden. Staël was dismissed as ambassador to France in 1795 by the young Gustav IV Adolf. For the remainder of his life, Staël ran up enormous debts due to his gambling and relied financially on the Neckers.In early 1802, Staël fell ill. His wife invited him back to the Necker family retreat at Coppet in the hopes that he would recover. In the late spring of 1802, Staël suffered a stroke on his way to Switzerland. Madame de Staël faithfully looked after him until he died, on the night of 8 May 1802. Though they were never really close, his death greatly affected his wife and she had him buried at Coppet.Staël was described by his wife and his contemporaries as a handsome man of polished manners, possessed of great wit and charm, kind-hearted, generous, and cultured with a great knowledge of history, fine wines and politics. He was a consummate and talented diplomat, who so greatly impressed the future-First Lady of the United States, Abigail Adams, who accompanied her husband John Adams, then US minister plenipotentiary to France, that she described him in letters home as: \"The Baron de Staël, the Swedish ambassador, comes nearest to that character, in his manners and personal appearance, of any gentleman I ever saw. The first time I saw him I was prejudiced in his favor, for his countenance commands your good opinion; it is animated, intelligent, sensible, affable and, without being perfectly beautiful, is perfectly agreeable; add to this a fine figure and who can fail in being charmed with the Baron de Staël?\" However, he could also be weak-willed and lacking in self-control. \nStaël successfully negotiated the cession of Saint Barthélemy to Sweden and supported the proposal of William Bolts for a Swedish colony in the eastern Indian Ocean. He skillfully navigated the troubled waters of the first years of the French Revolution. In his time, he was acknowledged as a diplomat of great talent, but ultimately he was destined to be overshadowed by the brilliance of his wife.\n\nChildren\nGustava Sofia Magdalena, born 1787, died in infancy.\nGustava Hedvig, born 1789, died in infancy.\nLudvig August, born on 1 September 1790.

He has been the CEO of the multi-level marketing company Crowd1, which has been identified as an illegal pyramid scheme in a number of countries. As of December 2020 he claims to have left Crowd1.\n\nEarly life\nStaël von Holstein was born in Halmstad. He lived in Spain between the ages of 2 and 8, after which his family moved back to Sweden. After his military service he worked as a travel guide in the French and Austrian alps, and in Spain. At the age of 24 he was in a car accident and had to use a wheelchair for three months.He returned to Sweden, and studied information technology at Lund University for a time. In 1989, he began his studies at Stockholm Business School, Stockholm University, majoring in marketing management. In an interview in 2012, he claimed that he had bribed his way into Stockholm Business School.He is married and has two children. He lives in Marbella and Madrid, Spain, and has previously lived in Holland, Thailand, Singapore, and Switzerland.\n\nCareer\nStaël von Holstein began his career at the media and investment company Kinnevik, working for Jan Stenbeck for several years. He was the marketing director of Kinnevik's TV channel Z-TV, and then became the CEO of the start-up teletext company InTV (Interactive television). Staël von Holstein was vice president of Inlux, in Luxemburg, and then went on to become responsible for Banque Invik's sales and credit card operations.At the end of 1995, Staël von Holstein left Kinnevik to found the web design company Icon Medialab together with Jesper Jos Olsson, Erik Wickström, and Magnus Lindahl. In 1998 he was included on a list of 12 \"Global Leaders of Tomorrow\" published by Chief Executive magazine.He moved back to Stockholm in 2004 to start the business incubator IQube.He was an independent, right-wing columnist for the Stockholm edition of the newspaper Metro until 2008.\n\nEntrepreneurship\nIcon Media Lab\nAt the end of 1995, Staël von Holstein left the Kinnevik Group to found Icon Medialab together with Jesper Jos Olsson, Erik Wickström, and Magnus Lindahl.[6]. \nThe company went public in 1999 and continued rapid expansion with a US$70 million investment into the Asian market in 2000. At its peak the company had over 3,000 employees in 32 offices in cities around the globe. In 2001 its shares plunged more than 98% from their early 2000 peak and it axed around 500 jobs. In December 2001 shares of the debt-ridden company were suspended from the Stockholm stock exchange. The company was merged with rival Dutch web company Lost Boys in a reverse takeover to form a new Dutch-based company under CEO Rens Buchwaldt, and re-capitalized through a £12.4 million rights issue.\n\nLetsBuyIt.com\nIn 1998 Staël von Holstein founded LetsBuyIt, an online price comparison platform that enabled its users to share, compare, and buy various products.  LetsBuyIt floated on Germany's Neuer Markt in July 2000, raising about US$60 million from a planned target of US$180 million in its initial public offering. It sought protection under the Dutch Bankruptcy Code (Faillissementswet) in December of the same year. After deferring bankruptcy through 2001, on 4 March 2002 it declared bankruptcy. Its staff had been reduced from 450 to 25.\n\nIQube\nIn 2004, Staël von Holstein started IQube, which quickly grew into one of the largest private incubators in Europe with a portfolio of more than 100 companies, but by 2009 IQube was wound-up, with Staël von Holstein's entire scheme described as \"a fraud\".\n\nMyCube\nStaël von Holstein founded MyCube in 2008, a digital life management tool for exchanging, sharing and selling content. MyCube was the first decentralized social exchange that prioritized privacy, ownership, and user freedom to monetize on their own creativity in contrast to centralized networks as Facebook etc. MyCube raised over US$8 million in funds in May 2011, then in August 2012 filed for voluntary liquidation.\n\nCrowd1\nIn 2019, Staël von Holstein was identified as the CEO of the multi-level marketing company Crowd1, on the company's official YouTube channel as well as in a message sent to the members of the marketing network at the end of 2019.In November 2019, Norway's gaming and foundation authority, Lotteri- og stiftelsestilsynet, determined that Crowd1 operates with a pyramid structure to generate revenue. In January 2020, in Burundi's largest city Bujumbura, Crowd1 was raided and over 300 people arrested, 17 of whom were placed in custody for promoting Crowd1, described as a Ponzi scheme.In Paraguay on 6 February 2020 the Comisión Nacional de Valores (CNV) issued a securities fraud warning against Crowd1, advising against investment. CNV identifies Crowd1 as an unregistered securities offering. Promoters of Crowd1 in Paraguay face up to three years imprisonment or a fine. On 21 February 2020 the Bank of Namibia declared Crowd1 a pyramid scheme and warned the promoters to stop their activities immediately. The bank stated  \"Crowd1 does not sell tangible products or render any service of essential value, but the primary source of income for Crowd1 is the sale of membership packages to new members\".On 12 May 2020 the Philippines Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) directed Crowd1 Asia Pacific to immediately stop its “fraudulent” investing-taking activities. On 1 June 2020 the Gabon Ministry of the Economy and Finance warned against the activities of Crowd1, stating that \"these services are akin to pyramid scam systems in network marketing in which the profit does not come from the sales activity but from the recruitment of new members. Thus, only the designers of said systems derive the benefits to the detriment of members.\" On 5 June 2020 the New Zealand Financial Markets Authority added Crowd1 and Impact Crowd Technology to its warning list due to concerns they may be involved in or operating a scam.In June 2020 Vietnam’s Competition and Consumer Protection Department issued a warning against the activities of Crowd1, stating that \"these operations were likely to be pyramid schemes and were prohibited according to the established regulations\". \nIn July 2020 the government of Côte d’Ivoire banned Crowd1 from operation in Côte d'Ivoire, determining its sales system to be a Ponzi scheme. On 3 December 2020 Národná banka Slovenska, the central bank of the Slovak Republic, issued a securities fraud warning on the activities of Crowd1 Network Ltd and Impact Crowd Technology S.L.In November 2020, Staël von Holstein claimed not to be the CEO of Crowd1 but of the parent company Impact Crowd Technology, as well as of Tecnología de Impacto Multiple SL which was \"the sole provider of Crowd1 products\".

During his career he played for Sporting de Gijón and Sevilla FC (1929–1946), and earned 3 caps and scored 2 goals for the Spain national football team, and participated in the 1934 FIFA World Cup.\nHe later became manager of Sevilla FC.\n\nHonours\nSevilla\n\nLa Liga: 1945–46\nCopa del Rey: 1935, 1939\nPassage 2:\nMirza Faiz Muhammad\nMirza Faiz Muhammad, also known by his title of Azādud Daulah, was an Indian nobleman and official in the Mughal empire during the 18th century. He was a descendant of Mirza Hadi Baig and the great-great grandfather of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad of Qadian.\n\nLife and reign\nDuring Faiz Muhammad's life, Qadian had developed close relations with Delhi. Faiz Muhammad was successful in suppressing the anarchy that prevailed in the Punjab during this period as a result of which, in 1716, the Mughal Emperor Farrukhsiyar conferred upon him the rank of Haft Hazārī which authorised him to keep regular force of 7,000 soldiers. He was also conferred the title Azādud Daulah (Strong Arm of the Government) by the Emperor.\nPassage 3:\nMuhammad I Tapar\nAbu Shuja Ghiyath al-Dunya wa'l-Din Muhammad ibn Malik-Shah (Persian: ابو شجاع غیث الدنیا و الدین محمد بن ملک شاه, romanized: Abū Shujāʿ Ghiyāth al-Dunyā wa ’l-Dīn Muḥammad ibn Malik-Šāh; 1082 – 1118), better known as Muhammad I Tapar (محمد اول تاپار), was the sultan of the Seljuk Empire from 1105 to 1118. He was a son of Malik-Shah I (r. 1072–1092) and Taj al-Din Khatun Safariya. In Turkish, Tapar means \"he who obtains, finds\".\n\nReign\nMuhammad was born in January 1082. He succeeded his nephew, Malik Shah II, as Seljuq Sultan in Baghdad, and thus was theoretically the head of the dynasty, although his brother Ahmad Sanjar in Khorasan held more practical power. Muhammad I probably allied himself with Radwan of Aleppo in the battle of the Khabur River against Kilij Arslan I, the sultan of Rüm, in 1107, in which the latter was defeated and killed. Following the internecine conflict with his half brother, Barkiyaruq, he was given the title of malik and the provinces of Armenia and Azerbaijan. Dissatisfied by this he revolted again, but had to flee back to Armenia. By 1104, Barkiyaruq, ill and tired of war, agreed to divide the sultanate with Muhammad. Muhammad became sole sultan following the death of Barkiyaruq in 1105.\nIn 1106, Muhammad conquered the Ismaili fortress of Shahdiz, and ordered the Bavandid ruler Shahriyar IV to participate in his campaign against the Ismailis. Shahriyar, greatly angered by the message Muhammad sent him, refused to aid him against the Ismailis. Shortly after, Muhammad sent an army headed by Amir Chavli, who tried to capture Sari but was unexpectedly defeated by an army under Shahriyar and his son Qarin III. Muhammad then sent a letter, which requested Shahriyar to send one of his sons to the Seljuq court in Isfahan. He sent his son Ali I, who impressed Muhammad so much that he offered him his daughter in marriage, but Ali refused and told him to grant the honor to his brother and heir of the Bavand dynasty, Qarin III. Qarin III then went to the Isfahan court and married her.\nIn 1106/1107, Ahmad ibn Nizam al-Mulk, the son of the famous vizier Nizam al-Mulk, went to the court of Muhammad I to file a complaint against the rais (head) of Hamadan. When Ahmad arrived to the court, Muhammad I appointed him as his vizier, replacing Sa'd al-Mulk Abu'l-Mahasen Abi, who had been recently executed on suspicion of heresy. The appointment was due mainly to the reputation of Ahmad's father. He was then given various titles which his father held (Qewam al-din, Sadr al-Islam and Nizam al-Mulk).\nMuhammad I, along with his vizier Ahmad, later campaigned in Iraq, where they defeated and killed the Mazyadid ruler Sayf al-dawla Sadaqa ibn Mansur, who bore the title \"king of the Arabs\". In 1109, Muhammad I sent Ahmad and Chavli Saqavu to capture the Ismaili fortresses of Alamut and Ostavand, but they failed to achieve any decisive result and withdrew. Ahmad was shortly replaced by Khatir al-Mulk Abu Mansur Maybudi as vizier of the Sejluq Empire. According to Ali ibn al-Athir (a historian who lived about a hundred years later), Ahmad then retired to a private life in Baghdad, but, according to the contemporary biographer, Anushirvan ibn Khalid, Muhammad I had Ahmad imprisoned for ten years.Muhammad I died in 1118 and was succeeded by Mahmud II, although after Muhammad I's death Sanjar was clearly the chief power in the Seljuq realms.\n\nFamily\nOne of Muhammad's wives was Gawhar Khatun, the daughter of Isma'il, son of Yaquti. Another wife was Qutlugh Khatun. Another wife was Nistandar Jahan Khatun. She was the mother of Sultan Ghiyath ad-Din Mas'ud and Fatimah Khatun. After Muhammad's death Mengubars, the governor of Iraq, married her. Their daughter Fatimah married Abbasid Caliph Al-Muqtafi in 1137, and died in September 1147. Another of his daughters married Arslan Shah, son of Kirman Shah, and the grandson of Qavurt.\n\nLegacy and assessment\nMuhammad was the last Seljuk ruler to have strong authority in the western part of the sultanate. The Seljuk realm was in a dire state after Muhammad's death, according to bureaucrat and writer Anushirvan ibn Khalid (died in 1137/1139); \"In Muhammad's reign the kingdom was united and secure from all envious attacks; but when it passed to his son Mahmud, they split up that unity and destroyed its cohesion. They claimed a share with him in the power and left him only a bare subsistence.\" Muhammad is mainly portrayed in a positive light by contemporary historians. According to the historian Imad ad-Din al-Isfahani (died in 1201), Muhammad was \"the perfect man of the Seljuk dynasty and their strongest steed\".Muhammad's ceaseless campaigns inspired one of his poets, Iranshah, to compose the Persian epic poem of Bahman-nama, an Iranian mythological story about the constant battles between Kay Bahman and Rostam's family. This implies that the work was also written to serve as advice for solving the socio-political issues of the time.\nPassage 4:\nFaiz Muhammad\nFaiz Muhammad (23 September 1937 – 29 October 2014) was a Pakistani freestyle wrestler. He was from 5 AK regt (HAIDER DIL BN). During his time, he was one of the  National Champions and Army Champions of Pakistan.\n\nEarly life and career\nMuhammad was born in 1937 in the Kandi (Rajauri district area of Jammu and Kashmir) and migrated to Azad Kashmir after the partition of British India in 1947. His family settled Iin Khanpur village, present day Kotli District of Azad Kashmir. \nIn June 1953, he was enlisted at training center number 3 of Azad Kashmir Regular Forces at Sohawa town (a village at that time). He had his first success in wrestling by winning the Pakistan Army Training Centres Wrestling Championship, an army-level competition. In the same year, he won the National and Army Wrestling Championships. He won the Army Championship every year from 1954 to 1984 and won several gold medals. At Pakistani national level, he is the only one who has this-record of Army Championships. From 1953 to 1986, he won the National Wrestling Championship for 33 years.\nPassage 5:\nFaiz Mohammad Khan\nFaiz Muhammad Khan Bahadur, (r.1742–1777) the third Nawab of Bhopal, was the son of Yar Muhammad Khan, the second Nawab of Bhopal (as a reagent), and the stepson of Mamola Bai a very influential Hindu wife of Yar Muhammad and a direct descendant of Dost Mohammad Khan.\n\nSee also\nMuhammad Shah\nAlamgir II\nPassage 6:\nCatherine I of Russia\nCatherine I Alekseevna Mikhailova (Russian: Екатери́на I Алексе́евна Миха́йлова, tr. Ekaterína I Alekséyevna Mikháylova; born Polish: Marta Helena Skowrońska, Russian: Ма́рта Самуи́ловна Скавро́нская, tr. Márta Samuílovna Skavrónskaya; 15 April [O.S. 5 April] 1684 – 17 May [O.S. 6 May] 1727) was the second wife and empress consort of Peter the Great, and empress regnant of Russia from 1725 until her death in 1727.\n\nLife as a servant\nThe life of Catherine I was said by Voltaire to be nearly as extraordinary as that of Peter the Great himself. Only uncertain and contradictory information is available about her early life. Said to have been born on 15 April 1684 (o.s. 5 April), she was originally named Marta Helena Skowrońska. Marta was the daughter of Samuel Skowroński (later spelled Samuil Skavronsky), a Roman Catholic farmer from the eastern parts of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, born to Minsker parents. In 1680 he married Dorothea Hahn at Jakobstadt. Her mother is named in at least one source as Elizabeth Moritz, the daughter of a Baltic German woman and there is debate as to whether Moritz's father was a Swedish officer. It is likely that two stories were conflated, and Swedish sources suggest that the Elizabeth Moritz story is probably incorrect. Some biographies state that Marta's father was a gravedigger and handyman, while others speculate that he was a runaway landless serf.\nMarta's parents died of the plague around 1689, leaving five children. According to one of the popular versions, at the age of three Marta was taken by an aunt and sent to Marienburg (the present-day Alūksne in Latvia, near the border with Estonia and Russia) where she was raised by Johann Ernst Glück, a Lutheran pastor and educator who was the first to translate the Bible into Latvian. In his household she served as a lowly servant, likely either a scullery maid or washerwoman.  No effort was made to teach her to read and write and she remained illiterate throughout her life.\nMarta was considered a very beautiful young girl, and there are accounts that Frau Glück became fearful that she would become involved with her son. At the age of seventeen, she was married off to a Swedish dragoon, Johan Cruse or Johann Rabbe, with whom she remained for eight days in 1702, at which point the Swedish troops were withdrawn from Marienburg. When Russian forces captured the town, Pastor Glück offered to work as a translator, and Field Marshal Boris Sheremetev agreed to his proposal and took him to Moscow.\nThere are unsubstantiated stories that Marta worked briefly in the laundry of the victorious regiment, and also that she was presented in her undergarments to Brigadier General Rudolph Felix Bauer, later the Governor of Estonia, to be his mistress. She may have worked in the household of his superior, Sheremetev. It is not known whether she was his mistress, or household maid.  She travelled back to the Russian court with Sheremetev's army.Afterwards she became part of the household of Prince Alexander Menshikov, who was the best friend of Peter the Great of Russia. Anecdotal sources suggest that she was purchased by him. Whether the two of them were lovers is disputed, as Menshikov was already engaged to Darya Arsenyeva, his future wife. It is clear that Menshikov and Marta formed a lifetime alliance.\nIt is possible that Menshikov, who was quite jealous of Peter's attentions and knew his tastes, wanted to procure a mistress on whom he could rely. In any case, in 1703, while visiting Menshikov at his home, Peter met Marta. In 1704, she was well established in the Tsar's household as his mistress, and gave birth to a son, Peter. In 1703, she converted to Orthodoxy and took the new name Catherine Alexeyevna (Yekaterina Alexeyevna). She and Darya Menshikova accompanied Peter and Menshikov on their military excursions.\n\nMarriage and family life\nThough no record exists, Catherine and Peter are described as having married secretly between 23 October and 1 December 1707 in Saint Petersburg. They had twelve children, two of whom survived into adulthood, Anna (born 1708) and Elizabeth (born 1709).\nPeter had moved the capital to St. Petersburg in 1703. While the city was being built he lived in a three-room log cabin with Catherine, where she did the cooking and caring for the children, and he tended a garden as though they were an ordinary couple. The relationship was the most successful of Peter's life and a great number of letters exist demonstrating the strong affection between Catherine and Peter. As a person she was very energetic, compassionate, charming, and always cheerful. She was able to calm Peter in his frequent rages and was often called in to do so.\nCatherine went with Peter on his Pruth Campaign in 1711. There, she was said to have saved Peter and his Empire, as related by Voltaire in his book Peter the Great. Surrounded by overwhelming numbers of Turkish troops, Catherine suggested before surrendering, that her jewels and those of the other women be used in an effort to bribe the Ottoman grand vizier Baltacı Mehmet Pasha into allowing a retreat.\nMehmet allowed the retreat, whether motivated by the bribe or considerations of trade and diplomacy. In any case Peter credited Catherine and proceeded to marry her again (this time officially) at Saint Isaac's Cathedral in St. Petersburg on 9 February 1712.  She was Peter's second wife; he had previously married and divorced Eudoxia Lopukhina, who had borne him the Tsarevich Alexis Petrovich. Upon their wedding, Catherine took on the style of her husband and became Tsarina. When Peter elevated the Russian Tsardom to Empire, Catherine became Empress. The Order of Saint Catherine was instituted by her husband on the occasion of their wedding.\n\nIssue\nCatherine and Peter had twelve children, all of whom died in childhood except Anna and Elizabeth:\n\nPeter Petrovich (1704–1707), died in infancy\nPaul Petrovich (October 1705–1707), died in infancy\nCatherine Petrovna (7 February 1707–7 August 1708)\nGrand Duchess Anna Petrovna (27 January 1708–15 May 1728)\nGrand Duchess Elizabeth Petrovna (29 December 1709–5 January 1762)\nGrand Duchess Mary Natalia Petrovna (20 March 1713–17 May 1715)\nGrand Duchess Margaret Petrovna (19 September 1714–7 June 1715)\nGrand Duke Peter Petrovich (9 November 1715–6 May 1719)\n\nGrand Duke Paul Petrovich (13 January 1717–14 January 1717)\nGrand Duchess Natalia Petrovna (31 August 1718–15 March 1725)\nGrand Duke Peter Petrovich (7 October 1723–7 October 1723)\nGrand Duke Paul Petrovich (1724–1724)\n\nSiblings\nUpon Peter's death, Catherine found her four siblings, Krystyna, Anna, Karol, and Fryderyk, gave them the newly created titles of Count and Countess, and brought them to Russia.\n\nKrystyna Skowrońska, renamed Christina (Russian: Христина) Samuilovna Skavronskaya (1687–14 April 1729), had married Simon Heinrich (Russian: Симон Гейнрих) (1672–1728) and their descendants became the Counts Gendrikov.\nAnna Skowrońska, renamed Anna Samuilovna Skavronskaya, had married one Michael-Joachim N and their descendants became the Counts Efimovsky.\nKarol Skowroński, renamed Karel Samuilovich Skavronsky, was created a Count of the Russian Empire on 5 January 1727 and made a Chamberlain of the Imperial Court; he had married Maria Ivanovna, a Russian woman, by whom he had descendants who became extinct in the male line with the death of Count Paul Martinovich Skavronskyi (1757-1793), father of Princess Catherine Bagration.\nFryderyk Skowroński, renamed Feodor Samuilovich Skavronsky, was created a Count of the Russian Empire on 5 January 1727 and was married twice: to N, a Lithuanian woman, and to Ekaterina Rodionovna Saburova, without having children by either of them.\n\nReign as empress regnant\nCatherine was crowned in 1724. The year before his death, Peter and Catherine had an estrangement over her support of Willem Mons, brother of Peter's former mistress Anna, and brother to one of the current ladies in waiting for Catherine, Matryona. He served as Catherine's secretary. Peter had fought his entire life to clear up corruption in Russia. Catherine had a great deal of influence over who could gain access to her husband. Willem Mons and his sister Matryona had begun selling their influence to those who wanted access to Catherine and, through her, to Peter. Apparently this had been overlooked by Catherine, who was fond of both. Peter found out and had Willem Mons executed and his sister Matryona exiled. He and Catherine did not speak for several months. Rumors flew that she and Mons had had an affair, but there is no evidence for this.\nPeter died (28 January 1725 Old Style) without naming a successor. Catherine represented the interests of the \"new men\", commoners who had been brought to positions of great power by Peter based on competence. A change of government was likely to favor the entrenched aristocrats. For that reason during a meeting of a council to decide on a successor, a coup was arranged by Menshikov and others in which the guards regiments with whom Catherine was very popular proclaimed her the ruler of Russia. Supporting evidence was \"produced\" from Peter's secretary Makarov and the Bishop of Pskov, both \"new men\" with motivation to see Catherine take over. The real power, however, lay with Menshikov, Peter Tolstoy, and other members of the Supreme Privy Council.\nCatherine viewed the deposed empress Eudoxia as a threat, so she secretly moved her to Shlisselburg Fortress near St. Petersburg to be put in a secret prison under strict custody as a state prisoner.\n\nDeath\nCatherine I died two years after Peter I, on 17 May 1727 at age 43, in St. Petersburg, where she was buried at St. Peter and St. Paul Fortress. Tuberculosis, diagnosed as an abscess of the lungs, caused her early demise.\nBefore her death she recognized Peter II, the grandson of Peter I and Eudoxia, as her successor.\n\nAssessment and legacy\nCatherine was the first woman to rule Imperial Russia, opening the legal path for a century almost entirely dominated by women, including her daughter Elizabeth and granddaughter-in-law Catherine the Great, all of whom continued Peter the Great's policies in modernizing Russia.  At the time of Peter's death the Russian Army, composed of 130,000 men and supplemented by another 100,000 Cossacks, was easily the largest in Europe.  However, the expense of the military was proving ruinous to the Russian economy, consuming some 65% of the government's annual revenue.  Since the nation was at peace, Catherine was determined to reduce military expenditure.  For most of her reign, Catherine I was controlled by her advisers.  However, on this single issue, the reduction of military expenses, Catherine was able to have her way.  The resulting tax relief on the peasantry led to the reputation of Catherine I as a just and fair ruler.The Supreme Privy Council concentrated power in the hands of one party, and thus was an executive innovation. In foreign affairs, Russia reluctantly joined the Austro-Spanish league to defend the interests of Catherine's son-in-law, the Duke of Holstein, against Great Britain.\nCatherine gave her name to Catherinehof near St. Petersburg, and built the first bridges in the new capital. She was also the first royal owner of the Tsarskoye Selo estate, where the Catherine Palace still bears her name.\nThe city of Yekaterinburg is named after her, Yekaterina being the Russian form of her name.\nShe also gave her name to the Kadriorg Palace (German: Katharinental, meaning \"Catherine's Valley\"), its adjacent Kadriorg Park and the later Kadriorg neighbourhood of Tallinn, Estonia, which today houses the Presidential Palace of Estonia. The name of the neighbourhood is also used as a metonym for the institution of the President.\nIn general, Catherine's policies were reasonable and cautious.  The story of her humble origins was considered by later generations of tsars to be a state secret.\n\nSee also\nBibliography of Russian history (1613–1917)\nRulers of Russia family tree\n\nNotes\nPassage 7:\nAsif Panhwar\nAsif Panhwar was the General Secretary of the Jeay Sindh Student Federation JSMM and the son of Faiz Muhammad Panhwar.

He co-composed with Howard Talbot the successful Kitty Grey (1900).He continued to write songs and to receive recognition for them. The 1901 and 1902 BBC Promenade Concerts, \"The Proms\", included four of his compositions, namely Come back, sweet Love, The Mermaid, My Peggy and Private Donald.\nHis setting of My Ships, a poem by Ella Wheeler Wilcox, was performed by Clara Butt and republished several times. It also appeared four times, with different singers, in the 1913 and 1914 Proms.\n\nAmerica\nIn September 1904 he went to live in New York City, finding employment with shows on Broadway, including the following roles:\n\non-stage actor (Sir Benjamin Backbite) in Lady Teazle (1904-1905), a musical version of The School for Scandal;\nmusical director of The Little Michus (1907), also featuring songs by Barratt;\nco-composer of Miss Pocahontas (1907), a musical comedy;\nmusical director of The Love Cure (1909–1910), a musical romance;\ncomposer of The Girl and the Drummer (1910), a musical romance with book by George Broadhurst.

In 1924, he became a naturalized American citizen. He died on 12 April 1947 in New York City.\n\nNote on his first name\nThe book British Musical Biography by Brown & Stratton (1897) in its entry for John Barratt refers to \"his son William Augustus Barratt\" with details that make it clear that Walter Augustus Barratt is the same person and that a \"William\" Augustus Barratt is a mistake. For professional purposes up to about 1900 he appears to have written as \"W. Augustus Barratt\", and thereafter mostly as simply \"Augustus Barratt\".\nPassage 9:\nMolvi Faiz Muhammad\nMolvi Faiz Muhammad is a Pakistani politician who has been a Member of the Senate of Pakistan, since March 2018.\n\nPolitical career\nMuhammad was elected to the Senate of Pakistan as a candidate of Jamiat Ulema-e Islam (F) on general seat from Balochistan in 2018 Pakistani Senate election.

With a desire to be an actor, a young Sidney Olcott went to New York City where he worked in the theatre until 1904 when he performed as a film actor with the Biograph Studios.\nIn 1907, Frank J. Marion and Samuel Long, with financial backing from George Kleine, formed a new motion picture company called the Kalem Company and were able to lure the increasingly successful Olcott away from Biograph. Olcott was offered the sum of ten dollars per picture and under the terms of his contract, Olcott was required to direct a minimum of one, one-reel picture of about a thousand feet every week. After making a number of very successful films for the Kalem studio, including Ben Hur (1907) with its dramatic chariot race scene, and Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1908), Olcott became the company's president and was rewarded with one share of its stock.\nIn 1910 Sidney Olcott demonstrated his creative thinking when he made Kalem Studios the first ever to travel outside the United States to film on location.\nOf Irish ancestry, and knowing that in America there was a huge built-in Irish audience, Olcott went to Ireland where he made a film called A Lad from Old Ireland. He would go on to make more than a dozen films there and later on only the outbreak of World War I prevented him from following through with his plans to build a permanent studio in Beaufort, County Kerry, Ireland. The Irish films led to him taking a crew to Palestine in 1912 to make the first five-reel film ever, titled From the Manger to the Cross, the life story of Jesus.The film concept was at first the subject of much scepticism but when it appeared on screen, it was lauded by the public and the critics. Costing $35,000 to produce, From the Manger to the Cross earned the Kalem Company profits of almost $1 million, a staggering amount in 1912. The motion picture industry acclaimed him as its greatest director and the film influenced the direction many great filmmakers would take such as D.W. Griffith and Cecil B. DeMille. From the Manger to the Cross is still shown today to film societies and students studying early film making techniques. In 1998 the film was selected for the National Film Registry of the United States Library of Congress.\nDespite making the studio owners very rich men, they refused to increase his salary beyond the $150 a week he was then earning. From the enormous profits made for his employers, Olcott's dividend on the one share they had given him amounted to $350. As a result, Sidney Olcott resigned and took some time off, making only an occasional film until 1915 when he was encouraged by his Canadian friend Mary Pickford to join her at Famous Players–Lasky, later Paramount Pictures. The Kalem Company never recovered from the mistake of losing Olcott and a few years after his departure, the operation was acquired by Vitagraph Studios in 1916.\n\nOlcott was a founding member of the East Coast chapter of the Motion Picture Directors Association, a forerunner to today's Directors Guild of America and would later serve as its president. Like the rest of the film industry, Sidney Olcott moved to Hollywood, California, where he directed many more successful and acclaimed motion pictures with the leading stars of the day.\nOlcott married actress Valentine Grant, the star of his 1916 film, The Innocent Lie.\nDuring World War II, Olcott opened his home to visiting British Commonwealth soldiers in Los Angeles. In his book titled Stardust and Shadows: Canadians in Early Hollywood, writer Charles Foster tells of this period in Olcott's life, and of how he was introduced to many members of Hollywood's Canadian community through Olcott. Olcott died in Hollywood, California, in the house of his friend Robert Vignola where he lived after the death of Valentine Grant. Wanting to be buried in Canada, he is buried in Park Lawn cemetery in Toronto, Ontario.\n\nPartial filmography\n1907\n1908\n1909\n1910\n1911\n1912\n1913\n1914\n1915\n1916\n1918\n1919\nMarriage for Convenience (1919)\n\n1920\nScratch My Back (1920)\n\n1921\nThe Right Way (1921)\nGod's Country and the Law (1921)\nPardon My French (1921)\n\n1922\nTimothy's Quest (1922)\n\n1923\nThe Green Goddess (1923)\nLittle Old New York (1923)\n\n1924\nThe Humming Bird (1924)\nMonsieur Beaucaire (1924)\nThe Only Woman (1924)\n\n1925\nSalome of the Tenements (1925)\nThe Charmer (1925)\nNot So Long Ago (1925)\nThe Best People (1925)\n\n1926\nThe White Black Sheep (1926)\nRanson's Folly (1926)\nThe Amateur Gentleman (1926)\n\n1927\nThe Claw (1927)\n\nSee also\nCanadian pioneers in early Hollywood\nPassage 5:\nWhen Lovers Part\nWhen Lovers Part is an American silent film produced by Kalem Company and directed by Sidney Olcott with Gene Gauntier, Jack J.

It is set at a United States East Coast university. First screened at the 68th Venice International Film Festival and the Toronto International Film Festival, it opened in New York and Los Angeles on April 6, 2012.\n\nPlot\nNewly transferred college student Lily becomes friends with Violet, Heather and Rose, a clique who run the campus' suicide prevention center. They date less attractive men to help the men's confidence; they try to clean up the \"unhygenic\" Doar Dorm; they clash with the editor of the campus newspaper, The Daily Complainer, who wants to close down the \"elitist\" fraternities; and they try to start a new dance craze, The Sambola!\n\nCast\nDevelopment\nDamsels in Distress was Stillman's first produced feature since The Last Days of Disco (1998). In August 1998, he had moved from New York to Paris with his wife and two daughters. In that time, he wrote a novelization of The Last Days of Disco, in addition to several original film scripts which were not made, including one set in Jamaica in the 1960s. He resolved to make a lower-budgeted film in the style of his debut, Metropolitan (1990). In 2006, he met with Liz Glotzer and Mart Shafer at Castle Rock Entertainment, who had financed his second and third films. According to Shafer:\n\nWhit said, 'I want to write a movie about four girls in a dorm who are trying to keep things civil in an uncivil world.' It took him a year to write 23 pages. Six months later, a few more dribbled in. He just doesn't work very fast. Finally we had a draft. When we started production he said, 'I think 12 years is the right amount of time between movies.'\nCastle Rock provided most of the $3 million budget.\n\nProduction\nThe movie was filmed on location in New York City on Staten Island at the Sailors' Snug Harbor Cultural Center. Filming finished on November 5, 2010.Stillman has said that the film was cut between its festival and theatrical runs:\n\nI felt the MPAA helped us out there. I'd hoped to get a PG-13 even with the Venice cut, but in the first viewing they thought it was R. So we looked at it, the editor [Andrew Hafitz] and I, and we saw immediately some things that would make it pretty clearly PG-13, and we felt would help the movie. There could've been a little heaviness of talking a little too much about what was going on, and it would delay the laugh until later – which I think is always good. We were really happy with the small changes we made. We made tiny changes in two scenes: we took out the text for what the ALA stood for... I think it gave it a Lubitschean vagueness and delayed the laugh.\n\nMusic\nThe film features an original score by Mark Suozzo. The song \"Sambola!\" is written by Suozzo, Michael A. Levine, and Lou Christie.\n\nReception\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 75% based on reviews from 143 critics. The website's critics consensus reads, \"Damsels in Distress can sometimes feel mannered and outlandish, but it's redeemed by director Whit Stillman's oddball cleverness and Greta Gerwig's dryly funny performance.\" On Metacritic, it has a score of 67% based on reviews from 33 critics.In Variety, Leslie Felperin wrote, \"a film that raises laughs even with its end credits, Whit Stillman's whimsical campus comedy Damsels in Distress is an utter delight.\" In Time, critic Richard Corliss wrote, \"Innocence deserted teen movies ages ago, but it makes a comeback, revived and romanticized, in this joyous anachronism.\" Andrew O'Hehir of Salon praised Gerwig's \"powerful and complicated performance\" and said that \"it's both a relief and a delight to discover that Stillman remains one of the funniest writers in captivity.\" He concluded, \"I laughed until I cried, and you may too (if you don't find it pointless and teeth-grindingly irritating). Either way, Whit Stillman is back at last, bringing his peculiar brand of counterprogramming refreshment to our jaded age.\" Jordan Hoffman of About.com gave the film four stars out of five, calling Gerwig \"a massive, multi-faceted talent\" and the film a \"love it or hate it movie. Personally, I think the ones who aren't charmed to pieces by its endless banter and preposterous characters very much need our help to expand their tastes and accept a more enlightened purview of what, indeed, is refined and acceptable motion picture entertainment.\"\n\nNotes\nPassage 7:\nNigel Hess\nNigel John Hess (born 22 July 1953) is a British composer, best known for his television, theatre and film soundtracks, including the theme tunes to Campion, Maigret, Wycliffe, Dangerfield, Hetty Wainthropp Investigates, Badger and Ladies in Lavender.\n\nBiography\nHess was born in Weston-super-Mare, Somerset.

Both films were directed and written by Travis Mathews. The drama films both revolve around the friends and ex-lovers of Jesse Metzger, a gay man in his mid-30s who is forced to move back to his hometown from San Francisco due to financial reasons.\nThe actors' own names, along with much of their real-life stories, were used for their characters in both films, which features graphic sexual scenes. The production of both films was aided by the gay pornographic studio NakedSword. This led to the full-length film being refused exemption from classification, which would have allowed it to screen at the Melbourne Queer Film Festival, a decision to which actor James Franco (who invited Mathews to collaborate on Franco's film Interior. Leather Bar.) reacted negatively.\n\n2010 short film\nCast\nJesse Metzger as Jesse\nBrenden Gregory as Brenden\n\nPlot\nJesse and Brenden playfully negotiate their way toward having sex together for the first time on Metzger's last night in San Francisco before he returns to the Midwest.\n\n2012 film\nCast\nJesse Metzger as Jesse a performance-arts director and the main character, who's forced to move back to his hometown\nBrontez Purnell as Brontez, a friend of Jesse, who works at a clothing shop\nBen Jasper as Ben, Jesse's ex-boyfriend, who works in advertising and stops by to say goodbye\nKeith McDonald as Keith, Jesse's friend and roommate\nWayne Bumb as Wayne\nFerrin Solano as Ferrin, Wayne's boyfriend, who moves in with Wayne\nJorge Rodolfo as Jorge, Wayne's friend, of whom Ferrin is initially jealous, but who eventually joins Wayne and Ferrin for a threesome\nPeter Knegt as Peter, Jesse's one-night standOthers; \n\nShannon O'Malley as Shannon\nCourtney Trouble as Courtney\nBob Mathews as Jesse's Dad (voice)\nJustin Time as Boy Outside of Aunt Charlie's\nMike Ojeda as Boy Outside of Aunt Charlie's\nGinno Castro as Party Person\nRyan Crowder as Party Person\n\nPlot\nJesse Metzger, a gay man in his mid-30s who works in the domain of performance arts, finds himself forced to move back to his hometown because he can no longer afford living in San Francisco. As he plans his move, his best friend Wayne is having his boyfriend Ferrin move in. The two have trouble acclimating through the movie, and Ferrin is worried about Wayne's increasing interest in Jorge, a friend of Wayne.\nJesse discusses his fears about moving with his other roommate, Keith, who seems to always help Jesse by saying the right things. Meanwhile, Jesse is having trouble with his job, which involves creativity, a quality he is losing under all the pressure. He contacts his ex-boyfriend Ben to say goodbye. Ben is excited, and goes shopping to impress Jesse, where he meets with friend Brontez. The two chat and agree to meet in a goodbye party for Jesse, which Wayne had planned for later that night. Jesse, despite having reminisced his love-making with Ben, and Ben feel good about meeting each other, but upon meeting, they both realize their feelings are gone. Later that day, Ben calls Brontez to confirm seeing him later at night in Jesse's party.\nAt the party, Jesse does not show up and stays downstairs with Keith, who is leaving for the weekend. The guests arrive. Ferrin suggests a threesome with Wayne and Jorge, to which they both agree. During the sex, Jorge leaves the two lovers. Meanwhile, Ben and Brontez flirt and eventually have sex. Downstairs, Jesse wears Keith's clothes and lays down listening to music. Keith shows up, surprising Jesse. The two chat until their sexual tension reaches the point where they have sex, which is interrupted by Jesse, who tells Keith that this \"isn't what he wants.\"\nIn the morning, Ben picks up Jesse. On their way to the airport, Jesse laughs loudly, claiming he is, despite his fears, strangely excited.\n\nProduction\nI Want Your Love is about gay relationships among a group of San Francisco friends. The short film was released in April 2010, with the cooperation of NakedSword, a gay porn studio, and proceeded to be shown at a number of LGBT film festivals around the world. The full-length film was shown at a number of LGBT film festivals in 2012.\n\nRestriction in Australia\nThe Australian Classification Board denied I Want Your Love festival exemption for the Sydney Mardi Gras Film Festival. The move has been controversial, with critics highlighting the fact that Donkey Love, a documentary about zoophilia in Colombia, was permitted to screen at the Sydney Underground Film Festival. In 2013, actor James Franco spoke out in defense of the film, stating that the refusal to grant a festival exemption to the film was \"hypocritical\" and \"an embarrassment\".\nPassage 9:\nMatt Corboy\nMatt Corboy (born June 4, 1973) is an American actor. He has appeared in both films and television series.\n\nEarly life\nCorboy was born in Honolulu, Hawaii, and grew up there, before leaving to attend Colorado State University, where he earned a degree in business.\n\nCareer\nCorboy took up acting in 1996, and has appeared in many commercials, films, and had one-time guest roles in television series. His best-known role was on The Shield, where he appeared as Officer Ray Carlson in 17 episodes. In 2011, he played Cousin Ralph in The Descendants, which received widespread critical acclaim and multiple awards including an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay.\nWhile growing up in Hawaii, Corboy would play poker with his friends. His affinity for the game led to him becoming the lead commentator for the Professional Poker Tour in 2006.In mid–2017, Corboy was cast in the recurring character Jared Preston Jr. on the ABC soap opera General Hospital to help facilitate Rebecca Budig's character Hayden Barnes exit off of the soap.\n\nPersonal life\nCorboy has been married to Kara McNamara Corboy since August 4, 2001.\n\nFilmography\nFilm\nTelevision\nPassage 10:\nGus Meins\nGus Meins (March 6, 1893 – August 1, 1940), born Gustave Peter Ludwig Luley, was an American film director. He was born in Frankfurt, Germany.\n\nCareer\nMeins started out in the 'teens as a cartoonist for the Los Angeles Evening Herald before becoming a comedy writer for Fox Film in 1919.In the 1920s, Meins directed a number of silent short subjects film series for Universal Pictures, including the Buster Brown comedies. He is best known as senior director of Hal Roach's Our Gang comedies from 1934 to 1936, and also as director of Laurel and Hardy's Babes in Toyland (1934). His assistant director was a young Gordon Douglas, who became senior director in 1936 when Meins left Our Gang for other directing jobs at Roach. Meins left Roach in 1937 over creative differences.\n\nDeath\nIn the summer of 1940, Meins faced prosecution on \"morals charges\", having been accused of sex offenses against six youths. The director swore his innocence but stated that the case would ruin his career, regardless of the outcome. He left home on the night of Thursday, August 1 telling his son, Douglas: \"You probably won't see me again.\"\nMeins was found dead in his car on August 4, reportedly having committed suicide by inhaling carbon monoxide days earlier. Bizarrely, the circumstances of his death in a car from suffocation were reminiscent of the demise five years earlier of comedian Thelma Todd, whom he had frequently directed.\nHe was interred at Grand View Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California.He was generally remembered as 'a cheerful, convivial gentleman'. His son Douglas Meins (1918–1987) appeared in at least seven Republic and Warner films in the late 1930s and early 1940s; he then served in the U.S. Army Corps during World War II.\n\nSelected filmography\nFeature films:\n\nBabes in Toyland (1934), starring Laurel and Hardy\nHis Exciting Night (1939)\nThe Covered Trailer (1939)ZaSu Pitts/Thelma Todd shorts:\n\nSneak Easily (1933)\nAsleep in the Feet (1933)\nMaids à la Mode  (1933)\nOne Track Minds (1933)Thelma Todd/Patsy Kelly shorts:\n\nBeauty and the Bus (1933)\nBacks to Nature (1933)\nAir Fright (1933)\nBabes in the Goods (1934)\nSoup and Fish (1934)\nMaid in Hollywood (1934)\nI'll Be Suing You (1934)\nThree Chumps Ahead (1934)\nOne-Horse Farmers (1934)\nDone In Oil (1934)\nAn All-American Toothache (1936)\nHill-Tillies (1936)Our Gang shorts:", "answers": ["no"], "length": 4132, "dataset": "2wikimqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "ef06eb197dec40c7fd672fcd6a3c2780917ec8c686049956"}
{"input": "What nationality is the performer of song Mimi (Song)?", "context": "Passage 1:\nO Valencia!\n\"O Valencia!\" is the fifth single by the indie rock band The Decemberists, and the first released from their fourth studio album, The Crane Wife.\nThe music was written by The Decemberists and the lyrics by Colin Meloy. It tells a story of two star-crossed lovers. The singer falls in love with a person who belongs to an opposing gang. At the end of the song, the singer's lover jumps in to defend the singer, who is confronting his lover's brother (the singer's \"sworn enemy\") and is killed by the bullet intended for the singer.\n\nTrack listing\nThe 7\" single sold in the UK was mispressed, with \"Culling of the Fold\" as the B-side despite the artwork and record label listing \"After the Bombs\" as the B-side.\n\nMusic videos\nFor the \"O Valencia!\" music video, The Decemberists filmed themselves in front of a green screen and asked fans to complete it by digitally adding in background images or footage. Stephen Colbert of The Colbert Report, having recently asked fans to do the same with a video of him with a light saber in front of a green screen, brought up The Decemberists on his segment \"Look Who's Riding on My Coattails Now\" and accused the band of stealing the idea. The Decemberists' response was to challenge Stephen Colbert to a guitar solo showdown on December 20, 2006, on The Colbert Report.On January 19, 2007, The Decemberists premiered an alternate music video of \"O Valencia!\", directed by Aaron Stewart-Ahn, on MTV2. The video follows a character named Patrick, played by Meloy, as he and his love Francesca (Lisa Molinaro), daughter of \"the Boss\", plan an escape to an unknown location. At a cafe, a man in a suit, portrayed by the band member Chris Funk, tells him to hide in the \"Valencia\" hotel (the Super Value Inn on North Interstate Avenue in Portland, Oregon) while he gets them the necessary documentation to escape. Above the name of the hotel, there is a neon sign that reads \"Office\". The letters have all burnt out except for the \"O\", creating the title of the song. The video then introduces other characters - various assassination teams - who sit in different rooms of the hotel waiting for the chance to catch the two lovers. Most are portrayed by other members of the band (along with Meloy's wife, Carson Ellis). They kill off any potential witnesses to their plan. Patrick manages to take down one member from each team, before they gang up on him. The Boss arrives, along with the man from the cafe, who reveals that he snitched on Patrick and Francesca. They execute Francesca, while forcing Patrick to watch. After they leave, Patrick finds a note by Francesca, which reveals that she never fell in love with him, and only wanted protection. 2 months later, Patrick and the man, who has lost an eye from a previous assassination attempt, have a sit-down at the same cafe. The man reveals that he snitched on Patrick just to take over the town. Patrick reveals that he poisoned a drink the man was having, but before he could get away, the man stabs Patrick in the neck with a fork before dying, followed by Patrick.\nThe video is somewhat influenced by the distinct style and themes of director Wes Anderson, with bold fonts being used to introduce characters and groups on the bottom of the screen (much like in the film The Royal Tenenbaums). The band had previously (and more explicitly) drawn influence from Anderson's Rushmore in their video for \"Sixteen Military Wives\". The layout of the hotel is also similar to the one used in Bottle Rocket.\nKurt Nishimura was chosen as the winner by mtvU for his video that depicted a love affair between a woman and her television, with the TV containing the green-screened Decemberists video footage.\nPassage 2:\nMimi (song)\n\"Mimi\" is a popular song written by Richard Rodgers, with words by Lorenz Hart. It was featured in the movie Love Me Tonight (1932), in which it was first sung by Maurice Chevalier to Jeanette MacDonald, then later reprised by the entire company. Sergio Franchi performed this song January 2, 1964 \non the ABC Television special, Victor Borge At Carnegie Hall. Sergio Franchi also recorded \"Mimi\" on his 1963 RCA Victor Red Seal album. Women In My Life.\nPassage 3:\nCaspar Babypants\nCaspar Babypants is the stage name of children's music artist Chris Ballew, who is also the vocalist and bassist of The Presidents of the United States of America.\n\nHistory\nBallew's first brush with children's music came in 2002, when he recorded and donated an album of traditional children's songs to the nonprofit Program for Early Parent Support titled \"PEPS Sing A Long!\" Although that was a positive experience for him, he did not consider making music for families until he met his wife, collage artist Kate Endle. Her art inspired Ballew to consider making music that \"sounded like her art looked\" as he has said. Ballew began writing original songs and digging up nursery rhymes and folk songs in the public domain to interpret and make his own. The first album, Here I Am!, was recorded during the summer of 2008 and released in February 2009.\nBallew began to perform solo as Caspar Babypants in the Seattle area in January 2009. Fred Northup, a Seattle-based comedy improvisor, heard the album and offered to play as his live percussionist.  Northrup also suggested his frequent collaborator Ron Hippe as a keyboard player. \"Frederick Babyshirt\" and \"Ronald Babyshoes\" were the Caspar Babypants live band from May 2009 to April 2012. Both Northup and Hippe appear on some of his recordings but since April 2012 Caspar Babypants has exclusively performed solo. The reasons for the change were to include more improvisation in the show and to reduce the sound levels so that very young children and newborns could continue to attend without being overstimulated. \nBallew has made two albums of Beatles covers as Caspar Babypants. Baby Beatles! came out in September 2013 and Beatles Baby! came out in September 2015.\nBallew runs the Aurora Elephant Music record label, books shows, produces, records, and masters the albums himself. Distribution for the albums is handled by Burnside Distribution in Portland, Oregon.\nCaspar Babypants has released a total of 17 albums. The 17th album, BUG OUT!, was released on May 1, 2020. His album FLYING HIGH! was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Children's Album. All 17 of the albums feature cover art by Ballew's wife, Kate Endle.\n\"FUN FAVORITES!\" and \"HAPPY HITS!\" are two vinyl-only collections of hit songs that Caspar Babypants has released in the last couple of years.\n\nDiscography\nAlbumsPEPS (2002)\nHere I Am!

He is the grandson of Frank Carney and uncle of singer Claire Sproule.\n\nBiography\nBorn and raised in Derry, Northern Ireland, at the age of 18 he moved to Dublin in Ireland, where he attended university. Growing up, he listened to Bob Dylan, Bert Jansch, the Beatles, British folk songs and traditional Irish music. It was in Dublin that he entered the music scene which was prominent in Ireland at the time. As a teenager he had met the Ó Domhnaill family during trips to the Gaeltacht area of Rann na Feirste in Co. Donegal, and while in Dublin they formed a band, Skara Brae who would go on to have a great effect on Irish traditional music.\nDáithí is well known as a guitarist and was one of the first guitarists to use the DADGAD guitar tuning for Irish music after the originator Davy Graham. In 1992 he joined Irish supergroup Altan with whom he sings and plays guitar. Of his use of DADGAD tuning, Sproule says, it \"just seemed to instantly gel with Irish music. The nature of the tuning meant that you didn't really produce anything that was terribly, drastically, offensively wrong to people. I was always a singer, but when I started playing with instrumentalists in sessions and pubs, I was able to develop a style by just playing along with them quietly and tactfully.\" He was deemed \"a seminal figure in Irish music\" by The Rough Guide to Irish Music.\nSproule is also a member of various other bands and has recorded further solo albums; he also teaches DADGAD guitar and traditional songs at the Center for Irish Music in St. Paul, Minnesota.\n\nDiscography\nSolo albums\nThe Crow in the Sun (2007)\nLost River, Vol. 1 (New Folk, 2011)\nA Heart Made of Glass (1995)\n\nwith Altan\nOther bands\nBright and Early (with Paddy O'Brien and Nathan Gourley - 2015 - New Folk Records)\nFrom Uig to Duluth (with Laura MacKenzie and Andrea Stern - 2014)\nThe Pinery (with Laura MacKenzie – 2009 – New Folk Records)\nSeanchairde (with Tara Bingham and Dermy Diamond – 2008 – New Folk Records)\nFingal (with Randal Bays and James Keane – 2008 – New Folk Records)\nSnug in the Blanket (with Jamie Gans and Paddy O'Brien – 2004)\nOverland (with Randal Bays – 2004)\nTrian II (with Liz Carroll and Billy McComiskey – 1995)\nA Thousand Farewells (with Martin and Christine Dowling – 1995)\nTrian (with Liz Carroll and Billy McComiskey – 1992)\nStranger at the Gate (with Paddy O'Brien – 1988)\nThe Iron Man (with Tommy Peoples – 1984)\nCarousel (with Seamus and Manus McGuire – 1984)\nSpring in the Air (with James Kelly and Paddy O'Brien – 1981)\nIs it Yourself?

He is the singer and occasionally guitarist and bassist of crossover thrash band M.O.D., and was the singer of its predecessor, Stormtroopers of Death. Prior to these bands, Milano played in early New York hardcore band the Psychos, which also launched the career of future Agnostic Front vocalist Roger Miret. Milano was also the singer of United Forces, which included his Stormtroopers of Death bandmate Dan Lilker. Milano managed a number of bands, including Agnostic Front, for whom he also co-produced the 1997 Epitaph Records release Something's Gotta Give and roadie for Anthrax.\n\nDiscography\nStormtroopers of Death albums\nStormtroopers of Death videos\nMethod of Destruction (M.O.D.)\nMastery\nPassage 9:\nMaurice Chevalier\nMaurice Auguste Chevalier (French: [moʁis ʃəvalje]; 12 September 1888 – 1 January 1972) was a French singer, actor and entertainer. He is perhaps best known for his signature songs, including \"Livin' In The Sunlight\", \"Valentine\", \"Louise\", \"Mimi\", and \"Thank Heaven for Little Girls\" and for his films, including The Love Parade, The Big Pond, The Smiling Lieutenant, One Hour with You and Love Me Tonight. His trademark attire was a boater hat and tuxedo.\nChevalier was born in Paris. He made his name as a star of musical comedy, appearing in public as a singer and dancer at an early age before working in menial jobs as a teenager. In 1909, he became the partner of the biggest female star in France at the time, Fréhel. Although their relationship was brief, she secured him his first major engagement, as a mimic and a singer in l'Alcazar in Marseille, for which he received critical acclaim by French theatre critics. In 1917, he discovered jazz and ragtime and went to London, where he found new success at the Palace Theatre.\nAfter this, he toured the United States, where he met the American composers George Gershwin and Irving Berlin and brought the operetta Dédé to Broadway in 1922. He developed an interest in acting and had success in Dédé. When talkies arrived, he went to Hollywood in 1928, where he played his first American role in Innocents of Paris. In 1930, he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor for his roles in The Love Parade (1929) and The Big Pond (1930), which secured his first big American hits, \"You Brought a New Kind of Love to Me\" and \"Livin' in the Sunlight, Lovin' in the Moonlight\".\nIn 1957, he appeared in Love in the Afternoon, which was his first Hollywood film in more than 20 years. In 1958, he starred with Leslie Caron and Louis Jourdan in Gigi. In the early 1960s, he made eight films, including Can-Can in 1960 and Fanny the following year. In 1970, he made his final contribution to the film industry where he sang the title song of the Disney film The Aristocats. He died in Paris, on 1 January 1972, from complications of a suicide attempt.\n\nEarly life\nChevalier was born on September 12, 1888, in Paris to Victor Charles Chevalier (1854-), a French house painter, and Joséphine (née Van Den Bossche, 1852–1929) a lace-maker of Belgian (Flemish) descent. He had two brothers, Charles (1877-1938) and Paul (1884–1969). Victor, an alcoholic, deserted the family in 1896, leaving Joséphine to feed and take care of the children on her own; forced to work much longer hours, she was hospitalized for overwork in 1898. Charles, the eldest, took over some responsibilities but was married in 1900, leaving his mother to take care of Maurice and Paul on her own.\nPaul was forced to find work, and eventually secured a job at a metal-engraving factory; the brothers became very close with their mother during this time, nicknaming her \"La Louque\", which Maurice would later name his Marnes-la-Coquette estate after. Determined to be an acrobat, Maurice left school aged ten but was convinced to abandon this after a severe injury. He tried a number of other jobs: a carpenter's apprentice, an electrician, a printer, and even as a doll painter. Chevalier was eventually able to hold down a job at a mattress factory, and became interested in performing; while daydreaming his finger was crushed in a machine and he was forced to stop working.While recovering, in 1900, he offered his services as a performer to the skeptical owner of a nearby cafe. Chevalier performed his first song there, V'la Les Croquants, although his performance was met with laughter as he had sung three octaves too high. Discouraged, Maurice returned home, where his mother and brother Paul encouraged him to continue practicing. He continued singing, unpaid, at the café until a member of the theatre saw him and suggested he try for a local musical. Chevalier got the part, and began to make a name as a mimic and a singer. His act in l'Alcazar in Marseille was so successful, on his return to Paris he was met by an admiring crowd.\nIn 1909, he became the partner of the biggest female star in France, Fréhel. However, due to her alcoholism and drug addiction, their liaison ended in 1911. Chevalier later said that he became addicted to cocaine during this time, a habit he was able to quit because he had no access to the drug as a prisoner of war in World War I. After splitting with Fréhel, he then started a relationship with 36-year-old Mistinguett at the Folies Bergère, where he was her younger dance partner; they eventually played out a public romance.\n\nWorld War I\nWhen World War I broke out, Chevalier was in the middle of his national service, already in the front line, where he was wounded by shrapnel in the back in the first weeks of combat and was taken as a prisoner of war in Germany for two years, where he learned English. In 1916, he was released through the secret intervention of Mistinguett's admirer, King Alfonso XIII of Spain, the only king of a neutral country who was related to both the British and German royal families.In 1917, Chevalier became a star in le Casino de Paris and played before British soldiers and Americans. He discovered jazz and ragtime and started thinking about touring the United States. In the prison camp, he had studied English and had an advantage over other French artists. He went to London, where he found new success at the Palace Theatre, even though he still sang in French.\n\nParis and Hollywood\nAfter the war, Chevalier went back to Paris and created several songs still known today, such as \"Valentine\" (1924). He played in a few pictures, including Chaplin's A Woman of Paris (1923), a rare drama for Chaplin, in which his character of The Tramp does not appear, and made an impression in the operetta Dédé. He met the American composers George Gershwin and Irving Berlin and brought Dédé to Broadway in 1922. The same year he met Yvonne Vallée, a young dancer, who became his wife in 1927.\nWhen Douglas Fairbanks was on honeymoon in Paris in 1920, he offered him star billing with his new wife Mary Pickford, but Chevalier doubted his own talent for silent movies (his previous ones had largely failed). When sound arrived, he made his Hollywood debut in 1928. He signed a contract with Paramount Pictures and played his first American role in Innocents of Paris. In 1930, he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor for his roles in The Love Parade (1929) and The Big Pond (1930). The Big Pond gave Chevalier his first big American hit songs: \"Livin' in the Sunlight, Lovin' in the Moonlight\" with words and music by Al Lewis and Al Sherman, plus \"A New Kind of Love\" (or \"The Nightingales\"). He collaborated with film director Ernst Lubitsch. He appeared in Paramount's all-star revue film Paramount on Parade (1930).\n\nWhile Chevalier was under contract with Paramount, his name was so recognized that his passport was featured in the Marx Brothers film Monkey Business (1931). In this sequence, each brother uses Chevalier's passport, and tries to sneak off the ocean liner where they were stowaways by claiming to be the singer—with unique renditions of \"You Brought a New Kind of Love to Me\" with its line \"If the nightingales could sing like you\". In 1931, Chevalier starred in a musical called The Smiling Lieutenant with Claudette Colbert and Miriam Hopkins. Despite the disdain audiences held for musicals in 1931, it proved a successful film.In 1932, he starred with Jeanette MacDonald in Paramount's film musical One Hour With You, which became a success and one of the films instrumental in making musicals popular again. Due to its popularity, Paramount starred Maurice Chevalier in another musical called Love Me Tonight (also 1932), and again co-starring Jeanette MacDonald. It is about a tailor who falls in love with a princess when he goes to a castle to collect a debt and is mistaken for a baron. Featuring songs by Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart, it was directed by Rouben Mamoulian, who, with the help of the songwriters, was able to put into the score his ideas of the integrated musical (a musical which blends songs and dialogue so the songs advance the plot). It is considered one of the greatest film musicals of all time.\nIn 1934, he starred in the first sound film of the Franz Lehár operetta The Merry Widow, one of his best-known films, though he felt his role was too narrow and repetitive. He then signed with MGM for The Man from the Folies Bergère, his own favourite of his films. After a disagreement over his star-billing, he returned to France in 1935 to resume his music-hall career.\nEven when he was the highest-paid star in Hollywood, Chevalier had a reputation as a penny-pincher. He later admitted that he was hesitant to spend money on things such as changing the blade of his razor as he had grown up in poverty, remarking that \"poverty is a disease that can never be cured.\"  When not playing around with young chorus-girls, he actually felt quite lonely, and sought the company of Adolphe Menjou and Charles Boyer, also French, but both much better educated than Chevalier. Boyer in particular introduced him to art galleries and good literature, and Chevalier would try to copy him as the man of taste. But at other times, he would 'revert to type' as the bitter and impoverished street-kid he was at heart. When performing in English, he always put on a heavy French accent, although his normal spoken English was quite fluent and sounded more American.In 1937, Chevalier married the dancer Nita Raya. He had several successes, such as his revue Paris en Joie in the Casino de Paris. A year later, he performed in Amours de Paris. His songs remained big hits, such as \"Prosper\" (1935), \"Ma Pomme\" (1936) and \"Ça fait d'excellents français\" (1939).\n\nWorld War II\nChevalier continued performing for as long as he could freely, retreating to the free zone in the south of France with his Jewish wife and her parents as well as some friends following the 1940 invasion by German Nazi troops. During this time, patriotic songs such as \"Ça sent si bon la France\" and \"Paris sera Toujours Paris\" became popular, and he held charity balls and performed to raise money for resistance efforts. Chevalier consistently refused to perform for the Vichy France collaborators, and feigned illness, but eventually, out of fear for the safety of his wife and her parents, he reluctantly agreed to a deal. He refused to perform on the collaborating station Radio Paris, but agreed to perform for prisoners of war at the very camp in which he had been incarcerated during World War I. The performance was given in exchange for the release of ten French prisoners.In 1942, Chevalier was named on a list of French collaborators with Germany to be killed during the war, or tried after it. That year he moved to La Bocca, near Cannes, but returned to the capital city in September. In 1944 when Allied forces freed France, Chevalier was accused of collaboration. The August 28, 1944, issue of Stars and Stripes, the daily newspaper of U.S. armed forces in the European Theater of Operations, reported in error that \"Maurice Chevalier Slain By Maquis, Patriots Say\". Even though he was acquitted by a French convened court, the English-speaking press remained hostile and he was refused a visa for several years. In a review of the 1969 Oscar-nominated documentary film about French collaboration Le chagrin et la pitié (The Sorrow and the Pity), Simon Heffer draws attention to “a clip of Maurice Chevalier explaining, entirely dishonestly, to an anglophone audience how he had not collaborated.”\nIn his own country, however, he was still popular. In 1946, he split from Nita Raya and, at the age of 58, began writing his memoirs, which took many years to complete.\n\nHe started to collect and paint art, and acted in Le silence est d'or (Man About Town) (1946) by René Clair. He toured throughout the United States and other parts of the world, then returned to France in 1948.\nIn 1944, he had participated in a Communist demonstration in Paris. He was therefore even less popular in the U.S. during the McCarthyism period; in 1951, he was refused re-entry into the U.S. because he had signed the Stockholm Appeal.\nIn 1949, he performed in Stockholm in a Communist benefit against nuclear arms. Also in 1949, Chevalier was the subject of the first official roast at the New York Friars' Club, although celebrities had been informally \"roasted\" at banquets since 1910.In 1952, he bought a large property in Marnes-la-Coquette, near Paris, and named it La Louque, as a homage to his mother's nickname. He started a relationship in 1952 with Janie Michels, a young divorcee with three children.\nIn 1954, after the McCarthy era abated, Chevalier was welcomed back in the United States. His first full American tour was in 1955, with Vic Schoen as arranger and musical director. The Billy Wilder film Love in the Afternoon (1957) with Audrey Hepburn and Gary Cooper, was his first Hollywood film in more than 20 years.In 1957, Chevalier was awarded The George Eastman Award, given by George Eastman House for distinguished contribution to the art of film.\nChevalier appeared in the movie musical Gigi (1958) with Leslie Caron and Hermione Gingold, with whom he shared the song \"I Remember It Well\", and several Walt Disney films. The success of Gigi prompted Hollywood to give him an Academy Honorary Award that year for achievements in entertainment. In 1957, he appeared as himself in an episode of The Jack Benny Program titled \"Jack in Paris\". He also appeared as himself in an episode of The Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour, titled \"Lucy Goes to Mexico\".\n\nFinal years\nIn the early 1960s, he toured the United States and between 1960 and 1963 made eight films, including Can-Can (1960) with Frank Sinatra. In 1961, he starred in the drama Fanny with Leslie Caron and Charles Boyer, an updated version of Marcel Pagnol's \"Marseilles Trilogy\". In 1962, he filmed Panic Button (not released until 1964), playing opposite Jayne Mansfield. In 1965, at age 77, he made another world tour. In 1967 he toured in Latin America, again, the US, Europe and Canada, where he appeared as a special guest at Expo 67. The following year, on October 1, 1968, he announced his farewell tour.\nHistorical newsreel footage of Chevalier appeared in the 1969 Marcel Ophüls documentary The Sorrow and the Pity. In a wartime short film near the end of the film's second part, he explained his disappearance during World War II, as rumors of his death lingered at that time, and he emphatically denied any collaboration with the Nazis. His theme song, \"Sweepin' the Clouds Away\", from the film Paramount on Parade (1930), was one of the film's theme songs and was played in the end credits of the second part.\nIn 1970, two years after his retirement, songwriters Richard M. and Robert B. Sherman convinced him to sing the title song of the Disney film The Aristocats, which ended up being his final contribution to the film industry.\n\nDeath and burial\nChevalier suffered from bouts of depression throughout his adult life. On March 7, 1971, he attempted suicide by overdosing on barbiturates. Rushed to the hospital, Chevalier was saved but suffered liver and kidney damage as a result of the drug. In the following months, he suffered memory lapses, chronic tiredness, and spent much of his time alone. On December 12, he fell ill and was taken to Paris's Necker Hospital and placed on dialysis. By December 30, doctors announced his kidneys were no longer responding to dialysis. Too frail for a transplant, he underwent surgery as a last-ditch effort to save his life. It was unsuccessful; Chevalier died from a cardiac arrest following kidney surgery on New Year's Day 1972, aged 83.\nHe is interred in the cemetery of Marnes-la-Coquette in Hauts-de-Seine, outside Paris, France with his mother, \"La Louque\".Chevalier has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1651 Vine Street.Author Michael Freedland later claimed in his 1981 biography of Chevalier that the actor Felix Paquet, who became close to Chevalier during the 1960s, cut off contact with all of his friends and family in hopes of securing access to his fortune. Freedland alleges that Paquet, eighteen years Chevalier's junior, intercepted mail and withheld information about Maurice's health in the months before his death.\n\nNotable songs\n\n\n== Selected filmography ==\nPassage 10:\nKristian Leontiou\nKristian Leontiou (born February 1982) is an English singer. Formerly a solo artist, he is the lead singer of indie rock band One eskimO.\n\nEarly life\nKristian Leontiou was born in London, England and is of Greek Cypriot descent. He went to Hatch End High School in Harrow and worked several jobs in and around London whilst concentrating on music when he had any free time.  In 2003 he signed a major record deal with Polydor. At the time, Leontiou was dubbed \"the new Dido\" by some media outlets. His debut single \"Story of My Life\" was released in June 2004 and reached #9 in the UK Singles Chart. His second single \"Shining\" peaked at #13 whilst the album Some Day Soon was certified gold selling in excess of 150,000 copies.\nLeontiou toured the album in November 2004 taking him to the US to work with L.A Reid, Chairman of the Island Def Jam music group.  Unhappy with the direction his career was going, on a flight back from the US in 2004 he decided to take his music in a new direction.  Splitting from his label in late 2005, he went on to collaborate with Faithless on the song \"Hope & Glory\" for their album ‘'To All New Arrivals'’.  It was this release that saw him unleash the One eskimO moniker.  It was through working with Rollo Armstrong on the Faithless album, that Rollo got to hear an early demo of \"Astronauts\" from the One eskimO project. Being more than impressed by what he heard, Rollo opened both his arms and studio doors to Leontiou and they began to co-produce the ‘'All Balloons’' album.\nIt was at this time that he paired up with good friend Adam Falkner, a drummer/musician, to introduce a live acoustic sound to the album. They recorded the album with engineer Phill Brown (engineer for Bob Marley and Robert Plant) at Ark studios in St John's Wood where they recorded live then headed back to Rollo's studio to add the cinematic electro touches that are prominent on the album.\nShortly after its completion, One eskimO's \"Hometime\" was used on a Toyota Prius advert in the USA. The funds from the advert were then used to develop the visual aspect of One eskimO. He teamed up with friend Nathan Erasmus (Gravy Media Productions) along with animation team Smuggling Peanuts (Matt Latchford and Lucy Sullivan) who together began to develop the One eskimO world, the first animation produced was for the track ‘Hometime’ which went on to win a British animation award in 2008.\nIn 2008 Leontiou started a new management venture with ATC Music. By mid-2008 Time Warner came on board to develop all 10 One eskimO animations which were produced the highly regarded Passion Pictures in London.  Now with all animation complete and a debut album, One eskimO prepare to unveil themselves fully to the world in summer 2009.\nLeontiou released a cover version of Tracy Chapman's \"Fast Car\", which was originally released as a single in 2005. Leontiou's version was unable to chart, however, due to there being no simultaneous physical release alongside the download single, a UK chart rule that was in place at the time. On 24 April 2011, the song entered the singles chart at number 88 due to Britain's Got Talent contestant Michael Collings covering the track on the show on 16 April 2011.\n\nDiscography\nAlbums\nSingles\nNotes\nA  - Originally released as a single in April 2005, Leontiou's version of \"Fast Car\" did not chart until 2011 in the UK.\n\nAlso featured on\nNow That's What I Call Music! 58 (Story of My Life)\nWin a Date with Tad Hamilton!

{"input": "Who lived longer, Werner Mensching or Karel Zich?", "context": "Passage 1:\nKarel Zich\nKarel Zich (10 June 1949 – 13 July 2004) was a Czech singer, guitarist and composer whose voice was often compared with that of Elvis Presley.\n\nLife\nKarel Zich was born in Prague, Czechoslovakia, into a musical family. His grandfather was Otakar Zich, composer and professor of music aesthetics, and his uncle was the composer Jaroslav Zich. Karel attended the Prague State Conservatory (Státní konzervatoř Praha) for three years and later graduated from Charles University in sociology.Between 1964 and 1965 he performed with the band Framus as a singer. In 1968 Zich joined Spirituál kvintet and stayed with them until 1973. His main interest was in rock'n'roll, and he is sometimes called the \"Czech Elvis\".After his successes in the Czech pop scene with various bands, Zich decided to start his solo career. In 1974 he left Spirituál kvintet and in 1976 released his first album, Dům č.5 (House No. 5). Although he sang his own songs, he also worked with famous composers Karel Svoboda, Petr Janda, and others.In 1975 Zich reached the top of his career by winning 4th place in Zlatý Slavík. In 1979 he founded the band Flop and recorded 50 singles and 15 albums, one with the legendary Wanda Jackson. During his career Zich sold over one million discs and performed at thousands of concerts in most European countries, the United States, Canada, Brazil, Chile and elsewhere. His most famous songs are Paráda (Awsome) and Měla na očích brýle. Twice took 2nd place in the country's top music festival and song contest, Bratislavská lýra, in 1977 and 1983.In his last years he often performed guitar solos and sometimes performed with his band. In 1992 he joined Spirituál kvintet again.\n\nDeath\nKarel Zich died of complications following a heart attack during a diving holiday in Porto-Vecchio, Corsica.\n\nSelected discography\nLet's Have a Party in Prague (with Wanda Jackson) – 1988\nPassage 2:\nKarol Hochberg\nKarol Hochberg (1911–1944, also Karl or Karel) was a collaborator during the Holocaust, who led the \"Department for Special Affairs\" within the Ústredňa Židov, the Judenrat in Bratislava which was created by the Nazis to direct the Jewish community of Slovakia.\n\nLife\nHochberg was born in Hungary in 1911 and studied in Vienna and Prague. He moved to Slovakia in 1939. In 1940, the Slovak Jews were forced to form the Ústredňa Židov (ÚŽ), a Judenrat, to implement Nazi orders. Most of the members of the ÚŽ had been prominent in Jewish public life before the Holocaust, and worked on public relief for Jews who had been dispossessed by anti-Jewish measures. However, the ÚŽ's reputation was harmed by the Jews within it who informed or collaborated, of whom Hochberg was the most notorious, according to YIVO (Institute for Jewish Research). In early 1941, the first head of the ÚŽ was deposed and arrested for sabotaging a census of Jews in eastern Slovakia with an aim to remove them to the west of the country. His replacement was an ineffectual schoolteacher named Arpad Sebestyen, who took a position of complete collaboration with the Germans. Hochberg was appointed to lead the \"Department for Special Affairs\",  which was created to ensure the prompt implementation of Dieter Wisliceny's orders; he promptly organized the census and removal, tarnishing the ÚŽ's reputation in the Jewish community. Due to Sebestyen's ineffectuality, Hochberg's department came to dominate the operations of the ÚŽ.In 1942, Hochberg's department worked on categorizing Jews for deportation, but it did not actually draw up the lists. About 57,000 Jews, two-thirds of the population, were deported that year; only a few hundred survived. Later, Hochberg played an important role in negotiations between the Bratislava Working Group, the resistance group within the ÚŽ, and Wisliceny. Hochberg, who made regular visits to Wisliceny's office, was the only feasible option because contact with Wisliceny had to be done clandestinely. The Working Group employed him as an intermediary despite its intense dislike and distrust of Hochberg, its fear that associating with him would harm their reputations, and its belief that he was unreliable.In November 1942, as the Working Group began to negotiate the Europa Plan with Wisliceny in an effort to save all European Jews from deportation and death, Hochberg was arrested for bribery and corruption. According to the Slovak police records, Hochberg had an illegal account in which large bribes were deposited in return for the cessation of transports. Andrej Steiner, a member of the Working Group, distrusted Hochberg and had provided the Slovak police with evidence against him. However, his colleague Michael Dov Weissmandl advocated that the Working Group try to get Hochberg released; Weissmandl believed that he was useful and was concerned that he would reveal the negotiations. The leader of the Working Group, Gisi Fleischmann, sided with Steiner, and the Working Group did not intervene on Hochberg's behalf. Imprisoned at Nováky labor camp and later Ilava prison, Hochberg escaped during the Slovak National Uprising and joined the partisans. He was executed as a collaborator by Jewish partisans.\nPassage 3:\nMaximus of Tyre\nMaximus of Tyre (Greek: Μάξιμος Τύριος; fl. late 2nd century AD), also known as Cassius Maximus Tyrius, was a Greek rhetorician and philosopher who lived in the time of the Antonines and Commodus, and who belongs to the trend of the Second Sophistic.  His writings contain many allusions to the history of Greece, while there is little reference to Rome; hence it is inferred that he lived longer in Greece, perhaps as a professor at Athens. Although nominally a Platonist, he is really a sophist rather than a philosopher, although he is still considered one of the precursors of Neoplatonism.\n\nWritings\nThe Dissertations\nThere exist 41 essays or discourses on theological, ethical, and other philosophical subjects, collected into a work called The Dissertations. The central theme is God as the supreme being, one and indivisible though called by many names, accessible to reason alone:\nIn such a mighty contest, sedition and discord, you will see one according law and assertion in all the earth, that there is one God, the king and father of all things, and many gods, sons of God, ruling together with him.\nAs animals form the intermediate stage between plants and human beings, so there exist intermediaries between God and man, viz. daemons, who dwell on the confines of heaven and earth. The soul in many ways bears a great resemblance to the divinity; it is partly mortal, partly immortal, and, when freed from the fetters of the body, becomes a daemon. Life is the sleep of the soul, from which it awakes at death. The style of Maximus is superior to that of the ordinary sophistical rhetorician, but scholars differ widely as to the merits of the essays themselves.Dissertation XX discusses \"Whether the Life of a Cynic is to Be Preferred\". He begins with a narrative of how Prometheus created mankind, who initially lived a life of ease \"for the earth supplied them with aliment, rich meadows, long-haired mountains, and abundance of fruits\" – in other words, a Garden of Eden that resonates with Cynic ideas. It was \"a life without war, without iron, without a guard, peaceful, healthful unindigent\".\nThen, taking perhaps from Lucretius, he contrasts that Garden to mankind's \"second life\", which started with the division of the earth into property, which they then enclosed into fortifications and walls, and started to wear jewellery and gold, built houses, “molested the earth by digging into it for metals”, and invaded the sea and the air (killing animals, fish and birds), in what he described as a “slaughter and all-various gore, pursuing gratification of the body”. Humans became unhappy and, to compensate, sought wealth, “fearing poverty...dreading death...neglecting the care of life...They blamed base actions but did not abstain from them and “the hated to live, but dreaded to die”.He then contrasts the two lives – that of the original Garden and of the “second life” he has just described and asks, which man would not choose the first, who “knows that by the change he shall be liberated from a multitude of evils” and what he calls “a dreadful prison of unhappy men, confined to a dreadful prison of unhappy men, confined in a dark recess, with large iron fetters round their feet, a great weight about their neck…passing their time in filth, in torment, and in weeping”. He asks, “Which of these images shall we proclaim blessed”? He goes on to praise Diogenes of Sinopeus, the Cynic, for choosing his ascetic life, but only because he avoided the often fearful fates of other philosophers – such as Socrates being condemned. But there is no mention of he himself taking up the ascetic life himself; rather he only talks about how the Garden would be preferable to the life mankind has made for itself.

He worked in many genres including genre scenes of interiors with merry companies and gallery paintings, history painting, still life and portraiture.\n\nLife\nCharles Emmanuel Biset was born on 26 December 1633 in Mechelen as Karel Emmanuel Biset.  He was the son of the decorative painter Joris Biset who had trained under Michiel Coxie III, a grandson of the great Renaissance painter Michiel Coxie.  Charles Emmanuel Biset likely trained under his father.\n\nHe worked in Mechelen from about 1640 until the early or mid-1650s. He was subsequently active in Paris where he is presumed to have worked for the court. Thereafter he is recorded for a while in Brussels before moving to Antwerp. Here he was active from 1661 to 1687.He became a master in Antwerp's Guild of Saint Luke in 1662 and was its dean in 1674.  He was also appointed a director of the Academy of Antwerp.He married in 1662 with the painter Maria van Uden who was the daughter of the landscape painter Lucas van Uden.  After her death in 1665, he began a relationship with her sister Anna.  In 1670 he married Anna Cleymans.  Their children were the painters Jan Andreas (also called Jan Baptist) and Jan Karel Biset. He enjoyed the patronage of Juan Domingo de Zuñiga y Fonseca, Count of Monterrey, and later the Governor of the Habsburg Netherlands for whom he may have worked on a quasi-exclusive basis for a while.In 1687 he is recorded in Breda.  It is possible he stayed there for the rest of his life while visiting Antwerp occasionally.  The last record of his life dates to 28 September 1693 when he was in Antwerp.\nThe place and date of his death are not clear but he is believed to have died between 28 September 1693 and 1713.He was the master of his nephew Jan Anthonie Coxie, who was the son of his sister Joanna and fellow Mechelen painter Jan Coxie.Biset was highly regarded as an artist in his time as is attested by the fact that both the early Flemish biographer Cornelis de Bie and the Dutch biographer Jacob Campo Weyerman included him in their artist biographies.\n\nWork\nGeneral\nBiset was a very versatile artist and the range of his work is very diverse: he painted genre scenes with merry companies, gallery paintings, portraits, history paintings and still lifes. Because of this diversity and the specific genres and themes he worked in, it is believed he may have received some training from Gonzales Coques who also painted in such diverse areas.Biset is regarded by some art historians as a follower of Coques. In fact, some works now ascribed to Biset were formerly attributed to Coques.  This is for instance the case with the composition A Family Seated at a Table in an Elegant Garden Exterior (Sotheby's, 6 December 2006 in New York, lot 7), which was originally regarded as a collaboration between Gonzales Coques and some specialist artists such as Peeter Gijsels and Wilhelm Schubert van Ehrenberg but is regarded by the RKD specialists as entirely by Biset's hand.As was the custom in Antwerp in the 17th century Biset regularly collaborated with other painters who were specialists in a particular genre.  Collaborations with the landscape painters Philips Augustijn Immenraet and Cornelis Huysmans and the architecture painter Wilhelm Schubert van Ehrenberg are recorded.\n\nPortraits\nBiset painted individual as well as family and group portraits, including merry companies.  The Hermitage collection holds a beautiful Portrait of a Musician.  It depicts a musician standing next to a column with some sheet music and a theorbo and viola da gamba resting against the column.  The figure dressed in black is set off against the velvet curtain behind him.  A stool placed next to the musician indicates that he has just finished or is about to commence a musical performance.\n\nThe headmen of the Antwerp schutterij De Oude Voetboog are known to have ordered a group portrait from Biset. It is likely that this work is the large composition referred to as The Legend of William Tell shown to the Antwerp Schutterij of St Sebastian.  This work, which is now in the Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium, was made for the hall of the Antwerp schutterij pursuant to a contract made before a notary on 28 April 1672.  The work is a collaboration with Philips Augustijn Immenraet and Wilhelm Schubert van Ehrenberg. The architecture is painted by Wilhelm Schubert van Ehrenberg and the landscape by Philips Augustijn Immenraet and the rest by Charles Emmanuel Biset.  The composition uses the tale of William Tell to create a group portrait of the leading members of the schutterij.The  Portrait of a family in an interior (Sold at Christie's on 19 April 2007 in New York, lot 31) was originally attributed to Gerard Pietersz van Zijl but is now attributed to Biset. This composition follows the model of the merry companies with its informal setting which includes children and musicians.  A less informal rendering of the same subject is in the Musée des Beaux-Arts de Nantes.\n\nGenre scenes\nGenre subjects involving indoor scenes of playing persons were quite popular in Flemish and Dutch painting in the 17th century and in particular among the so-called Caravaggists.  Biset painted similar genre scenes an example of which is his composition the Tric-trac players (Statens Museum for Kunst).\n\nThe composition shows an interior with two standing men playing tric-trac and three onlookers. One of the onlookers is engaged in a lively exchange with a maid who is handing him a glass of wine.  A young male servant is pouring drinks for the company at a table on which also food is placed including oysters, a few of which have fallen on the floor.  The overall setting seems to point to a company that is actively enjoying itself but may be on the verge of losing control.\n\nGallery paintings\nBiset worked also in the genre of the 'gallery paintings'.  The 'gallery paintings' genre is native to Antwerp where Frans Francken the Younger and Jan Brueghel the Elder were the first artists to create paintings of art and curiosity collections in the 1620s. Gallery paintings depict large rooms in which many paintings and other precious items are displayed in elegant surroundings.  The earliest works in this genre depicted art objects together with other items such as scientific instruments or peculiar natural specimens.  The genre became immediately quite popular and was followed by other artists such as Jan Brueghel the Younger, Cornelis de Baellieur, Hans Jordaens, David Teniers the Younger, Gillis van Tilborch and Hieronymus Janssens.  The art galleries depicted were either real galleries or imaginary galleries, sometimes with allegorical figures.\n\nAn example of Biset's work in this genre is the Interior of an Imaginary Picture Gallery (Alte Pinakothek, Munich) dated to 1666.  This composition falls into the category of allegorical picture galleries, which can be considered a sub-category of the imaginary art gallery type. This composition depicts a large imaginary gallery in which are present a number of persons admiring and scrutinizing artworks and, on the right hand side, figures representing gods and allegorical figures. Wilhelm Schubert van Ehrenberg painted the architecture as well as the ceiling (which is made up of copies of Rubens' works for the Carolus Borromeuskerk in Antwerp) (later destroyed in a fire). The figures are believed to be by Charles Emmanuel Biset. The painting is a collaboration with each of the individual painters whose work is depicted in the painting and have signed their own work: Theodoor Boeyermans (Daughters of Cecrops and Erychtonius), Pieter Boel (Animal Piece), Jan Cossiers (Diana and Actaeon), Cornelis de Heem (Fruit Still Life), Robert van den Hoecke (Winter Landscape), Philips Augustijn Immenraet (Italianate Landscape), Jacob Jordaens (Gyges and Kandaules and Allegory of Painting), Pieter Thijs (Adoration of the Shepherds), Lucas van Uden (Landscape) and the monogrammists missed PB (Fish Still Life) and PVI or PVH (Satyr and Nymph). This type of painting can be regarded as a carefully crafted advertisement of the present talent and past legacy of the Antwerp school of painting.\n\nStill lifes\nA number of still lifes with books are attributed to Biset.  These still lifes stand in a tradition of vanitas still lifes with books that was popular in Flemish and Dutch still life painting in the 17th century.  An example is the Still life with books and a skull (Sold at Alain Truong, 18 December 2008 in Paris).  The composition depicts a table on which rest a number of writing implements, some sealed letters and old books.  On top of one book which is opened and appears to be handwritten rests a human skull.  The message of the work appears to be that human endeavours as expressed in personal writings are futile as death is the ultimate outcome.\n\nBook illustrations\nBiset provided some designs for illustrations for a number of publications in Antwerp.  This includes the book on mushrooms by the priest Franciscus van Sterbeeck entitled Theatrum fungorum oft het toneel der campernoelien ... vergaedert ende beschreven door Franciscus van Sterbeeck, which was published by Joseph Jacobs in Antwerp in 1675 and by the same author and publisher the Citricultura oft Regeringhe der uythemsche boomen te weten oranien, citroenen, limoenen, granaten, laurieren en andere on the cultivation of non-native trees, published in 1682 in Antwerp.\nPassage 5:\nRita Blumenberg\nRita Blumenberg (born 23 June 1936) is a West German retired pair skater.

Carel had three brothers who all became painters.  The best known was Balthasar who was a landscape, history and portrait painter. His younger brothers were Jacob Andries, a history painter, and Jan Frans, a copyist and art dealer.  Jan Frans was for a while resident as a painter and art dealer in London.\n\nCarel Beschey was a pupil of Hendrick Govaerts.  In 1727 he won the first prize in the life drawing competition of the Academy of Arts in Antwerp.  Like his brother Balthasar, he became a director of the Academy of Arts of Antwerp.Thanks to the connections of his younger brother Balthasar who was also an art dealer and portrait painter, Carel Beschey was able to find patrons and buyers for his paintings.  At his brother's house, art lovers regularly met up to study the work of the great Dutch and Flemish masters.It is not known when or where Carel Beschey died but it is assumed he died in Antwerp c. 1770.\n\nWork\nCarel Beschey painted mainly landscapes usually with many figures and occasionally with a religious scene.  He was one of a number of Antwerp artists from the second half of the 17th century and the first half of the 18th century who painted landscapes in a style reminiscent of earlier Flemish landscape painting. In particular, the work of Jan Brueghel the Elder.  These artists included, amongst others, Izaak van Oosten, Peeter Gijsels, Adriaen Frans Boudewyns, Pieter Bout, Joseph van Bredael and his brother Balthasar Beschey.   What these artists had in common was that they liked to paint pleasant landscapes with peasant scenes in fresh colours, which exuded a bucolic sense of happiness. Most of their landscapes were populated with small figures in anecdotal poses set against a backdrop of a nice landscape or of some buildings.  The preferred palette was pronounced blue-green.\n\nThe landscapes of Carel Beschey are closely based on the work of Jan Brueghel the Elder. Carel Beschey had a preference for wide, rural landscapes in which the rich scenery with farmers and travellers clearly evokes the model of landscape painting of the 17th century.Beschey painted a few pairs of winter and summer landscapes.  His winter landscapes display a greater level of independence from the Brueghel model.  An example is A winter landscape with hunters and skaters on a frozen river running through a village (sold at Sotheby's on 9 December 2009 in London, lot 5).\nPassage 9:\nCharles Buls\nCharles Buls or Karel Buls (13 October 1837 – 13 July 1914) was a Belgian politician and mayor of the City of Brussels.\n\nEarly life\nCharles François Gommaire Buls was born in Brussels as the son of a goldsmith from the region of Mechelen. Buls received an artistic education, and spent a year in Paris, and nine months in Italy, studying fine arts. He also learned several languages including English, German, Italian and Latin, besides his mother tongue Dutch. He followed in his father's footsteps and worked as a goldsmith.\nIn 1862 he became a Freemason in \"Les vrais amis\", and in 1871 joined \"La libre pensée\".  At the same time, he was a member of \"de Veldbloem\" and \"Vlamingen vooruit\", two Flemish organisations of the Flemish movement. Together with his brother in law, Leo Van der Kindere, the later mayor of Uccle, he became a \"flamingant\".\n\nPolitics\nBuls entered politics in 1870 as a Flemish candidate on a radical list but he was not elected until 1877, when he was elected to the Brussels city council on a liberal list. He became schepen or échevin of education in 1879. Buls was a supporter of progressive causes, especially in language issues and education, and the education of women, on which he wrote frequently. He was a supporter of Isabelle Gatti de Gamond's educational reforms. From 1879 on he played an important role in the development of Flemish education in Brussels.On the national stage, Buls served in the Belgian Chamber of Representatives in 1882, and again from 1886 to 1894.\nBuls became Mayor of Brussels in 1881 and remained in office until 1899. At his initiative policemen had to be able to speak both French and Dutch and bilingual signposting was established throughout the city. However, along with these reforms, his most lasting achievement was the result of his opposition to the grandiose architectural schemes of King Leopold II, and the resulting preservation of old parts of Brussels. In particular, Buls was a steadfast defender and admirer of the Mont des Arts and the Grand-Place, now a UNESCO World Heritage Site, successfully proposing the 1883 city ordinance protecting the façades of the Grand-Place buildings and providing funds for their restoration which took place between 1883 and 1923. In 1899, the architects of Brussels who had been involved in this restoration work paid for a memorial commemorating Buls, designed by Victor Horta and executed by Victor Rousseau, to be placed in the rebuilt \"L'Etoile\" or \"De Ster\" house on the Grand-Place. At the reopening of the restored Town Hall, Buls greeted Leopold II in Dutch, and the King replied in the same language, which was unusual at the time. In 1999, a new fountain with a larger-than-life-sized seated statue of Buls and his dog was erected at the Place Agoraplein, close to the Grand-Place.\nBuls was an accomplished and prolific author, not merely on educational and artistic issues but also publishing accounts of his travels abroad.\n\nSee also\nList of mayors of the City of Brussels\nPassage 10:\nCarolus Gallus\nGallus, Carolus (or Karel de Haan) (16 August 1530 in Arnhem – 28 January 1616 in Nijbroek) was a Reformed minister and polemicist against the Anabaptists. Native to the Netherlands, Gallus was raised in a Roman Catholic family, and studied law and theology to become a priest.\n\nLife\nAs a Roman Catholic preparing to study for the priesthood, and against the warnings of his friend Joannes Visser, Carolus Gallus chose to study theology under John Calvin and Theodore de Beze at the Genevan Academy.\nIn early 1560, he became a priest at Deventer, though by February 1561, he was sued by dean of Deventer and brought under charges of heresy due to his administration of the Eucharist during a Christmas Mass. The city kept him in his position until June 1561, when he fled to the city of Hamm. He was appointed as Evangelical pastor by the Duke of Cleves and remained in this position until 1576. He moved to Bremen for a brief time and became a bitter opponent to the Anabaptists. He published his first book against the Anabaptists entitled Lehre de Christelicken geloovens in veer boecken tegen den wedertöpern erdömmen (Bremen, 1577 ?).  From 1578 to 1581, at the behest of Count Johan Nassau, he was a military chaplain with his friend Johannes Fontanus in Gelderland, where the Reformation was beginning to take hold.\nBetween the years of 1583 and 1586, he ministered once again in Deventer, but once again had to flee as Roman Catholics from Spain who infiltrated the city. He was appointed as professor of theology at the University of Leiden in 1587 and maintained this position rather shortly, as he took a call to become minister in Oldenbroek in 1592, where he remained until his death.\n\nChief works\nLehre de Christelicken geloovens in veer boecken tegen den wedertöpern erdömmen.

The film is a sequel to Royal Tramp, which was released earlier in the same year.\n\nPlot\nHaving been revealed as the false Empress Dowager, Lung-er returns to the Dragon Sect camp. There, the sect leader reminds her of their mission to support Ng Sam-kwai's, a military general, campaign for the throne before abdicating her title to Lung-er.\nSiu-bo lounges at the brothel where he once worked but is then attacked by disciples of the One Arm Nun, an anti-Qing revolutionary figure, before being quickly subdued. When Siu-bo tries to take advantage of them, Ng Ying-hung, Ng Sam-kwai's son, exposes his lies. Scorned and unaware of the stranger's title, Siu-bo sends his men after Ying-Hung, but Lung-er, now disguised as Ying-hung's male bodyguard, easily fends them off.\nAt the palace, The Emperor, wary of Ng Sam-kwai's intentions, marries off the Princess to Ying-hung and assigns Siu-bo to be the Imperial Inspector General of the wedding march, so that he can keep his eyes on the general's activities. This complicates Siu-bo's relationship with Princess when she tells Siu-bo she's pregnant with his child.\nThe One Arm Nun and her disciple, Ah Ko, later ambushes the procession. Fighting to a standstill with Lung-er, the assailants escape with Ying-hung and Siu-bo. However, Siu-bo garners some respect from her when he reveals his dual identity as a Heaven and Earth Society commander. Lung-er finally catches up to them with reinforcements at an inn but only manages to rescue Siu-bo. Having been saved by Ying-hung before, Ah Ko elopes with him amid the confusion.\nAt the Dragon Sect camp, Ying-hung and Fung Sek-fan secretly poisons Lung-er and turn the followers against her. She escapes with Siu-bo but must have sex with a man before dawn, otherwise she will die. However, this will transfer 4/5th of her martial arts' power to whomever she sleeps with. Despite Siu-bo's lecherous personality, Lung-er accepts his blunt honesty as a sign of virtue and chooses to sacrifice her virginity to Siu-bo and becomes his third wife.\nWhen Siu-bo gets back to the Princess, they execute a plan to castrate Ying-hung. With her betrothed no longer able to produce heirs, the Princess is taken by Siu-bo as his fourth wife. Enraged by the end of his family line, Ng Ying-hung prematurely gathers his troops and sets out to wage war with the Emperor. He tasks Fung Sek-fan with killing the Princess and Siu-bo. Though Chan Kan-nam manages to intervene and lets his disciple escape.\nLater, the One Arm Nun captures the elopers, Ying-hung and Ah Ko, and offers them to Siu-bo. Siu-bo pardons them and even takes Ah Ko as his fifth wife. Afterward, Fung Sek-fan is promoted when he surrenders Ng Sam-kwai's battle plans and Chan Kan-nam to the Emperor. Given Siu-bo's muddied history with the Heaven and Earth Society, the Emperor tasks him with Chan's execution. Siu-bo's newfound power is difficult for him to control, and Chan helps him master it in time for him to use it against Fung. Siu-bo also uncovers the secret of the 42 Chapters books after burning them in frustration, revealing hidden stones that are left unburned, revealing map coordinates to the location of the treasure all major parties have been attempting to locate.\nIn order to save his master, Siu-bo defeats Fung with his newly acquired martial arts power after both falling into a hidden cave wherein the treasure is found, and swaps Feng's body with Chan's before the execution to save his master. And just as he was about to escape with his wives and Chan, the Emperor arrives with his troops, having been sold out by Siu-bo's opportunistic friend To-lung who is now involved romantically with Siu-bo's sister. But seeing that they are friends, his sister is in love with Siu-bo, and with Siu-bo bluffing that he's strong enough to demolish the Emperor and his entire army if he wanted, the Emperor lets them go, declaring that Siu-bo has died and no longer exists as far as he's concerned. Siu-bo laughs afterward that the Emperor fell for his bluff.\n\nCast\nStephen Chow as Wai Siu-bo\nBrigitte Lin as Lung-er\nChingmy Yau as Princess Kin-ning\nMichelle Reis as Ah Ko/Li Ming-ko\nNatalis Chan as To-lung\nDamian Lau as Chan Kan-nam\nDeric Wan as Hong-hei Emperor\nKent Tong as Ng Ying-hung, Sam-kwai's son\nPaul Chun as Ng Sam-kwai\nSandra Ng as Wai Chun-fa\nFennie Yuen as Seung-yee twin\nVivian Chan as Seung-yee twin\nYen Shi-kwan as Fung Sek-fan\nHelen Ma as Kau-nan/one-armed Divine nun\nSharla Cheung as Mo Tung-chu / Empress Dowager\nLaw Lan as founder of Divine Dragon Sect\nTam Suk-moi as Ah Nong\nHoh Choi-chow as Palace guard Wen Shan Lun\nYeung Jing-jing\nWan Seung-lam\nLee Fai\nCheng Ka-sang\nHo Wing-cheung\nKwan Yung\nTo Wai-wo\nPassage 2:\nConey Island Baby (film)\nConey Island Baby is a 2003 comedy-drama in which film producer Amy Hobby made her directorial debut.

The low-quality special effects, the non-existent acting, the bad dubbing, and the chaotic plotting and pacing were all of a piece with what critics had been saying, erroneously, about the Godzilla movies for years.\" The review referred to the film's \"cheesy special effects and ridiculous dialogue taking on a sort of so-bad-they're-good charm\", and described the film as a \"thoroughly memorable (if not necessarily enjoyable, outside of the MST3K continuum) specimen of bad cinema.\"On October 11, 1997 the film was shown on the movie-mocking television show Mystery Science Theater 3000. In his review of the film, Bruce Eder of AllMovie described the episode as a memorable one, specifically the cast watching the repetitive aerial dogfights between spaceships, and one of the hosts remarking that \"Independence Day seems a richly nuanced movie\". Criticism of the film included excessive use of WWII stock footage in the action scenes (especially the obviously noticeable shot featuring a picture of Adolf Hitler in one building).In his book Japanese Science Fiction, Fantasy and Horror Films, Stuart Galbraith IV stated that the film \"had a few surprises\" despite a \"woefully familiar script\". Galbraith noted that the film was not as over-the-top as Prince of Space and that the opticals in the film were as strong as anything Toho had produced at the time. Galbraith suggested the effects may have been lifted from Toei's The Final War (aka World War III Breaks Out) from 1961.\n\nSee also\nList of Japanese films of 1961\nList of Mystery Science Theater 3000 episodes\nList of science fiction films of the 1960s\n\nNotes\nPassage 8:\nIt's a King\nIt's a King is a 1933 British comedy film directed by Jack Raymond and starring Sydney Howard, Joan Maude and Cecil Humphreys.

It was released on YouTube and Steam on 14 June 2017.\n\nPlot\nChapter 1: World\nIn the near future, Earth will be attacked by technologically superior and highly aggressive reptilian aliens called the Klum (pronounced \"klume\"). Humanity is nearing extinction with millions dead or enslaved. The Klum transform the Earth in favor of their own ideal living conditions. They do this at first by burning forests and destroying cities. Then they build megastructures that alter the atmosphere by pumping out methane. The gas makes it progressively harder for terrestrial life to breathe. And it warms the climate, which leads to flooding of coastal cities.\nThe story begins in 2020, from the viewpoint of resistance fighters in Texas, a group of US Army soldiers and many others who have banded together. Most human survivors live underground or among ruins. They have barely enough provisions, weapons, and ammunition. The humans fight by using whatever they can against the primary Klum weapon: an omnipresent nanite in their weaponry, and telepathic control over any human that makes direct eye contact with them.\nThe resistance makes \"brain-barriers\" that block this\nmind control. The Klum know, however, that a scarcity of materials means a scarcity of brain barriers. They hope, therefore, to win a war of attrition against the human survivors.\nSome prisoners are living incubators for the Klum's young, which inevitably kills the victims. Others are dissected. Still other humans are converted into human loudspeakers that urge humans to surrender into \"conservatories\". Very few humans ever escape.\nAfter the Klum destroy a militia convoy with an airstrike, one of the surviving soldiers witnesses an angel-like being materialize from thin air. The narration describes ″them″ as mankind's saviours.\n\nChapter 2: Amir & Nosh\nNosh is a tech-savvy pyromaniac and bomb-maker, eking out a living in a scrapyard far from the resistance. The resistance despises Nosh for his murderous glee and demands - giving the sick or suicidal over as bait during his many IED ambushes. They must, however, give in to Nosh's demands to\nsecure the IEDs and the brain-barriers he makes.\nThe resistance stumble across Amir, a mute who has escaped from the Klum. He has extensive cybernetics across his head and shoulders. Amid opposition from her lieutenants, the resistance leader, Jasper, releases Amir from her custody into the care of a resistance fighter named Sarah.\nSarah, having lost her daughter to the Klum's experiments, takes a liking to him. She gives Amir food and drink while trying to persuade him to help the resistance fight the Klum by using the precognitive abilities he acquired via the aliens' experiments.\n\nChapter 3: Siege\nAmir recovers physically and mentally. Then, because of his implant, he has a premonition involving a wounded Klum on the run from militia forces.\nSarah pleads with Amir to help the militia officers to stop the genocide. The more she talks to him, the more his eyes change, seeing the premonition of the impending attack more clearly. Amir, still mute, foresees the militia successfully shooting down an alien aircraft, and the pilot is the alien on the run.\nSarah asks Amir if they will be able to learn how to hunt the Klum and teach them how to fear. Unable to answer, he foresees the Klum telekinetically bashing one of the militia soldiers, disconnecting his brain barrier and causing him to be mind-controlled, turning on his comrades, who are forced to kill him.\nSarah tells Amir that he now has the abilities the aliens have and that he is to use them for humanity. Back in the vision, the militia surround the Klum; Jasper orders the militia to cut off its head. The film ends with Sarah urging Amir to use his abilities because he is humanity's last hope.\n\nCast\nSigourney Weaver as Jasper\nEugene Khumbanyiwa as Amir\nRobert Hobbs as Carl\nCarly Pope as Sarah\nBrandon Auret as Nosh\nMike Huff as Policeman\nOwen McCrae as Klum\nConnor Page as Child\nJay Anstey as A suicide bomber\nJustin Shaw as Man in medical device\nCarla Marais as eight-year-old girl\nRyan Angilley as Martinez\nAlec Gillis as Militia officer 1\nRuan Coetzee as Militia officer 2\nPaul Davies as Militia officer 3\nPieter Jacobz as Militia officer 4", "answers": ["It'S A King"], "length": 4098, "dataset": "2wikimqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "b058a6541fba988d17aa0172344f2b537993008bedd729d5"}

He served as vicar general of the Duchy of Athens from 1317 to 1330.\nHe was first proclaimed vicar general by his father in 1317 and sent off to govern Athens on behalf of his younger half-brother Manfred. He arrived in Piraeus with ten galleys later that year, but Manfred had died and was succeeded by another brother, William II. In the year of his arrival, Fadrique married Marulla, the daughter of Boniface of Verona, thus allying himself with the chief lord of Euboea. By this marriage, also, he acquired rights to the castles of Larmena, Karystos, Zetouni, and Gardiki.\nOver the next two years, Fadrique warred with the Republic of Venice and stormed the city of Negroponte with Turks after Boniface of Verona died. In 1318, John II Ducas, the sebastokrator of Neopatras, died and Fadrique invaded Thessaly. He took possession of his castles at Zetouni and Gardiki and conquered Neopatras, Siderokastron, Loidoriki, Domokos, and Pharsalus.

He was the third son of Peter III of Aragon and served in the War of the Sicilian Vespers on behalf of his father and brothers, Alfonso ΙΙΙ and James ΙΙ. He was confirmed as king by the Peace of Caltabellotta in 1302. His reign saw important constitutional reforms: the Constitutiones regales, Capitula alia, and Ordinationes generales.\n\nName\nAlthough the second Frederick of Sicily, he chose to call himself \"Frederick III\" (being one of the rare medieval monarchs who actually used a regnal number) – presumably because only some fifty years before, his well-known and remembered great-grandfather had ruled Sicily and also used an official ordinal: Fridericus secundus, imperator etc.. Thus, Fridericus tertius was better in line with the precedent of his ancestor's ordinal. However, an anecdote attributes Frederick's choice of numeral to him being the third son of Peter. The next man called Frederick to occupy the Sicilian throne was dubbed by later generations of historians as Frederick III: Frederick III the Simple, though he himself did not use an ordinal.\n\nBiography\nEarly years\nFrederick was born in BarcelonaWhen his father died in 1285, he left the Kingdom of Aragon to his eldest son, Alfonso, and that of Sicily to his second son, James. When Alfonso died in 1291, James became king of Aragon and left Frederick as regent in Sicily. The war between the Angevins, who contested the title to Sicily from their peninsular possessions centred on Naples (the so-called Kingdom of Naples), and the Crown of Aragon for the possession of the island was still in progress, and although the Crown of Aragon was successful in Italy, James’ position in Spain became very insecure due to internal troubles and French attacks. Peace negotiations were begun with Charles II of Naples, but were interrupted by the successive deaths of two popes. At last, under the auspices of Pope Boniface VIII, James concluded a shameful treaty, by which, in exchange for being left undisturbed in the rest of the territories belonging to the Crown of Aragon and promised possession of Sardinia and Corsica, he gave up Sicily to the Church, for whom it was to be held by the Angevins (Treaty of Anagni, 10 June 1295). The Sicilians refused to be made over once more to the hated French they had expelled in 1282 (in the Sicilian Vespers), and found a national leader in the regent Frederick. In vain the pope tried to bribe him with promises and dignities; he was determined to stand by his subjects, and was crowned king by the nobles at Palermo in 1296.When Frederick heard that James was preparing to go to war with him, he sent a messenger, Mountainer Pérez de Sosa, to Catalonia in an effort to stir up the barons and cities against James in 1298. Mountainer carried with him an Occitan poem, Ges per guerra no.m chal aver consir, intended as a communication with his supporters in Catalonia. This communiqué seems to have had in mind Ponç Hug as a recipient, for the count penned a response (under the title con d'Empuria), A l'onrat rei Frederic terz vai dir, in which he praised Frederick's tact and diplomacy, but told him bluntly that he would not abandon his sovereign. This poetic transaction is usually dated to January–March, Spring, or August 1296, but Gerónimo Zurita in the seventeenth century specifically dated the embassy of Mountainer to 1298.\n\nReign\nFrederick reformed the administration and extended the powers of the Sicilian parliament, which was composed of the barons, the prelates, and the representatives of the towns.His refusal to comply with the pope's injunctions led to a renewal of the war. Frederick landed in Calabria, where he seized several towns, encouraged revolt in Naples, negotiated with the Ghibellines of Tuscany and Lombardy, and assisted the house of Colonna against Pope Boniface. In the meanwhile James, who received many favours from the Church, married his sister Yolanda to Robert, the third son of Charles II. Unfortunately for Frederick, a part of the Catalan-Aragonese nobles of Sicily favoured King James, and both John of Procida and Roger of Lauria, the heroes of the war of the Vespers, went over to the Angevins, and the latter completely defeated the Sicilian fleet off Capo d'Orlando. Charles's sons Robert and Philip landed in Sicily, but after capturing Catania were defeated by Frederick, Philip being taken prisoner (1299), while several Calabrian towns were captured by the Sicilians.For two years more the fighting continued with varying success, until Charles of Valois, who had been sent by Boniface to invade Sicily, was forced to sue for peace, his army being decimated by the plague. In August 1302 the Treaty of Caltabellotta was signed, by which Frederick was recognized king of Trinacria (the name Sicily was not to be used) for his lifetime, and was to marry Eleanor of Anjou, daughter of Charles II of Naples and Maria Arpad of Hungary. At Frederick's death, the kingdom was to revert to the Angevins (this clause was inserted chiefly to allow Charles to save face) and Frederick's children would receive compensation elsewhere. Boniface tried to induce King Charles to break the treaty, but the latter was only too anxious for peace. Finally, in May 1303, the pope ratified the treaty, albeit with changes and additions, which included Frederick agreeing to pay him a tribute.For a few years Sicily enjoyed peace, and the kingdom was reorganized. However, on the descent of the emperor Henry VII, Holy Roman Emperor into Italy, Frederick entered into an alliance with him, and in violation of the pact of Caltabellotta made war on the Angevins again (1313) and captured Reggio. He set sail for Tuscany to cooperate with the emperor, but on the latter's death he returned to Sicily. Robert, who had succeeded Charles II in 1309, made several raids into the island, which suffered much material injury. A truce was concluded in 1317, but as the Sicilians had helped the north Italian Ghibellines in the attack on Genoa, and Frederick had seized some Church revenues for military purposes, Pope John XXII excommunicated him and placed the island under an interdict (1321) which lasted until 1335. An Angevin fleet and army, under Robert's son Charles, was defeated at Palermo by Giovanni da Chiaramonte in 1325, and in 1326 and 1327 there were further Angevin raids on the island, until the descent into Italy of the next Holy Roman Emperor Louis the Bavarian distracted their attention. The election of Pope Benedict XII (1334), who was friendly to Frederick, promised a respite; but after fruitless negotiations the war broke out once more, and Chiaramonte went over to Robert, owing to a private feud.In 1337 Frederick died at Paternò, and in spite of the Peace of Caltabellotta his son Peter II of Sicily succeeded him.\n\nFamily\nFrom his marriage (1303) with Eleanor of Anjou were born:\n\nPeter (1304–1342), successor\nRoger (1305–died young).\nManfred (1306–1317), Duke of Athens and Neopatria\nConstance (1307 – after 19 June 1344), married in 1317 to Henry II of Cyprus; on 29 December 1331 to Leo V of Armenia; and in 1343 to John of Lusignan, brother of Peter I of Cyprus.

Executive Authority is vested in the President of Malta with the general direction and control of the Government of Malta remaining with the Prime Minister of Malta who is the head of government and the cabinet. Legislative power is vested in the Parliament of Malta which consists of the President of Malta and the unicameral House of Representatives of Malta with the Speaker presiding officer of the legislative body. Judicial power remains with the Chief Justice and the Judiciary of Malta. Since Independence, the party electoral system has been dominated by the Christian democratic Nationalist Party (Partit Nazzjonalista) and the social democratic Labour Party (Partit Laburista).\nThe Economist Intelligence Unit rated Malta a \"flawed democracy\" in 2022.\n\nPolitical developments since Independence\nSince independence, two parties have dominated Malta's polarized and evenly divided politics during this period: the centre-right Nationalist Party and the centre-left Labour Party. \nFrom the pre-independence 1962 general election until 2017 third parties failed to score any electoral success. In the 2013 election, the Democratic Alternative (a green party established in 1989), had managed to secure only 1.8% of the first preference votes nationwide.\nThe 1996 elections resulted in the election of the Labour Party, by 8,000 votes, to replace the Nationalists who had won in 1987 and 1992. Voter turnout was characteristically high at 96%, with the Labour Party receiving 50.72%, the Nationalist Party 47.8%, the Democratic Alternative 1.46%, and independent candidates 0.02%. \nIn 1998, the Labour Party's loss in a parliamentary vote led the Prime Minister to call an early election. The Nationalist Party was returned to office in September 1998 by a majority of 13,000 votes, holding a five-seat majority in Parliament. Voter turnout was 95%, with the Nationalist Party receiving 51.81%, the Labour Party 46.97%, the Democratic Alternative 1.21%, and independent candidates 0.01%.\nBy the end of 2002 the Nationalist government wrapped up negotiations for European Union membership. A referendum on the issue was called in March 2003 for which the Nationalists and the Democratic Alternative campaigned for a \"yes\" vote while Labour campaigned heavily for \"no\" vote, invalidate their vote or abstain. Turnout was 91%, with more than 53% voting \"yes\".The Labour Party argued that the \"yes\" votes amounted to less than 50% of the overall votes, hence, and citing the 1956 Maltese United Kingdom integration referendum as an example, they claimed that the \"yes\" had not in fact won the referendum. The then MLP Leader Alfred Sant said that the General Election which was to be held within a month would settle the affair. In the General Elections the Nationalists were returned to office with 51.79% of the vote to Labour's 47.51%. The Democratic Alternative polled 0.68%. The Nationalists were thus able to form a government and sign and ratify the EU Accession Treaty on 16 April 2003.\nOn 1 May 2004 Malta joined the EU and on 1 January 2008, the Eurozone with the euro as the national currency. The first elections after membership were held in March 2008 resulting in a narrow victory for the Nationalist Party with 49.34% of first preference votes. In May 2011, a nationwide referendum was held on the introduction of divorce. This was the first time in the history of parliament that Parliament approved a motion originating outside from the Cabinet.In March 2013, the Labour Party returned to Government after fifteen years in Opposition with a record-breaking lead of 36,000 votes leading to the resignation of the Nationalist leader Lawrence Gonzi, and Joseph Muscat became Prime Minister.  In June 2017, the Labour Party called in a snap election on its May Day celebrations and increased its vote disparity to around 40,000 votes. The then leader of the opposition Simon Busuttil announced his resignation shortly thereafter. This election saw the first third party elected to Malta's Parliament since its Independence, with the election of Marlene Farrugia in the 10th District representing the Democratic Party. Joseph Muscat continued to be Prime Minister In January 2020, he stepped down after the 2019 Malta political crisis surrounding the carbombing of investigative journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia. Robert Abela - the son of Malta's former President George Abela - elected a new leader of Labour Party and new prime minister of Malta in January 2020.Democratic Alternative and the Democratic Party merged into a new party, AD+PD, on 17 October 2020.In March 2022, the ruling Labour party, led by Prime Minister Robert Abela, won its third successive election. It gained even bigger victory than in 2013 and in 2017.\n\nExecutive branch\nUnder its 1964 constitution, Malta became a parliamentary democracy within the Commonwealth. Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom was sovereign of Malta, and a Governor-General exercised executive authority on her behalf, while the actual direction and control of the government and the nation's affairs were in the hands of the cabinet under the leadership of a Maltese prime minister.\nOn December 13, 1974, the constitution was revised, and Malta became a republic within the Commonwealth, with executive authority vested in the President of Malta which can be exercised directly or through officers subordinate to him. The president is elected by the House of Representatives for a five-year term. They appoint as Prime Minister the leader of the party with a majority of seats in the unicameral House of Representatives, known in Maltese as Kamra tar-Rappreżentanti.\n\nThe President also nominally appoints, upon recommendation of the Prime Minister, the individual ministers. Ministers are selected from among the members of the House of Representatives, which usually consists of 65 members unless bonus seats are given to a party which gains an absolute majority of votes but not a Parliamentary majority. Elections must be held at least every 5 years and the electoral system used is single transferable vote.\n\nAdministrative divisions\nMalta is divided into 68 elected local councils, with each council responsible for the administration of cities or regions of varying sizes. Administrative responsibility is distributed between the local councils and the central government in Valletta.\nThe Local Councils Act, 1993 (Act XV of 1993) was published on June 30, 1993, subdividing Malta into 54 local councils in Malta and 14 in Gozo. The inhabitants who are registered elect the Council every three years, as voters in the Local Councils' Electoral Register. Elections are held by means of the system of proportional representation using the single transferable vote. The mayor is the head of the Local Council and the representative of the Council for all effects under the Act. The Executive Secretary, who is appointed by the Council, is the executive, administrative, and financial head of the Council. All decisions are taken collectively with the other members of the Council. Local councils are responsible for the general upkeep and embellishment of the locality, local wardens, and refuse collection, and carry out general administrative duties for the central government such as collection of government rents and funds, and answering government-related public inquiries.\nThere are also Administrative Committees elected with responsibility for smaller regions.\n\nLegislative branch\nElections to the House of Representatives (Kamra tad-Deputati) are based on the single transferable vote system, a variant of the proportional representation electoral system. First, vacancies are filled through casual election and subsequent vacancies through co-option, meaning that no by-elections are held between one general election and the other. The Parliamentary term cannot exceed five years.\nOrdinarily, 65 members are elected to the House from 13 multi-seat constituencies each returning 5 MPs. Additional MPs are elected in two circumstances:\n\nWhen a party achieves 50%+1 of first-preference valid votes in the election but does not secure a Parliamentary majority it is awarded enough seats (filled by the best runner-up candidates) to make a Parliamentary majority\nWhen in an election contested by more than two parties only two parties are elected to Parliament and the relative Parliamentary strength is not proportionate to the first preference votes obtained, additional seats are allocated to establish proportionalityA third electoral amendment has been enacted which guarantees strict-proportionality with respect to votes and seats to parliamentary political groups.\n\nPolitical party standings as of the most recent election\nVoting stations were opened from 07:00 to 22:00, and in total, there were 355,075 citizens that had the right to vote in the general election. The turnout at 14:00 was reported at 44.8%, which was eight points lower than in 2017. According to the Electoral Commission of Malta, a total of 304,050 citizens voted, which made it the lowest turnout since the 1955 election. In addition to the 65 regularly elected members, two seats were awarded to the Nationalist Party to restore proportionality between votes obtained and parliamentary representation and twelve more women were appointed (six for each of the parties with elected members) to comply with the gender-corrective mechanism.\n\nJudicial branch\nThe Judicial system in Malta comprises Inferior Courts, Civil and Criminal Courts of\nAppeal, and a Constitutional Court.  Inferior courts are presided over by Magistrates which have original jurisdiction in criminal and civil actions. In the Criminal Courts, the presiding judge sits with a jury of nine.  The Court of Appeal and the Court of Criminal Appeal hear appeals from decisions of the civil and criminal actions respectively.\nThe highest court, the Constitutional Court, has both original and appellate jurisdiction. In its appellate jurisdiction it adjudicates cases involving violations of human rights and interpretation of the Constitution. It can also perform judicial review. In its original jurisdiction it has jurisdiction over disputed parliamentary elections and electoral corrupt practices.\nThere is a legal aid scheme offered to citizens lacking the means to afford legal defence.According to the Constitution, the President appoints the Chief Justice of Malta acting in accordance with a resolution of the House supported by the votes of not less than two-thirds of all the members of the House of Representatives. The Judges of the Superior Court and the Magistrates of the Inferior Courts are appointed through the Judicial Appointments Committee of Malta.\nGuarantees for the independence of the judiciary include the security of tenure for judges until their retiring age set at 65 (with a choice to extend retirement till 68), or until impeachment. The impeachment procedure for judges foresees a removal decision of the President upon request by the Commission for the Administration for Justice. \nThe independence of the judiciary is also guaranteed by the constitutional requirement that the judges’ salaries are paid from the Consolidated Fund and thus the government may not diminish or amend them to their prejudice.\nThe Maltese system is considered in line with the principles of separation of powers and of independence of the judiciary. However, in its pre-accession evaluation reports, the European Commission has suggested in 2003 the need to reform the procedure for appointment of the members of the judiciary, currently \"controlled by political bodies\" (i.e. the Parliament and parties therein), in order to improve its objectivity. The Commission has also pointed to the need to check the compliance of the procedure for challenging judges and magistrates provided for by Article 738 of the Code of Organisation and Civil Procedure with the principle of an impartial tribunal enshrined in the European Convention on Human Rights.\n\nInternational organization participation\nMalta is a member of the Commonwealth of Nations, CE, EBRD, ECE, EU (member from 1 May 2004), FAO, IAEA, IBRD, ICAO, ICCt, ICFTU, ICRM, IFAD, IFRCS, ILO, IMF, IMO, Inmarsat, Intelsat, Interpol, IOC, IOM, ISO, ITU, OPCW, OSCE, PCA, UN, UNCTAD, UNESCO, UNIDO, UPU, WCL, WCO, WHO, WIPO, WMO, WToO, WTrO\nMalta was a long-time member of the Non-Aligned Movement.

He is currently the head of the Department of Public Administration and Regional Studies at the Masaryk Institute of Advanced Studies of the Czech Technical University in Prague, a former local (non-party) politician and the Mayor of the Capital City of Prague. He is married, has three sons, lives alternately in Prague and Ostrava.\nIn 2010 he was elected to the Municipal Assembly in Prague as a candidate of the TOP 09 party.  On 24 November 2011 he became a member of the executive council of Prague and the Deputy Mayor of Bohuslav Svoboda. Hudeček was elected deputy mayor of Prague between 24 November 2011 and 23 May 2013, then deputy mayor with the responsibilities of Mayor during the flooding of May and June 2013 days in Prague, and Mayor of Prague between 20 June 2013 and 26 October 2014.\nPassage 2:\nA Trial in Prague\nA Trial in Prague is an 83 min colour documentary film directed by Zuzana Justman, about the Slánský trial, a high-profile show trial in 1952 Communist Czechoslovakia.\n\nContent\nAt the height of the Cold War, an infamous political show trial, known as the Slánský trial, took place in Czechoslovakia. In 1952, 14 leading Communists, including Rudolf Slánský, the second most powerful man in the country, were tried on charges of high treason and espionage. Although they were innocent of the charges, they confessed and were convicted. Most of the men were hanged, but three received life sentences. Eleven of the fourteen were Jews.\nThe film tells the story of the trial and the paranoia of the period through testimonies, trial footage, archival films and extensive documentation. Among the people who appear in the film are Lise London, whose late husband Artur London was one of the defendants and wrote about the trial in a widely published memoir \"The Confession;\" Eduard Goldstucker, a Kafka scholar and the first Czech ambassador to Israel who was jailed and forced to testify at the trial; and Jan Kavan, the former Czech Minister of Foreign Affairs, whose father, also a trial witness, died shortly after his release from prison.\nWhat led these men to their passionate belief in Communism and why did they publicly confess to crimes they did not commit?  The film explores the questions, as well as the role of Moscow, the motives for the trial and its anti-Semitic thrust. It deals with the personal stories of the condemned men and the legacy they left their children, who \"feel a need to live out the interrupted lives of their fathers\".\n\nComments\n\"Sensitive, intelligent & moving … shows the human face of both communism and its victims\" - New York Times \"Harrowing and enlightening, a tale that even Kafka would find hard to imagine\" (Boston Phoenix).\"Measured, informative…neatly structured\" (Variety).“The film is as compelling for these painful details as for the tough-minded analysis that ties them together.” ( The Village Voice)“Powerful, important and refreshingly straightforward documentary.” (New York Post)\n\nSources\nSlánská, Josefa (1969).

Arbutny (Sydney Greenstreet) and charming and erudite drunkard Johnny West (Peter Lorre) to her London flat on Chinese New Year in 1938 because of her belief that if three strangers make the same wish to an idol of Kwan Yin, Chinese goddess of fortune and destiny, the wish will be granted.  Since money will make their dreams come true, the three go in on a sweepstakes ticket for the Grand National horse race together and agree that they will not sell the ticket if it is chosen, but will hold on to it until the race is run.  Shackleford would use the money to try to win her estranged husband back, Arbutny to smooth the way for his selection to the prestigious Barrister's Club, and Johnny to buy a bar and live in it.\nThe stories of the three strangers are revealed. Shackleford's husband David (Alan Napier) moved to Canada and fell in love with Janet Elliott (Marjorie Riordan). He returns, just after Johnny and Arbutny take their leave of Crystal, and demands a divorce, but she refuses. She sees to it that he loses a promotion. She also lies to Janet, telling her that David still loves her and that she is pregnant. The trusting woman believes her and returns to Canada.\nWith the help of an adoring Icey Crane (Joan Lorring), Johnny has been hiding out after his drunken participation in a botched robbery that resulted in the death of a policeman. Icey commits perjury in order to provide an alibi for the murderer and ringleader, Bertram Fallon (Robert Shayne). When a second witness is discredited, Fallon confesses to the robbery but blames the murder on West and the third man involved, Timothy Delaney, who is nicknamed Gabby (Peter Whitney). Johnny is caught and sentenced to death, but Gabby finds Fallon on his way to prison and stabs him.  As he dies in the railway carriage, Fallon clears Johnny.\nArbutny has been speculating in stocks with money from the trust fund of Lady Rhea Belladon (Rosalind Ivan), an eccentric widow who believes she can talk with her dead husband.  When the stock falls and his margin is called, a desperate Arbutny proposes to Lady Belladon.  After consulting with her dead husband, she turns him down. Worse, she says that Lord Belladon wants to have the books checked.  Arbutny contemplates suicide, is about to shoot himself but glances in the newspaper and discovers their sweepstakes ticket \"Kwan Yin\" was drawn in the Grand National.\nThe three strangers converge on Crystal's flat.  Arbutny wants to sell his share of the ticket immediately so he can replace the funds he stole before his crime can be uncovered.  Johnny is willing, but Shackleford is adamant that they stick to their original agreement.  Arbutny becomes enraged and accidentally kills her with her statue of Kwan Yin. Ironically, they hear on the radio that their horse wins.  Johnny points out to Arbutny that the winning ticket has to be destroyed because their agreement and signatures on it would provide a motive for Crystal's murder. They leave the flat, but Arbutny is overcome by guilt, and panics and runs out into the middle of the busy street.  Arbutny stops traffic and attracts a crowd, including a policeman, where he confesses to the murder. David Shackleford arrives, intending to shoot his estranged wife for  driving Janet away from him, but leaves, shaken, upon discovering that she's already dead.\nJohnny returns to the pub, where Icey finds him.  Content with having her, he sets the ticket on fire.\n\nCast\nProduction\nThree Strangers was in production from early January to mid-February 1945.  Its original title was Three Men and a Girl, and Bette Davis and George Brent were originally to be the leads.  At one point, the story was considered for a sequel of sorts to The Maltese Falcon, and Humphrey Bogart, Sydney Greenstreet and Mary Astor were to star. However, according to Robert Osborne of Turner Classic Movies, Warner Bros. discovered the rights to the characters had reverted to Dashiell Hammett. Because Warners had owned the rights since 1937, actors considered for the role of \"Jerome K. Arbutny\" were Lionel Atwill, Donald Crisp, Ian Hunter and Claude Rains, while Miriam Hopkins and Kay Francis were considered to play \"Crystal Shackelford\".  For the third starring role, that of \"Johnny West,\" Errol Flynn, David Niven, Leslie Howard, Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. and Robert Montgomery were considered.  Director Jean Negulesco was a fan of Lorre's work and fought hard to give him the role.John Huston was inspired to write the story by a wooden figure he bought in an antique shop while working in London. Later, events at a party in his flat suggested to Huston the story of three strangers sharing a sweepstakes ticket.  Alfred Hitchcock was at the gathering, and liked the story when Huston told it to him, but nothing came of it.  Huston returned to Hollywood, and Warners bought the treatment in 1937.  Huston went on to write the script with his friend Howard Koch. When the film finally went into production, Huston was not available to direct it, because he was a lieutenant in the U.S. Army Signal Corps.Two American release dates for Three Strangers can be found: 28 January 1946 and 16 February 1946.  It's possible that the first date is the premiere, and the later one the actual date of general release.\n\nReception\nIn its 1946 review, Variety wrote:\n\nGreenstreet overplays to some extent as the attorney who has raided a trust fund, but he still does a good job. Lorre is tops as a drunk who gets involved in a murder of which he's innocent, while Fitzgerald rates as the victim.\nBosley Crowther in The New York Times wrote that same year:\n\n[T]he action [...] is full-bodied melodrama of a shrewd and sophisticated sort. Never so far away from reason that it is wholly incredible but obviously manufactured fiction, it makes a tolerably tantalizing show, reaching some points of fascination in a few of its critical scenes.\nAccording to Warner Bros. records, the film earned $1,033,000 in the U.S. and $614,000 in other markets.\nPassage 9:\nJean Negulesco\nJean Negulesco (born Ioan Negulescu; 13 March [O.S. 29 February] 1900 – 18 July 1993) was a Romanian-American film director and screenwriter. He first gained notice for his film noirs and later made such notable films as Johnny Belinda (1948), How to Marry a Millionaire (1953), Titanic (1953), and Three Coins in the Fountain (1954).He was called \"the first real master of CinemaScope\".\n\nBiography\nEarly life\nBorn in Craiova, Negulesco was the son of a hotel keeper and attended Carol I High School.\nWhen he was 15, he was working in a military hospital during World War I. George Enescu, the Romanian composer, came to play the violin to the war wounded; Negulesco drew a portrait of him, and Enesco bought it. Negulesco decided to be a painter and studied art in Bucharest.Negulesco went to Paris in 1920, and enrolled in the Académie Julian. He sold one of his paintings to Rex Ingram.\n\nAmerica\nIn 1927, he visited New York City for an exhibition of his paintings and settled there.He then made his way to California, at first working as a portraitist.He became interested in movies and made an experimental feature film, financed as well as written and directed by himself, called Three and a Day. Through his contact with the film's star, Mischa Auer, he managed to get a job at Paramount.\n\nParamount\nHe did the opening montage for the film musical Tonight We Sing and worked on The Story of Temple Drake and A Farewell to Arms (1932).He worked his way to assistant producer, second unit director.\n\nWarner Brothers\nNegulesco went to Warner Brothers in 1940. He made his reputation at Warner Bros by directing short subjects, particularly a series of band shorts featuring unusual camera angles and dramatic use of shadows and silhouettes.\nNegulesco's first feature film as director was Singapore Woman (1941). In 1948, he was nominated for an Academy Award for Directing for Johnny Belinda.\n\n20th Century Fox\nIn 1948 Negulesco went to work for 20th Century Fox. He was the first director to make two films in Fox's CinemaScope - How to Marry a Millionaire and Three Coins in the Fountain; the former receiving a nomination for a BAFTA Award for Best Film.His 1959 movie The Best of Everything was on Entertainment Weekly's Top 50 Cult Films of All-Time.\nDuring his Hollywood career and in his 1984 autobiography Things I Did and Things I Think I Did, Negulesco claimed to have been born on 29 February 1900; he apparently was motivated to make this statement because birthdays on leap year day are comparatively rare (and even though 1900 was not a leap year in the Gregorian calendar, it was under the Julian calendar, which applied in Romania at that time).\nHe has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6212 Hollywood Blvd.\n\nDeath\nFrom the late 1960s Negulesco lived in Marbella, Spain, where he died, at age 93, of heart failure. He is buried in the Virgen del Carmen cemetery in Marbella.\n\nFilmography\nShorts\nFeature films\nArchive\nMany of Negulesco's home movies are held by the Academy Film Archive; the archive has preserved a number of them, including behind-the-scenes footage of Negulesco's films.\n\nNotes\nPassage 10:\nSt. Vitus Madonna\nThe St. Vitus Madonna (c. 1395–1415) comes from the treasure of St. Vitus Cathedral in Prague and is exhibited in its original frame in the permanent collection of the National Gallery in Prague.\n\nHistory of the picture\nJan of Jenštejn, chancellor of King Wenceslaus IV and the Archbishop of Prague, was usually quoted as the donor of this picture. It is more likely, however, that the picture was painted later on, meaning that a more probable donor was Oldřich Zajíc of Hazmburk, brother of Zbyněk Zajíc of Hazmburk, fifth Archbishop of Prague, who died in 1411. In memory of his brother, Oldřich Zajíc of Hazmburk founded the altarpiece of St. Johns in their family chapel at St Vitus Cathedral.The picture itself survived separately in the possession of the Metropolitan Chapter. The picture's frame was purchased in 1883 from the estate of Josef Vojtěch Hellich for the Prague City Museum, from where it came to gallery of the Society of Patriotic Friends of Art. In 1937 Vincenc Kramář, director of the Society, joined both parts and since 1940 the picture and its frame have been loaned for display at the National Gallery in Prague.\nInformation from the St. Vitus inventory of the late 15th century mentions a beautiful panel of the Virgin Mary with the portraits of the four Evangelists and four patron saints of the Czech lands. It is recorded that they were painted by ‘Prague Panices’ (Prague Junkers) – free artists who appear in written sources from the 15th century. The St Vitus Madonna was exhibited in New York City in 2005.\n\nDescription and context\nThe picture in a cut frame decorated with twelve portraits is painted in tempera on a chalk base, on a soft-wood panel covered with stretched canvas. It is 51 x 39.5 cm in size. In the 1850s amethysts donated by Canon Pešina were added to the halo (these were later removed). The composition as a whole adheres to older models of Marian pictures. The picture of the St Vitus Madonna is directly related to sculptures in the International Gothic style and demonstrates how painting could have been directly influenced by contemporary sculpture. Stylistically it corresponds to artistic development in Bohemia around 1400 and, with its perfection of form, became the prototype of the Beautiful Madonnas.\nThe medallions with portraits in low detailed reliefs, that decorate the frame, depict half-figures of four patron saints of the Czech lands: St. Wenceslaus, St. Sigisgmund, St. Vitus and St. Adalbert (vertically); John the Baptist and John the Evangelist (top) and St. Procopius (?) and a kneeling archbishop, possibly the donor Jan of Jenštejn or the deceased Zbyněk Zajíc of Hazmburk (bottom). In the corners of the frame there are four quadrilobes with figures of angels bearing ribbons on which there are fragments of the text of the popular 12th-century Marian antiphon Regina coeli, laetare in which the faithful looked for protection against the plaque. Gemstones are indicated between the portraits; these were usually part of works meant for worshipping. The picture originally stood on the altar independently, since on its reverse it was decorated with silver foil.\nThis work dates from the high period of the Marian cult around 1400. It represents one of the two main types – the Madonna holding the child on her right side and both figures directing their gaze towards the viewer. Jesus's mortal human origin is emphasised by his nudity and several details (such as his mother pressing her fingers into his skin). These details also have Eucharistic significance, referring to Corpus Christi. This concept of the Marian image was widespread in the period before the Hussite Wars broke out.\n\nRelated works\nMadonna of Lnáře (1400-1420)\nThe Týn Madonna\nThe Madonna of Svojšín, differing in detail, since it has a crown as the Queen of Heaven, instead of a veil\nThe Madonna of Jindřichův Hradec (a small format for private worship, not to be confused with the Madonna of Jindřichův Hradec (1460)\nMadonna of Vyšší Brod Monastery (1415-1420)\nMadonna of Wrocław (1417-1418)\nIllumination in the missal of Zbyněk Zajíc of Hazmburk (1409)\n\nLater replicas\nMadonna of Jindřichův Hradec\nMadonna of Český Krumlov\nMadonna of Brussels", "answers": ["yes"], "length": 4176, "dataset": "2wikimqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "0c7274b5100ebeee9e7c1437949590cf5722c3f00b454f92"}

Ekaterína I Alekséyevna Mikháylova; born Polish: Marta Helena Skowrońska, Russian: Ма́рта Самуи́ловна Скавро́нская, tr. Márta Samuílovna Skavrónskaya; 15 April [O.S. 5 April] 1684 – 17 May [O.S. 6 May] 1727) was the second wife and empress consort of Peter the Great, and empress regnant of Russia from 1725 until her death in 1727.\n\nLife as a servant\nThe life of Catherine I was said by Voltaire to be nearly as extraordinary as that of Peter the Great himself. Only uncertain and contradictory information is available about her early life. Said to have been born on 15 April 1684 (o.s. 5 April), she was originally named Marta Helena Skowrońska. Marta was the daughter of Samuel Skowroński (later spelled Samuil Skavronsky), a Roman Catholic farmer from the eastern parts of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, born to Minsker parents. In 1680 he married Dorothea Hahn at Jakobstadt. Her mother is named in at least one source as Elizabeth Moritz, the daughter of a Baltic German woman and there is debate as to whether Moritz's father was a Swedish officer. It is likely that two stories were conflated, and Swedish sources suggest that the Elizabeth Moritz story is probably incorrect. Some biographies state that Marta's father was a gravedigger and handyman, while others speculate that he was a runaway landless serf.\nMarta's parents died of the plague around 1689, leaving five children. According to one of the popular versions, at the age of three Marta was taken by an aunt and sent to Marienburg (the present-day Alūksne in Latvia, near the border with Estonia and Russia) where she was raised by Johann Ernst Glück, a Lutheran pastor and educator who was the first to translate the Bible into Latvian. In his household she served as a lowly servant, likely either a scullery maid or washerwoman.  No effort was made to teach her to read and write and she remained illiterate throughout her life.\nMarta was considered a very beautiful young girl, and there are accounts that Frau Glück became fearful that she would become involved with her son. At the age of seventeen, she was married off to a Swedish dragoon, Johan Cruse or Johann Rabbe, with whom she remained for eight days in 1702, at which point the Swedish troops were withdrawn from Marienburg. When Russian forces captured the town, Pastor Glück offered to work as a translator, and Field Marshal Boris Sheremetev agreed to his proposal and took him to Moscow.\nThere are unsubstantiated stories that Marta worked briefly in the laundry of the victorious regiment, and also that she was presented in her undergarments to Brigadier General Rudolph Felix Bauer, later the Governor of Estonia, to be his mistress. She may have worked in the household of his superior, Sheremetev. It is not known whether she was his mistress, or household maid.  She travelled back to the Russian court with Sheremetev's army.Afterwards she became part of the household of Prince Alexander Menshikov, who was the best friend of Peter the Great of Russia. Anecdotal sources suggest that she was purchased by him. Whether the two of them were lovers is disputed, as Menshikov was already engaged to Darya Arsenyeva, his future wife. It is clear that Menshikov and Marta formed a lifetime alliance.\nIt is possible that Menshikov, who was quite jealous of Peter's attentions and knew his tastes, wanted to procure a mistress on whom he could rely. In any case, in 1703, while visiting Menshikov at his home, Peter met Marta. In 1704, she was well established in the Tsar's household as his mistress, and gave birth to a son, Peter. In 1703, she converted to Orthodoxy and took the new name Catherine Alexeyevna (Yekaterina Alexeyevna). She and Darya Menshikova accompanied Peter and Menshikov on their military excursions.\n\nMarriage and family life\nThough no record exists, Catherine and Peter are described as having married secretly between 23 October and 1 December 1707 in Saint Petersburg. They had twelve children, two of whom survived into adulthood, Anna (born 1708) and Elizabeth (born 1709).\nPeter had moved the capital to St. Petersburg in 1703. While the city was being built he lived in a three-room log cabin with Catherine, where she did the cooking and caring for the children, and he tended a garden as though they were an ordinary couple. The relationship was the most successful of Peter's life and a great number of letters exist demonstrating the strong affection between Catherine and Peter. As a person she was very energetic, compassionate, charming, and always cheerful. She was able to calm Peter in his frequent rages and was often called in to do so.\nCatherine went with Peter on his Pruth Campaign in 1711. There, she was said to have saved Peter and his Empire, as related by Voltaire in his book Peter the Great. Surrounded by overwhelming numbers of Turkish troops, Catherine suggested before surrendering, that her jewels and those of the other women be used in an effort to bribe the Ottoman grand vizier Baltacı Mehmet Pasha into allowing a retreat.\nMehmet allowed the retreat, whether motivated by the bribe or considerations of trade and diplomacy. In any case Peter credited Catherine and proceeded to marry her again (this time officially) at Saint Isaac's Cathedral in St. Petersburg on 9 February 1712.  She was Peter's second wife; he had previously married and divorced Eudoxia Lopukhina, who had borne him the Tsarevich Alexis Petrovich. Upon their wedding, Catherine took on the style of her husband and became Tsarina. When Peter elevated the Russian Tsardom to Empire, Catherine became Empress. The Order of Saint Catherine was instituted by her husband on the occasion of their wedding.\n\nIssue\nCatherine and Peter had twelve children, all of whom died in childhood except Anna and Elizabeth:\n\nPeter Petrovich (1704–1707), died in infancy\nPaul Petrovich (October 1705–1707), died in infancy\nCatherine Petrovna (7 February 1707–7 August 1708)\nGrand Duchess Anna Petrovna (27 January 1708–15 May 1728)\nGrand Duchess Elizabeth Petrovna (29 December 1709–5 January 1762)\nGrand Duchess Mary Natalia Petrovna (20 March 1713–17 May 1715)\nGrand Duchess Margaret Petrovna (19 September 1714–7 June 1715)\nGrand Duke Peter Petrovich (9 November 1715–6 May 1719)\n\nGrand Duke Paul Petrovich (13 January 1717–14 January 1717)\nGrand Duchess Natalia Petrovna (31 August 1718–15 March 1725)\nGrand Duke Peter Petrovich (7 October 1723–7 October 1723)\nGrand Duke Paul Petrovich (1724–1724)\n\nSiblings\nUpon Peter's death, Catherine found her four siblings, Krystyna, Anna, Karol, and Fryderyk, gave them the newly created titles of Count and Countess, and brought them to Russia.\n\nKrystyna Skowrońska, renamed Christina (Russian: Христина) Samuilovna Skavronskaya (1687–14 April 1729), had married Simon Heinrich (Russian: Симон Гейнрих) (1672–1728) and their descendants became the Counts Gendrikov.\nAnna Skowrońska, renamed Anna Samuilovna Skavronskaya, had married one Michael-Joachim N and their descendants became the Counts Efimovsky.\nKarol Skowroński, renamed Karel Samuilovich Skavronsky, was created a Count of the Russian Empire on 5 January 1727 and made a Chamberlain of the Imperial Court; he had married Maria Ivanovna, a Russian woman, by whom he had descendants who became extinct in the male line with the death of Count Paul Martinovich Skavronskyi (1757-1793), father of Princess Catherine Bagration.\nFryderyk Skowroński, renamed Feodor Samuilovich Skavronsky, was created a Count of the Russian Empire on 5 January 1727 and was married twice: to N, a Lithuanian woman, and to Ekaterina Rodionovna Saburova, without having children by either of them.\n\nReign as empress regnant\nCatherine was crowned in 1724. The year before his death, Peter and Catherine had an estrangement over her support of Willem Mons, brother of Peter's former mistress Anna, and brother to one of the current ladies in waiting for Catherine, Matryona. He served as Catherine's secretary. Peter had fought his entire life to clear up corruption in Russia. Catherine had a great deal of influence over who could gain access to her husband. Willem Mons and his sister Matryona had begun selling their influence to those who wanted access to Catherine and, through her, to Peter. Apparently this had been overlooked by Catherine, who was fond of both. Peter found out and had Willem Mons executed and his sister Matryona exiled. He and Catherine did not speak for several months. Rumors flew that she and Mons had had an affair, but there is no evidence for this.\nPeter died (28 January 1725 Old Style) without naming a successor. Catherine represented the interests of the \"new men\", commoners who had been brought to positions of great power by Peter based on competence. A change of government was likely to favor the entrenched aristocrats. For that reason during a meeting of a council to decide on a successor, a coup was arranged by Menshikov and others in which the guards regiments with whom Catherine was very popular proclaimed her the ruler of Russia. Supporting evidence was \"produced\" from Peter's secretary Makarov and the Bishop of Pskov, both \"new men\" with motivation to see Catherine take over. The real power, however, lay with Menshikov, Peter Tolstoy, and other members of the Supreme Privy Council.\nCatherine viewed the deposed empress Eudoxia as a threat, so she secretly moved her to Shlisselburg Fortress near St. Petersburg to be put in a secret prison under strict custody as a state prisoner.\n\nDeath\nCatherine I died two years after Peter I, on 17 May 1727 at age 43, in St. Petersburg, where she was buried at St. Peter and St. Paul Fortress. Tuberculosis, diagnosed as an abscess of the lungs, caused her early demise.\nBefore her death she recognized Peter II, the grandson of Peter I and Eudoxia, as her successor.\n\nAssessment and legacy\nCatherine was the first woman to rule Imperial Russia, opening the legal path for a century almost entirely dominated by women, including her daughter Elizabeth and granddaughter-in-law Catherine the Great, all of whom continued Peter the Great's policies in modernizing Russia.  At the time of Peter's death the Russian Army, composed of 130,000 men and supplemented by another 100,000 Cossacks, was easily the largest in Europe.  However, the expense of the military was proving ruinous to the Russian economy, consuming some 65% of the government's annual revenue.  Since the nation was at peace, Catherine was determined to reduce military expenditure.  For most of her reign, Catherine I was controlled by her advisers.  However, on this single issue, the reduction of military expenses, Catherine was able to have her way.  The resulting tax relief on the peasantry led to the reputation of Catherine I as a just and fair ruler.The Supreme Privy Council concentrated power in the hands of one party, and thus was an executive innovation. In foreign affairs, Russia reluctantly joined the Austro-Spanish league to defend the interests of Catherine's son-in-law, the Duke of Holstein, against Great Britain.\nCatherine gave her name to Catherinehof near St. Petersburg, and built the first bridges in the new capital. She was also the first royal owner of the Tsarskoye Selo estate, where the Catherine Palace still bears her name.\nThe city of Yekaterinburg is named after her, Yekaterina being the Russian form of her name.\nShe also gave her name to the Kadriorg Palace (German: Katharinental, meaning \"Catherine's Valley\"), its adjacent Kadriorg Park and the later Kadriorg neighbourhood of Tallinn, Estonia, which today houses the Presidential Palace of Estonia. The name of the neighbourhood is also used as a metonym for the institution of the President.\nIn general, Catherine's policies were reasonable and cautious.  The story of her humble origins was considered by later generations of tsars to be a state secret.\n\nSee also\nBibliography of Russian history (1613–1917)\nRulers of Russia family tree\n\nNotes\nPassage 8:\nStein Erik Hagen\nStein Erik Hagen (born 22 July 1956) is a Norwegian businessman.

He died on 12 April 1947 in New York City.\n\nNote on his first name\nThe book British Musical Biography by Brown & Stratton (1897) in its entry for John Barratt refers to \"his son William Augustus Barratt\" with details that make it clear that Walter Augustus Barratt is the same person and that a \"William\" Augustus Barratt is a mistake. For professional purposes up to about 1900 he appears to have written as \"W. Augustus Barratt\", and thereafter mostly as simply \"Augustus Barratt\".", "answers": ["Kiplangat Sang"], "length": 4003, "dataset": "2wikimqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "1f69042b1b5c54db57567137b3cc824c3cf27504897bd17d"}
{"input": "What is the place of birth of the director of film Confusion Na Wa?", "context": "Passage 1:\nChow Ka Wa\nChow Ka Wa (Chinese: 鄒嘉華; Cantonese Yale: Jāu Gāwà ; born 23 April 1986 in Hong Kong) is a Hong Kong footballer who plays for Hong Kong First Division League club Southern as a right midfielder.\n\nClub career\nCitizen\nChow began his professional career at Citizen, a newly promoted First Division club, in the 2004–05 season. However, as a young player, he failed to compete for a place in the starting line-up, only mostly played in the Senior Shield.\n\nLoan to Xiangxie Phar\nDuring the season, Xiangxie Phar was rebuilt and players all left the club. To retain their presence in the league, six teams from the First Division league loaned their young players so that they could gain match experiences. Chow was one of them who was loaned from Citizen. However, as he was still a student at that time, he failed to attend every training session and therefore was not given many match-playing chances. He returned to Citizen at the end of the season.\n\nKwun Tong\nAfter spending a season in the top-tier division, he joined Third Division side Kwun Tong, as he had to focus on academic studies. Although he played most of the matches, he failed to help them gain promotion to the Second Division. He left the club at the end of the season.\n\nHong Kong 08\nChow made a return to the First Division in the 2006–07 season, joining Hong Kong 08, which was formed by a team of young players to let them gain match experiences before competing in the 2008 Olympics qualifiers. He was given plenty of match-playing chances although there were many wingers at the team. However, the club was relegated and was dissolved after the season.\nAlthough many players and coaches joined newly promoted side Workable, Chow did not follow them and joined Third Division side Shatin, meaning he would miss the First Division for the second time.\n\nShatin\nChow joined Third Division side Shatin in the 2007–08 season. As a third-tier club, however, Shatin had many players with First Division playing experience, including Lee Wai Man who was the current most capped Hong Kong national team record player, Ng Yat Hoi, Kwok Yue Hung and so on. With an exceptionally strong squad in the league, Chow helped Shatin claim the league title without dropping any points in all 15 matches, meaning they had also gained promotion to Second Division. At the same time, Shatin also won the Junior Shield title in the season.\nChow stayed at the club as Shatin were aiming at promotion to the First Division for their first time in club history. He continued to make a great impact in the team and eventually helped the club achieve their season goal as they claimed the league title with only losing one match in 18 matches. On the other hand, Shatin successfully defended their Junior Shield title, defeating Sham Shai Po 2–0 in the final. Chow played 90 minutes in the match, providing one assist in the match.\nHe followed the team and made a second return to the First Division in the 2009–10 season. However, since Shatin bought several new players to strengthen their squad, Chow's match-playing chances were therefore reduced. Shatin failed to avoid relegation to the Second Division as they placed 2nd at the bottom of the league. Chow also left the club after the season.\n\nPontic\nChow made his third leave from the First Division as he joined Second Division side Pontic in the 2010–11 season. As a key member in the team, he only missed one game throughout the season, helping the club gain promotion to the First Division.\nHowever, since Pontic failed to find sponsors, they lacked sufficient funds to run the club. As a result, Pontic announced they refused to promote to the First Division. Soon later, Pontic was punished and had their club qualification cancelled, meaning that they were not able to compete in every league and cup organised by the Hong Kong Football Association. Chow became Free Agent afterwards.\n\nSouthern\nChow joined Second Division side Southern in the 2011–12 season. Under coaching of Fung Hoi Man, Chow was a usual starter for the club, featuring 20 league matches and scoring 2 goals. Southern successfully gain promotion to the First Division as they placed second in the league.\nThe 2012–13 season was a year of breakthrough for Chow Ka Wa, as his impressive performance and co-operation with fellow team-mates Dieguito, Jonathan Carril and Ip Chung Long attracted people's eyes. He made a great impact on Southern's 8-game unbeaten in the league during the season. Unfortunately, Chow was injured in January and was forced to stay on the sidelines for two months.\nOn 20 April 2013, he scored the winning goal in the 68th minute after being substituted in the 60th minute against South China, not just helping the club to win 3–2, but also helping them to secure the league 4th place. This was also Chow's first game after his recovery on his injury. This goal became more important as Southern qualified for the 2013 Hong Kong AFC Cup play-offs by finishing fourth in the league, as Kitchee won the FA Cup on 11 May 2013 after they had secure a place in the play-offs by finishing second in the league.\n\nCareer statistics\nClub\nAs of 5 May 2013.\nRemarks:\n1 Others include 2013 Hong Kong AFC Cup play-offs.2 Hong Kong League Cup only consists of top-tier division clubs.3 Hong Kong League Cup was not held in the 2009–10 and 2012–13 seasons.\nPassage 2:\nKenneth Gyang\nKenneth Gyang is a young filmmaker in Nigeria and was born in Barkin Ladi of Plateau State, Nigeria.\nHe studied Film Production at the National Film Institute in Jos and screenwriting at Gaston Kaboré's IMAGINE in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso.

The title of the film was inspired by the lyrics of the late Afrobeat singer Fela Kuti's song \"Confusion\". Confusion Na Wa won the Best picture at the 9th Africa Movie Academy Awards, it also won the award for Best Nigerian film.\nThe film tells a story on how so many interconnected separate events come together to complicate the lives of people.\n\nPlot\nThe film starts with a monologue by an unnamed narrator explaining the synopsis of the film with images from the end of the film. Emeka Nwosu (Ramsey Nouah) is stuck in a traffic jam caused by the death of a pedestrian, when his concubine, Isabella (Tunde Aladese), sends him a text reminding him to get home early so they can have fun together. City hustlers Charles (OC Ukeje) and Chichi (Gold Ikponmwosa) arrive at the scene, and as a fight breaks out on the crowded road Emeka is knocked down and his phone falls out of his pocket, and after Emeka walks away unknowingly, Charles steals it. Bello (Ali Nuhu) is a diligent and honest civil servant, whose only \"crime\" at the office has been his refusal to partake in any of the corrupt practice by his co-workers. His raucous boss uses every opportunity to disrespect him. During a workday, Bello is given more jobs to do by his colleagues after work hours. He reluctantly accepts and is subsequently abused by his boss for not finishing the job on time despite his explanations.\nCharles and Chichi review the pictures on the stolen phone and try to reach an agreement on what to do with the phone. The two friends force their entry to the car of a publisher by breaking the wheel-screen, and steal the stereo. They buy some drinks with the money they got and begin discussing on their interpretation of The Lion King as seen by Africans. Emeka notices that his phone has been stolen and tries calling his number, but is told by Charlie that due to \"The Circle of Life\" in The Lion King ownership has been passed on to them from him. He furiously disengages from the conversation on the resistance of the friends to start a meaningful conversation. He is calmed by his concubine Isabella afterwards.\nBabajide (Tony Goodman) is the head publisher of Righteous Trumpet Newspaper. During a family dinner he explains the car robbery he faced and is surprised that both his wife and kids did not condemn the act by the thieves with complete disdain—instead, a sociological debate starts between him and his son, Kola (Nathaniel Deme) who is shifting the blame from the thieves to the government. His mum introduces another topic to end the heated debate since neither side will let go.\nCharles persuades Chichi to accompany him to a drug dealer, Muri (Toyin Oshinaike). Charles had previously had sex with Muri's sister but Chichi is negligent and wants to visit another dealer at \"Abbatoir\". He later retires then follows Charles. They buy drugs worth N200, and as Muri's sister walks outside and Muri notices Chichi facial expressions towards her, Muri tells them that his sister is about to get married . Charles and Chichi have a reflective discussion while having a cigar when Chichi informs Charles that he will be relocating to Bauchi State to start a new life with his uncle. Charles gives him the stolen phone as a farewell gift.\nThe two friends interrupt the sexual intercourse between a disturbed Emeka and Isabella with a call, and they start to negotiate a ransom for the recovery of the phone, while Emeka's wife waits for him at home. Kola's sister, Doyin (Yachat Sankey) sneaks out of the house to attend a party and persuades Kola to promise not to tell their parents. At the party, Charles drugs Doyin's friend, Fola (Lisa Pam-Tok) then the power goes out and he rapes her. Chichi refuses to use drugs on Doyin and opts to get her number instead. Police raid the party and arrest many including Charles. At home, Babajide tries motivating Kola with some fatherly advise and explains to him that he needs to start taking responsibility to become a man. He instructs Kola to join him at his office the next day.\nAt home we see that Bello's wife is Isabella, and he questions his wife on her whereabouts the previous day. She feels irritated in the course of their argument, especially at his mention of lack of money as the reason for them not wanting to have a child. On his way to work the next day, Babajide and Kola engage in a father-son conversation, and Babajide narrates his life-story on how he was able to overcome challenges during the civil war and establish his company. He gets distracted then splashes muddy water on Bello, who is walking along the road. Bello reacts angrily by throwing a stone at the car and regrettably breaking the back-screen. Babjide refuses to accept any compensation or apology from him and decides to take him to the Police Station explaining to him that as a good example to his son, whenever crimes are committed, it should always be a matter for the police. As he zooms off with Bello in his car, the sticker on his car reads \"I am an Ideal Citizen, what about you?\". Bello refuses to bribe his way out of jail at the request of the corrupt policemen and is placed in the same cell as Charles. Babajide introduces Kola to his staff at the office and tells him to write an article on the decline of the moral level in the society, using his ordeal (with the thieves and Bello) as a guide, even though he had previously told him to write on the power supply.\nAfter some hours, the police release Bello, having encountered difficulty in extorting money from either him or Babajide; however they refuse to help him find his wallet, which is later revealed to have been stolen by Charles in the cell. Afterwards he is set free after his Parole Officer warns him that he will not be given a second chance if he breaks the law again. He sets out to his father's house, where the nagging of his mum about his way of life drove him out. Charles and Chichi meets on a hill, where they discuss the previous night and their encounter with the ladies. They call Emeka and threaten to blackmail him by telling his wife of his extra-marital affairs, if he does not yield to their demands. Doyin informs Kola that her friend is missing and he should come to her rescue. Kola leaves his dad's office to assist her in finding Fola. After searching for some time, they find Fola by the road then take her home to an apprehensive dad, Adekunle (Toyin Alabi) who swore to kill whoever was responsible for the rape. Isabella informs Emeka that she is pregnant, and he refuses the pregnancy and advises her to return to her husband. Babajide consults many of his colleagues to examine if his suspicion that Kola is gay is true. Bello angrily abandons his work after getting fed-up with the kind of treatment he has been subjected to by his boss and colleagues. Adekunle gets the address of Emeka through his phone number (from Chichi). He consults Bello's office and pays his way to get the personal details of the owner of the phone.\nEmeka narrates his phone theft story to his wife, Irene (Yewande Iruemiobe) and she discourages him from paying the ransom. On his way out to meet Charles and Chichi, he is stopped by Adekunle, who slaps him severely thinking he is Chichi. After some explanations from Irene, Adekunle lets Emeka go but takes the ransom from him. Babajide questions Kola, and stylishly tries to get him to speak about his view of sexuality. Kola's responses suggest that he is unsure about what he feels about his sexual attractions, and so his dad immediately takes him to Muri in order to be cleansed of homosexuality. Bello's wife Isabella tries to impose her pregnancy on him, but he refuses citing \"lack of sex\" as a reason. He later sees messages that implicate Isabella on her phone.\nCharles and Chichi are discussing with Muri on how they will extort money from Emeka at their meeting in Shayi's. Muri also tells them that he was paid N115,000 by Adekunle for a firearm. Kola and his dad arrive at Muri's bar explaining their ordeal to him. He responds, requesting that his \"nurses\" cleanse Kola of homosexuality. Bello arrives at Shayi's and suspiciously approaches a man, who he mistakenly thought was Emeka. Adekunle also arrives the scene then shoots Chichi (thinking he was Charles) who was seated with Charles close to the entrance of the restaurant.\n\nCast\nRamsey Noah as Emeka Nwosu\nOC Ukeje as Charles\nAli Nuhu as Bello\nTunde Aladese as Isabella\nGold Ikponmwosa as Chichi\nTony Goodman as Babajide\nNathaniel Deme as Kola\nYanchat Sankey as Doyin\nLisa Pam Tok as Fola\nToyin Alabi as Adekunle\n\nReception\nThe film was received with positive reviews with Sodas and Popcorn rating it 4 out of 5, describing it as one of the best movies of 2013 and an inspiration to Nigeria's filmmakers.\n\nAccolades\nIt won 2 awards at the 9th Africa Movie Academy Awards.

He was the director of the Peabody Essex Museum in Salem for 17 months, resigning December 31, 2020. He was the director of the Toledo Museum of Art in Ohio from 2010 to 2019. He was the director of the Hood Museum of Art from 2005 to 2010, and the National Gallery of Australia (Canberra) from 1997 to 2004.\n\nCareer\nBrian Kennedy currently lives and works in the United States after leaving Australia in 2005 to direct the Hood Museum of Art at Dartmouth College. In October 2010 he became the ninth Director of the Toledo Museum of Art. On 1 July 2019, he succeeded Dan Monroe as the executive director and CEO of the Peabody Essex Museum.\n\nEarly life and career in Ireland\nKennedy was born in Dublin and attended Clonkeen College. He received B.A. (1982), M.A. (1985) and PhD (1989) degrees from University College-Dublin, where he studied both art history and history.\nHe worked in the Irish Department of Education (1982), the European Commission, Brussels (1983), and in Ireland at the Chester Beatty Library (1983–85), Government Publications Office (1985–86), and Department of Finance (1986–89). He married Mary Fiona Carlin in 1988.He was Assistant Director at the National Gallery of Ireland in Dublin from 1989 to 1997. He was Chair of the Irish Association of Art Historians from 1996 to 1997, and of the Council of Australian Art Museum Directors from 2001 to 2003. In September 1997 he became Director of the National Gallery of Australia.\n\nNational Gallery of Australia (NGA)\nKennedy expanded the traveling exhibitions and loans program throughout Australia, arranged for several major shows of Australian art abroad, increased the number of exhibitions at the museum itself and oversaw the development of an extensive multi-media site.  Although he oversaw several years of the museum's highest ever annual visitation, he discontinued the emphasis of his predecessor, Betty Churcher, on showing \"blockbuster\" exhibitions.\nDuring his directorship, the NGA gained government support for improving the building and significant private donations and corporate sponsorship. However, the initial design for the building proved controversial generating a public dispute with the original architect on moral rights grounds.  As a result, the project was not delivered during Dr Kennedy's tenure, with a significantly altered design completed some years later.  Private funding supported two acquisitions of British art, including David Hockney's A Bigger Grand Canyon in 1999, and Lucian Freud's After Cézanne in 2001. Kennedy built on the established collections at the museum by acquiring the Holmgren-Spertus collection of Indonesian textiles; the Kenneth Tyler collection of editioned prints, screens, multiples and unique proofs; and the Australian Print Workshop Archive. He was also notable for campaigning for the construction of a new \"front\" entrance to the Gallery, facing King Edward Terrace, which was completed in 2010 (see reference to the building project above).\nKennedy's cancellation of the \"Sensation exhibition\" (scheduled at the NGA from 2 June 2000 to 13 August 2000) was controversial, and seen by some as censorship. He claimed that the decision was due to the exhibition being \"too close to the market\" implying that a national cultural institution cannot exhibit the private collection of a speculative art investor. However, there were other exhibitions at the NGA during his tenure, which could have raised similar concerns. The exhibition featured the privately owned Young British Artists works belonging to Charles Saatchi and attracted large attendances in London and Brooklyn. Its most controversial work was Chris Ofili's The Holy Virgin Mary, a painting which used elephant dung and was accused of being blasphemous. The then-mayor of New York, Rudolph Giuliani, campaigned against the exhibition, claiming it was \"Catholic-bashing\" and an \"aggressive, vicious, disgusting attack on religion.\" In November 1999, Kennedy cancelled the exhibition and stated that the events in New York had \"obscured discussion of the artistic merit of the works of art\". He has said that it \"was the toughest decision of my professional life, so far.\"Kennedy was also repeatedly questioned on his management of a range of issues during the Australian Government's Senate Estimates process - particularly on the NGA's occupational health and safety record and concerns about the NGA's twenty-year-old air-conditioning system. The air-conditioning was finally renovated in 2003. Kennedy announced in 2002 that he would not seek extension of his contract beyond 2004, accepting a seven-year term as had his two predecessors.He became a joint Irish-Australian citizen in 2003.\n\nToledo Museum of Art\nThe Toledo Museum of Art is known for its exceptional collections of European and American paintings and sculpture, glass, antiquities, artist books, Japanese prints and netsuke. The museum offers free admission and is recognized for its historical leadership in the field of art education.  During his tenure, Kennedy has focused the museum's art education efforts on visual literacy, which he defines as \"learning to read, understand and write visual language.\"   Initiatives have included baby and toddler tours, specialized training for all staff, docents, volunteers and the launch of a website, www.vislit.org. In November 2014, the museum hosted the International Visual Literacy Association (IVLA) conference, the first Museum to do so. Kennedy has been a frequent speaker on the topic, including 2010 and 2013 TEDx talks on visual and sensory literacy.\nKennedy has expressed an interest in expanding the museum's collection of contemporary art and art by indigenous peoples. Works by Frank Stella, Sean Scully, Jaume Plensa, Ravinder Reddy and Mary Sibande have been acquired.  In addition, the museum has made major acquisitions of Old Master paintings by Frans Hals and Luca Giordano.During his tenure the Toledo Museum of Art has announced the return of several objects from its collection due to claims the objects were stolen and/or illegally exported prior being sold to the museum.  In 2011 a Meissen sweetmeat stand was returned to Germany followed by an Etruscan Kalpis or water jug to Italy (2013), an Indian sculpture of Ganesha (2014) and an astrological compendium to Germany in 2015.\n\nHood Museum of Art\nKennedy became Director of the Hood Museum of Art in July 2005. During his tenure, he implemented a series of large and small-scale exhibitions and oversaw the production of more than 20 publications to bring greater public attention to the museum's remarkable collections of the arts of America, Europe, Africa, Papua New Guinea and the Polar regions. At 70,000 objects, the Hood has one of the largest collections on any American college of university campus. The exhibition, Black Womanhood: Images, Icons, and Ideologies of the African Body, toured several US venues. Kennedy increased campus curricular use of works of art, with thousands of objects pulled from storage for classes annually. Numerous acquisitions were made with the museum's generous endowments, and he curated several exhibitions: including Wenda Gu: Forest of Stone Steles: Retranslation and Rewriting Tang Dynasty Poetry, Sean Scully: The Art of the Stripe, and Frank Stella: Irregular Polygons.\n\nPublications\nKennedy has written or edited a number of books on art, including:\n\nAlfred Chester Beatty and Ireland 1950-1968: A study in cultural politics, Glendale Press (1988), ISBN 978-0-907606-49-9\nDreams and responsibilities: The state and arts in independent Ireland, Arts Council of Ireland (1990), ISBN 978-0-906627-32-7\nJack B Yeats: Jack Butler Yeats, 1871-1957 (Lives of Irish Artists), Unipub (October 1991), ISBN 978-0-948524-24-0\nThe Anatomy Lesson: Art and Medicine (with Davis Coakley), National Gallery of Ireland (January 1992), ISBN 978-0-903162-65-4\nIreland: Art into History (with Raymond Gillespie), Roberts Rinehart Publishers (1994), ISBN 978-1-57098-005-3\nIrish Painting, Roberts Rinehart Publishers (November 1997),  ISBN 978-1-86059-059-7\nSean Scully: The Art of the Stripe, Hood Museum of Art (October 2008), ISBN 978-0-944722-34-3\nFrank Stella: Irregular Polygons, 1965-1966, Hood Museum of Art (October 2010), ISBN 978-0-944722-39-8\n\nHonors and achievements\nKennedy was awarded the Australian Centenary Medal in 2001 for service to Australian Society and its art. He is a trustee and treasurer of the Association of Art Museum Directors, a peer reviewer for the American Association of Museums and a member of the International Association of Art Critics. In 2013 he was appointed inaugural eminent professor at the University of Toledo and received an honorary doctorate from Lourdes University. Most recently, Kennedy received the 2014 Northwest Region, Ohio Art Education Association award for distinguished educator for art education.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nPassage 8:\nFung Hing Wa\nFung Hing Wa (Chinese: 馮慶燁, born 12 December 1992 in Hong Kong) is a Hong Kong professional football player who currently plays as a centre back for Hong Kong Premier League club Lee Man.\n\nClub career\nIn 2005, Fung through a project to go to Newcastle United to have training.In 2008, Fung signed for Hong Kong Third Division club Sham Shui Po. \nIn 2012, Fung signed for Hong Kong First Division club Yokohama FC Hong Kong.In 2015, Fung signed for Hong Kong Premier League club Pegasus.On 17 July 2019, Eastern announced the signing of Fung at their season opening media event.On 30 June 2020, it was confirmed that Fung had left the club in order to sign with R&F.On 19 November 2020, Fung announced that he reached a mutual termination with R&F and had returned to Eastern.On 19 June 2022, Fung left Eastern again.\nOn 15 July 2022, Fung joined Lee Man.\n\nInternational career\nOn 11 December 2019, Fung made his international debut for Hong Kong in the match against South Korea in the 2019 EAFF E-1 Football Championship.\n\nCareer Statistics\nClub\nAs of 20 May 2021\n\nInternational\nAs of matches played 14 June 2022\n\nHonours\nClub\nSham Shui PoHong Kong Second Division: 2010–11\nHong Kong Third Division: 2009–10PegasusHong Kong FA Cup: 2015–16\nHong Kong Sapling Cup: 2015–16Tai PoHong Kong Premier League: 2018–19\nHong Kong Sapling Cup: 2016–17Eastern\n\nHong Kong Sapling Cup: 2020–21\nPassage 9:\nIan Barry (director)\nIan Barry is an Australian director of film and TV.\n\nSelect credits\nWaiting for Lucas (1973) (short)\nStone (1974) (editor only)\nThe Chain Reaction (1980)\nWhose Baby?

{"input": "Where was the wife of Alfred L. Copley born?", "context": "Passage 1:\nAgatha (wife of Samuel of Bulgaria)\nAgatha (Bulgarian: Агата, Greek: Άγάθη; fl. late 10th century) was the wife of Emperor Samuel of Bulgaria.\n\nBiography\nAccording to a later addition to the history of the late-11th-century Byzantine historian John Skylitzes, Agatha was a captive from Larissa, and the daughter of the magnate of Dyrrhachium, John Chryselios. Skylitzes explicitly refers to her as the mother of Samuel's heir Gavril Radomir, which means that she was probably Samuel's wife. On the other hand, Skylitzes later mentions that Gavril Radomir himself also took a beautiful captive, named Irene, from Larissa as his wife. According to the editors of the Prosopographie der mittelbyzantinischen Zeit, this may have been a source of confusion for a later copyist, and Agatha's real origin was not Larissa, but Dyrrhachium. According to the same work, it is likely that she had died by ca. 998, when her father surrendered Dyrrhachium to the Byzantine emperor Basil II.Only two of Samuel's and Agatha's children are definitely known by name: Gavril Radomir and Miroslava. Two further, unnamed, daughters are mentioned in 1018, while Samuel is also recorded as having had a bastard son.Agatha is one of the central characters in Dimitar Talev's novel Samuil.\nPassage 2:\nNína Tryggvadóttir\nNína Tryggvadóttir (March 16, 1913 – June 18, 1968) was born Jónína Tryggvadóttir in Seyðisfjörður, Iceland.

She is also known under the technically incorrect name Empress Shōken (昭憲皇后, Shōken-kōgō). She was one of the founders of the Japanese Red Cross Society, whose charity work was known throughout the First Sino-Japanese War.\n\nEarly life\nLady Masako Ichijō was born on 9 May 1849, in Heian-kyō, Japan. She was the third daughter of Tadayoshi Ichijō, former Minister of the Left and head of the Fujiwara clan's Ichijō branch. Her adoptive mother was one of Prince Fushimi Kuniie's daughters, but her biological mother was Tamiko Niihata, the daughter of a doctor from the Ichijō family. Unusually for the time, she had been vaccinated against smallpox. As a child, Masako was somewhat of a prodigy: she was able to read poetry from the Kokin Wakashū by the age of 4 and had composed some waka verses of her own by the age of 5. By age seven, she was able to read some texts in classical Chinese with some assistance and was studying Japanese calligraphy. By the age of 12, she had studied the koto and was fond of Noh drama. She excelled in the studies of finances, ikebana and Japanese tea ceremony.The major obstacle to Lady Masako's eligibility to become empress consort was the fact that she was 3 years older than Emperor Meiji, but this issue was resolved by changing her official birth date from 1849 to 1850. They became engaged on 2 September 1867, when she adopted the given name Haruko (美子), which was intended to reflect her \nserene beauty and diminutive size.\nThe Tokugawa Bakufu promised 15,000 ryō in gold for the wedding and assigned her an annual income of 500 koku, but as the Meiji Restoration occurred before the wedding could be completed, the promised amounts were never delivered. The wedding was delayed partly due to periods of mourning for Emperor Kōmei,  for her brother Saneyoshi, and the political disturbances around Kyoto between 1867 and 1868.\n\nEmpress of Japan\nLady Haruko and Emperor Meiji's wedding was finally officially celebrated on 11 January 1869. She was the first imperial consort to receive the title of both nyōgō and of kōgō (literally, the emperor's wife, translated as \"empress consort\"), in several hundred years. However, it soon became clear that she was unable to bear children. Emperor Meiji already had 12 children by 5 concubines, though: as custom in Japanese monarchy, Empress Haruko adopted Yoshihito, her husband's eldest son by Lady Yanagihara Naruko, who became Crown Prince. On 8 November 1869, the Imperial House departed from Kyoto for the new capital of Tokyo. In a break from tradition, Emperor Meiji insisted that the Empress and the senior ladies-in-waiting should attend the educational lectures given to the Emperor on a regular basis about national conditions and developments in foreign nations.\n\nInfluence\nOn 30 July 1886, Empress Haruko attended the Peeresses School's graduation ceremony in Western clothing. On 10 August, the imperial couple received foreign guests in Western clothing for the first time when hosting a Western Music concert.From this point onward, the Empress' entourage wore only Western-style clothes in public, to the point that in January 1887 \nEmpress Haruko issued a memorandum on the subject: traditional Japanese dress was not only unsuited to modern life, but Western-style dress was closer than the kimono to clothes worn by Japanese women in ancient times.In the diplomatic field, Empress Haruko hosted the wife of former US President Ulysses S. Grant during his visit to Japan. She was also present for her husband's meetings with Hawaiian King Kalākaua in 1881. Later that same year, she helped host the visit of the sons of future British King Edward VII: Princes Albert Victor and George (future George V), who presented her with a pair of pet wallabies from Australia.On  26 November 1886, Empress Haruko accompanied her husband to Yokosuka, Kanagawa to observe the new Imperial Japanese Navy cruisers Naniwa and Takachiho firing torpedoes and performing other maneuvers. From 1887, the Empress was often at the Emperor's side in official visits to army maneuvers. When Emperor Meiji fell ill in 1888, Empress Haruko took his place in welcoming envoys from Siam, launching warships and visiting Tokyo Imperial University. In 1889, Empress Haruko accompanied Emperor Meiji on his official visit to Nagoya and Kyoto. While he continued on to visit naval bases at Kure and Sasebo, she went to Nara to worship at the principal Shinto shrines.Known throughout her tenure for her support of charity work and women's education during the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–95), Empress Haruko worked for the establishment of the Japanese Red Cross Society. She participated in the organization's administration, especially in their peacetime activities in which she created a money fund for the International Red Cross. Renamed \"The Empress Shōken Fund\", it is presently used for international welfare activities. After Emperor Meiji moved his military headquarters from Tokyo to Hiroshima to be closer to the lines of communications with his troops, Empress Haruko joined her husband in March 1895. While in Hiroshima, she insisted on visiting hospitals full of wounded soldiers every other day of her stay.\n\nDeath\nAfter Emperor Meiji's death in 1912, Empress Haruko was granted the title Empress Dowager (皇太后, Kōtaigō) by her adoptive son, Emperor Taishō. She died in 1914 at the Imperial Villa in Numazu, Shizuoka and was buried in the East Mound of the Fushimi Momoyama Ryo in Fushimi, Kyoto, next to her husband. Her soul was enshrined in Meiji Shrine in Tokyo. On 9 May 1914, she received the posthumous name Shōken Kōtaigō (昭憲皇太后). Her railway-carriage can be seen today in the Meiji Mura Museum, in Inuyama, Aichi prefecture.\n\nHonours\nNational\nGrand Cordon of the Order of the Precious Crown, 1 November 1888\n\nForeign\nShe received the following orders and decorations:\n Russian Empire: Grand Cross of the Order of St. Catherine, 13 December 1887\n Spain: Dame of the Order of Queen Maria Luisa, 29 November 1889\n Siam: Dame of the Order of the Royal House of Chakri, 12 October 1899\n German Empire: Dame of the Order of Louise, 1st Class, 19 May 1903\n Kingdom of Bavaria: Dame of Honour of the Order of Theresa, 29 February 1904\n Korean Empire: Grand Cordon of the Order of the Auspicious Phoenix, 27 July 1908\n\nAncestry\nSee also\nEmpress of Japan\nŌmiya Palace\n\nNotes\nPassage 9:\nArtaynte\nArtaynte (f. 478 BC), was the wife of the Crown Prince Darius.\n\nLife\nDaughter of an unnamed woman and Prince Masistes, a marshall of the armies during the invasion of Greece in 480-479 BC, and the brother of King Xerxes I.\nDuring the Greek campaign Xerxes developed a passionate desire for the wife of Masistes, but she would constantly resist and would not bend to his will. Upon his return to Sardis, the king endeavoured to bring about the marriage of his son Daris to Artaynte, the daughter of this woman the wife of Masistes, supposing that by doing so he could obtain her more easily.\nAfter moving to Susa he brought Artaynte to the royal house with him for his son Daris, but fell in love with her himself, and after obtaining her they became lovers. \nAt the behest of Xerxes, Artaynte committed adultery with him (Xerxes). When queen Amestris found out, she did not seek revenge against Artaynte, but against her mother, Masistes' wife, as Amestris thought that it was her connivance. On Xerxes' birthday, Amestris sent for his guards and mutilated Masistes' wife by cutting off her breasts and threw them to dogs, and her nose and ears and lips also, and cutting out her tongue as well. On seeing this, Masistes fled to Bactria to start a revolt, but was intercepted by Xerxes' army who killed him and his sons.\nPassage 10:\nEunoë (wife of Bogudes)\nEunoë Maura was the wife of Bogudes, King of Western Mauretania. Her name has also been spelled Euries or Euryes or Eunoa.\n\nBiography\nEarly life\nEunoë Maura was thought to be descended from Berbers, but her name is Greek so it appears she might have been from there or had Greek ancestry. She was likely of very high status, as she is mentioned by historian Suetonius in the same context as Cleopatra.\n\nMarriage\nAt an unspecified early date in her marriage to her husband Bogud he mounted an expedition along the Atlantic coast, seemingly venturing into the tropics. When he returned he presented his wife Eunoë with gigantic reeds and asparagus he had found on the journey.She is believed to have been a mistress of Julius Caesar. She may have replaced Cleopatra in Caesar's affections, when he arrived in North Africa prior to the Battle of Thapsus on 6 April 46 BC, the two were among several queens courted by Caesar. It is also possible that they first met in Spain if she accompanied her husband there on a campaign. Only a brief romance for the Roman, both Eunoe and Bogudes profited through gifts bestowed on them by Caesar. Caesar departed from Africa in June 46 BC, five and a half months after he landed.\n\nCultural depictions\nEunoë and Caesar's affair is greatly exaggerated and expanded on in the Medieval French prose work Faits des Romains. Jeanette Beer in her book A Medieval Caesar states that the Roman general is \"transformed into Caesar, the medieval chevalier\" in the text, and that the author is more interested in Caesar's sexual dominance over the queen than the political dominance he held over her husband Bogud. The text describes her; \"Eunoe was the most beautiful woman in four kingdoms — nevertheless, she was Moorish\", which Beer further analysed as being indicative of the fact that it was unimaginable to audiences of the time to believe that a lover of Caesar could be ugly, but that Moors still represented everything that was ugly to them.Eunoë has also been depicted in several novels about Caesar, as well as serialized stories in The Cornhill Magazine. In such fiction her character often serves as a foil for the relationship between Caesar and another woman, mostly Cleopatra, such as in The Memoirs of Cleopatra, The Bloodied Toga and When We Were Gods. In Song of the Nile she also plays a posthumous role as a person of interest for Cleopatra's daughter Selene II who became queen of Mauritania after her.Eunoe has also been depicted in a numismatic drawing by Italian artist and polymath Jacopo Strada, who lived in the 16th century. There is however no archaeological evidence of a coin that bears her name or picture.\n\nSee also\nWomen in ancient Rome", "answers": ["Seyðisfjörður"], "length": 4396, "dataset": "2wikimqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "3be59c383b827f15b3aeae8e3be3403f89c8635f0acf9330"}

It was released on YouTube and Steam on 14 June 2017.\n\nPlot\nChapter 1: World\nIn the near future, Earth will be attacked by technologically superior and highly aggressive reptilian aliens called the Klum (pronounced \"klume\"). Humanity is nearing extinction with millions dead or enslaved. The Klum transform the Earth in favor of their own ideal living conditions. They do this at first by burning forests and destroying cities. Then they build megastructures that alter the atmosphere by pumping out methane. The gas makes it progressively harder for terrestrial life to breathe. And it warms the climate, which leads to flooding of coastal cities.\nThe story begins in 2020, from the viewpoint of resistance fighters in Texas, a group of US Army soldiers and many others who have banded together. Most human survivors live underground or among ruins. They have barely enough provisions, weapons, and ammunition. The humans fight by using whatever they can against the primary Klum weapon: an omnipresent nanite in their weaponry, and telepathic control over any human that makes direct eye contact with them.\nThe resistance makes \"brain-barriers\" that block this\nmind control. The Klum know, however, that a scarcity of materials means a scarcity of brain barriers. They hope, therefore, to win a war of attrition against the human survivors.\nSome prisoners are living incubators for the Klum's young, which inevitably kills the victims. Others are dissected. Still other humans are converted into human loudspeakers that urge humans to surrender into \"conservatories\". Very few humans ever escape.\nAfter the Klum destroy a militia convoy with an airstrike, one of the surviving soldiers witnesses an angel-like being materialize from thin air. The narration describes ″them″ as mankind's saviours.\n\nChapter 2: Amir & Nosh\nNosh is a tech-savvy pyromaniac and bomb-maker, eking out a living in a scrapyard far from the resistance. The resistance despises Nosh for his murderous glee and demands - giving the sick or suicidal over as bait during his many IED ambushes. They must, however, give in to Nosh's demands to\nsecure the IEDs and the brain-barriers he makes.\nThe resistance stumble across Amir, a mute who has escaped from the Klum. He has extensive cybernetics across his head and shoulders. Amid opposition from her lieutenants, the resistance leader, Jasper, releases Amir from her custody into the care of a resistance fighter named Sarah.\nSarah, having lost her daughter to the Klum's experiments, takes a liking to him. She gives Amir food and drink while trying to persuade him to help the resistance fight the Klum by using the precognitive abilities he acquired via the aliens' experiments.\n\nChapter 3: Siege\nAmir recovers physically and mentally. Then, because of his implant, he has a premonition involving a wounded Klum on the run from militia forces.\nSarah pleads with Amir to help the militia officers to stop the genocide. The more she talks to him, the more his eyes change, seeing the premonition of the impending attack more clearly. Amir, still mute, foresees the militia successfully shooting down an alien aircraft, and the pilot is the alien on the run.\nSarah asks Amir if they will be able to learn how to hunt the Klum and teach them how to fear. Unable to answer, he foresees the Klum telekinetically bashing one of the militia soldiers, disconnecting his brain barrier and causing him to be mind-controlled, turning on his comrades, who are forced to kill him.\nSarah tells Amir that he now has the abilities the aliens have and that he is to use them for humanity. Back in the vision, the militia surround the Klum; Jasper orders the militia to cut off its head. The film ends with Sarah urging Amir to use his abilities because he is humanity's last hope.\n\nCast\nSigourney Weaver as Jasper\nEugene Khumbanyiwa as Amir\nRobert Hobbs as Carl\nCarly Pope as Sarah\nBrandon Auret as Nosh\nMike Huff as Policeman\nOwen McCrae as Klum\nConnor Page as Child\nJay Anstey as A suicide bomber\nJustin Shaw as Man in medical device\nCarla Marais as eight-year-old girl\nRyan Angilley as Martinez\nAlec Gillis as Militia officer 1\nRuan Coetzee as Militia officer 2\nPaul Davies as Militia officer 3\nPieter Jacobz as Militia officer 4\nPassage 4:\nRoyal Tramp II\nRoyal Tramp II is a 1992 Hong Kong film based on Louis Cha's novel The Deer and the Cauldron.

There, the sect leader reminds her of their mission to support Ng Sam-kwai's, a military general, campaign for the throne before abdicating her title to Lung-er.\nSiu-bo lounges at the brothel where he once worked but is then attacked by disciples of the One Arm Nun, an anti-Qing revolutionary figure, before being quickly subdued. When Siu-bo tries to take advantage of them, Ng Ying-hung, Ng Sam-kwai's son, exposes his lies. Scorned and unaware of the stranger's title, Siu-bo sends his men after Ying-Hung, but Lung-er, now disguised as Ying-hung's male bodyguard, easily fends them off.\nAt the palace, The Emperor, wary of Ng Sam-kwai's intentions, marries off the Princess to Ying-hung and assigns Siu-bo to be the Imperial Inspector General of the wedding march, so that he can keep his eyes on the general's activities. This complicates Siu-bo's relationship with Princess when she tells Siu-bo she's pregnant with his child.\nThe One Arm Nun and her disciple, Ah Ko, later ambushes the procession. Fighting to a standstill with Lung-er, the assailants escape with Ying-hung and Siu-bo. However, Siu-bo garners some respect from her when he reveals his dual identity as a Heaven and Earth Society commander. Lung-er finally catches up to them with reinforcements at an inn but only manages to rescue Siu-bo. Having been saved by Ying-hung before, Ah Ko elopes with him amid the confusion.\nAt the Dragon Sect camp, Ying-hung and Fung Sek-fan secretly poisons Lung-er and turn the followers against her. She escapes with Siu-bo but must have sex with a man before dawn, otherwise she will die. However, this will transfer 4/5th of her martial arts' power to whomever she sleeps with. Despite Siu-bo's lecherous personality, Lung-er accepts his blunt honesty as a sign of virtue and chooses to sacrifice her virginity to Siu-bo and becomes his third wife.\nWhen Siu-bo gets back to the Princess, they execute a plan to castrate Ying-hung. With her betrothed no longer able to produce heirs, the Princess is taken by Siu-bo as his fourth wife. Enraged by the end of his family line, Ng Ying-hung prematurely gathers his troops and sets out to wage war with the Emperor. He tasks Fung Sek-fan with killing the Princess and Siu-bo. Though Chan Kan-nam manages to intervene and lets his disciple escape.\nLater, the One Arm Nun captures the elopers, Ying-hung and Ah Ko, and offers them to Siu-bo. Siu-bo pardons them and even takes Ah Ko as his fifth wife. Afterward, Fung Sek-fan is promoted when he surrenders Ng Sam-kwai's battle plans and Chan Kan-nam to the Emperor. Given Siu-bo's muddied history with the Heaven and Earth Society, the Emperor tasks him with Chan's execution. Siu-bo's newfound power is difficult for him to control, and Chan helps him master it in time for him to use it against Fung. Siu-bo also uncovers the secret of the 42 Chapters books after burning them in frustration, revealing hidden stones that are left unburned, revealing map coordinates to the location of the treasure all major parties have been attempting to locate.\nIn order to save his master, Siu-bo defeats Fung with his newly acquired martial arts power after both falling into a hidden cave wherein the treasure is found, and swaps Feng's body with Chan's before the execution to save his master. And just as he was about to escape with his wives and Chan, the Emperor arrives with his troops, having been sold out by Siu-bo's opportunistic friend To-lung who is now involved romantically with Siu-bo's sister. But seeing that they are friends, his sister is in love with Siu-bo, and with Siu-bo bluffing that he's strong enough to demolish the Emperor and his entire army if he wanted, the Emperor lets them go, declaring that Siu-bo has died and no longer exists as far as he's concerned. Siu-bo laughs afterward that the Emperor fell for his bluff.\n\nCast\nStephen Chow as Wai Siu-bo\nBrigitte Lin as Lung-er\nChingmy Yau as Princess Kin-ning\nMichelle Reis as Ah Ko/Li Ming-ko\nNatalis Chan as To-lung\nDamian Lau as Chan Kan-nam\nDeric Wan as Hong-hei Emperor\nKent Tong as Ng Ying-hung, Sam-kwai's son\nPaul Chun as Ng Sam-kwai\nSandra Ng as Wai Chun-fa\nFennie Yuen as Seung-yee twin\nVivian Chan as Seung-yee twin\nYen Shi-kwan as Fung Sek-fan\nHelen Ma as Kau-nan/one-armed Divine nun\nSharla Cheung as Mo Tung-chu / Empress Dowager\nLaw Lan as founder of Divine Dragon Sect\nTam Suk-moi as Ah Nong\nHoh Choi-chow as Palace guard Wen Shan Lun\nYeung Jing-jing\nWan Seung-lam\nLee Fai\nCheng Ka-sang\nHo Wing-cheung\nKwan Yung\nTo Wai-wo\nPassage 5:\nPal Pal Dil Ke Ssaat\nPal Pal Dil Ke Ssaat is a 2009 Hindi-language film directed by V.K.Kumar, starring Ajay Jadeja, Vinod Kambli, Mahi Gill, Satish Shah and Sushma Seth.\n\nCast\nAjay Jadeja as Ajay Kapoor\nMahie Gill as Dolly\nVinod Kambli as Himself\nSatish Shah as John Abraham\nSushma Seth as Mrs. Kapoor\nVivek Mishra as Paniker\nAnshul Nagar as Vinit Khanna\nTanvir Azmi as Makhan Singh\nPassage 6:\nPyar Ki Jeet (1948 film)\nPyar Ki Jeet   (Love's Victory) is a 1948 Indian Bollywood film.

It premiered at the 2011 Sundance Film Festival in January, and was given a limited theatrical release on July 22, 2011, by Fox Searchlight Pictures. The film earned two nominations at the 38th Saturn Awards for Marling's performance and for Cahill and Marling's writing. The critical consensus on Rotten Tomatoes calls it slow paced but soulful.\n\nPlot\nRhoda Williams (Brit Marling), a brilliant 17-year-old girl who has spent her young life fascinated by astronomy, is delighted to learn that she has been accepted into MIT. She celebrates, drinking with friends, and in a reckless moment, drives home intoxicated. Listening to a story on the radio about a recently discovered Earth-like planet, she gazes out her car window at the stars and inadvertently hits a stopped car at an intersection, putting John Burroughs (William Mapother) in a coma and killing his pregnant wife and young son. After serving her four-year prison sentence, Rhoda becomes a janitor at her former high school and struggles with guilt and regret.\nHearing more news stories about the mirror Earth, Rhoda enters an essay contest sponsored by a millionaire entrepreneur who is offering a civilian space flight to the mirror Earth.\nOne day Rhoda sees John laying a toy at the accident site. She visits his house, intending to apologize. He answers the door and she loses her nerve. Instead, she pretends to be a maid offering a free day of cleaning as a marketing tool for a cleaning service. John, who has dropped out of his Yale music faculty position, has been letting his home and himself go, and accepts Rhoda's offer. He has no idea who she is, and when she finishes asks her to come back the next week. In time, a caring relationship develops and they have sex.\nRhoda wins the essay contest and is chosen to be one of the first to travel to the other Earth. John asks her not to go, believing they might have a future together. She finally decides to tell him the truth about who she is. He is upset and throws her out of the house.\nRhoda hears an astrophysicist talking on television, describing a \"broken mirror\" hypothesis which states that upon the sighting of the twin-Earth the synchronicity of events happening in both the Earths was broken. Rhoda rushes back to John's house, but he refuses to let her in. She breaks into his house, and he begins to strangle her. He stops, and when she recovers she tells him about the theory and that there might be a possibility for his family to still be alive on the other Earth. She leaves him the ticket. In time, she learns that John accepted the gift and becomes one of the first civilian space travelers to the other Earth.\nFour months later, on a foggy day, Rhoda approaches her house, discovering her other self from Earth 2 standing in front of her.\n\nCast\nBrit Marling as Rhoda Williams\nWilliam Mapother as John Burroughs\nJordan Baker as Kim Williams\nRobin Lord Taylor as Jeff Williams\nFlint Beverage as Robert Williams\nKumar Pallana as Purdeep\nDiane Ciesla as Dr. Joan Tallis\nRupert Reid as Keith Harding\nRichard Berendzen as himself (narrator)\n\nProduction\nThe idea behind Another Earth first developed out of director Mike Cahill and actress Brit Marling speculating as to what it would be like were one to encounter one's own self. In order to explore the possibility on a large scale, they devised the concept of a duplicate Earth. The visual representation of the duplicate planet was deliberately made to evoke the Moon, as Cahill was deeply inspired by the 1969 Apollo 11 lunar landing. This movie shares some of its plot details with the 1969 British sci-fi movie Doppelganger.\n\nAnother Earth was filmed in and around New Haven, Connecticut, Mike Cahill's hometown – with some scenes taking place along the West Haven shoreline and at West Haven High School and Union Station – so that he could avail himself of the services of local friends and family and thus reduce expenses. His childhood home was used as Rhoda's home and his bedroom as Rhoda's room. The scene of the car collision was made possible through the help of a local police officer with whom Cahill was acquainted, who cordoned off part of a highway late one night. The scene in which Rhoda leaves the prison facility was filmed by having Marling walk into an actual prison posing as a yoga instructor and then exiting.\nAccording to Brit Marling, she approached William Mapother for the role of John after \"being haunted\" by his performance in In the Bedroom (2001). Mapother consented to work on Another Earth for $100 a day. When asked why he agreed to join the cast, considering the \"notoriously hit or miss\" nature of independent films, Mapother replied that he was drawn by the film's subject and by the names involved in the project. At Mapother's insistence, he and the production team worked extensively on the scenes of John and Rhoda in order to develop John's character in the film.The film ignores the physical consequences of having a similar-sized planet and moon appear nearby (e.g. effect on tides, gravity and atmosphere) other than depicting night time as brighter due to the reflection of the Sun's light off the other planet. The DVD / Blu-ray deleted scenes feature reveals that the film makers did intend to illustrate some of the consequences by filming a scene in which Rhoda encounters flowers floating in mid-air, but the scene was cut from the final film.\n\nMusic\nThe musical score was composed by Fall on Your Sword, with the exception of the song played in the musical saw scene, composed by Scott Munson and performed by Natalia Paruz. Mike Cahill came upon Paruz, known also as the \"Saw Lady\", while riding the subway in New York. Mesmerized by her playing, he obtained her contact information and arranged for her to coach William Mapother on how to hold and act as if playing the saw for the scene in the film.\n\nRelease\nAnother Earth had its world premiere at the 27th Sundance Film Festival in January 2011. It was released in dramatic competition. Variety reported: \"[It] has been deemed one of the more highly praised pics of the fest as it received a standing ovation after the screening and strong word of mouth from buyers and festgoers.\" The distributor Fox Searchlight Pictures won distribution rights to the film in a deal worth $1.5 million to $2 million, beating out other distributors including Focus Features and the Weinstein Company.Fox Searchlight is the distributor of Another Earth in the United States, Canada, and other English-speaking territories. The film had a limited release in the United States and Canada on July 22, 2011, expanding to a wide release in ensuing months.In its first week in theaters, it grossed $112,266. Eventually, the film grossed $1.9 million worldwide.\n\nReception\nRotten Tomatoes gives Another Earth a rating of 65% based on 136 reviews and an average score of 6.2/10.  The critical consensus reads: \"Another Earth is often weighed down by placid pacing and ponderousness, but this soulful sci-fi nevertheless offers plenty of profound concepts to ponder.\"Film critic Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film three and a half stars out of four. Ebert commented that, \"Another Earth is as thought-provoking, in a less profound way, as Tarkovsky's Solaris, another film about a sort of parallel Earth\".\n\nAwards\nAnother Earth won the Alfred P. Sloan Prize at the 2011 Sundance Film Festival, for \"focusing on science or technology as a theme, or depicting a scientist, engineer or mathematician as a major character.\" It went on to earn the Audience Award in the category of Narrative Feature at the 2011 Maui Film Festival.Another Earth was named one of the top 10 independent films of the year at the 2011 National Board of Review Awards and was nominated for a Georgia Film Critics Association Award for Best Picture.\n\nSee also\nJourney to the Far Side of the Sun - A 1969 science fiction film that was the first to deal with the premise of a double Earth.

The low-quality special effects, the non-existent acting, the bad dubbing, and the chaotic plotting and pacing were all of a piece with what critics had been saying, erroneously, about the Godzilla movies for years.\" The review referred to the film's \"cheesy special effects and ridiculous dialogue taking on a sort of so-bad-they're-good charm\", and described the film as a \"thoroughly memorable (if not necessarily enjoyable, outside of the MST3K continuum) specimen of bad cinema.\"On October 11, 1997 the film was shown on the movie-mocking television show Mystery Science Theater 3000. In his review of the film, Bruce Eder of AllMovie described the episode as a memorable one, specifically the cast watching the repetitive aerial dogfights between spaceships, and one of the hosts remarking that \"Independence Day seems a richly nuanced movie\". Criticism of the film included excessive use of WWII stock footage in the action scenes (especially the obviously noticeable shot featuring a picture of Adolf Hitler in one building).In his book Japanese Science Fiction, Fantasy and Horror Films, Stuart Galbraith IV stated that the film \"had a few surprises\" despite a \"woefully familiar script\". Galbraith noted that the film was not as over-the-top as Prince of Space and that the opticals in the film were as strong as anything Toho had produced at the time. Galbraith suggested the effects may have been lifted from Toei's The Final War (aka World War III Breaks Out) from 1961.\n\nSee also\nList of Japanese films of 1961\nList of Mystery Science Theater 3000 episodes\nList of science fiction films of the 1960s\n\nNotes", "answers": ["Another Earth"], "length": 5575, "dataset": "2wikimqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "d9a612aad6d6d6f504633151e88dd819e36ed39303c0658b"}

The Weimar-era state of Baden originated from the area of the Grand Duchy. In 1951–1952, it became part of the new state of Baden-Württemberg.\n\nLife\nFriedrich \"Fritz\" Wilhelm Ludwig Leopold August Prinz von Baden was born on 9 July 1857, in Karlsruhe in the state of Baden-Württemberg to Frederick I, Grand Duke of Baden and Princess Louise of Prussia.\nAs a student at the University of Heidelberg, Frederick was a member of the Suevia Corps, a student fraternal organization. Frederick became the head of the House of Zähringen on 28 September 1907, after the death of his father Frederick I, who was the sovereign Grand Duke of Baden reigning from 1856 to 1907. He abdicated on 22 November 1918, amidst the tumults of the German Revolution of 1918–19 which resulted in the abolition of the Grand Duchy. After the death of his cousin Carola of Vasa, he became the representative of the descent of the Kings of Sweden of the House of Holstein-Gottorp. On 20 September 1885 in Schloss Hohenburg, he married Princess Hilda of Nassau, the only daughter of the exiled Duke Adolphe of Nassau who later succeeded as Grand Duke of Luxembourg. There was no surviving issue from the marriage.\nHe was à la suite the Royal Prussian Regiments Erstes Garde-Regiment zu Fuß (1st Guard Foot Regiment) and 1. Garde-Ulanen-Regiment and à la suite the Imperial 1st Seebataillon. He was also Regimentschef of the 4.

This castle is in the present day town of Baden-Baden.\n\nLife\nHermann was the son of Hermann I of Baden and Judit of Backnang-Sulichgau. He was ruler of the March of Verona from 1112 until 1130.\nHe styled himself Dominus in Baden, comes Brisgaviae, marchio Verona. In English, his titles were: Lord in Baden, Count of Brisgau, Margrave of Verona. Around 1070 Hermann began to build Castle Hohenbaden on top of the remains of an old Celtic structure. After the structure was completed in 1112, he gave himself the title Margrave of Baden.\nHe rebuilt the Augustine monastery that his father had built in Backnang in 1123. Hermann was laid to rest in the monastery with the inscription:\n\"In this tomb lies the Margrave Hermann of Baden, who was the founder of this monastery and temple. He died in the year thousand increased by hundred and three times ten fronm the time on when the pious virgin bore .

January 16, 1160)\nJudith (d. 1162), married Ulrich I of Carinthia (d. 1144)\nPassage 5:\nPrince William of Baden (1829–1897)\nPrince Louis William Augustus of Baden (German: Ludwig Wilhelm August Prinz von Baden; 18 December 1829 – 27 April 1897) was a Prussian general and politician. He was the father of Prince Maximilian of Baden, the last Minister President of the Kingdom of Prussia and last Chancellor of the German Empire. Wilhelm was a Prince of Baden, and a member of the House of Zähringen.\n\nFamily\nWilhelm was born in Karlsruhe, Grand Duchy of Baden, on 18 December 1829 as the fifth child and third surviving son of Leopold, Grand Duke of Baden, and his wife Princess Sophie of Sweden. Through his father, Wilhelm was a grandson of Charles Frederick, Grand Duke of Baden and his wife Baroness Louise Caroline Geyer of Geyersberg and through his mother, a grandson of Gustav IV Adolf of Sweden and his wife Frederica of Baden.Wilhelm was a brother of Alexandrine, Duchess of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, Louis II, Grand Duke of Baden, Frederick I, Grand Duke of Baden, Prince Charles of Baden, Marie, Princess Ernest of Leiningen, and Grand Duchess Olga Feodorovna of Russia.\n\nMilitary career\nDuring his brief service in the Baden Federal Contingent (German: Baden Bundescontingente), Wilhelm attained the rank of Lieutenant in 1847 and First Lieutenant in 1849. Beginning between 1849 and 1850, he served as a First Lieutenant in the 1st Foot Guards (German: 1. Garde-Regiment zu Fuß) infantry regiment of the Royal Prussian Army. Wilhelm received his formal education in the Prussian Army. From 1856, Wilhelm served as Major of the Guard Artillery (German: Gardeartillerie) and served as the last Major General and Commander of the Guards Artillery Brigade (German: Gardeartilleriebrigade). Wilhelm retired from Prussian military service in 1863 with the rank of Lieutenant General, shortly before his marriage to Princess Maria of Leuchtenberg.\n\nAustro-Prussian War\nIn 1866, during the Austro-Prussian War between the Kingdom of Prussia and the Austrian Empire, Wilhelm assumed command of the Baden Division of the 8th Federal Corps (German: 8. Bundeskorps) siding with the Austrian-led German Confederation. The dissolution of the 8th Federal Corps began on 30 July 1866 when Wilhelm sent a flag of truce along with a letter to the Prussian headquarters at Marktheidenfeld. The letter stated that Wilhelm's father Leopold, Grand Duke of Baden, had entered into direct negotiations with Wilhelm I of Prussia and that King Wilhelm I granted the Baden troops permission to return to their homes.Immediately following the Austro-Prussian War, Wilhelm reformed the army of Baden based upon the Prussian system. Wilhelm and Prince August of Württemberg were the two south German princes who were foremost in securing the union of the Northern and Southern German states. On 22 September 1868, Wilhelm announced his resignation from the command of the troops of the Grand Duchy of Baden and was replaced by General Beza.\n\nFranco-Prussian War\nIn the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–71, Wilhelm commanded the 1st Baden Brigade in the XIV Corps. On 30 October 1870, Wilhelm and General Gustav Friedrich von Beyer assailed Dijon. The French had transported 10,000 men by rail and the citizens of Dijon, including women, joined in the defense of the city against the Germans. The resistance was not easily subdued and the Germans suffered heavy losses, however according to historian Gustave Louis Maurice Strauss, \"[Wilhelm] carried the heights of St. Apollinari in gallant style and occupied the suburbs from which the Germans ultimately forced their way into the city where fierce fights from barricade to barricade from house to house lasted till midnight.\" Dijon was occupied by 24,000 Prussians on 18 January 1870, but was reoccupied by the French after a severe battle, and subsequently retaken by the Prussians on 19 January, during which Wilhelm was shot in his cheek at Nuits-Saint-Georges.\n\nPost-war career\nIn 1895, Kaiser Wilhelm II promoted him à la suite to the Grenadier Regiment (German: Leibgrenadierregimentes) in honor of the 25th anniversary of the Battle of Nuits-Saint-Georges. At the same time, Wilhelm II made him knight of the Order of Pour le Mérite, the Kingdom of Prussia's highest military order.Wilhelm's final military rank was General of the Infantry.\n\nPolitical career\nFrom a young age, Wilhelm held a seat in the First Chamber of the Diet of the Grand Duchy of Baden. From 1871 to 1873, Wilhelm was a representative of Baden in the Reichstag of the German Empire in which he was a member of the German Imperial Party (German: Deutsche Reichspartei) (also known as the Free Conservative Party).\n\nMarriage and children\nWilhelm married Princess Maria Maximilianovna of Leuchtenberg, Princess Romanovskaja on 11 February 1863 in Saint Petersburg. She was the eldest surviving daughter of Maximilian de Beauharnais, 3rd Duke of Leuchtenberg and his wife Grand Duchess Maria Nikolaevna of Russia,  Russian Empire. Upon learning of the marriage, United States President Abraham Lincoln sent a letter to Wilhelm's elder brother Frederick I, Grand Duke of Baden in which Lincoln stated: \"I participate in the satisfaction afforded by this happy event and pray Your Royal Highness to accept my sincere congratulations upon the occasion together with the assurances of my highest consideration.\" Prior to the marriage, Wilhelm had traveled to England as a potential suitor of Princess Mary Adelaide of Cambridge.Wilhelm and Maria had two children:\n\nPrincess Marie of Baden (26 July 1865 – 29 November 1939), later Duchess of Anhalt as the wife of Friedrich II, Duke of Anhalt (no issue)\nPrince Maximilian of Baden (10 July 1867 – 6 November 1929)\n\nCandidate for the Greek throne\nFollowing the deposition of Otto of Greece and the Greek head of state referendum of 1862, Wilhelm was considered by Wilhelm I of Prussia and Otto von Bismarck as a candidate for the throne of the Kingdom of Greece. The Russian Empire's preferred candidate for the Greek throne fluctuated between Nicholas de Beauharnais, 4th Duke of Leuchtenberg and Wilhelm, his brother-in-law. As a potential candidate, Wilhelm demanded no renunciations of rights to the Greek throne from King Otto's family in the Kingdom of Bavaria. According to The New York Times on 16 March 1863, then recent purchases of Greek bonds in London were the result of a report that Wilhelm was to be formally recommended for the throne.\n\nLater life\nWilhelm was in attendance at the dedication of the monument to Martin Luther at Worms on 27 June 1868.Following the death of his brother-in-law Ernest II, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, Wilhelm traveled to Schloss Reinhardsbrunn on 23 August 1893 to visit his widowed sister Alexandrine and greet the Duke's successor, Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh. He attended the Duke's funeral procession and service in Coburg on 28 August 1893.Wilhelm died in Karlsruhe on 27 April 1897 at the age of 67. He was interred at the Grand Ducal Crypt Chapel (German: Großherzogliche Grabkapelle) in the Fasanengarten in Karlsruhe.\n\nTitles, styles, honours and arms\nTitles and styles\n18 December 1829 – 27 April 1897: His Grand Ducal Highness Prince Wilhelm of Baden\n\nHonours\nNational honours\nForeign honours Austrian Empire: Grand Cross of the Imperial Order of Leopold, 1852\n Belgium: Grand Cordon of the Order of Leopold\n French Empire: Grand Cross of the Legion of Honour, June 1860\n Kingdom of Italy: Knight of the Annunciation\n Principality of Montenegro: Grand Cross of the Order of Prince Danilo I\n Russian Empire:\nKnight of St. Andrew\nKnight of St. Alexander Nevsky\nKnight of St. Anna, 1st Class\nKnight of St. George, 4th Class\n\nAncestry\nPassage 6:\nJakobea of Baden\nPrincess Jakobea of Baden (16 January 1558 – 3 September 1597 in Düsseldorf, buried in the St. Lambert Church in Düsseldorf) was daughter of the Margrave Philibert of Baden-Baden and Mechthild of Bavaria.\n\nLife\nJakobea of Baden-Baden became an orphan at an early age and was raised at the court of her maternal uncle Duke Albert V of Bavaria, where she had several suitors. At the insistence of her cousin Ernest of Bavaria, who was Archbishop of Cologne, Emperor Rudolph II, King Philip II of Spain and Pope Gregory XIII, she married, on 16 June 1585, to Duke John William of Jülich-Cleves-Berg, who was considered physically unattractive and mentally unstable and was the son and heir apparent of William \"the Rich\" of Jülich-Cleves-Berg, in an attempt to keep the confessionally wavering duke William in the Catholic camp. The marriage was celebrated lavishly in Düsseldorf, which at the time was ravaged by the Cologne War, and was documented by Dietrich Graminäus in his volume Beschreibung derer Fürstlicher Güligscher ec. Hochzeit.\nWilliam the Rich could never overcome the early death of his eldest son Charles Frederick.  He despised his second son and successor, John William, and gave him little chance to learn to govern and thus contributed to the disaster that befell his duchies.\n\nWhen William died in 1592, John William inherited the duchies and Jakobea tried to rule on behalf of her husband, who had been locked up because of his temper tantrums. She had been born a Protestant, but was raised as a Roman Catholic and did not choose for either side. She never became pregnant, possibly because her husband was impotent. She had a relationship with the much younger Dietrich von Hall zu Ophoven, who was Amtmann at Monheim am Rhein and was eventually arrested and locked up in the tower of Düsseldorf Castle.  She tried to plead her case in the Roman Rota and at the imperial court in Prague, but the case made little progress. The Catholic side, represented primarily by her sister-in-law Sibylle of Jülich-Cleves-Berg, then took matters into their own hands.She was found dead in her room on the morning of 3 September 1597, after she had received guests and toasted on her husband's health the night before.  Eyewitness accounts suggest that she was strangled or suffocated.  The motive for the move appears to have been to make room for a more fertile wife, who could save the endangered dynasty.\nShe was buried on 10 September 1597 in a closed ceremony in the Kreuzherren Church in Düsseldorf.  On 23 March 1820, her body was transferred to the St. Lambert Church in Düsseldorf and solemnly reburied.\nThe City Museum in Düsseldorf has a lock of her hair.\n\nLegacy\nComparing Jakobea to Mary Stuart is not entirely far-fetched; even so, it may be an exaggeration.  Jakobea of Baden was overwhelmed by the confusing conditions at the religiously divided court in Düsseldorf and fled in a love affair for some amusement. When she was held in humiliating captivity and lost all hope of help from her powerful relatives in Baden and Bavaria, she showed her true caliber and attitude.  The popular misinformation that Jakobea of Baden was beheaded, would make her more similar to Mary Stuart.\n\nFootnotes\nPassage 7:\nFrederick III, Margrave of Baden\nFrederick III of Baden (1327 – 2 September 1353) was Margrave of Baden from 1348 to 1353.\n\nLife\nHe was the elder son of Rudolf IV and Marie of Oettingen.\n\nFamily and children\nHe married Margareta of Baden, daughter of Rudolf Hesso, Margrave of Baden-Baden and had the following children:\n\nRudolf VI, Margrave of Baden-Baden (died 21 March 1372).\nMargarete, Dame d'Héricourt, married to:\n10 November 1363 Count Gottfried II of Leiningen-Rixingen;\nCount Heinrich of Lützelstein.\n\nSee also\nList of rulers of Baden\nPassage 8:\nStéphanie de Beauharnais\nStéphanie, Grand Duchess of Baden (Stéphanie Louise Adrienne de Beauharnais; 28 August 1789 – 29 January 1860) was a French princess and the Grand Duchess consort of Baden by marriage to Karl, Grand Duke of Baden.\nBorn in Versailles during the French Revolution, Stéphanie's life was significantly influenced by Napoleon Bonaparte, who married her aunt and became her patron. Napoleon, needing to secure an alliance with the Prince-elector of Baden, adopted Stephanie and arranged her marriage to Karl of Baden.\nHer marriage to Karl in 1806 wasn't notably successful initially; they lived separately in Karlsruhe and Mannheim respectively. However, they reconciled to produce heirs after Karl succeeded to the throne in 1811. They had five children, but there was controversy around their unnamed son who died shortly after birth, with rumors suggesting Kaspar Hauser could have been the real heir. After Karl's death in 1818, Stéphanie remained a widow for 41 years. Her residence in Mannheim became a notable salon for artists and intellectuals. She died in Nice, France, in 1860.\n\nBiography\nEarly life\nBorn in Versailles at the beginning of the French Revolution, Stéphanie was the daughter of Claude de Beauharnais, 2nd Count des Roches-Baritaud (1756–1819). In 1783 the 2nd Count married Claudine Françoise de Lezay (1767–1791). The marriage resulted in the birth of first her older brother Alberic de Beauharnais (1786–1791) and then Stephanie herself. Her father remarried in 1799 to Suzanne Fortin-Duplessis (1775–1850). \nOn 13 December 1779 Alexandre, Vicomte de Beauharnais, first cousin of her father, married Joséphine Tascher de la Pagerie. On 23 July 1794, Alexandre was guillotined. Joséphine had affairs with several influential figures of the French Directory, including Paul François Jean Nicolas Barras. The latter would introduce her to his recent favorite Napoléon Bonaparte. Napoléon soon started courting her. On 9 March 1796 they were married.\nGeneral Napoléon Bonaparte was now stepfather to Eugène de Beauharnais and Hortense de Beauharnais, second cousins of Stephanie. As his prominence and wealth continued to rise, Napoléon found himself being de facto patron to both the Bonaparte and the de Beauharnais families. Stephanie would soon see her patron rise to become First Consul of France.\n\nPrincess\nHer \"uncle\" crowned himself Emperor of the French on 2 December 1804. As a prominent member of the new Imperial Family, Stephanie held residence in the Tuileries Palace. Her new status allowed her to live a rather luxurious life. \nThis was a consequence of Napoleon's effort to secure an alliance with the Prince-elector of Baden. The alliance was to be secured through a marriage between the descendants of the two sovereigns, connecting the two dynasties. The Prince-Elector was to be represented by his grandson. Napoleon on the other hand lacked legitimate descendants of his own. He adopted Stephanie and named her \"Princesse Française\" (French Princess) with the style of Imperial Highness.\n\nGrand Duchess of Baden\nThe marriage of Stephanie and Karl (Charles), took place in Paris on 8 April 1806. On 25 July 1806 her new grandfather-in-law was named Karl Friedrich, Grand Duke of Baden.\nBy most accounts the arranged marriage was not particularly successful. Her husband was determined to continue living as a bachelor. He set residence in Karlsruhe. She was allowed to settle separately in Mannheim. Even the official complaints by the Emperor did not resolve this situation. The Grand Duke offered Schwetzingen to be their common summer residence. But only Stephanie accepted the offer. The situation changed somewhat when it became evident that the aging Grand Duke would not live much longer. The couple reconciled in an effort to produce heirs for the throne when her spouse succeeded to the throne in 1811.\nThe Grand Duke died on 8 December 1818. Stephanie remained a widow for the rest of her long life. She was reportedly a devoted mother to her three daughters. Her residence in Mannheim became a popular Salon for artists and intellectuals. Stephanie died in Nice, France at the age of 71, in 1860, 41 years after her husband.\n\nChildren\nOn 10 June 1811 Stephanie's husband, Karl succeeded his grandfather as Grand Duke of Baden. He and Grand Duchess Stephanie would have five children:\n\nPrincess Luise Amelie Stephanie of Baden (5 June 1811 – 19 July 1854). She was married on 30 November 1830 to Gustav, Prince of Vasa.\nUnnamed son (29 September 1812 – 16 October 1812). One theory suspects the dead unnamed child to be unrelated to her and her actual son (and therefore the hereditary prince) to be Kaspar Hauser. Although some authors have argued that this was not the case, \"the silly fairytale, which to this day moves many pens and has found much belief, was fully disproved in Otto Mittelstädt's book on Kaspar Hauser and his Baden Princedom (Heidelberg 1876).\" The idea has remained current in some circles to this day. Since Kaspar was unmarried and childless when stabbed to death in 1833 his heavily disputed claim reunited with the actual succession then held by Leopold, Grand Duke of Baden, since Karl's uncle and successor Louis I also died unmarried and childless three years earlier.\nPrincess Josephine Friederike Luise of Baden (21 October 1813 – 19 June 1900). She was married on 21 October 1834 to Karl Anton, Fürst of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen.\nPrince Alexander of Baden (1–8 May 1816).\nPrincess Marie Amelie Elisabeth Karoline of Baden (11 October 1817 – 8 October 1888). She was married on 23 February 1843 to William Alexander Anthony Archibald Douglas-Hamilton, 11th Duke of Hamilton.\nPassage 9:\nIraqi nationality law\nIraqi nationality is transmitted by one's parents.\n\nHistory\nThe first nationality law was passed in 1924, and that year, on 6 August, all people within the bounds of Iraqi jurisdiction automatically acquired Iraqi citizenship. According to Zainab Saleh,  \"The 1924 Iraqi Nationality Law and its amendments bring to light the haunted origins of Arab nationalism\" by defining Iraqis of Persian descent as second-class citizens.\n\nNaturalisation\nThe law governing naturalisation is Law No. 43 of 1963 and Law No. 5 of 1975. Naturalisation is only available to those over 18 years of age. There is a requirement of good repute, and a clean criminal record. Generally, the person seeking naturalisation is required to be an ethnic Arab, or otherwise married to an Iraqi man for not less than 5 years with residence within the country. Naturalised citizens are required to take an oath of allegiance before a competent person authourised to receive the same within 90 days.It ought to be noted that naturalised citizens will be barred from holding the office of Member of Parliament or Minister, for at least 10 years after the date of naturalisation, in addition, naturalised citizens are unable to hold the office of Prime Minister of Iraq or President of Iraqi.\n\nDual citizenship\nIraq recognizes dual nationality.\n\nTravel freedom\nIn 2016, Iraqi citizens had visa-free or visa on arrival access to 30 countries and territories.

She was a daughter of Margrave Hermann III of Baden and his wife, Bertha of Lorraine.\n\nMarriages and issue\nGertrude married in 1180 to Albert II of Dagsburg (d. 1211). With him she had two sons, Henry and William, and a daughter, Gertrude (d. 1225).  Both sons were killed in a tournament in Andain in 1202, so that the noble family of the Etichonids died out in the male line with Albert II in 1211.  This left her daughter Gertrude as heiress of the county of Dagsburg.\nHer daughter Gertrude married in 1206 in her first marriage to Duke Theobald I of Lorraine.  In 1217, she married her second husband, Count Theobald IV of Champagne, who was also King of Navarre from 1234 as Theobald I.  Theobald, however, repudiated her before 1223.  In 1224, she married her third husband, Simon III of Saarbrücken and Leiningen (d. 1234 or 36), the son of Count Frederick II of Leiningen and Saarbrücken.  When she died childless, her third husband Simon of Leiningen inherited the county of Dagsburg, thus creating the Leiningen-Dagsburg line.", "answers": ["German"], "length": 4327, "dataset": "2wikimqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "60163d86d206aaa179b61a2d43b27a7ec909b724b5685b50"}

It was composed by Fredrik Kempe, with lyrics by both Kempe and Ernman. It is the first Swedish entry to contain lyrics in French, as well as being the last Swedish entry to have contained lyrics in a language other than English. Despite the fact that France's Patricia Kaas would get a relatively good placing in the final, Ernman drew further attention to Francophone culture in the semi-final, as well in the grand final (by classing 3rd in the OGAE Second Chance round), despite her ultimate placing (21st).\nThe song was the winner of Melodifestivalen 2009 on 14 March 2009, earning the right to compete for Sweden in the first semi-final of Eurovision 2009 on 12 May 2009. The song qualified for the final round where it finished 21st place with 33 points, making it Sweden's second lowest placing in the contest since 1992's \"I morgon är en annan dag\" (22nd), and also the second time the country failed to place within the Top 20.\nIn 2010, the song was covered by Russian pop singer Philipp Kirkorov and opera singer Anna Netrebko with Kirkorov singing verses and Netrebko singing chorus. They recorded two versions of the song, one with original French and English lyrics and other sang exclusively in Russian.\nThe song has also been used as the backing track for the musical documentary Spaceplane Sailing. The short film covers the 33-mission career of the Space Shuttle Atlantis and was premiered on YouTube in February 2013.\n\nMelodifestivalen and Eurovision\n\"La voix\" participated in the fourth heat of the 2009 Melodifestivalen which was held on 28 February 2009 at the Malmö Arena in Malmö.

Besides operas and operettas, she has also performed chansons, cabaret, jazz, and appeared in musicals. She is a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Music. Ernman represented Sweden in the Eurovision Song Contest 2009 with the song \"La Voix\", finishing in 21st place.\n\nLife and career\nEarly life\nErnman was born in Uppsala, Sweden, spent her childhood and school years in Sandviken, and was educated at the Royal College of Music in Stockholm, the Music Conservatory in Orléans, France, and the school of the Royal Swedish Opera. She is married to actor Svante Thunberg, with whom she had appeared in a 2000 Swedish television musical documentary about the composer Joseph Martin Kraus, played by Thunberg. Together they have two daughters: singer Beata Ernman, and climate activist Greta Thunberg.\n\nOperas\nIn 1997, Ernman sang in the premiere of Ivar Hallström's 1897 opera Liten Karin in Vadstena; Opera magazine noted that \"the mezzo Malena Ernman was very expressive as Princess Cecilia, King Erik XIV's sister\". In 1998, her Rosina in The Barber of Seville at the Royal Opera in Stockholm was described as \"displaying impressive technique\" and \"shaping the character with mocking good humour\". The same year, she sang Kaja in the premiere of Sven-David Sandström's Staden under Leif Segerstam also at the Royal Opera in Stockholm, where one reviewer commented that \"in vocal focus and expression, her full, rich voice is not that far behind Bartoli\". In July 1999, Ernman sang the trouser role of Ziöberg in the premiere of Jonas Forssell's Trädgården (The Garden) at the Drottningholm Palace Theatre in Stockholm, conducted by Roy Goodman, the first new opera to be premiered at the theatre in modern times.In Brussels in 2000, her Nerone in Handel's Agrippina, alongside Rosemary Joshua's Poppea and Anna Caterina Antonacci's Aggripina was described as \"the most convincingly brattish young man imaginable\".In 2001, Ernman sang Sesto in Handel's Giulio Cesare at the Drottningholm Festival. She sang at the Glyndebourne Festival, in the Summer of 2002 as Nancy in Albert Herring and the next summer as Prince Orlovsky in Johann Strauss's Die Fledermaus, which was also performed at the BBC Proms that year.In 2002/2003 Ernman appeared in Vienna as Diana in La Calisto. In 2003/2004 she sang the part of Donna Elvira in Don Giovanni at La Monnaie in Brussels and appeared at the Aix-en-Provence Festival as Lichas in Hercules by George Frideric Handel, with Les Arts Florissants under conductor William Christie, revived at the Paris Opera and at the Vienna Festival.In the spring and summer of 2005, Ernman created the title role in Philippe Boesmans's Julie, appearing at la Monnaie, at the Vienna Festival, and in Aix-en-Provence. In 2006 she sang as Nerone in L'incoronazione di Poppea in Brussels and Berlin, then as Dido in Dido and Aeneas with William Christie at the Vienna Festival. \nShe also sang in Agrippina at Oper Frankfurt.In August 2006, Ernman made her debut at the Salzburg Festival as Annio in La clemenza di Tito under conductor Nikolaus Harnoncourt. In 2007, her roles included Sesto in Giulio Cesare with René Jacobs in Vienna, Cherubino in Le nozze di Figaro with Daniel Harding in Aix-en-Provence, and Nerone in L'incoronazione di Poppea in Amsterdam. In 2008 she sang Angelina in La Cenerentola with the Royal Swedish Opera and Dido and Aeneas with Christie and the Opéra-Comique in Paris. In 2009 she reprised Angelina in La Cenerentola with Oper Frankfurt and the Swedish Royal Opera, and Dido in Dido and Aeneas with Christie in Vienna and Amsterdam. In 2010, she sang the castrato role of Idamante in Idomeneo under Jérémie Rhorer at the Theatre de la Monnaie in Brussels, where her \"feisty\" portrayal of the prince was \"as if to the gender born, her efforts rewarded by the inclusion of the usually cut aria 'No, la morte'. Vienna saw her in the title role of Serse by Handel in October 2011 at the Theater an der Wien, and the following season she sang Eduige in the Nicolas Harnoncourt-led production of Handel's Rodelinda at the same house, later released on DVD. Back in the city as Elena in La donna del lago in August 2012, she was \"impressive... dealing with the vocal difficulties with aplomb and managing the extra dramatic demands made on her with genuine expressivity\". She added Béatrice to her repertoire in 2013 in performances at Theater an der Wien of Berlioz's late opéra-comique. Also in 2013 she returned to the part of Aggripina at the Gran Teatre del Liceu in Barcelona, in a production by David McVicar conducted by Harry Bicket.Ernman has sung several major roles with the Staatsoper Berlin, including Cherubino in Le nozze di Figaro and Zerlina in Don Giovanni, both under conductor Daniel Barenboim. She also performed Rosina in Rossini's Il barbiere di Siviglia with Staatsoper Berlin and the Finnish National Opera. With the Royal Opera Stockholm she has also sung the title role in Carmen.Ernman worked with conductor René Jacobs in the roles of Nerone in Agrippina, Roberto in Scarlatti's Griselda and Diana in Cavalli's La Calisto.In 2018, she sang Gabriella in the Swedish musical Så som i himmelen (As It Is in Heaven), based on a 2004 film of the same name, with words by Kay Pollak and Carin Pollak and the score by Fredrik Kempe, which premiered at the Oscarsteatern in September 2018.\n\nConcerts\nEarly recitals on Swedish Radio included Rachmaninov in 1994, The airconditioned nightmare by Olov Olofsson, songs by Gunnar de Frumerie, and an eclectic mix of Fauré, Debussy, Jolivet, Ravel, Bizet, Barber, Ives and Lehrer in 1996, Brahms lieder, and works by Carlid, Mahler and Berio in 1998.\nErnman has performed several concert pieces as well. At the Salzburg Festival she sang Mozart's \"Waisenhausmesse\" with conductor Frans Brüggen. She performed Berio's \"Folksongs\" with the Stockholm Royal Philharmonic Orchestra under Carlo Rizzi, and at the Verbier Festival with Gustavo Dudamel. She sang the world premiere of \"Nachtgesänge\" by Fabian Müller with the Zurich Tonhalle Orchestra. In Minneapolis she sang Mozart's \"Requiem\" with Arnold Östman.\n\n2009 Melodifestivalen and Eurovision\nOn 28 November 2008, it was announced that Ernman would enter Melodifestivalen 2009 for the Eurovision Song Contest 2009 with the song \"La voix,\" written by Fredrik Kempe. On 28 February 2009, Ernman competed in the 4th semi-final of Melodifestivalen in Malmö and became a finalist. She went on to win the final on 14 March at the Globe Arena in Stockholm, and to represent Sweden in the Eurovision Song Contest in Moscow. She qualified as a finalist on 12 May and performed in the finals on 16 May, where she finished 21st with 33 points. \"La voix\" was the first Swedish entry to contain a substantial amount of French lyrics; it was written by Ernman herself, who speaks French fluently. Prior to the competition a documentary about the life and career of Ernman was broadcast on Swedish television entitled 'Rösternas Malena' ('The voice of Malena').Ernman revealed that the dress for her Eurovision performance cost 400,000 kronor (€37,471) and was made by designer Camilla Thulin. Singer Dea Norberg joined Ernman as one of the choirgirls. Ernman later participated in the Second Chance round of Melodifestivalen 2015 as a guest singer for Behrang Miris entry.\n\nPersonal life\nErnman is married to Swedish actor Svante Thunberg. Their first daughter Greta Thunberg rose to worldwide prominence when she initiated the School Strike for Climate. She also has a younger daughter, who is three years younger. Ernman’s career was taking off when Greta was born, and Svante stayed at home to look after their children.In August 2014, 11-year-old Greta suddenly stopped eating, talking, reading, or wanting to do anything. This condition lasted for several months, until she was diagnosed with Asperger syndrome. The acute period of her daughter's condition affected Ernman and her family to such an extent that she had three breakdowns during her professional activity and five performances had to be cancelled. After the crisis was overcome, she turned to the nationwide daily newspaper Expressen, which reported it in detail, because she wanted to help other families in a similar situation.Ernman has been politically active in support of the Paris Agreement; in June 2017 she wrote a collaborative debate piece in Dagens Nyheter. With her husband, she co-wrote the book Scenes from the Heart about her family, the environment, and sustainability. It was published in August 2018.\n\nAwards\n2010: appointed Hovsångerska (lit. \"[royal] court singer\") by Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden\n2017: WWF-Sweden \"Environmental Hero of the Year\"\n\nDiscography\nAlbums\n2000: Naïve (KMH) – songs by Olov Olofsson, Bo Linde, Bror Samuelson, Sandström, among others, with ensemble directed by Chrichan Larson\n2001: Cabaret Songs – songs by William Bolcom, Kurt Weill, Friedrich Hollander and Benjamin Britten; with Bengt-Åke Lundin, piano (BIS)\n2003: Songs in Season (Nytorp Musik) – songs related to nature and the seasons by Mendelssohn, Grieg, Respighi, Storm, Copland, Koechlin, Mahler, Gefors, Schreker, Fauré, Liszt, Finzi, Sibelius, Tchaikovsky, and Jennefelt.

He is best known for having been the singer of Trust.\nHe was one of the best friends of Bon Scott the singer of AC/DC and together they recorded the song \"Ride On\" which was one of the last songs by Bon Scott.\n\nExternal links\nBernie Bonvoisin at IMDb\nPassage 4:\nPaule Desjardins\nPaule Desjardins (29 April 1929 — 31 December 2007), also known as Paule Canat, was a French singer and fashion designer. She represented France in the Eurovision Song Contest 1957 with the song \"La belle amour\" which finished second with 17 points.In the early 1960s, she ended her musical career to marry the French industrialist Charles Canat. She started a new career as a lingerie designer in Millau. From 1960 to 1992, Paule was responsible for the creation of collections, developing new clothing lines that played an important role in the development of the company.Paule and Charles had a son, Joël. He ran his father’s company from 1991-1996, before selling it to Saaly Holding. Charles passed away on 1 December 2007, at the age of 86. Paule passed away exactly 30 days after his death.\nPassage 5:\nAnother Girl\n\"Another Girl\" is a song by the English rock band the Beatles from their 1965 album Help! and included in the film of the same title. The song was written by Paul McCartney and credited to the Lennon–McCartney partnership. The song is addressed to the singer's girlfriend, who is informed that the singer has found \"another girl.\"\n\nComposition and recording\nMcCartney wrote the song while holidaying in Hammamet, a resort in Tunisia. With an up-tempo swing-beat that McCartney favoured (\"Can't Buy Me Love\", \"She's a Woman\") it opens with a short refrain, powered by block vocal harmonies, that segues straight into the verse, which is constructed on the blues-mode chord changes the group currently favoured. The bridge theme makes a sudden key change up a minor third from A to C (a harmonic strategy also used on the record's next track \"You're Going to Lose That Girl\") and features more close three-part harmonies as the aggressively sung verse's apparent threat to a jealous girl turns into a sweet tribute to the \"other\" girl who \"will always be my friend\".\nThe Beatles recorded the song on 15 February 1965, having also worked that day on \"Ticket to Ride\" and \"I Need You\". The backing track was quickly recorded in a single take. George Harrison added a guitar \"flourish\" at the end which was omitted from the final mix: McCartney added lead guitar the next day. This is one of several Beatles songs recorded at the time on which McCartney played lead guitar in addition to his usual bass. Four-track recording allowed the group to refine songs' arrangements in the studio and McCartney often had clear ideas about the guitar lines he wanted. He also contributed lead guitar to \"Ticket to Ride\" and played an electric guitar duet with Harrison on \"The Night Before\". The song was mixed down on 18 February and again on 23 February.This song features the often-utilized three-part harmonies between Lennon, McCartney and Harrison, but it is one of the only instances in which Lennon sings the highest harmony.\nMcCartney said of this song and other album tracks, \"It's a bit much to call them fillers because I think they were a bit more than that, and each one of them made it past the Beatles test. We all had to like it.\"\n\nLive performances\nThe song was performed live for the first time by a Beatle when Paul McCartney returned to the Nippon Budokan, Tokyo, on 28 April 2015; this was 49 years after the Beatles had first played at the venue, in June and July 1966. In a released statement, McCartney said, \"It was sensational and quite emotional remembering the first time and then experiencing this fantastic audience tonight.\"\n\nIn the film Help!\nIn the film Help!, McCartney lip-syncs \"Another Girl\" while standing on a coral reef on Balmoral Island in the Bahamas, and plays a girl in a bikini as if she is a guitar. Since McCartney's hands are occupied (with either bass or girl), George Harrison mimes McCartney's guitar fills as if playing them himself. The four of them each change instruments. For instance, Harrison is seen playing McCartney's bass and looks confused. Starr is shown playing acoustic guitar and Lennon mimes playing drums.  Another scene was filmed at the Cloisters, a famous Bahamian landmark.\n\nCover versions\nThe George Martin Orchestra covers the track on Help!, their instrumental reworking of the Beatles' album.\nBerlin-based Lautten Compagney covers the track on their 2021 album \"Time Travel\" in an arrangement for baroque orchestra and saxophone.\n\nPersonnel\nAccording to George Martin, quoted by Kevin Ryan and Brian Kehew:\nPaul McCartney – double-tracked lead vocal, bass guitar, lead guitar\nJohn Lennon – harmony vocal, electric rhythm guitar\nGeorge Harrison – harmony vocal, acoustic rhythm guitar\nRingo Starr – drums\n\nNotes\nPassage 6:\nCaspar Babypants\nCaspar Babypants is the stage name of children's music artist Chris Ballew, who is also the vocalist and bassist of The Presidents of the United States of America.\n\nHistory\nBallew's first brush with children's music came in 2002, when he recorded and donated an album of traditional children's songs to the nonprofit Program for Early Parent Support titled \"PEPS Sing A Long!\" Although that was a positive experience for him, he did not consider making music for families until he met his wife, collage artist Kate Endle. Her art inspired Ballew to consider making music that \"sounded like her art looked\" as he has said. Ballew began writing original songs and digging up nursery rhymes and folk songs in the public domain to interpret and make his own. The first album, Here I Am!, was recorded during the summer of 2008 and released in February 2009.\nBallew began to perform solo as Caspar Babypants in the Seattle area in January 2009. Fred Northup, a Seattle-based comedy improvisor, heard the album and offered to play as his live percussionist.  Northrup also suggested his frequent collaborator Ron Hippe as a keyboard player. \"Frederick Babyshirt\" and \"Ronald Babyshoes\" were the Caspar Babypants live band from May 2009 to April 2012. Both Northup and Hippe appear on some of his recordings but since April 2012 Caspar Babypants has exclusively performed solo. The reasons for the change were to include more improvisation in the show and to reduce the sound levels so that very young children and newborns could continue to attend without being overstimulated. \nBallew has made two albums of Beatles covers as Caspar Babypants. Baby Beatles! came out in September 2013 and Beatles Baby! came out in September 2015.\nBallew runs the Aurora Elephant Music record label, books shows, produces, records, and masters the albums himself. Distribution for the albums is handled by Burnside Distribution in Portland, Oregon.\nCaspar Babypants has released a total of 17 albums. The 17th album, BUG OUT!, was released on May 1, 2020. His album FLYING HIGH! was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Children's Album. All 17 of the albums feature cover art by Ballew's wife, Kate Endle.\n\"FUN FAVORITES!\" and \"HAPPY HITS!\" are two vinyl-only collections of hit songs that Caspar Babypants has released in the last couple of years.\n\nDiscography\nAlbumsPEPS (2002)\nHere I Am!

Formerly a solo artist, he is the lead singer of indie rock band One eskimO.\n\nEarly life\nKristian Leontiou was born in London, England and is of Greek Cypriot descent. He went to Hatch End High School in Harrow and worked several jobs in and around London whilst concentrating on music when he had any free time.  In 2003 he signed a major record deal with Polydor. At the time, Leontiou was dubbed \"the new Dido\" by some media outlets. His debut single \"Story of My Life\" was released in June 2004 and reached #9 in the UK Singles Chart. His second single \"Shining\" peaked at #13 whilst the album Some Day Soon was certified gold selling in excess of 150,000 copies.\nLeontiou toured the album in November 2004 taking him to the US to work with L.A Reid, Chairman of the Island Def Jam music group.  Unhappy with the direction his career was going, on a flight back from the US in 2004 he decided to take his music in a new direction.  Splitting from his label in late 2005, he went on to collaborate with Faithless on the song \"Hope & Glory\" for their album ‘'To All New Arrivals'’.  It was this release that saw him unleash the One eskimO moniker.  It was through working with Rollo Armstrong on the Faithless album, that Rollo got to hear an early demo of \"Astronauts\" from the One eskimO project. Being more than impressed by what he heard, Rollo opened both his arms and studio doors to Leontiou and they began to co-produce the ‘'All Balloons’' album.\nIt was at this time that he paired up with good friend Adam Falkner, a drummer/musician, to introduce a live acoustic sound to the album. They recorded the album with engineer Phill Brown (engineer for Bob Marley and Robert Plant) at Ark studios in St John's Wood where they recorded live then headed back to Rollo's studio to add the cinematic electro touches that are prominent on the album.\nShortly after its completion, One eskimO's \"Hometime\" was used on a Toyota Prius advert in the USA. The funds from the advert were then used to develop the visual aspect of One eskimO. He teamed up with friend Nathan Erasmus (Gravy Media Productions) along with animation team Smuggling Peanuts (Matt Latchford and Lucy Sullivan) who together began to develop the One eskimO world, the first animation produced was for the track ‘Hometime’ which went on to win a British animation award in 2008.\nIn 2008 Leontiou started a new management venture with ATC Music. By mid-2008 Time Warner came on board to develop all 10 One eskimO animations which were produced the highly regarded Passion Pictures in London.  Now with all animation complete and a debut album, One eskimO prepare to unveil themselves fully to the world in summer 2009.\nLeontiou released a cover version of Tracy Chapman's \"Fast Car\", which was originally released as a single in 2005. Leontiou's version was unable to chart, however, due to there being no simultaneous physical release alongside the download single, a UK chart rule that was in place at the time. On 24 April 2011, the song entered the singles chart at number 88 due to Britain's Got Talent contestant Michael Collings covering the track on the show on 16 April 2011.\n\nDiscography\nAlbums\nSingles\nNotes\nA  - Originally released as a single in April 2005, Leontiou's version of \"Fast Car\" did not chart until 2011 in the UK.\n\nAlso featured on\nNow That's What I Call Music! 58 (Story of My Life)\nWin a Date with Tad Hamilton! OST, Love Love Songs - The Ultimate Love Collection (Shining)\nSummerland OST (The Crying)\nPassage 8:\nO Valencia!\n\"O Valencia!\" is the fifth single by the indie rock band The Decemberists, and the first released from their fourth studio album, The Crane Wife.\nThe music was written by The Decemberists and the lyrics by Colin Meloy. It tells a story of two star-crossed lovers. The singer falls in love with a person who belongs to an opposing gang. At the end of the song, the singer's lover jumps in to defend the singer, who is confronting his lover's brother (the singer's \"sworn enemy\") and is killed by the bullet intended for the singer.\n\nTrack listing\nThe 7\" single sold in the UK was mispressed, with \"Culling of the Fold\" as the B-side despite the artwork and record label listing \"After the Bombs\" as the B-side.\n\nMusic videos\nFor the \"O Valencia!\" music video, The Decemberists filmed themselves in front of a green screen and asked fans to complete it by digitally adding in background images or footage. Stephen Colbert of The Colbert Report, having recently asked fans to do the same with a video of him with a light saber in front of a green screen, brought up The Decemberists on his segment \"Look Who's Riding on My Coattails Now\" and accused the band of stealing the idea. The Decemberists' response was to challenge Stephen Colbert to a guitar solo showdown on December 20, 2006, on The Colbert Report.On January 19, 2007, The Decemberists premiered an alternate music video of \"O Valencia!\", directed by Aaron Stewart-Ahn, on MTV2. The video follows a character named Patrick, played by Meloy, as he and his love Francesca (Lisa Molinaro), daughter of \"the Boss\", plan an escape to an unknown location. At a cafe, a man in a suit, portrayed by the band member Chris Funk, tells him to hide in the \"Valencia\" hotel (the Super Value Inn on North Interstate Avenue in Portland, Oregon) while he gets them the necessary documentation to escape. Above the name of the hotel, there is a neon sign that reads \"Office\". The letters have all burnt out except for the \"O\", creating the title of the song. The video then introduces other characters - various assassination teams - who sit in different rooms of the hotel waiting for the chance to catch the two lovers. Most are portrayed by other members of the band (along with Meloy's wife, Carson Ellis). They kill off any potential witnesses to their plan. Patrick manages to take down one member from each team, before they gang up on him. The Boss arrives, along with the man from the cafe, who reveals that he snitched on Patrick and Francesca. They execute Francesca, while forcing Patrick to watch. After they leave, Patrick finds a note by Francesca, which reveals that she never fell in love with him, and only wanted protection. 2 months later, Patrick and the man, who has lost an eye from a previous assassination attempt, have a sit-down at the same cafe. The man reveals that he snitched on Patrick just to take over the town. Patrick reveals that he poisoned a drink the man was having, but before he could get away, the man stabs Patrick in the neck with a fork before dying, followed by Patrick.\nThe video is somewhat influenced by the distinct style and themes of director Wes Anderson, with bold fonts being used to introduce characters and groups on the bottom of the screen (much like in the film The Royal Tenenbaums). The band had previously (and more explicitly) drawn influence from Anderson's Rushmore in their video for \"Sixteen Military Wives\". The layout of the hotel is also similar to the one used in Bottle Rocket.\nKurt Nishimura was chosen as the winner by mtvU for his video that depicted a love affair between a woman and her television, with the TV containing the green-screened Decemberists video footage.\nPassage 9:\nBilly Milano\nBilly Milano (born June 3, 1964) is an American heavy metal and hardcore punk musician. He is the singer and occasionally guitarist and bassist of crossover thrash band M.O.D., and was the singer of its predecessor, Stormtroopers of Death. Prior to these bands, Milano played in early New York hardcore band the Psychos, which also launched the career of future Agnostic Front vocalist Roger Miret. Milano was also the singer of United Forces, which included his Stormtroopers of Death bandmate Dan Lilker. Milano managed a number of bands, including Agnostic Front, for whom he also co-produced the 1997 Epitaph Records release Something's Gotta Give and roadie for Anthrax.\n\nDiscography\nStormtroopers of Death albums\nStormtroopers of Death videos\nMethod of Destruction (M.O.D.)\nMastery\nPassage 10:\nPanda (Astro song)\nAstro is the first album of long duration (after the EP Le disc of Astrou) of Chilean indie band Astro, released in 2011.

He is remembered as the father of Harold Beauchamp, who rose to fame as chairman of the Bank of New Zealand and was the father of writer Katherine Mansfield.\n\nBiography\nBeauchamp came to Nelson from Australia on the Lalla Rookh, arriving on 23 February 1861.He lived much of his life in a number of locations around the top of the South Island, also Whanganui when Harold was 11 for seven years and then to the capital (Wellington). Then south to Christchurch and finally Picton and the Sounds. He had business failures and was bankrupted twice, in 1879 and 1884. He married Mary Stanley on the Victorian goldfields in 1854; Arthur and Mary lived in 18 locations over half a century, and are buried in Picton. Six of their ten children born between 1855 and 1893 died, including the first two sons born before Harold.Beauchamp represented the Picton electorate from 1866 to 1867, when he resigned.  He had the energy and sociability required for politics, but not the private income then required to be a parliamentarian. He supported the working man and the subdivision of big estates, opposed the confiscation of Māori land and was later recognised as a founding Liberal, the party that Harold supported and was a \"fixer\" for. Yska calls their life an extended chronicle of rootlessness, business failure and almost ceaseless family tragedy and Harold called his father a rolling stone by instinct. Arthur also served on the council of Marlborough Province and is best-remembered for a 10-hour speech to that body when an attempt was made to relocate the capital from Picton to Blenheim.In 1866 he attempted to sue the Speaker of the House, David Monro. At the time the extent of privilege held by Members of Parliament was unclear; a select committee ruled that the case could proceed, but with a stay until after the parliamentary session.\n\nSee also\nYska, Redmer (2017).

He is known as one of the \"Twenty-Four Generals of Takeda Shingen\" \nHe also recorded as having been wounded 41 times in 36 encounters. \nHe was the father of Obata Masamori.\n\nSee also\nIsao Obata\nPassage 3:\nJohn Templeton (botanist)\nJohn Templeton (1766–1825) was a pioneering Irish naturalist, sometimes referred to as the \"Father of Irish Botany\". He was a leading figure in Belfast's late eighteenth century enlightenment, initially supported the  United Irishmen, and figured prominently in the town's scientific and literary societies.\n\nFamily\nTempleton was born in Belfast in 1766, the son of James Templeton, a prosperous wholesale merchant, and his wife Mary Eleanor, daughter of Benjamin Legg, a sugar refiner. The family resided in a 17th century country house to the south of the town, which been named Orange Grove in honour of William of Orange who had stopped at the house en route to his victory over James II at the Battle of the Boyne in 1690.Until the age of 16 Templeton attended a progressive, co-educational, school favoured by the town's liberal, largely Presbyterian, merchant class. Schoolmaster David Manson sought to exclude \"drudgery and fear\" by combining classroom instruction with play and experiential learning. Templeton counted among his schoolfellows brother and sister Henry Joy and Mary Ann McCracken, and maintained a warm friendship with them throughout his life.In 1799, Templeton married Katherine Johnson of Seymour Hill. Her family had been touched by the United Irish rebellion the previous year: her brother-in-law, Henry Munro, commander of the United army at the Battle of Ballynahinch, had been hanged. The couple had five children: Ellen, born on 30 September 1800, Robert, born on 12 December 1802, Catherine, born on 19 July 1806, Mary, born on 9 December 1809 and Matilda on 2 November 1813.\nThe union between the two already prosperous merchant families provided more than ample means enabling Templeton to devote himself passionately to the study of natural history.\n\nUnited Irishman\nLike many of his liberal Presbyterian peers in Belfast, Templeton was sympathetic to the programme and aims of the Society United Irishmen:  Catholic Emancipation and democratic reform of the Irish Parliament. But it was several years before he was persuaded to take the United Irish \"test\" or pledge. In March 1797 his friend, Mary Ann McCracken, wrote to her brother: [A] certain Botanical friend of ours whose steady and inflexible mind is invulnerable to any other weapon but reason, and only to be moved by conviction has at last turned his attention from the vegetable kingdom to the human species and after pondering the matter for some months, is at last determined to become what he ought to have been months ago.\nShe hoped his sisters would \"soon follow him.\" Having committed himself to the patriotic union of Catholic, Protestant and Dissenter, Templeton changed the name of the family home from loyalist Orange Grove to Irish \"Cranmore\" (crann mór, 'big tree').\nTempleton was disenchanted by the Rebellion of 1798, and mindful of events in France , repelled by the violence. He nonetheless withdrew from the Belfast Literary Society, of which he had been a founding member in 1801, rather than accept the continued presence of Dr. James MacDonnell. MacDonnell's offence had been to subscribe forty guineas in 1803 for the capture (leading to execution) of the unreformed rebel Thomas Russell who had been their mutual friend. (While unable to \"forget the amiable Russell\", time, he conceded,  \"softened a little my feelings\": in 1825, Templeton and MacDonnell met and shook hands).\n\nGarden\nThe garden at Cranmore spread over 13-acre garden was planted with exotic and native species acquired on botanical excursions, from fellow botanists, nurseries, botanical gardens and abroad: \"Received yesterday a large chest of East Indian plants which I examined today.\" \"Box from Mr. Taylor\".Other plants arrived, often as seeds from North America, Australia, India, China and other parts of the British Empire  Cranmore also served as a small animal farm.for experimental animal husbandry and a kitchen garden.\n\nBotanist\nJohn Templeton's interest in botany began with this experimental garden laid out according to a suggestion in Rousseau's 'Nouvelle Heloise' and following Rousseau's 'Letters on the Elements of Botany Here he cultivated many tender exotics out of doors (a list provided by Nelson and began botanical studies which lasted throughout his life and corresponded with the most eminent botanists in England Sir William Hooker, William Turner, James Sowerby and, especially Sir Joseph Banks, who had travelled on Captain James Cook's voyages, and in charge of Kew Gardens. Banks tried (unsuccessfully) to tempt him to New Holland (Australia) as a botanist on the Flinders's Expedition with the offer of a large tract of land and a substantial salary. An associate of the Linnean Society, Templeton visited London and saw the botanical work being achieved there. This led to his promotion of the Belfast Botanic Gardens as early as 1809, and to work on a Catalogue of Native Irish Plants, in manuscript form and now in the Royal Irish Academy, which was used as an accurate foundation for later work by succeeding Irish botanists. He also assembled text and executed many beautiful watercolour drawings for a Flora Hibernica, sadly never finished, and kept a detailed journal during the years 1806–1825 (both now in the Ulster Museum, Belfast).[1] Of the 12000 algal specimens in the Ulster Museum Herbarium about 148 are in the Templeton collection and were mostly collected by him, some were collected by others and passed to Templeton. The specimens in the Templeton collection in the Ulster Museum (BEL) have been catalogued. Those noted in 1967 were numbered: F1 – F48. Others were in The Queen's University Belfast. All of Templeton's specimens have now been numbered in the Ulster Museum as follows: F190 – F264; F290 – F314 and F333 – F334.\nTempleton was the first finder of Rosa hibernicaThis rose, although collected by Templeton in 1795, remained undescribed until 1803 when he published a short diagnosis in the Transactions of the Dublin Society.\n\nEarly additions to the flora of Ireland include Sisymbrium Ligusticum seoticum (1793), Adoxa moschatellina (1820), Orobanche rubra and many other plants. His work on lichens was the basis of this secton of Flora Hiberica by James Townsend Mackay who wrote of him The foregoing account of the Lichens of Ireland would have been still more incomplete, but for the extensive collection of my lamented friend, the late Mr. John Templeton, of Cranmore, near Belfast, which his relict, Mrs. Templeton, most liberally placed at my disposal. I believe that thirty years ago his acquirements in the Natural History of organised beings rivalled that of any individual in Europe : these were by no means limited to diagnostic marks, but extended to all the laws and modifications of the living force. The frequent quotation of his authority in every preceding department of this Flora, is but a brief testimony of his diversified knowledge\n\nBotanical Manuscripts\nThe MSS. left by Templeton consist of seven volumes. One of these is a small 8vo. half bound ; it is in the Library of the Royal Irish Academy, and contains 280 pp. of lists of Cryptogams, chiefly mosses, with their localities. In this book is inserted a letter from Miss F. M. More, sister of Alexander Goodman More, to Dr. Edward Perceval Wright, Secretary, Royal Irish Academy, dated March, 1897, in which she says—‘*‘ The Manuscript which accompanies this letter was drawn up between 1794 and 1810, by the eminent naturalist, John Templeton, in Belfast. It was lent by his son, Dr. R. Templeton, to my brother, Alex. G. More, when he was preparing the second edition of the ‘ Cybele Hibernica,’ on condition that it should be placed in the Library of the Royal Irish Academy afterwards.\" The other six volumes are quarto size, and contain 1,090 folios, with descriptions of many of the plants, and careful drawings in pen and pencil and colours of many species. They are now lent to the Belfast Museum. About ten years ago I [Lett]spent a week in examining these volumes, and as their contents have hitherto never been fully described, I would like to give an epitome of my investigation of them.\n\nVol. 1.—Phanerogams, 186 folios, with 15 coloured figures, and 6 small drawings in the text.\nVol. Il.—Fresh-water Algae, 246 folios, 71 of which are coloured.\nVol.IIl.—Marine Algae, 212 folios, of which 79 are coloured figures. At the end of this volume are 3 folios of Mosses, the pagination of which runs with the rest of this volume, but it is evident they had at some time been misplaced.\nVol. IV Fungi, 112 folios.\nVol. V.—Mosses, 117 folios, of which 20 are coloured, and also 73 small drawings in the text. *Vol. VI.—Mosses and Hepatics. 117 folios are Hepatics, 40 of which are in colours ; 96 folios are Mosses, of which 39 are full-page coloured figures; and in addition there are 3 small coloured drawings in the text.All these drawings were executed by Templeton himself, they are every one most accurately and beautifully drawn; and the colouring is true to nature and artistically finished; those of the mosses and hepatics being particularly good. Templeton is not mentioned in Tate’s ‘‘ Flora Belfastiensis,’ published in 1863, at Belfast. The earliest published reference to his MSS. is in the \"* Flora of Ulster,\" by Dickie, published in 1864, where there is this indefinite allusion—‘* To the friends of the late Mr. Templeton I am indebted for permission to take notes of species recorded in his manuscript.\" The MS. was most likely the small volume now in the Royal Irish Academy Library. In the introduction to the \"*‘ Flora of the North-east of Ireland\"’ (1888), there is a brief biographical sketch of Templeton, but no mention of any MS. However, in a ‘‘ Supplement\" to the Flora (1894), there is this note— ‘* Templeton, John, four volumes of his ‘ Flora Hibernica’ at present deposited with the Belfast Natural History and Philosophical Society, contain much original matter, which could not be worked out in time for the present paper.\" This fixes the approximate date of the MSS. being loaned to the Belfast Museum. They were not known to the authors of the ‘‘ Cybele Hibernica’\"’ in 1866, while in the second edition (1898) the small volume of the MSS. in R.1.A. Library is described in the Index of Authors under its full title—Catalogue of the Native Plants of Ireland, by John Templeton, A.L.S.\n\nNotable plant finds\nAntrim:Northern beech fern Glenaan River, Cushendall 1809: intermediate wintergreen Sixmilewater 1794: heath pearlwort :Muck Island Islandmagee  1804: dwarf willow Slievenanee Mountain 1809: thin-leaf brookweed beside River Lagan in its tidal reaches – gone now 1797: Dovedale moss Cave Hill 1797: Arctic root Slemish Mountain pre 1825: Cornish moneywort  formerly cultivated at Cranmore, Malone Road, Belfast1 pre-1825 J. persisted to 1947: rock whitebeam  basalt cliffs of the Little Deerpark, Glenarm 15 July 1808: yellow meadow rue Portmore Lough 1800:  Moschatel Mountcollyer Deerpark 2 May 1820 , Bearberry  Fair Head pre 1825, Sea Bindweed Bushfoot dunes pre 1825,  Flixweed , 'Among the ruins of Carrickfergus I found Sisymbrium Sophia in plenty' 2 Sept. 1812 – Journal of J.

He published very little aside from monthly reports on natural history and meteorology in the 'Belfast Magazine' commenced in 1808. John Templeton studied birds extensively, collected shells, marine organisms (especially \"Zoophytes\") and insects, notably garden pest species. He planned a 'Hibernian Fauna' to accompany 'Hibernian Flora'. This was not published, even in part, but A catalogue of the species annulose animals and of rayed ones found in Ireland as selected from the papers of the late J Templeton Esq. of Cranmore with localities, descriptions, and illustrations Mag.

Hist . 1: (n. s.): 403–413 403 -413 were (collated and edited By Robert Templeton). Much of his work was used by later authors, especially by William Thompson whose 'The Natural History of Ireland' is its essential continuation.\n\nDublin\nTempleton was a regular visitor to the elegant Georgian city of Dublin (by 1816 the journey was completed in one day in a wellington coach with 4 passengers) and he was a Member of the Royal Dublin Society.By his death in 1825 the Society had established a Botanic at Glasnevin \"with the following sections:\n1 The Linnaean garden, which contains two divisions, - Herbaceous plants, and shrub-fruit; and forest-tree plants.\n2. Garden arranged on the system of Jussieu. 3. Garden of Indigenous plants (to Ireland), disposed according to the system of Linnaeus. 4. Kitchen Garden, where six apprentices are constantly employed, who receive a complete knowledge of systematic botany. 5. Medicinal plants. 6. Plants eaten, or rejected, by cattle. 7. Plants used in rural economy. 8. Plants used in dyeing. 9. Rock plants. 10. Aquatic and marsh plants. - For which an artificial marsh has been formed. 11. Cryptogamics. 12. Flower garden, besides extensive hot-houses, and a conservatory for exotics\".\nOther associations were with Leinster House housing the RDS Museum and Library.\n\"Second Room. Here the animal kingdom is displayed, arranged in six classes. 1. Mammalia. 2. Aves. 3. Amphibia. 4. Pisces. 5. Insectae. 6. Vermes. Here is a great variety of shells, butterflies and beetles, and of the most beautiful species\" and the Leske collection.\nThe library at Leinster House held 12,000 books and was particularly rich in  works on botany; \"amongst which is a very valuable work in four large folio volumes, \"Gramitia Austriaca\" [Austriacorum Icones et descriptions graminum]; by Nicholas Thomas Host\".Templeton was also associated with theFarming Society funded 1800, the \nKirwanian Society  founded 1812, Marsh's Library, Trinity College Botanic Garden. Four acres supplied with both exotic and indigenous plants,the Trinity Library (80,000 volumes) and Trinity Museum.Also the Museum of the College of Surgeons.\n\nDeath and legacy\nNever of strong constitution, he was not expected to survive, he was in failing health from 1815 and died in 1825 aged only 60, \"leaving a sorrowing wife, youthful family and many friends and townsmen who greatly mourned his death\". The Australian leguminous genus Templetonia is named for him.\nIn 1810 Templeton had supported the veteran United Irishman, William Drennan, in the foundation of the Belfast Academical Institution. With the staff and scholars of the Institution's early Collegiate Department, he then helped form the Belfast Natural History and Philosophical Society (the origin of both the Botanical Gardens and what is now the Ulster Museum).\nAlthough always ready to communicate his own findings, Templeton did not publish much. Robert Lloyd Praeger (1865-1953), editor of the Irish Naturalist and President of the Royal Irish Academy, described him nonetheless as \"the most eminent naturalist Ireland has produced\".Templeton's son, Robert Templeton (1802-1892), educated at the Belfast Academical Institution (which was eventually to acquire Cranmore House), became an entomologist renowned for his work on Sri Lankan arthropods.

He was the second son of Cleombrotus I, and grandfather of Areus I, who succeeded him. Although he reigned for more than 60 years, his life is completely unknown, apart from a victory at the Pythian Games in 336 BC. Several theories have been suggested by modern historians to explain such inactivity, but none has gained consensus.\n\nLife and reign\nCleomenes was the second son of king Cleombrotus I (r. 380–371), who belonged to the Agiad dynasty, one of the two royal families of Sparta (the other being the Eurypontids). Cleombrotus died fighting Thebes at the famous Battle of Leuctra in 371. His eldest son Agesipolis II succeeded him, but he died soon after in 370. Cleomenes' reign was instead exceptionally long, lasting 60 years and 10 months according to Diodorus of Sicily, a historian of the 1st century BC. In a second statement, Diodorus nevertheless tells that Cleomenes II reigned 34 years, but he confused him with his namesake Cleomenes I (r. 524–490).\n\nDespite the outstanding length of his reign, very little can be said about Cleomenes. He has been described by modern historians as a \"nonentity\". Perhaps that the apparent weakness of Cleomenes inspired the negative opinion of the hereditary kingship at Sparta expressed by Aristotle in his Politics (written between 336 and 322). However, Cleomenes may have focused on internal politics within Sparta, because military duties were apparently given to the Eurypontid Agesilaus II (r. 400–c.360), Archidamus III (r. 360–338), and Agis III (r. 338–331). As the Spartans notably kept their policies secret from foreign eyes, it would explain the silence of ancient sources on Cleomenes. Another explanation is that his duties were assumed by his elder son Acrotatus, described as a military leader by Diodorus, who mentions him in the aftermath of the Battle of Megalopolis in 331, and again in 315.Cleomenes' only known deed was his chariot race victory at the Pythian Games in Delphi in 336. In the following autumn, he gave the small sum of 510 drachmas for the reconstruction of the Temple of Apollo at Delphi, which had been destroyed by an earthquake in 373. Cleomenes might have made this gift as a pretext to go to Delphi and engage in informal diplomacy with other Greek states, possibly to discuss the consequences of the recent assassination of the Macedonian king Philip II.One short witticism of Cleomenes regarding cockfighting is preserved in the Moralia, written by the philosopher Plutarch in the early 2nd century AD:\nSomebody promised to give to Cleomenes cocks that would die fighting, but he retorted, \"No, don't, but give me those that kill fighting.\"\nAs Acrotatus died before Cleomenes, the latter's grandson Areus I succeeded him while still very young, so Cleomenes' second son Cleonymus acted as regent until Areus' majority. Some modern scholars also give Cleomenes a daughter named Archidamia, who played an important role during Pyrrhus' invasion of the Peloponnese, but the age difference makes it unlikely.\nPassage 6:\nEystein Glumra\nEystein Glumra (\"Eystein the Noisy\" or \"Eystein the Clatterer\"; Modern Norwegian Øystein Glumra), also known as Eystein Ivarsson, was reputedly a petty king on the west coast of Norway during the 9th century.\nThe Heimskringla saga states that Eystein Glumra was the father of Rognvald Eysteinsson and Sigurd Eysteinsson: \"The first earl of the Orkney Islands was ... Sigurd ... a son of Eystein Glumra, and brother of Ragnvald earl of More. After Sigurd, his son Guthorm was earl for one year. After him Torf-Einar, a son of Ragnvald ... was long earl, and was a man of great power\".\nAccording to the Orkneyinga saga, Eystein Glumra was the son of Ivar Halfdansson and grandson of Halfdan the Old. The Orkneyinga Saga also named Eystein Glumra as the father of Rognvald Eysteinsson: \"Heiti, Gorr's son, was father of Sveiði the sea-king, [who was] the father of Halfdan the old, [who was] the father of Ivar the Uplanders' earl, [who was] the father of Eystein the noisy, [who was] the father of earl Rognvald the mighty and wise in council\".\nTwo novels by Linnea Hartsuyker, The Half-Drowned King (2017) and The Sea Queen (2018), cover the lives of Eystein's children.\nPassage 7:\nInoue Masaru (bureaucrat)\nViscount Inoue Masaru (井上 勝, August 25, 1843 – August 2, 1910) was the first Director of Railways in Japan and is known as the \"father of the Japanese railways\".\n\nBiography\nHe was born into the Chōshū clan at Hagi, Yamaguchi, the son of Katsuyuki Inoue. He was briefly adopted into the Nomura family and became known as Nomura Yakichi, though he was later restored to the Inoue family.\nMasaru Inoue was brought up as the son of a samurai belonging to the Chōshū fief. At 15, he entered the Nagasaki Naval Academy established by the Tokugawa shogunate under the direction of a Dutch naval officer. In 1863, Inoue and four friends from the Chōshū clan stowed away on a vessel to the United Kingdom. He studied civil engineering and mining at University College London and returned to Japan in 1868. After working for the government as a technical officer supervising the mining industry, he was appointed Director of the Railway Board in 1871. Inoue played a leading role in Japan's railway planning and construction, including the construction of the Nakasendo Railway, the selection of the alternative route (Tokaido), and the proposals for future mainline railway networks.In 1891 Masaru Inoue founded Koiwai Farm with Yanosuke Iwasaki and Shin Onogi.  After retirement from the government, Inoue founded Kisha Seizo Kaisha, the first locomotive manufacturer in Japan, becoming its first president in 1896. In 1909 he was appointed President of the Imperial Railway Association. He died of an illness in London in 1910, during an official visit on behalf of the Ministry of Railways.\n\nHonors\nInoue and his friends later came to be known as the Chōshū Five. To commemorate their stay in London, two scholarships, known as the Inoue Masaru Scholarships, are available each session under the University College London 1863 Japan Scholarships scheme to enable University College students to study at a Japanese University. The value of the scholarships are £3000 each.\n\nHis tomb is in the triangular area of land where the Tōkaidō Main Line meets the Tōkaidō Shinkansen in Kita-Shinagawa.\n\nChōshū Five\nThese are the four other members of the \"Chōshū Five\":\n\nItō Shunsuke (later Itō Hirobumii)\nInoue Monta (later Inoue Kaoru)\nYamao Yōzō who later studied engineering at the Andersonian Institute, Glasgow, 1866-68 while working at the shipyards by day\nEndō Kinsuke\n\nSee also\nJapanese students in Britain\nStatue of Inoue Masaru\nPassage 8:\nFrancesco I Acciaioli\nFrancis or Francesco I Acciaioli was the son of Nerio II Acciaioli by his second wife Chiara Zorzi. He succeeded on his father's death in 1451 to the Duchy of Athens under his mother's regency.\nHis mother married the Venetian Bartolomeo Contarini (1453). However, Mehmet II, the Ottoman sultan, intervened at the insistence of the people on the behalf of the young duke Francis and summoned Bartolommeo and Chiara to his court at Adrianople. Another Acciaioli, Francesco II, was sent to Athens as a Turkish client duke. Evidently, the citizenry had mistrusted the two lovers influence over the young duke, for whose safety they may have feared. The young Francesco I remained at the court of the Ottoman sultan.\nPassage 9:\nNerio II Acciaioli\nNerio II Acciaioli (1416–1451) was the Duke of Athens on two separate occasions from 1435 to 1439 and again from 1441 to 1451.\nHe was a member of the Acciaioli family of Florence, the son of Francesco Lord of Sykaminon, who was cousin to Antonio I Acciaioli Duke of Athens. His mother was Margareta Malpigli. Nerio II's rule was contemporaneous with a renewed Italian philhellenism and corresponding interest in antiquities and the Greek language. Nerio not only spoke Greek naturally, but also owned the most famous monuments of the Hellenic world in his capital of Athens.\nNerio arrived in Greece in 1419 on the death of his father when he was only three years old. He was named heir to his uncle Antonio I of Athens, but on his uncle's death in 1435, he had to fight his uncle's widow Maria Melissene and the Chalkokondyles for the ducal throne. While George Chalkokondyles, the father of the Laonikos Chalkokondyles was pressing her suit before Murad II, the Ottoman sultan, the leading men of Athens tricked Maria into leaving the Acropolis then handed the title to Nerio. Maria and George Chalkokondyles' family were banished from Athens. After securing his position with Turkish help, he was removed by the intrigues of his brother Antonio II and driven from the Acropolis. His inveterate personal enemy, the historian Laonikos Chalkokondyles, denigrates him as \"effeminate.\"Nerio returned to power in 1441 on the death of his brother, after spending a few years in Florence. He immediately expelled his brother's widow Maria Zorzi. It is probably that Nerio was present when the Emperor John VIII made a proclamation of Catholicism in the Florentine Duomo on 6 July 1439. In 1444, Nerio went to war against the Turks on the side of the despot Constantine, but came to terms with the Ottomans. He subsequently lost Thebes to Constantine and was forced to pay him tribute and become his vassal. In 1446, Murad assisted Nerio in retaking Thebes for the Latins. On his death, he was succeeded by his young son Francesco under the regency of his widow Chiara Zorzi.\n\nNotes\nPassage 10:\nTakayama Tomoteru\nTakayama Tomoteru (高山友照) (1531–1596) was a Japanese samurai of the Azuchi–Momoyama period, who served Matsunaga Hisahide.\nHe was the father of Takayama Ukon, and was a Kirishitan.", "answers": ["Florence"], "length": 4864, "dataset": "2wikimqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "9354c44bd9db99cfb2b8f803def7504f1a8bf16e182b5514"}

People's Artist of the USSR (1990).\n\nEarly life\nRolan Bykov was born to Anton Mikhailovich Bykov and Olga Matveyevna Bykova (née Sitnyakovskaya), the youngest of two brothers. There are many myths surrounding his biography, including the names of Rolan and his parents, date and place of birth. Different directories showed that he was born in Moscow, yet Bykov and his brother Geronim stated that their family moved to Moscow from Kyiv in 1934. Throughout his life Rolan Antonovich Bykov was officially known as Roland Anatolyevich Bykov and his date of birth — as November 12 which, according to him, was caused by a mistake in his passport. He named various reasons for this: from a drunken militsioner at the passport office to his own aunt who confused names and dates while arranging his documents. As for the unusual name, Rolan explained that he was named after Romain Rolland (according to the Russian pronunciation) by his parents who confused Romain's surname for his name.Bykov's father was a military and intelligence officer of mixed Polish-Czech ancestry originally named Semyon Geronimovich Gordanovsky. He started his career by participating in World War I and making a successful escape after being taken captive by Austria-Hungary. During the Russian Civil War he fought as part of the 1st Cavalry Army led by Semyon Budyonny. Between 1924 and 1926 he worked in Cheka and regularly visited Germany under different passports. His last code name was Anton Mikhailovich Bykov which he adopted as a real name. He was later promoted to a high-ranking position in the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and served as a managing director at various enterprises.Bykov's mother also changed her name from Ella Matusovna to Olga Matveevna at one point. While Bykov regularly referred to her and her relatives as «Ukrainians», she was in fact a daughter of a prosperous Jewish NEPman. She wanted to become an actress and finished two courses of a theater institute, but was expelled for truancy.Between 1937 and 1947 Bykov studied in Moscow schools. In 1939 he joined a youth theatrical studio organized by a Pioneers Palace where he met Alexander Mitta, Boris Rytsarev and Igor Kvasha. During the Battle of Moscow his family was evacuated to Yoshkar-Ola for three years, although his father chose to stay and volunteered for the front line. In 1947 he entered the Boris Shchukin Higher Theater College to study acting under Vera Lvova and Leonid Shikhmatov.\n\nCareer\nIn 1951 Bykov graduated and immediately joined the Moscow Youth Theater where he served as an actor and a stage director until 1959. Simultaneously he also appeared in several movies in episodic roles, worked as an actor at the Moscow Drama Theater (1951—1952), as the head of the theater studio at the Bauman Palace of Culture (1951—1953), as a stringer for various children's programmes at the Soviet Central Television and as an editor on radio (1953—1959). He made his acting debut in the film School of Courage. In 1957 he organized a Student's Theater at the Moscow State University where he served as the main director up until 1959. Iya Savvina was among actors he discovered in the process.Between 1959 and 1960 Bykov headed the Lenin Komsomol Theatre in Leningrad, but left it for cinema. In 1959 he played the main part of Akaki Akakiyevich in The Overcoat, an adaptation of Nikolai Gogol's story directed by Aleksey Batalov. Soon after he joined Mosfilm where he spent the rest 40 years working as an actor and a film director. He played over 100 roles and became highly popular as a comedy actor with such roles as Chebakov from Balzaminov's Marriage (1964), Barmalei from Aybolit-66 and Skomorokh from Andrei Rublev (both 1966), Ivan Karyakin from Two Comrades Were Serving (1968), Petrykin from Big School-Break (1973), Cat Bazilio from The Adventures of Buratino (1975), Father Fyodor from The Twelve Chairs (1976) and others.As a film director he became known for his experimental children's and family movies. Among his most famous works are Seven Nannies (1962), Aybolit-66 (1966), Attention, a Turtle! (1970) and Scarecrow (1983). His films are generally associated with postmodernism, presented as a mix of different styles, genres and techniques, with theatrical musical numbers, arthouse editing, fourth wall breaking and so on. An unexpectedly grim Scarecrow released in 1984 became especially controversial and led to a lot of public criticism; some insisted it should be banned. Bykov survived a heart attack in the process. Yet in 1986 with the start of perestroika he was awarded the USSR State Prize for his movie.Apart from his movie career Bykov also worked as an educator at High Courses for Scriptwriters and Film Directors. Between 1986 and 1990 he served as a secretary of the Union of Cinematography of the USSR. He was also a member of the Nika Award organization.\nIn 1989 Bykov headed the Younost studio at Mosfilm dedicated to children's cinema. Between 1989 and 1992 he also headed the All-Soviet Center of Cinema and TV for Children and Youth. In 1992 he created and headed the Rolan Bykov's Fund (also known as International Fund for Development of Cinema for Children and Youth). According to his 1994 interview to Vladislav Listyev, they had produced 64 movies by that time and received various awards internationally, yet none of them were shown at Russian movie theaters since new management saw them as nonprofitable.Since 1989 Bykov had been involved in the political life of Russia. Between 1989 and 1991 he served as a member of the Congress of People's Deputies of the Soviet Union. He also headed a Nonpartisan Socio-Political Movement 95 that expressed support to culture, science, education and ecology. During the 1995 Parliamentary elections he headed a liberal pro-government Common Cause party along with Irina Khakamada and Vladimir Dzhanibekov. He also served as a president of the Help bank at one point.In 1996 Bykov was diagnosed with lung cancer and survived a surgery. He died two years later from thrombosis. He was buried at Novodevichy Cemetery.\n\nPersonal life\nFirst wife — an actress Lydia Nikolayevna Knyazeva (1925—1987). They met at the Moscow Youth Theater and spent 15 years together. They also adopted a boy from an orphanage and raised him under the name of Oleg Rolanovich Bykov (1958—2002). He appeared in Scarecrow in minor role and produced several movies, but left the industry shortly after.Second wife — an actress Elena Sanayeva, daughter of the acclaimed Soviet actor Vsevolod Sanayev. Bykov adopted her son from the first marriage Pavel Sanayev (born 1969) who became a popular Russian film director and writer. His part-autobiographical novel Bury Me Behind the Baseboard published in 1994 became a national bestseller. Bykov is featured in it under a name of Tolik. The book was adapted as a 2009 drama film Bury Me Behind the Baseboard, although the Sanayev family were displeased with it.Bykov also wrote poetry since childhood and published a book of poems in 1994 entitled Poems by Rolan Bykov that was re-released several times. In 2010 his widow Elena Sanayeva published a book of Bykov's diaries (from 1945 to 1996) that contained a lot of personal thoughts along with his wife's commentaries.In later years Bykov expressed a lot of concern regarding the movie industry and newer times in general. In his interview to Vladislav Listyev he stated that modern cinema was solely built around money, or the golden calf as he called it, with no place for art. «Back in 1984 I survived a heart attack following the release of Scarecrow; these days I survived a stroke during the production of a 10-minute short under Belgian producers». In his interviews to Leonid Filatov he characterized modern times as «corrupted», «a collapse of culture and morals», and modern cinema — as «a cigarette butt's art». In his diaries he continued those themes, predicting a Third World War, an environmental disaster and a general «schizophreniation» of the world population. The only exit he saw was a cultural and spiritual renaissance.\n\nSelected filmography\nActor\nDirector\nAwards and honors\nMedal \"For Labour Valour\" (1967)\nJubilee Medal \"In Commemoration of the 100th Anniversary of the Birth of Vladimir Ilyich Lenin\" (1970)\nHonored Artist of the RSFSR (1973)\nUSSR State Prize (1986) – for film Scarecrow\nPeople's Artist of the RSFSR (1987)\nVasilyev Brothers State Prize of the RSFSR (1987) – for his role as Professor Larsen in film Dead Man's Letters\nNika Award for Best Actor (1988) – for film Commissar\nPeople's Artist of the USSR (1990)\nOrder \"For Merit to the Fatherland\", 4th class (11 November 1994)\nPassage 4:\nBrian Kennedy (gallery director)\nBrian Patrick Kennedy (born 5 November 1961) is an Irish-born art museum director who has worked in Ireland and Australia, and now lives and works in the United States.  He was the director of the Peabody Essex Museum in Salem for 17 months, resigning December 31, 2020. He was the director of the Toledo Museum of Art in Ohio from 2010 to 2019. He was the director of the Hood Museum of Art from 2005 to 2010, and the National Gallery of Australia (Canberra) from 1997 to 2004.\n\nCareer\nBrian Kennedy currently lives and works in the United States after leaving Australia in 2005 to direct the Hood Museum of Art at Dartmouth College. In October 2010 he became the ninth Director of the Toledo Museum of Art. On 1 July 2019, he succeeded Dan Monroe as the executive director and CEO of the Peabody Essex Museum.\n\nEarly life and career in Ireland\nKennedy was born in Dublin and attended Clonkeen College. He received B.A. (1982), M.A. (1985) and PhD (1989) degrees from University College-Dublin, where he studied both art history and history.\nHe worked in the Irish Department of Education (1982), the European Commission, Brussels (1983), and in Ireland at the Chester Beatty Library (1983–85), Government Publications Office (1985–86), and Department of Finance (1986–89). He married Mary Fiona Carlin in 1988.He was Assistant Director at the National Gallery of Ireland in Dublin from 1989 to 1997. He was Chair of the Irish Association of Art Historians from 1996 to 1997, and of the Council of Australian Art Museum Directors from 2001 to 2003. In September 1997 he became Director of the National Gallery of Australia.\n\nNational Gallery of Australia (NGA)\nKennedy expanded the traveling exhibitions and loans program throughout Australia, arranged for several major shows of Australian art abroad, increased the number of exhibitions at the museum itself and oversaw the development of an extensive multi-media site.  Although he oversaw several years of the museum's highest ever annual visitation, he discontinued the emphasis of his predecessor, Betty Churcher, on showing \"blockbuster\" exhibitions.\nDuring his directorship, the NGA gained government support for improving the building and significant private donations and corporate sponsorship. However, the initial design for the building proved controversial generating a public dispute with the original architect on moral rights grounds.  As a result, the project was not delivered during Dr Kennedy's tenure, with a significantly altered design completed some years later.  Private funding supported two acquisitions of British art, including David Hockney's A Bigger Grand Canyon in 1999, and Lucian Freud's After Cézanne in 2001. Kennedy built on the established collections at the museum by acquiring the Holmgren-Spertus collection of Indonesian textiles; the Kenneth Tyler collection of editioned prints, screens, multiples and unique proofs; and the Australian Print Workshop Archive. He was also notable for campaigning for the construction of a new \"front\" entrance to the Gallery, facing King Edward Terrace, which was completed in 2010 (see reference to the building project above).\nKennedy's cancellation of the \"Sensation exhibition\" (scheduled at the NGA from 2 June 2000 to 13 August 2000) was controversial, and seen by some as censorship. He claimed that the decision was due to the exhibition being \"too close to the market\" implying that a national cultural institution cannot exhibit the private collection of a speculative art investor. However, there were other exhibitions at the NGA during his tenure, which could have raised similar concerns. The exhibition featured the privately owned Young British Artists works belonging to Charles Saatchi and attracted large attendances in London and Brooklyn. Its most controversial work was Chris Ofili's The Holy Virgin Mary, a painting which used elephant dung and was accused of being blasphemous. The then-mayor of New York, Rudolph Giuliani, campaigned against the exhibition, claiming it was \"Catholic-bashing\" and an \"aggressive, vicious, disgusting attack on religion.\" In November 1999, Kennedy cancelled the exhibition and stated that the events in New York had \"obscured discussion of the artistic merit of the works of art\". He has said that it \"was the toughest decision of my professional life, so far.\"Kennedy was also repeatedly questioned on his management of a range of issues during the Australian Government's Senate Estimates process - particularly on the NGA's occupational health and safety record and concerns about the NGA's twenty-year-old air-conditioning system. The air-conditioning was finally renovated in 2003. Kennedy announced in 2002 that he would not seek extension of his contract beyond 2004, accepting a seven-year term as had his two predecessors.He became a joint Irish-Australian citizen in 2003.\n\nToledo Museum of Art\nThe Toledo Museum of Art is known for its exceptional collections of European and American paintings and sculpture, glass, antiquities, artist books, Japanese prints and netsuke. The museum offers free admission and is recognized for its historical leadership in the field of art education.  During his tenure, Kennedy has focused the museum's art education efforts on visual literacy, which he defines as \"learning to read, understand and write visual language.\"   Initiatives have included baby and toddler tours, specialized training for all staff, docents, volunteers and the launch of a website, www.vislit.org. In November 2014, the museum hosted the International Visual Literacy Association (IVLA) conference, the first Museum to do so. Kennedy has been a frequent speaker on the topic, including 2010 and 2013 TEDx talks on visual and sensory literacy.\nKennedy has expressed an interest in expanding the museum's collection of contemporary art and art by indigenous peoples. Works by Frank Stella, Sean Scully, Jaume Plensa, Ravinder Reddy and Mary Sibande have been acquired.  In addition, the museum has made major acquisitions of Old Master paintings by Frans Hals and Luca Giordano.During his tenure the Toledo Museum of Art has announced the return of several objects from its collection due to claims the objects were stolen and/or illegally exported prior being sold to the museum.  In 2011 a Meissen sweetmeat stand was returned to Germany followed by an Etruscan Kalpis or water jug to Italy (2013), an Indian sculpture of Ganesha (2014) and an astrological compendium to Germany in 2015.\n\nHood Museum of Art\nKennedy became Director of the Hood Museum of Art in July 2005. During his tenure, he implemented a series of large and small-scale exhibitions and oversaw the production of more than 20 publications to bring greater public attention to the museum's remarkable collections of the arts of America, Europe, Africa, Papua New Guinea and the Polar regions. At 70,000 objects, the Hood has one of the largest collections on any American college of university campus. The exhibition, Black Womanhood: Images, Icons, and Ideologies of the African Body, toured several US venues. Kennedy increased campus curricular use of works of art, with thousands of objects pulled from storage for classes annually. Numerous acquisitions were made with the museum's generous endowments, and he curated several exhibitions: including Wenda Gu: Forest of Stone Steles: Retranslation and Rewriting Tang Dynasty Poetry, Sean Scully: The Art of the Stripe, and Frank Stella: Irregular Polygons.\n\nPublications\nKennedy has written or edited a number of books on art, including:\n\nAlfred Chester Beatty and Ireland 1950-1968: A study in cultural politics, Glendale Press (1988), ISBN 978-0-907606-49-9\nDreams and responsibilities: The state and arts in independent Ireland, Arts Council of Ireland (1990), ISBN 978-0-906627-32-7\nJack B Yeats: Jack Butler Yeats, 1871-1957 (Lives of Irish Artists), Unipub (October 1991), ISBN 978-0-948524-24-0\nThe Anatomy Lesson: Art and Medicine (with Davis Coakley), National Gallery of Ireland (January 1992), ISBN 978-0-903162-65-4\nIreland: Art into History (with Raymond Gillespie), Roberts Rinehart Publishers (1994), ISBN 978-1-57098-005-3\nIrish Painting, Roberts Rinehart Publishers (November 1997),  ISBN 978-1-86059-059-7\nSean Scully: The Art of the Stripe, Hood Museum of Art (October 2008), ISBN 978-0-944722-34-3\nFrank Stella: Irregular Polygons, 1965-1966, Hood Museum of Art (October 2010), ISBN 978-0-944722-39-8\n\nHonors and achievements\nKennedy was awarded the Australian Centenary Medal in 2001 for service to Australian Society and its art. He is a trustee and treasurer of the Association of Art Museum Directors, a peer reviewer for the American Association of Museums and a member of the International Association of Art Critics. In 2013 he was appointed inaugural eminent professor at the University of Toledo and received an honorary doctorate from Lourdes University. Most recently, Kennedy received the 2014 Northwest Region, Ohio Art Education Association award for distinguished educator for art education.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nPassage 5:\nJesse E.

He also co-founded the off-off-Broadway Theatre [the Hardware Poets Playhouse] with his wife Audrey Davis Levin and was also an associate artist of The Interact Theatre Company.\nPassage 8:\nMichael Govan\nMichael Govan (born 1963) is the director of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. Prior to his current position, Govan worked as the director of the Dia Art Foundation in New York City.\n\nEarly life and education\nGovan was born in 1963 in North Adams, Massachusetts, and was raised in the Washington D.C. area, attending Sidwell Friends School.He majored in art history and fine arts at Williams College, where he met Thomas Krens, who was then director of the Williams College Museum of Art. Govan became closely involved with the museum, serving as acting curator as an undergraduate. After receiving his B.A. from Williams in 1985, Govan began an MFA in fine arts from the University of California, San Diego.\n\nCareer\nAs a twenty-five year old graduate student, Govan was recruited by his former mentor at Williams, Thomas Krens, who in 1988 had been appointed director of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation. Govan served as deputy director of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum under Krens from 1988 to 1994, a period that culminated in the construction and opening of the Frank Gehry designed Guggenheim branch in Bilbao, Spain. Govan supervised the reinstallation of the museum's permanent collection galleries after its extensive renovation.\n\nDia Art Foundation\nFrom 1994 to 2006, Govan was president and director of Dia Art Foundation in New York City. There, he spearheaded the conversion of a Nabisco box factory into the 300,000 square foot Dia:Beacon in New York's Hudson Valley, which houses Dia's collection of art from the 1960s to the present. Built in a former Nabisco box factory, the critically acclaimed museum has been credited with catalyzing a cultural and economic revival within the formerly factory-based city of Beacon. Dia's collection nearly doubled in size during Govan's tenure, but he also came under criticism for \"needlessly and permanently\" closing Dia's West 22nd Street building. During his time at Dia, Govan also worked closely with artists James Turrell and Michael Heizer, becoming an ardent supporter of Roden Crater and City, the artists' respective site-specific land art projects under construction in the American southwest. Govan successfully lobbied Washington to have the 704,000 acres in central Nevada surrounding City declared a national monument in 2015.\n\nLACMA\nIn February 2006, a search committee composed of eleven LACMA trustees, led by the late Nancy M. Daly, recruited Govan to run the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. Govan has stated that he was drawn to the role not only because of LACMA's geographical distance from its European and east coast peers, but also because of the museum's relative youth, having been established in 1961. \"I felt that because of this newness I had the opportunity to reconsider the museum,\" Govan has written, \"[and] Los Angeles is a good place to do that.\"Govan has been widely regarded for transforming LACMA into both a local and international landmark. Since Govan's arrival, LACMA has acquired by donation or purchase over 27,000 works for the permanent collection, and the museum's gallery space has almost doubled thanks to the addition of two new buildings designed by Renzo Piano, the Broad Contemporary Art Museum (BCAM) and the Lynda and Stewart Resnick Pavilion. LACMA's annual attendance has grown from 600,000 to nearly 1.6 million in 2016.\n\nArtist collaborations\nSince his arrival, Govan has commissioned exhibition scenography and gallery designs in collaboration with artists. In 2006, for example, Govan invited LA artist John Baldessari to design an upcoming exhibition about the Belgian surrealist René Magritte, resulting in a theatrical show that reflected the twisted perspective of the latter's topsy-turvy world. Baldessari has also designed LACMA's logo. Since then, Govan has also commissioned Cuban-American artist Jorge Pardo to design LACMA's Art of the Ancient Americas gallery, described in the Los Angeles Times as a \"gritty cavern deep inside the earth ... crossed with a high-style urban lounge.\"Govan has also commissioned several large-scale public artworks for LACMA's campus from contemporary California artists. These include Chris Burden's Urban Light (2008), a series of 202 vintage street lamps from different neighborhoods in Los Angeles, arranged in front of the entrance pavilion, Barbara Kruger's Untitled (Shafted) (2008), Robert Irwin's Primal Palm Garden (2010), and Michael Heizer's Levitated Mass, a 340-ton boulder transported 100 miles from the Jurupa Valley to LACMA, a widely publicized journey that culminated with a large celebration on Wilshire Boulevard. Thanks in part to the popularity of these public artworks, LACMA was ranked the fourth most instagrammed museum in the world in 2016.In his first three full years, the museum raised $251 million—about $100 million more than it collected during the three years before he arrived. In 2010, it was announced that Govan will steer LACMA for at least six more years. In a letter dated February 24, 2013, Govan, along with the LACMA board's co-chairmen Terry Semel and Andrew Gordon, proposed a merger with the financially troubled Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles and a plan to raise $100 million for the combined museum.\n\nZumthor Project\nGovan's latest project is an ambitious building project, the replacement of four of the campus's aging buildings with a single new state of the art gallery building designed by architect Peter Zumthor. As of January 2017, he has raised about $300 million in commitments. Construction is expected to begin in 2018, and the new building will open in 2023, to coincide with the opening of the new D Line metro stop on Wilshire Boulevard. The project also envisages dissolving all existing curatorial departments and departmental collections. Some commentators have been highly critical of Govan's plans. Joseph Giovannini, recalling Govan's technically unrealizable onetime plan to hang Jeff Koons' Train sculpture from the facade of the Ahmanson Gallery, has accused Govan of \"driving the institution over a cliff into an equivalent mid-air wreck of its own\". Describing the collection merging proposal as the creation of a \"giant raffle bowl of some 130,000 objects\", Giovannini also points out that the Zumthor building will contain 33% less gallery space than the galleries it will replace, and that the linear footage of wall space available for displays will decrease by about 7,500 ft, or 1.5 miles. Faced with losing a building named in its honor, and anticipating that its acquisitions could no longer be displayed, the Ahmanson Foundation withdrew its support.\nOn the merging of the separate curatorial divisions to create a non-departmental art museum, Christopher Knight has pointed out that \"no other museum of LACMA's size and complexity does it\" that way, and characterized the museum's 2019 \"To Rome and Back\" exhibition, the first to take place under the new scheme, as \"bland and ineffectual\" and an \"unsuccessful sample of what's to come\".\n\nPersonal life\nGovan is married and has two daughters, one from a previous marriage. He and his family used to live in a $6 million mansion in Hancock Park that was provided by LACMA - a benefit worth $155,000 a year, according to most recent tax filings - until LACMA decided that it would sell the property to make up for the museum's of almost $900 million in debt [2]. That home is now worth nearly $8 million and Govan now lives in a trailer park in Malibu's Point Dume region.\nLos Angeles CA 90020\nUnited States.

The mob chases the young girl to the river's edge, where she gets rescued by her grandfather. He takes her home and asks her what the attack was all about. She equivocates, but then slowly reveals the reason for the bullying over the course of the film, which is told in a series of flashbacks. \nWhen Lena arrived at the new school, she acquired the nickname \"scarecrow\" due to a clumsy fall in class. She then develops a liking for the most popular boy in class, threatening the established social order. The young girl Shmakova, once the favorite of the class hero Somov, now has to move to another desk. This tension leads to much of the drama later in the movie.\nThe students are excited about an upcoming spring break trip to Moscow. In the meantime, they decide to skip a literature lesson and go watch a movie instead. Somov is uncomfortable with the idea and ends up revealing to the teacher that the class ran off to the movies. As part of their punishment, the class does not get to go to Moscow. One of the tougher girls who goes by the nickname \"Iron Tack\" figures that someone betrayed them about the movie. She decides to find out who the traitor is. To save Somov, Lena says that it was she who told the teacher. This begins a series of terrifying chase scenes through the village as the schoolkids turn up the pressure on Lena, while Somov keeps insisting to Lena that he will come clean and tell them the truth. In the end, he is unable to.\nAfter telling her grandfather the long story of how she took on the guilt of her beloved, Lena goes to the village beauty shop, where she cuts her hair off, and then shows up at Somov's birthday party. She delivers a pointed diatribe about many of her classmates, and then dramatically whips off her shawl, revealing her bald head. She also announces that she's leaving the village.\nBack at school, Lena comes in to find that Somov has finally confessed to the rest of the class that he was the one who told the teacher. He's now standing at the edge of the window, threatening to jump. Lena talks him into getting down from the window, and many of the students congratulate Lena on being tough and not leaving. The teacher greets her class and announces that Lena's grandfather has donated his home and a priceless collection of paintings by a famous artist who once lived in the village. The collection has been appraised as extremely valuable, and the home will become a museum for the collection. At that point, the grandfather comes in to collect his granddaughter Lena. He leaves a special painting, wrapped in a cloth, with the class. When the teacher unwraps the painting, it is revealed to be a young woman who appears just like Lena did with her short hair. The children are stricken with shame over what they did to her, and one student writes on the chalkboard above the painting \"Scarecrow, forgive us\".\n\nCast\nKristina Orbakaite as Lena Bessoltseva\nYuri Nikulin as Nikolay Nikolayevich Bessoltsev, Lena's grandfather\nElena Sanayeva as Margarita Ivanovna Kuzmina, a teacher\nSvetlana Kryuchkova as auntie Klava, a hairdresser\nRolan Bykov as the conductor of the military orchestra of the Suvorov Military School\nPassage 10:\nOlav Aaraas\nOlav Aaraas (born 10 July 1950) is a Norwegian historian and museum director.\nHe was born in Fredrikstad.

He studied in Straßburg and Leipzig. He tried to develop the principality's education and introduced a chancery for it. Teaching was based on the Austrian system and a Jesuit was made head of the Donaueschingen Gymnasium and later the Benedictine Franz Uebelacker was put in charge of the whole school system. He also had a history of the House of the Fürstenberg written from the principality's archives.\nHe set up a zuchthaus in Hüfingen and stopped his father's industrialisation policy and made resettlement difficult, since he saw industry as immoral - he preferred home handiwork such as watchmaking. In 1777 he set up a fire brigade. He was made director of the Swabian College of Reichsgrafen and in 1775 the Holy Roman Emperor appointed him a major general (with his rank effective from 1765).\nHe was also a music lover and was said to have been an excellent cellist. In 1762 he began building a private chapel at his court at Donaueschingen, and bringing a number of foreign musicians to man it. In 1783 he appointed Franz Christoph Neubauer as his musical director. He employed Ernst Christoph Dressler as Kapellmeister at Wetzlar between 1767 and 1771. In 1766 Leopold Mozart and his son Wolfgang Amadeus spent around two weeks at Donaueschingen as Joseph Wenzel's guest.\n\nMarriage and succession\nOn 9 June 1748 Joseph Wenzel married Maria Josepha, countess of Waldburg-Scheer-Trauchburg, daughter of count Hans Ernst von Waldburg-Scheer-Trauchburg.

She is a member of the House of Borromeo, an Italian noble family with historic ties to the Catholic Church and the Duchy of Milan. Through her marriage to Prince Antonius zu Fürstenberg she is a member of the German House of Fürstenberg. Matilde Borromeo has competed in international equestrian competitions representing Italy.\n\nEarly life\nMatilde Borromeo was born on 8 August 1983 in Milan, Italy. She is the third daughter of Carlo Ferdinando Borromeo, Count of Arona and Marion Sybil Zota. She is sister of Donna Lavinia Borromeo and Donna Isabella Borromeo. She is half-sister of Donna Beatrice Borromeo, who married into the Monegasque princely family, and Carlo Borromeo. She is a sister-in-law of Italian fashion designer Marta Ferri. Her paternal grandfather was Vitaliano Borromeo, Prince of Angera.\n\nCareer\nMatilde Borromeo began working on her family's farm in Lomellina after she got her degree in breeding and animal welfare at the University of Milan. She works in the daily industry and she started breeding show-jumping horses in 2006. Shortly after she began competing in the equestrian circuit, riding horses she raised on her own. She has competed international events. She has competed at the Global Champions Tour, Master of Paris, Master of Verona, and at the Piazza di Siena. Representing Italy, she has placed second in Monte Carlo, first in Tortona, second in Verona, and first in Truccazzano. She ranked ninth on the first and second days and tenth on the third day in the CIS first class grand prix at the Milano Winter Show. In 2015, Matilde Borromeo served as chief ambassador for the Milano Winter Show and Fiera Verona Cavalli.\n\nPersonal life\nOn 11 June 2011 Borromeo married Prince Antonius of Fürstenberg, the youngest son of Heinrich, Prince of Fürstenberg, at Isola Bella, one of the Borromean Islands in Lake Maggiore owned by the Borromeo family. They have two children, Prince Karl Egon and Prince Alexander.In February 2019 it was reported that Borromeo and Antonius had separated.\nPassage 6:\nHeinrich, Prince of Fürstenberg\nHeinrich, Prince of Fürstenberg (German: Heinrich Fürst zu Fürstenberg; born 17 July 1950) is a German landowner, businessman and nobleman, who is the head of the House of Fürstenberg.\n\nEarly years\nPrince Heinrich zu Fürstenberg was born in 1950 at Schloss Heiligenberg in Heiligenberg, Germany. He is the son of Joachim Egon, Prince of Fürstenberg, and Countess Paula von Königsegg-Aulendorf. He studied economics at university in Vienna.\n\nPersonal life and family\nIn 1976, Prince Heinrich married his second cousin, Princess Maximiliane of Windisch-Graetz, in Rome, Italy. In 1977, their first child, Prince Christian, was born. In 1985, their second child, Prince Antonius, was born.\nIn 2010, his eldest son married Jeannette Griesel. His younger son married Matilde dei Principi Borromeo Arese Taverna in 2011.In 2012, he was added to the International Best Dressed Hall of Fame.\n\nCareer\nPrince Heinrich's father died in 2002, and he assumed the role as head of the Princely House of Fürstenberg at that time.  He owns and manages the family businesses, which include landholdings and beer brewing.The Fürstenberg family is the second-largest forest owner in Germany. The family was granted the right to brew beer in 1283 by Rudolf I of Germany and has been in the business ever since. In 2005, Prince Heinrich joined the Fürstenberg Brewery with Brau Holding International.\nPassage 7:\nKarl Aloys zu Fürstenberg\nKarl Aloys zu Fürstenberg (26 June 1760 – 25 March 1799) was an Austrian military commander. He achieved the rank of Field Marshal and died at the Battle of Stockach.\nThe third son of a cadet branch of the House of  Fürstenberg, at his birth his chances of inheriting the family title of Fürst zu Fürstenberg were slight; he was prepared instead for a military career, and a tutor was hired to teach him the military sciences. He entered the Habsburg military in 1777, at the age of seventeen years, and was a member of the field army in the short War of the Bavarian Succession (1778–79). His career progressed steadily during the Habsburg War with the Ottoman Empire. In particular he distinguished himself at Šabac in 1790, when he led his troops in storming the fortress on the Sava river.\nDuring the French Revolutionary Wars, he fought with distinction again for the First Coalition, particularly at Ketsch and Frœschwiller, and in 1796 at Emmendingen, Schliengen and Kehl. He was stationed at key points to protect the movements of the Austrian army. With a force of 10,000, he defended the German Rhineland at Kehl, and reversed a bayonet assault by French troops at Bellheim; his troops also overran Speyer without any losses. By the end of the War of the First Coalition, at the age of 35, he had achieved the rank of Field Marshal. During the War of the Second Coalition, he fought in the first two battles of the German campaign, at Ostrach on 21 March 1799, and at Stockach on 25 March 1799. At the latter action while leading a grenadier regiment, he was hit by French case shot and knocked off his horse. He died shortly afterward.\n\nChildhood and early military training\nAs the third son of a cadet (junior) branch of the Fürstenberg princely family, Karl Aloys was prepared for a military career. His tutor, Lieutenant Ernst, was in active service in the Habsburg military, and took six-year-old Karl Aloys on maneuvers with him. In this way, he learned as a child the Habsburg military manual, and came into contact with important military men who later furthered his education and career; he also acquired an honorary rank as Kreis-Obristen, or Colonel of the Imperial Circle, by the time he was ten years old. As a youth, in 1776, he met the Habsburg war minister Count Franz Moritz von Lacy and Baron Ernst Gideon von Laudon; he was also invited to dine with Emperor Joseph II. He started his service in 1777 as a Fähnrich (ensign) in the Habsburg military organization. He saw his first field service during the War of the Bavarian Succession (1777–78), although he was not involved in any battles.In 1780, at the age of twenty years, he was promoted to captain, and assigned to the 34th Infantry Regiment, also known as the Anton Esterházy, named for Paul II Anton, Prince Esterházy, the general of cavalry, field marshal of the Seven Years' War, and ambassador to Britain. While he was assigned to this unit, he participated in the border conflicts between the Ottoman Empire and the Habsburgs, 1787–92, and stormed the fortress at Šabac (German: Schabatz) on the Sava River in Serbia on 27 April 1788. For his action at Šabac, he was personally commended by the Emperor; on the following day, he was promoted to major and given command of a grenadier battalion.On 1 January 1790, at Laudon's explicit request, Karl Aloys zu Fürstenberg was promoted to major general; at the end of June of that year, he received the coveted position of second colonel of the 34th Infantry Regiment Anton Esterhazy, where he served as the executive officer for Anton I, Prince Esterházy, the 34th Hungarian Regiment's Colonel and Proprietor. This was a customary appointment in which a less prominent officer completed the day-to-day administrative duties of the Colonel and Proprietor, who was usually a noble and was often posted in a different assignment, sometimes a different staff location. Karl Aloys zu Fürstenberg also received the confraternal Order of Saint Hubert from the Duke of Bavaria and married the \"elegant\" Princess Elisabeth of Thurn und Taxis (1767–1822), that year.\n\nFight against Revolutionary France\nWhile Karl Aloys zu Fürstenberg fought for the Habsburg cause in Serbia, in France, a coalition of the clergy and the professional and bourgeois class—the First and Third estates—led a call for reform of the French government and the creation of a written constitution. Initially, the rulers of Europe viewed the French Revolution as an event between the French king and his subjects, and not something in which they should interfere. In 1790, Leopold succeeded his brother Joseph as emperor and by 1791, he considered the situation surrounding his sister, Marie Antoinette, and her children, with greater alarm. In August 1791, in consultation with French émigré nobles and Frederick William II of Prussia, he issued the Declaration of Pillnitz, in which they declared the interest of the monarchs of Europe as one with the interests of Louis XVI and his family. They threatened ambiguous, but quite serious, consequences if anything should happen to the royal family. The French émigrés continued to agitate for support of a counter-revolution. On 20 April 1792, the French National Convention declared war on Austria. In the War of the First Coalition (1792–1797), France opposed most of the European states sharing land or water borders with her, plus Portugal and the Ottoman Empire.\n\nWar of the First Coalition\nIn the early days of the French Revolutionary Wars, Karl Aloys zu Fürstenberg remained as brigade commander of a small Austrian corps, approximately 10,000 men, under the overall command of Anton I, Prince Esterházy. He was stationed in the Breisgau, a Habsburg territory between the Black Forest and the Rhine. This location between the forested mountains and the river included two important bridgeheads across the river which offered access to southwestern Germany, the Swiss Cantons, or north-central Germany. His brigade defended Kehl, a small village immediately across the Rhine from Strasbourg, but most of the action in 1792 occurred further north, in present-day Belgium, near the cities of Speyer and Trier, and at Frankfurt on the Main River.In the second year of the war, Fürstenberg was transferred to the cavalry of Dagobert Sigmund von Wurmser, in the Army of the Upper Rhine, and placed in charge of the advance guard near Speyer, which was still held by the French. On 30 March, he crossed the Rhine by Ketsch at the head of the advance guard, which included 9,000 men. He took the city of Speyer on 1 April, in the absence of the commander of the city, Adam Philippe, Comte de Custine, who was away with most of his troops; those that remained behind simply abandoned the city. On the following day, Fürstenberg occupied the town of Germersheim. His first combat action of the war occurred on 3 April, when Custine's infantry attacked him in a bayonet charge near the villages of Bellheim, Hördt and Leimersheim, and afterward at Landau and Lauterbourg. During these attacks, he lost all the ground he had gained in the days before. After these events, he was again transferred, this time to the command of the Regiment Count von Kavanagh, where he continued to distinguish himself during the French counter-offensive of October–November 1793. In the action around Geidertheim, on the Zorn River, he assisted Lieutenant Field Marshal Gabriel Anton, Baron Splény de Miháldy, in repelling a French counter-attack. Shortly afterward, he became very ill and, in December 1793, was sent to the Hagenau to recover. On 22 December, he rejoined Wurmser's Corps for the Battle of Froeschwiller against Lazare Hoche and Jean-Charles Pichegru. After the French retreated over the Rhine at Huningue, near Basel, he directed the construction of its new fortifications.In June 1796, Fürstenberg commanded a division of four infantry battalions, 13 artillery pieces, and the Freikorps (Volunteers) Gyulay and secured the Rhine corridor between Kehl and Rastatt. On 26 June 1796, the French Army of the Rhine and Moselle crossed the Rhine and chased the Swabian Circle's military contingent out of Kehl. In June 1796, Archduke Charles added the contingent to Fürstenberg's command, making him the Swabian's Feldzeugmeister, or General of Infantry. Fürstenberg's troops defended the imperial line at the town of Rastatt until support troops arrived, and they could make an orderly withdrawal into the Upper Danube Valley. The Swabian contingent was demobilized in July, and Fürstenberg returned to the command of Austrian regulars during the Austrian counter-offensive. At the Battle of Emmendingen on 19 October 1796, his leadership was again instrumental in an Austrian victory. General Jean Victor Marie Moreau's Army of the Rhine-and-Moselle sought to retain a foothold on the eastern side of the Rhine, following his retreat from southwestern Germany west of the Black Forest. Fürstenberg held Kenzingen, 2.5 miles (4 km) north of Riegel on the Elz River. Karl Aloys zu Fürstenberg was ordered to feint against Riegel, to protect the primary Austrian positions at Rust and Kappel.In the Battle of Schliengen (24 October 1796), Fürstenberg commanded the second column of the Austrian force, which included nine battalions of infantry and 30 squadrons of cavalry; with these, he overwhelmed the force of General of Division Laurent de Gouvion Saint-Cyr, holding his position to prevent the French force from retreating north on the Rhine. While Maximilian Anton Karl, Count Baillet de Latour, engaged the main Austrian force at Kehl, Archduke Charles entrusted to Lieutenant Field Marshal Fürstenberg the command of the forces besieging Huningue, which included two divisions with 20 battalions of infantry and 40 squadrons of cavalry. Charles' confidence in his young field marshal was well-placed. On 27 November, Fürstenberg's chief engineer opened and drained the water-filled moat protecting the French fortifications. Fürstenberg offered the commander of the bridgehead, General of Brigade Jean Charles Abbatucci, the opportunity to surrender, which he declined. In the night of 30 November to 1 December, Fürstenberg's force stormed the bridgehead twice, but was twice repulsed. In one of these attacks, the French commander was mortally wounded and died on 3 December. Fürstenberg maintained the siege of Kehl while Archduke Charles engaged the stronger French force to the north of Kehl.After the French capitulation at Kehl (10 January 1797), Fürstenberg received additional forces with which he could end the siege at Hüningen. He ordered the reinforcement of the ring of soldiers surrounding Hüningen and, on 2 February 1797, the Austrians prepared to storm the bridgehead. General of Division Georges Joseph Dufour, the new French commander, pre-empted what would have been a costly attack, by offering to surrender the bridge. On 5 February, Fürstenberg finally took possession of the bridgehead. Francis II, the Holy Roman Emperor, appointed him as Colonel and Proprietor of the 36th Infantry Regiment, which bore his name until his death in battle in 1799.\n\nPeace\nThe Coalition forces—Austria, Russia, Prussia, Great Britain, Sardinia, among others—achieved several victories at Verdun, Kaiserslautern, Neerwinden, Mainz, Amberg and Würzburg, but in northern Italy, they could neither lift nor escape the siege at Mantua. The efforts of Napoleon Bonaparte in northern Italy pushed Austrian forces to the border of Habsburg lands. Napoleon dictated a cease-fire at Leoben on 17 April 1797, leading to the formal Treaty of Campo Formio, which went into effect on 17 October 1797. Austria withdrew from the territories the army had fought so hard to acquire, including the strategic river crossings at Hüningen and Kehl, as well as key cities further north.When the war ended, Fürstenberg stayed at the Donaueschingen estate of his cousin, Karl Joachim Aloys, who had recently inherited the family title as Fürst zu Fürstenberg. Later in 1797, he traveled to Prague and remained with his family until May 1798, when he received a posting to a new division in Linz. His daughter, Maria Anna, was born after he left, on 17 September 1798.\n\nActivities in the Second Coalition\nDespite the longed-for peace, tensions grew between France and most of the First Coalition allies, either separately or jointly. Ferdinand IV of Naples refused to pay agreed-upon tribute to France, and his subjects followed this refusal with a rebellion. The French invaded Naples and established the Parthenopaean Republic. A republican uprising in the Swiss cantons, encouraged by the French Republic which offered military support, led to the overthrow of the Swiss Confederation and the establishment of the Helvetic Republic. On his way to Egypt in Spring 1798, Napoleon had stopped on the Island of Malta and removed the Hospitallers from their possessions. This angered Paul, Tsar of Russia, who was the honorary head of the Order. The ongoing French occupation of Malta angered the British, who dedicated themselves to ejecting the French garrison at Valletta. The French Directory was convinced that the Austrians were conniving to start another war. Indeed, the weaker the French Republic seemed, the more seriously the Austrians, the Neapolitans, the Russians, and the British actually discussed this possibility.\nAs winter broke on 1 March 1799, General Jean Baptiste Jourdan and his 25,000-man Army of the Danube crossed the Rhine at Kehl. The Army of the Danube met little resistance as it advanced through the Black Forest and eventually took a flanking position on the north shore of Lake Constance. Instructed to block the Austrians from access to the Swiss alpine passes, Jourdan planned to isolate the armies of the Coalition in Germany from allies in northern Italy, and prevent them from assisting one another. His was a preemptive strike. By crossing the Rhine in early March, Jourdan acted before Archduke Charles' army could be reinforced by Austria's Russian allies, who had agreed to send 60,000 seasoned soldiers and their more-seasoned commander, Generalissimo Alexander Suvorov. Furthermore, if the French held the interior passes in Switzerland, they could not only prevent the Austrians from transferring troops between northern Italy and southwestern Germany, but could use the routes to move their own forces between the two theaters.\n\nBattle of Ostrach\nAt the outbreak of hostilities in March 1799, Karl Aloys zu Fürstenberg was with his troops in Bavarian territory, just north of the free and Imperial city of Augsburg. When news reached the Austrian camp that the French had crossed the Rhine, Charles ordered the imperial army to advance west. Fürstenberg moved his troops toward Augsburg, crossing the Lech River.The French advanced guard arrived in Ostrach on 8–9 March, and over the next week skirmished with the Austrian forward posts, while the rest of the French army arrived. Jourdan disposed his 25,000 troops along a line from Salem Abbey and Lake Constance to the Danube river, centered in Ostrach. He established his command headquarters at the imperial city of Pfullendorf, overlooking the entire Ostrach valley.  Jourdan was expecting Dominique Vandamme's troops to arrive in time to support his far north flank near the river, but Vandamme had gone to Stuttgart to investigate a rumored presence of Austrian troops there and had not rejoined the main army. Consequently, the French left flank, under command of Gouvion Saint-Cyr, was thinly manned. Jourdan thought he had more time, expecting Charles would need still three or four days to move his troops across the Lech, and march to Ostrach, but by the middle of Holy Week in 1799, more than a third of Charles' army, 48,000 mixed troops, was positioned in a formation parallel to  Jourdan's, and his 72,000 remaining troops were arrayed with the left wing at Kempten, the center near Memmingen, and the right flank extended to Ulm.By 21 March, the French and Austrian outposts overlapped, and skirmishing intensified.  Charles had divided his force into four columns. Fürstenberg covered the  northern flank of the Archduke's main force. Fürstenberg's force pushed the French out of Davidsweiler, and then advanced on Ruppersweiler  and Einhard, 5 kilometers (3 mi) to the northwest of Ostrach. Saint-Cyr did not have the manpower to defend the position, and the entire line fell back to Ostrach, with Fürstenberg's troops pressuring their withdrawal. Fürstenberg's persistent pressure on the French left flank was instrumental in the collapse of the northern part of the French line. After their success in driving the French back from Ostrach, and then from the heights of Pfullendorf, the Austrian forces continued to press the French back to Stockach, and then another five miles or so to Engen.\n\nDeath at the Battle of Stockach (1799)\nOn the morning of what they suspected would be the general engagement, Karl Aloys zu Fürstenberg sought out the field chaplain, and requested the sacraments because, as he told his aide, anything can happen during a battle. Although Ostrach had been a hard-fought battle, at Engen and Stockach, the Austrian and French forces were far more concentrated—more men in a smaller space—than they had been at Ostrach, where the French forces in particular had been stretched thinly on a long line from Lake Constance to north of the Danube. At Stockach, furthermore, Jourdan had all his troops under his direct control, with the possible exception of Dominique Vandamme, who was maneuvering his small force of cavalry and light infantry into position to attempt a flanking action on the far right Austrian flank.In the course of the battle, Jourdan's forces were supposed to engage in simultaneous attacks on the left, center and right of the Austrian line. On the French right, Souham's and Ferino's Corps met with strong resistance and were stopped; on the French left, Lefebvre's troops charged with such force that the Austrians were pushed back. Having stopped Souham's and Ferino's assault, Charles had troops available to counter Lefebvre's force. At that point, Vandamme's men moved into action. Because Souham's assault at the center had been stalled, Charles still had enough men to turn part of his force to fight this new threat, but the Austrians were hard pressed and the action furious. At one point, Charles attempted to lead his eight battalions of Hungarian grenadiers into action, to the dismay of the old soldiers. Fürstenberg reportedly said that while he lived, he would not leave this post (at the head of the grenadiers) and the Archduke should not dismount and fight. As Fürstenberg led the Hungarian grenadiers into the battle, he was cut down by a canister and case shot employed by the French. Although he was carried alive off the field, he died almost immediately. Charles ultimately did lead his grenadiers into battle, and reportedly his personal bravery rallied his troops to push back the French. After the battle, someone removed Fürstenberg's wedding ring and returned it to his wife in Prague, with news of his death; Fürstenberg was buried at the battlefield cemetery in Stockach, and his cousin erected a small monument there, but in 1857, his body was moved to the family cemetery, Maria Hof at Neudingen, near Donaueschingen.\n\nFamily\nUpon the death of Prosper Ferdinand, Count Fürstenberg, in the War of the Spanish Succession, in 1704 the Fürstenberg inheritance was divided between the count's two youngest sons, Joseph Wilhelm Ernst and Wilhelm Egon; the eldest son was an ecclesiastic. The family of Fürstenberg was raised to princely status 2 February 1716, with the elevation of Joseph Wilhelm Ernst, as the first Prince (Fürst) of Fürstenberg (German: Fürst zu Fürstenberg). The first prince had three sons, Joseph Wenzel Johann Nepomuk (1728–1783), Karl Borromäus Egon (1729–1787), and Prosper Maria, who died in infancy. The title passed through the line of the first son, Joseph Wenzel Johann Nepomuk (as second prince), to his son Joseph Maria Benedikt Karl (third prince, who died in 1796) and then to another son of the second prince, Karl Joachim Aloys (fourth prince). The last son of Joseph Wilhelm Ernst died in 1803 without male issue. Consequently, the title passed to the male line of first prince's  second son. This son, Karl Borromäus Egon, had died in 1787.Karl Borromäus Egon's oldest son, Joseph Maria Wenzel (16 August 1754 – 14 July 1759), died as a small child. The second son, Philipp Nerius Maria (Prague, 21 October 1755 – 5 June 1790), married in 1779 to his first cousin, Josepha Johanna Benedikta von Fürstenberg (sister of the third and fourth princes), at Donaueschingen. Only one of their sons survived childhood, but died at the age of 15 years. The other children of this second son were all daughters, and thus not eligible to inherit the title Prince of Fürstenberg. Consequently, the title devolved to the agnatic male descendants of Karl Aloys zu Fürstenberg.In 1803, two of Karl Aloys zu Fürstenberg's children were still living. Karl Egon, as the surviving son, inherited the title Prince of Fürstenberg; he and his eldest sister lived into adulthood and produced families.Children of Karl Aloys zu Fürstenberg and Elizabeth, Princess of Thurn und Taxis, were:\n\nMarie Leopoldine (Prague, 4 September 1791 – Kupferzell, 10 January 1844); married at Heiligenberg, 20 May 1813 to Charles Albert III, Prince of Hohenlohe-Waldenburg-Schillingsfürst (Vienna, 29 February 1776 – Bad Mergentheim, 15 June 1843)\nMaria Josepha (9 September 1792)\nAntonie (28 October 1794 – 1 October 1799)\nKarl Egon II (Prague, 28 October 1796 – Bad Ischl 22 October 1854), succeeded his cousin, Joachim, as the fifth Fürst zu Fürstenberg on 17 May 1804.

In 2002, at the age of 12, he composed his first songs, \"Amor de Barrio\" (Neighbourhood Love) and \"Desencuentro\" (Disagreement) which would be featured 10 years later on his debut album. In Málaga he performed for the first time with a Flamenco band in a restaurant, and he was nicknamed El Blanco Moreno (The White Moreno), because he \"was very pale-skinned and Moreno was my family name\", as he stated in an interview in early 2011. Later, Pablo met producer Manuel Illán and recorded a demo, which included a cover of \"Deja de Volverme Loca\" (Stop Driving Me Crazy) by Diana Navarro.

Formerly a solo artist, he is the lead singer of indie rock band One eskimO.\n\nEarly life\nKristian Leontiou was born in London, England and is of Greek Cypriot descent. He went to Hatch End High School in Harrow and worked several jobs in and around London whilst concentrating on music when he had any free time.  In 2003 he signed a major record deal with Polydor. At the time, Leontiou was dubbed \"the new Dido\" by some media outlets. His debut single \"Story of My Life\" was released in June 2004 and reached #9 in the UK Singles Chart. His second single \"Shining\" peaked at #13 whilst the album Some Day Soon was certified gold selling in excess of 150,000 copies.\nLeontiou toured the album in November 2004 taking him to the US to work with L.A Reid, Chairman of the Island Def Jam music group.  Unhappy with the direction his career was going, on a flight back from the US in 2004 he decided to take his music in a new direction.  Splitting from his label in late 2005, he went on to collaborate with Faithless on the song \"Hope & Glory\" for their album ‘'To All New Arrivals'’.  It was this release that saw him unleash the One eskimO moniker.  It was through working with Rollo Armstrong on the Faithless album, that Rollo got to hear an early demo of \"Astronauts\" from the One eskimO project. Being more than impressed by what he heard, Rollo opened both his arms and studio doors to Leontiou and they began to co-produce the ‘'All Balloons’' album.\nIt was at this time that he paired up with good friend Adam Falkner, a drummer/musician, to introduce a live acoustic sound to the album. They recorded the album with engineer Phill Brown (engineer for Bob Marley and Robert Plant) at Ark studios in St John's Wood where they recorded live then headed back to Rollo's studio to add the cinematic electro touches that are prominent on the album.\nShortly after its completion, One eskimO's \"Hometime\" was used on a Toyota Prius advert in the USA. The funds from the advert were then used to develop the visual aspect of One eskimO. He teamed up with friend Nathan Erasmus (Gravy Media Productions) along with animation team Smuggling Peanuts (Matt Latchford and Lucy Sullivan) who together began to develop the One eskimO world, the first animation produced was for the track ‘Hometime’ which went on to win a British animation award in 2008.\nIn 2008 Leontiou started a new management venture with ATC Music. By mid-2008 Time Warner came on board to develop all 10 One eskimO animations which were produced the highly regarded Passion Pictures in London.  Now with all animation complete and a debut album, One eskimO prepare to unveil themselves fully to the world in summer 2009.\nLeontiou released a cover version of Tracy Chapman's \"Fast Car\", which was originally released as a single in 2005. Leontiou's version was unable to chart, however, due to there being no simultaneous physical release alongside the download single, a UK chart rule that was in place at the time. On 24 April 2011, the song entered the singles chart at number 88 due to Britain's Got Talent contestant Michael Collings covering the track on the show on 16 April 2011.\n\nDiscography\nAlbums\nSingles\nNotes\nA  - Originally released as a single in April 2005, Leontiou's version of \"Fast Car\" did not chart until 2011 in the UK.\n\nAlso featured on\nNow That's What I Call Music! 58 (Story of My Life)\nWin a Date with Tad Hamilton! OST, Love Love Songs - The Ultimate Love Collection (Shining)\nSummerland OST (The Crying)\nPassage 3:\nBilly Milano\nBilly Milano (born June 3, 1964) is an American heavy metal and hardcore punk musician. He is the singer and occasionally guitarist and bassist of crossover thrash band M.O.D., and was the singer of its predecessor, Stormtroopers of Death. Prior to these bands, Milano played in early New York hardcore band the Psychos, which also launched the career of future Agnostic Front vocalist Roger Miret. Milano was also the singer of United Forces, which included his Stormtroopers of Death bandmate Dan Lilker. Milano managed a number of bands, including Agnostic Front, for whom he also co-produced the 1997 Epitaph Records release Something's Gotta Give and roadie for Anthrax.\n\nDiscography\nStormtroopers of Death albums\nStormtroopers of Death videos\nMethod of Destruction (M.O.D.)\nMastery\nPassage 4:\nO Valencia!\n\"O Valencia!\" is the fifth single by the indie rock band The Decemberists, and the first released from their fourth studio album, The Crane Wife.\nThe music was written by The Decemberists and the lyrics by Colin Meloy. It tells a story of two star-crossed lovers. The singer falls in love with a person who belongs to an opposing gang. At the end of the song, the singer's lover jumps in to defend the singer, who is confronting his lover's brother (the singer's \"sworn enemy\") and is killed by the bullet intended for the singer.\n\nTrack listing\nThe 7\" single sold in the UK was mispressed, with \"Culling of the Fold\" as the B-side despite the artwork and record label listing \"After the Bombs\" as the B-side.\n\nMusic videos\nFor the \"O Valencia!\" music video, The Decemberists filmed themselves in front of a green screen and asked fans to complete it by digitally adding in background images or footage. Stephen Colbert of The Colbert Report, having recently asked fans to do the same with a video of him with a light saber in front of a green screen, brought up The Decemberists on his segment \"Look Who's Riding on My Coattails Now\" and accused the band of stealing the idea. The Decemberists' response was to challenge Stephen Colbert to a guitar solo showdown on December 20, 2006, on The Colbert Report.On January 19, 2007, The Decemberists premiered an alternate music video of \"O Valencia!\", directed by Aaron Stewart-Ahn, on MTV2. The video follows a character named Patrick, played by Meloy, as he and his love Francesca (Lisa Molinaro), daughter of \"the Boss\", plan an escape to an unknown location. At a cafe, a man in a suit, portrayed by the band member Chris Funk, tells him to hide in the \"Valencia\" hotel (the Super Value Inn on North Interstate Avenue in Portland, Oregon) while he gets them the necessary documentation to escape. Above the name of the hotel, there is a neon sign that reads \"Office\". The letters have all burnt out except for the \"O\", creating the title of the song. The video then introduces other characters - various assassination teams - who sit in different rooms of the hotel waiting for the chance to catch the two lovers. Most are portrayed by other members of the band (along with Meloy's wife, Carson Ellis). They kill off any potential witnesses to their plan. Patrick manages to take down one member from each team, before they gang up on him. The Boss arrives, along with the man from the cafe, who reveals that he snitched on Patrick and Francesca. They execute Francesca, while forcing Patrick to watch. After they leave, Patrick finds a note by Francesca, which reveals that she never fell in love with him, and only wanted protection. 2 months later, Patrick and the man, who has lost an eye from a previous assassination attempt, have a sit-down at the same cafe. The man reveals that he snitched on Patrick just to take over the town. Patrick reveals that he poisoned a drink the man was having, but before he could get away, the man stabs Patrick in the neck with a fork before dying, followed by Patrick.\nThe video is somewhat influenced by the distinct style and themes of director Wes Anderson, with bold fonts being used to introduce characters and groups on the bottom of the screen (much like in the film The Royal Tenenbaums). The band had previously (and more explicitly) drawn influence from Anderson's Rushmore in their video for \"Sixteen Military Wives\". The layout of the hotel is also similar to the one used in Bottle Rocket.\nKurt Nishimura was chosen as the winner by mtvU for his video that depicted a love affair between a woman and her television, with the TV containing the green-screened Decemberists video footage.\nPassage 5:\nAstrid North\nAstrid North (Astrid Karina North Radmann; 24 August 1973, West Berlin – 25 June 2019, Berlin) was a German soul singer and songwriter. She was the singer of the German band Cultured Pearls, with whom she released five Albums.

Her art inspired Ballew to consider making music that \"sounded like her art looked\" as he has said. Ballew began writing original songs and digging up nursery rhymes and folk songs in the public domain to interpret and make his own. The first album, Here I Am!, was recorded during the summer of 2008 and released in February 2009.\nBallew began to perform solo as Caspar Babypants in the Seattle area in January 2009. Fred Northup, a Seattle-based comedy improvisor, heard the album and offered to play as his live percussionist.  Northrup also suggested his frequent collaborator Ron Hippe as a keyboard player. \"Frederick Babyshirt\" and \"Ronald Babyshoes\" were the Caspar Babypants live band from May 2009 to April 2012. Both Northup and Hippe appear on some of his recordings but since April 2012 Caspar Babypants has exclusively performed solo. The reasons for the change were to include more improvisation in the show and to reduce the sound levels so that very young children and newborns could continue to attend without being overstimulated. \nBallew has made two albums of Beatles covers as Caspar Babypants. Baby Beatles! came out in September 2013 and Beatles Baby! came out in September 2015.\nBallew runs the Aurora Elephant Music record label, books shows, produces, records, and masters the albums himself. Distribution for the albums is handled by Burnside Distribution in Portland, Oregon.\nCaspar Babypants has released a total of 17 albums. The 17th album, BUG OUT!, was released on May 1, 2020. His album FLYING HIGH! was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Children's Album. All 17 of the albums feature cover art by Ballew's wife, Kate Endle.\n\"FUN FAVORITES!\" and \"HAPPY HITS!\" are two vinyl-only collections of hit songs that Caspar Babypants has released in the last couple of years.\n\nDiscography\nAlbumsPEPS (2002)\nHere I Am!

He was the singer of indie punk band Carter the Unstoppable Sex Machine.\n\nBiography\nJim Bob played in various bands during the late 1970s and early 1980s, including Jamie Wednesday, who were performing between 1984 and 1987. In 1987 Jamie Wednesday split up just before a gig at the London Astoria. Morrison and Les \"Fruitbat\" Carter filled in, playing along to a backing tape, and Carter USM was born. Jim Bob and Les Carter had known each other since the late 1970s, when their bands The Ballpoints (featuring Jim on vocals) and Dead Clergy (Les on bass and vocals) used to rehearse at the same studio behind Streatham station. When The Ballpoints' bassist quit at the end of 1980, Carter joined the band, who than went on to play several gigs under the name Peter Pan's Playground.\nHe was a member of Carter USM. The band split up in 1997. Since Carter USM, Jim Bob has released two albums and three singles with his disco-pop-punk group Jim's Super Stereoworld, seven solo albums as Jim Bob or James Robert Morrison, and played various live shows both with his band and solo.  In 2001, he joined his old Carter bandmate Fruitbat on stage once again, as part of the group Who's The Daddy Now?.\nIn 2005, Cherry Red released a DVD of a live solo acoustic performance, titled Live From London, featuring songs from his solo career as well as many Carter USM tracks. This was followed by a concept album, School, released in March 2006.\nA best-of album was released in the autumn of 2006, accompanied by a UK tour. This was originally intended as a download-only release, but a physical CD was produced. The album was accompanied by a free CD of Jim Bob and Jim's Super Stereoworld rarities. The cover design was re-worked by Jim Bob from an image by Jim Connolly.\nThe album A Humpty Dumpty Thing was released in November 2007 by Cherry Red Records. The album came with a Jim Bob-penned-mini novel, \"Word Count\". A single from the album, \"Battling The Bottle\", was released with Jim Bob's re-working of the children's song \"The Wheels on the Bus\" on the B-side.\nJim Bob's next solo record, Goffam, was a semi-concept album about a city in the grip of crime, deserted by its superheroes. He toured the UK in April and September 2009 promoting the album.\nIn December 2009 Jim Bob performed his 2004 song \"Angelstrike!\" as part of the shows The Return of 9 Lessons and Carols for Godless People for two nights at the Bloomsbury Theatre and at Hammersmith Apollo. This was broadcast on BBC4 television under the title 'Nerdstack'.\nHis debut novel Storage Stories was released  on the day of a UK general election, 6 May 2010, by Ten Forty Books. This was followed by three novels with major publishers: Driving Jarvis Ham, The Extra Ordinary Life of Frank Derrick, Age 81 and Frank Derrick's Holiday of a Lifetime.\nJim Bob's autobiography, Goodnight Jim Bob – On The Road With Carter The Unstoppable Sex Machine, was published by Cherry Red Books in 2004. The sequel, Jim Bob from Carter, was published by Cherry Red Books on 23 March 2019. The double novel A Godawful Small Affair and Harvey King Unboxes His Family, written under the name J.B. Morrison, was published by Cherry Red Books in March 2020.\nThe 26-second song \"2020 WTF!\" was released in March 2020 on Cherry Red Records. It was the first single from Jim Bob's August 2020 album, Pop Up Jim Bob. The second single, \"Jo's Got Papercuts\", followed in June, and a third, \"If it Ain't Broke\", was released in July.\nThe album Pop Up Jim Bob was released on Cherry Red Records on 14 August 2020. Entering the official UK album chart at number 26, it was Jim Bob's first top-30 LP since Carter The Unstoppable Sex Machine.\nJim Bob's 13th solo album, Who Do We Hate Today, was released on Cherry Red Records on 20 August 2021 and reached 34 in the UK album charts, his second top-40 solo LP.\n\nSolo discography\nAll releases credited as Jim Bob unless otherwise stated.

He was the director of the Peabody Essex Museum in Salem for 17 months, resigning December 31, 2020. He was the director of the Toledo Museum of Art in Ohio from 2010 to 2019. He was the director of the Hood Museum of Art from 2005 to 2010, and the National Gallery of Australia (Canberra) from 1997 to 2004.\n\nCareer\nBrian Kennedy currently lives and works in the United States after leaving Australia in 2005 to direct the Hood Museum of Art at Dartmouth College. In October 2010 he became the ninth Director of the Toledo Museum of Art. On 1 July 2019, he succeeded Dan Monroe as the executive director and CEO of the Peabody Essex Museum.\n\nEarly life and career in Ireland\nKennedy was born in Dublin and attended Clonkeen College. He received B.A. (1982), M.A. (1985) and PhD (1989) degrees from University College-Dublin, where he studied both art history and history.\nHe worked in the Irish Department of Education (1982), the European Commission, Brussels (1983), and in Ireland at the Chester Beatty Library (1983–85), Government Publications Office (1985–86), and Department of Finance (1986–89). He married Mary Fiona Carlin in 1988.He was Assistant Director at the National Gallery of Ireland in Dublin from 1989 to 1997. He was Chair of the Irish Association of Art Historians from 1996 to 1997, and of the Council of Australian Art Museum Directors from 2001 to 2003. In September 1997 he became Director of the National Gallery of Australia.\n\nNational Gallery of Australia (NGA)\nKennedy expanded the traveling exhibitions and loans program throughout Australia, arranged for several major shows of Australian art abroad, increased the number of exhibitions at the museum itself and oversaw the development of an extensive multi-media site.  Although he oversaw several years of the museum's highest ever annual visitation, he discontinued the emphasis of his predecessor, Betty Churcher, on showing \"blockbuster\" exhibitions.\nDuring his directorship, the NGA gained government support for improving the building and significant private donations and corporate sponsorship. However, the initial design for the building proved controversial generating a public dispute with the original architect on moral rights grounds.  As a result, the project was not delivered during Dr Kennedy's tenure, with a significantly altered design completed some years later.  Private funding supported two acquisitions of British art, including David Hockney's A Bigger Grand Canyon in 1999, and Lucian Freud's After Cézanne in 2001. Kennedy built on the established collections at the museum by acquiring the Holmgren-Spertus collection of Indonesian textiles; the Kenneth Tyler collection of editioned prints, screens, multiples and unique proofs; and the Australian Print Workshop Archive. He was also notable for campaigning for the construction of a new \"front\" entrance to the Gallery, facing King Edward Terrace, which was completed in 2010 (see reference to the building project above).\nKennedy's cancellation of the \"Sensation exhibition\" (scheduled at the NGA from 2 June 2000 to 13 August 2000) was controversial, and seen by some as censorship. He claimed that the decision was due to the exhibition being \"too close to the market\" implying that a national cultural institution cannot exhibit the private collection of a speculative art investor. However, there were other exhibitions at the NGA during his tenure, which could have raised similar concerns. The exhibition featured the privately owned Young British Artists works belonging to Charles Saatchi and attracted large attendances in London and Brooklyn. Its most controversial work was Chris Ofili's The Holy Virgin Mary, a painting which used elephant dung and was accused of being blasphemous. The then-mayor of New York, Rudolph Giuliani, campaigned against the exhibition, claiming it was \"Catholic-bashing\" and an \"aggressive, vicious, disgusting attack on religion.\" In November 1999, Kennedy cancelled the exhibition and stated that the events in New York had \"obscured discussion of the artistic merit of the works of art\". He has said that it \"was the toughest decision of my professional life, so far.\"Kennedy was also repeatedly questioned on his management of a range of issues during the Australian Government's Senate Estimates process - particularly on the NGA's occupational health and safety record and concerns about the NGA's twenty-year-old air-conditioning system. The air-conditioning was finally renovated in 2003. Kennedy announced in 2002 that he would not seek extension of his contract beyond 2004, accepting a seven-year term as had his two predecessors.He became a joint Irish-Australian citizen in 2003.\n\nToledo Museum of Art\nThe Toledo Museum of Art is known for its exceptional collections of European and American paintings and sculpture, glass, antiquities, artist books, Japanese prints and netsuke. The museum offers free admission and is recognized for its historical leadership in the field of art education.  During his tenure, Kennedy has focused the museum's art education efforts on visual literacy, which he defines as \"learning to read, understand and write visual language.\"   Initiatives have included baby and toddler tours, specialized training for all staff, docents, volunteers and the launch of a website, www.vislit.org. In November 2014, the museum hosted the International Visual Literacy Association (IVLA) conference, the first Museum to do so. Kennedy has been a frequent speaker on the topic, including 2010 and 2013 TEDx talks on visual and sensory literacy.\nKennedy has expressed an interest in expanding the museum's collection of contemporary art and art by indigenous peoples. Works by Frank Stella, Sean Scully, Jaume Plensa, Ravinder Reddy and Mary Sibande have been acquired.  In addition, the museum has made major acquisitions of Old Master paintings by Frans Hals and Luca Giordano.During his tenure the Toledo Museum of Art has announced the return of several objects from its collection due to claims the objects were stolen and/or illegally exported prior being sold to the museum.  In 2011 a Meissen sweetmeat stand was returned to Germany followed by an Etruscan Kalpis or water jug to Italy (2013), an Indian sculpture of Ganesha (2014) and an astrological compendium to Germany in 2015.\n\nHood Museum of Art\nKennedy became Director of the Hood Museum of Art in July 2005. During his tenure, he implemented a series of large and small-scale exhibitions and oversaw the production of more than 20 publications to bring greater public attention to the museum's remarkable collections of the arts of America, Europe, Africa, Papua New Guinea and the Polar regions. At 70,000 objects, the Hood has one of the largest collections on any American college of university campus. The exhibition, Black Womanhood: Images, Icons, and Ideologies of the African Body, toured several US venues. Kennedy increased campus curricular use of works of art, with thousands of objects pulled from storage for classes annually.

Biographical Directory of the United States Congress.\nPassage 4:\nJohn of Brienne\nJohn of Brienne (c. 1170 – 19–23 March 1237), also known as John I, was King of Jerusalem from 1210 to 1225 and Latin Emperor of Constantinople from 1229 to 1237. He was the youngest son of Erard II of Brienne, a wealthy nobleman in Champagne. John, originally destined for an ecclesiastical career, became a knight and owned small estates in Champagne around 1200. After the death of his brother, Walter III, he ruled the County of Brienne on behalf of his minor nephew Walter IV (who lived in southern Italy).\nThe barons of the Kingdom of Jerusalem proposed that John marry their queen, Maria. With the consent of Philip II of France and Pope Innocent III, he left France for the Holy Land and married the queen; the couple were crowned in 1210. After Maria's death in 1212 John administered the kingdom as regent for their infant daughter Isabella II; an influential lord, John of Ibelin, attempted to depose him. John was a leader of the Fifth Crusade. Although his claim of supreme command of the crusader army was never unanimously acknowledged, his right to rule Damietta (in Egypt) was confirmed shortly after the city fell to the crusaders in 1219. He claimed the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia on behalf of his second wife, Stephanie, in 1220. After Stephanie and their infant son died that year, John returned to Egypt. The Fifth Crusade ended in failure (including the recovery of Damietta by the Egyptians) in 1221.\nJohn was the first king of Jerusalem to visit Europe (Italy, France, England, León, Castile and Germany) to seek assistance for the Holy Land. He gave his daughter in marriage to Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II in 1225, and Frederick ended John's rule of the Kingdom of Jerusalem. Although the popes tried to persuade Frederick to restore the kingdom to John, the Jerusalemite barons regarded Frederick as their lawful ruler. John administered papal domains in Tuscany, became the podestà of Perugia and was a commander of Pope Gregory IX's army during Gregory's war against Frederick in 1228 and 1229.\nHe was elected emperor in 1229 as the senior co-ruler (with Baldwin II) of the Latin Empire, and was crowned in Constantinople in 1231. John III Vatatzes, Emperor of Nicaea, and Ivan Asen II of Bulgaria occupied the last Latin territories in Thrace and Asia Minor, besieging Constantinople in early 1235. John directed the defence of his capital during the months-long siege, with the besiegers withdrawing only after Geoffrey II of Achaea and united fleets from Italian towns defeated their fleet in 1236. The following year, John died as a Franciscan friar.\n\nEarly life\nJohn was the youngest of the four sons of Count Erard II of Brienne and Agnes of Montfaucon. He seemed \"exceedingly old ... about 80\" to the 14-year-old George Akropolites in 1231; if Akropolites' estimate was correct, John was born around 1150. However, no other 13th-century authors described John as an old man. His father referred to John's brothers as \"children\" in 1177 and mentioned the tutor of John's oldest brother, Walter III, in 1184; this suggests that John's brothers were born in the late 1160s. Modern historians agree that John was born after 1168, probably during the 1170s.Although his father destined John for a clerical career, according to the late-13th-century Tales of the Minstrel of Reims he \"was unwilling\". Instead, the minstrel continued, John fled to his maternal uncle at the Clairvaux Abbey. Encouraged by his fellows, he became a knight and earned a reputation in tournaments and fights. Although elements of the Tales of the Minstrel of Reims are apparently invented (for instance, John did not have a maternal uncle in Clairvaux), historian Guy Perry wrote that it may have preserved details of John's life. A church career was not unusual for youngest sons of 12th-century noblemen in France; however, if his father sent John to a monastery he left before reaching the age of taking monastic vows. John \"clearly developed the physique that was necessary to fight well\" in his youth, because the 13th-century sources Akropolites and Salimbene di Adam emphasize his physical strength.Erard II joined the Third Crusade and died in the Holy Land in 1191. His oldest son, Walter III, succeeded him in Brienne. John was first mentioned in an 1192 (or 1194) charter issued by his brother, indicating that he was a prominent figure in Walter's court. According to a version of Ernoul's chronicle, John participated in a war against Peter II of Courtenay. Although the Tales of the Minstrel of Reims claimed that he was called \"John Lackland\", according to contemporary charters John held Jessains, Onjon, Trannes and two other villages in the County of Champagne around 1200. In 1201, Theobald III granted him additional estates in Mâcon, Longsols and elsewhere. Theobald's widow, Blanche of Navarre, persuaded John to sell his estate at Mâcon, saying that it was her dower.Walter III of Brienne died in June 1205 while fighting in southern Italy. His widow, Elvira of Sicily, gave birth to a posthumous son, Walter IV, who grew up in Italy. John assumed the title of count of Brienne, and began administering the county on his nephew's behalf in 1205 or 1206. As a leading vassal of the count of Champagne, John frequented the court of Blanche of Navarre, who ruled Champagne during the minority of her son, Theobald IV. According to a version of Ernoul's chronicle, she loved John \"more than any man in the world\"; this annoyed King Philip II of France.The two versions of Ernoul's chronicle tell different stories about John's ascent to the throne of Jerusalem. According to one version, the leading lords of Jerusalem sent envoys to France in 1208 asking Philip II to select a French nobleman as a husband for their queen, Maria. Taking advantage of the opportunity to rid himself of John, Philip II suggested him. In the other version an unnamed knight encouraged the Jerusalemite lords to select John, who accepted their offer with Philip's consent. John visited Pope Innocent III in Rome. The pope donated 40,000 marks for the defence of the Holy Land, stipulating that John could spend the money only with the consent of the Latin patriarch of Jerusalem and the grand masters of the Knights Templar and the Knights Hospitaller.\n\nKing of Jerusalem\nCo-ruler\nJohn landed at Acre on 13 September 1210; the following day, Patriarch of Jerusalem Albert of Vercelli married him to Queen Maria. John and Maria were crowned in the Cathedral of Tyre on 3 October. The truce concluded by Maria's predecessor Aimery and the Ayyubid sultan Al-Adil I had ended by John's arrival. Although Al-Adil was willing to renew it, Jerusalemite lords did not want to sign a new treaty without John's consent. During John and Maria's coronation, Al-Adil's son Al-Mu'azzam Isa pillaged the area around Acre but did not attack the city. After returning to Acre, John raided nearby Muslim settlements in retaliation.Although about 300 French knights accompanied him to the Holy Land, no influential noblemen joined him; they preferred participating in the French Albigensian Crusade or did not see him as sufficiently eminent. John's cousin, Walter of Montbéliard, joined him only after he was expelled from Cyprus. Montbéliard led a naval expedition to Egypt to plunder the Nile Delta. After most of the French crusaders left the Holy Land, John forged a new truce with Al-Adil by the middle of 1211 and sent envoys to Pope Innocent urging him to preach a new crusade.\n\nConflicts\nMaria died shortly after giving birth to their daughter, Isabella, in late 1212. Her death triggered a legal dispute, with John of Ibelin (who administered Jerusalem before John's coronation) questioning the widowed king's right to rule. The king sent Raoul of Merencourt, Bishop of Sidon, to Rome for assistance from the Holy See. Pope Innocent confirmed John as lawful ruler of the Holy Land in early 1213, urging the prelates to support him with ecclesiastical sanctions if needed. Most of the Jerusalemite lords remained loyal to the king, acknowledging his right to administer the kingdom on behalf of his infant daughter; John of Ibelin left the Holy Land and settled in Cyprus.The relationship between John of Brienne and Hugh I of Cyprus was tense. Hugh ordered the imprisonment of John's supporters in Cyprus, releasing them only at Pope Innocent's command. During the War of the Antiochene Succession John sided with Bohemond IV of Antioch and the Templars against Raymond-Roupen of Antioch and Leo I, King of Cilician Armenia, who were supported by Hugh and the Hospitallers. However, John sent only 50 knights to fight the Armenians in Antiochia in 1213. Leo I concluded a peace treaty with the Knights Templar late that year, and he and John reconciled. John married Leo's oldest daughter, Stephanie (also known as Rita), in 1214 and Stephanie received a dowry of 30,000 bezants. Quarrels among John, Leo I, Hugh I and Bohemond IV are documented by Pope Innocent's letters urging them to reconcile their differences before the Fifth Crusade reached the Holy Land.\n\nFifth Crusade\nPope Innocent proclaimed the Fifth Crusade in 1213, with the \"liberation of the Holy Land\" (the reconquest of Jerusalem) its principal object. The first crusader troops, commanded by Leopold VI of Austria, landed at Acre in early September 1217. Andrew II of Hungary and his army followed that month, and Hugh I of Cyprus and Bohemond IV of Antioch soon joined the crusaders. However, hundreds of crusaders soon returned to Europe because of a famine following the previous year's poor harvest. A war council was held in the tent of Andrew II, who considered himself the supreme commander of the crusader army. Other leaders, particularly John, did not acknowledge Andrew's leadership. The crusaders raided nearby territory ruled by Al-Adil I for food and fodder, forcing the sultan to retreat in November 1217. In December John besieged the Ayyubid fortress on Mount Tabor, joined only by Bohemond IV of Antioch. He was unable to capture it, which \"encouraged the infidel\", according to the contemporary Jacques de Vitry.\nAndrew II decided to return home, leaving the crusaders' camp with Hugh I and Bohemond IV in early 1218. Although military action was suspended after their departure, the crusaders restored fortifications at Caesarea and Atlit. After new troops arrived from the Holy Roman Empire in April, they decided to invade Egypt. They elected John supreme commander, giving him the right to rule the land they would conquer. His leadership was primarily nominal, since he could rarely impose his authority on an army of troops from many countries.The crusaders laid siege to Damietta, on the Nile, in May 1218. Although they seized a strategically important tower on a nearby island on 24 August, Al-Kamil (who had succeeded Al-Adil I in Egypt) controlled traffic on the Nile. In September, reinforcements commanded by Pope Honorius III's legate Cardinal Pelagius (who considered himself the crusade's supreme commander) arrived from Italy.Egyptian forces attempted a surprise attack on the crusaders' camp on 9 October, but John discovered their movements. He and his retinue attacked and annihilated the Egyptian advance guard, hindering the main force. The crusaders built a floating fortress on the Nile near Damietta, but a storm blew it near the Egyptian camp. The Egyptians seized the fortress, killing nearly all of its defenders. Only two soldiers survived the attack; they were accused of cowardice, and John ordered their execution. Taking advantage of the new Italian troops, Cardinal Pelagius began to intervene in strategic decisions. His debates with John angered their troops. The soldiers broke into the Egyptian camp on 29 August 1219 without an order, but they were soon defeated and nearly annihilated. During the ensuing panic, only the cooperation of John, the Templars, the Hospitallers and the noble crusaders prevented the Egyptians from destroying their camp.In late October, Al-Kamil sent messengers to the crusaders offering to restore Jerusalem, Bethlehem and Nazareth to them if they withdrew from Egypt. Although John and the secular lords were willing to accept the sultan's offer, Pelagius and the heads of the military orders resisted; they said that the Moslems could easily recapture the three towns. The crusaders ultimately refused the offer. Al-Kamil tried to send provisions to Damietta across their camp, but his men were captured on 3 November. Two days later, the crusaders stormed into Damietta and seized the town. Pelagius claimed it for the church, but he was forced to acknowledge John's right to administer it (at least temporarily) when John threatened to leave the crusaders' camp. According to John of Joinville, John seized one-third of Damietta's spoils; coins minted there during the following months bore his name. Al-Mu'azzam, emir of Damascus and brother of al-Kamil, invaded the Kingdom of Jerusalem and pillaged Caesarea before the end of 1219.John's father-in-law, Leo I of Armenia, died several months before the crusaders seized Damietta. He bequeathed his kingdom to his infant daughter, Isabella. John and Raymond-Roupen of Antioch (Leo's nephew) questioned the will's legality, each demanding the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia for themselves. In a February 1220 letter, Pope Honorius declared John to be Leo's rightful heir. Saying that he wanted to assert his claim to Cilicia, John left Damietta for the Kingdom of Jerusalem around Easter 1220. Although Al-Mu'azzam's successful campaign the previous year also pressed John to leave Egypt, Jacques de Vitry and other Fifth Crusade chroniclers wrote that he deserted the crusader army.Stephanie died shortly after John's arrival. Contemporary sources accused John of causing her sudden death, claiming that he severely beat her when he heard that she tried to poison his daughter Isabella. Their only son died a few weeks later, ending John's claim to Cilicia. Soon after Pope Honorius learned about the deaths of Stephanie and her son, he declared Raymond-Roupen the lawful ruler of Cilicia and threatened John with excommunication if he fought for his late wife's inheritance.John did not return to the crusaders in Egypt for several months. According to a letter from the prelates in the Holy Land to Philip II of France, lack of funds kept John from leaving his kingdom. Since his nephew Walter IV was approaching the age of majority, John surrendered the County of Brienne in 1221. During John's absence from Egypt, Al-Kamil again offered to restore the Holy Land to the Kingdom of Jerusalem in June 1221; Pelagius refused him. John returned to Egypt and rejoined the crusade on 6 July 1221 at the command of Pope Honorius.The commanders of the crusader army decided to continue the invasion of Egypt, despite (according to Philip d'Aubigny) John's strong opposition. The crusaders approached Mansurah, but the Egyptians imposed a blockade on their camp. Outnumbered, Pelagius agreed to an eight-year truce with Al-Kamil in exchange for Damietta on 28 August. John was among the crusade leaders held hostage by Al-Kamil until the crusader army withdrew from Damietta on 8 September.\n\nNegotiations\nAfter the Fifth Crusade ended \"in colossal and irremediable failure\", John returned to his kingdom. Merchants from Genoa and Pisa soon attacked each other in Acre, destroying a significant portion of the town. According to a Genoese chronicle, John supported the Pisans and the Genoese left Acre for Beirut.John was the first king of Jerusalem to visit Europe, and had decided to seek aid from the Christian powers before he returned from Egypt. He also wanted to find a suitable husband for his daughter, to ensure the survival of Christian rule in the Holy Land. John appointed Odo of Montbéliard as a bailli to administer the Kingdom of Jerusalem in his absence.\nHe left for Italy in October 1222 to attend a conference about a new crusade. At John's request, Pope Honorius declared that all lands conquered during the crusade should be united with the Kingdom of Jerusalem. To plan the military campaign, the pope and Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II met at Ferentino in March 1223; John attended the meeting. He agreed to give his daughter in marriage to Frederick II after the emperor promised that he would allow John to rule the Kingdom of Jerusalem for the rest of his life.John then went to France, although Philip II was annoyed at being excluded from the decision of Isabella's marriage. Matilda I, Countess of Nevers, Erard II of Chacenay, Albert, Abbot of Vauluisant and other local potentates asked John to intervene in their conflicts, indicating that he was esteemed in his homeland. John attended the funeral of Philip II at the Basilica of St Denis in July; Philip bequeathed more than 150,000 marks for the defence of the Holy Land. John then visited England, attempting to mediate a peace treaty between England and France after his return to France.He made a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela in March 1224. According to the Latin Chronicle of the Kings of Castile, John went to the Kingdom of León to marry one of the elder daughters of Alfonso IX of León (Sancha or Dulce) because Alfonso had promised him the kingdom \"along with her\". The marriage could jeopardize the claim of Sancha's and Dulce's half-brother, Ferdinand III of Castile, to León. To protect her son's interests, Ferdinand's mother Berengaria of Castile decided to give her daughter (Berengaria of León) to John in marriage. Although modern historians do not unanimously accept the chronicle's account of John's plan to marry Sancha or Dulce, they agree that the queen of France (Blanche of Castile, Berengaria of Castile's sister) played an important role in convincing John to marry her niece. The marriage of John and Berengaria of León was celebrated in Burgos in May 1224.About three months later, he met Emperor Frederick's son Henry in Metz and visited Henry's guardian, Engelbert, Archbishop of Cologne. From Germany John went to southern Italy, where he persuaded Pope Honorius to allow Emperor Frederick to postpone his crusade for two years. Frederick married John's daughter, Isabella (who had been crowned queen of Jerusalem), on 9 November 1225. John and Frederick's relationship became tense. According to a version of Ernoul's chronicle, John got into a disagreement with his new son-in-law because Frederick seduced a niece of Isabella who was her lady-in-waiting. In the other version of the chronicle John often \"chastised and reproved\" his son-in-law, who concluded that John wanted to seize the Kingdom of Sicily for his nephew Walter IV of Brienne and tried to murder John (who fled to Rome). Frederick declared that John had lost his claim to the Kingdom of Jerusalem when Isabella married him; he styled himself king of Jerusalem for the first time in December 1225. Balian of Sidon, Simon of Maugastel, Archbishop of Tyre, and the other Jerusalemite lords who had escorted Isabella to Italy acknowledged Frederick as their lawful king.\n\nPapal service\nPope Honorius did not accept Frederick's unilateral act, and continued to regard John as the rightful king of Jerusalem. In an attempt to take advantage of the revived Lombard League (an alliance of northern Italian towns) against Frederick II, John went to Bologna. According to a version of Ernoul's chronicle, he declined an offer by the Lombard League representatives to elect him their king. Even though this account was fabricated, John remained in Bologna for over six months. The dying Pope Honorius appointed John rector of a Patrimony of Saint Peter in Tuscany (part of the Papal States) on 27 January 1227, and urged Frederick II to restore him to the throne of the Kingdom of Jerusalem. Honorius' successor, Gregory IX, confirmed John's position in the Papal States on 5 April and ordered the citizens of Perugia to elect him their podestà.Gregory excommunicated Frederick II on 29 September 1227, accusing him of breaking his oath to lead a crusade to the Holy Land; the emperor had dispatched two fleets to Syria, but a plague forced them to return. His wife Isabella died after giving birth to a son, Conrad, in May 1228. Frederick continued to consider himself king of Jerusalem, in accordance with the precedent set by John during Isabella's minority.The imperial army under the command of Rainald of Urslingen invaded the Papal States in October 1228, beginning the so-called War of the Keys. Although John defeated the invaders in a series of battles, it took a counter-invasion by another papal army in southern Italy to drive Rainald back to Sulmona. John laid a siege before returning to Perugia in early 1229 to conclude negotiations with envoys of the Latin Empire of Constantinople, who were offering him the imperial crown.\n\nEmperor of Constantinople\nElection\nThe Latin Emperor of Constantinople, Robert I, died in January 1228. His brother Baldwin II succeeded him, but a regent was needed to rule the Latin Empire since Baldwin was ten years old. Ivan Asen II of Bulgaria was willing to accept the regency, but the barons of the Latin Empire suspected that he wanted to unite the Latin Empire with Bulgaria. They offered the imperial crown instead to John, an ally of the Holy See.After months of negotiation, John and the envoys from the Latin Empire signed a treaty in Perugia which was confirmed by Pope Gregory on 9 April 1229. John was elected emperor of the Latin Empire for life as senior co-ruler with Baldwin II, who married John's daughter Marie. The treaty also prescribed that although Baldwin would rule the Latin lands in Asia Minor when he was 20 years old, he would become sole emperor only after John's death. John also stipulated that his sons would inherit Epirus and Macedonia, but the two regions still belonged to Emperor of Thessalonica Theodore Doukas.After signing the treaty, John returned to Sulmona. According to the contemporary Matthew Paris, he allowed his soldiers to plunder nearby monasteries to obtain money. John lifted the siege of Sulmona in early 1229 to join Cardinal Pelagius, who launched a campaign against Capua. Frederick II (who had crowned himself king of Jerusalem in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre) returned to Italy, forcing the papal troops to withdraw.John went to France to recruit warriors to accompany him to Constantinople. Pope Gregory did not proclaim John's expedition to the Latin Empire a crusade, but promised papal privileges granted to crusaders to those who joined him. During his stay in France, John was again an intermediary between local potentates and signed a peace treaty between Louis IX of France and Hugh X of Lusignan. He returned to Italy in late 1230. John's envoys signed a treaty with Jacopo Tiepolo, Doge of Venice, who agreed to transport him and his retinue of 500 knights and 5,000 commoners to Constantinople in return for John's confirmation of Venetian possessions and privileges in the Latin Empire. Shortly after John left for Constantinople in August, Pope Gregory acknowledged Frederick II's claim to the Kingdom of Jerusalem.\n\nRule\nJohn was crowned emperor in Hagia Sophia in autumn 1231; by then, his territory was limited to Constantinople and its vicinity. The Venetians urged him to wage war against John III Vatatzes, Emperor of Nicaea, who supported a rebellion against their rule in Crete. According to Philippe Mouskes' Rhymed Chronicle, John could make \"neither war nor peace\"; because he did not invade the Empire of Nicaea, most French knights who accompanied him to Constantinople returned home after his coronation. To strengthen the Latin Empire's financial position, Geoffrey II of Achaea (John's most powerful vassal) gave him an annual subsidy of 30,000 hyperpyra after his coronation.Taking advantage of John III Vatatzes' invasion of Rhodes, John launched a military expedition across the Bosphorus against the Empire of Nicaea in 1233. His three-to-four-month campaign \"achieved little, or nothing\"; the Latins only seized Pegai, now Biga in Turkey. With John's approval, two Franciscan and two Dominican friars wanted to mediate a truce between the Latin Empire and Nicaea in 1234 but it was never signed. In a letter describing their negotiations, the friars described John as a \"pauper\" abandoned by his mercenaries.John III Vatatzes and Ivan Asen II concluded a treaty dividing the Latin Empire in early 1235. Vatatzes soon seized the last outposts of the empire in Asia Minor and Gallipoli, and Asen occupied the Latin territories in Thrace. Constantinople was besieged in an effort to persuade the defenders to gather in one place, enabling an invasion elsewhere. Although the besiegers outnumbered the defenders, John repelled all attacks on the town's walls. Mouskes compared him to Hector, Roland, Ogier the Dane and Judas Maccabeus in his Rhymed Chronicle, emphasizing his bravery.A Venetian fleet forced Vatatzes' naval forces to withdraw, but after the Venetians departed for home the Greeks and Bulgarians besieged Constantinople again in November 1235. John sent letters to European monarchs and the pope, pleading for assistance. Since the survival of the Latin Empire was in jeopardy, Pope Gregory urged the crusaders to defend Constantinople instead of the Holy Land. A combined naval force from Venice, Genoa, Pisa and Geoffrey II of Achaea broke through the blockade. Asen soon abandoned his alliance with Vatatzes, who was forced to lift the siege in 1236.\n\nDeath\nAccording to three 13th-century authors (Matthew Paris, Salimbene di Adam and Bernard of Besse), John became a Franciscan friar before his death. They agree that John's declining health contributed to his conversion, but Bernard also described a recurring vision of an old man urging the emperor to join the Franciscans. Most 13th-century sources suggest that John died between 19 and 23 March 1237, the only Latin emperor to die in Constantinople.According to the Tales of the Minstrel of Reims, he was buried in Hagia Sophia. Perry wrote that John, who died as a Franciscan friar, may have been buried in the Franciscan church dedicated to Saint Francis of Assisi which was built in Galata during his reign. In a third theory, proposed by Giuseppe Gerola, a tomb decorated with the Latin Empire coat of arms in Assisi's Lower Basilica may have been built for John by Walter VI, Count of Brienne.\n\nFamily\nJohn's first wife (Maria the Marquise, born 1191) was the only child of Isabella I of Jerusalem and her second husband, Conrad of Montferrat. Maria inherited Jerusalem from her mother in 1205. John and Maria's only child, Isabella (also known as Yolanda), was born in late 1212.Stephanie of Armenia became John's second wife in 1214. She was the only daughter of Leo II of Armenia and his first wife, Isabelle (niece of Sibylle, the third wife of Bohemond III of Antioch). Stephanie gave birth to a son in 1220, but she and her son died that year.John married his third wife, Berengaria of León, in 1224; she was born around 1204 to Alfonso IX of León and Berengaria of Castile. John and Berengaria's first child, Marie, was born in 1224. Their first son, Alphonse, was born during the late 1220s. Berengaria's cousin, Louis IX of France, made him Grand Chamberlain of France and he acquired the County of Eu in France with his marriage. John's second son, Louis, was born around 1230. His youngest son, John, who was born in the early 1230s, was Grand Butler of France.\nPassage 5:\nGiacomo Bosio\nGiacomo Bosio (1544–1627) was a brother of the Order of St. John of Jerusalem and the historian of this order. \nHe was the uncle of the Maltese antiquary Antonio Bosio.\n\nBiography\nGiacomo Bosio was born in 1544 in Chivasso, in the present province of Turin in the Piedmont.\nHe was a son of a noble family from Milan that had already contributed many knights to the Order.\nGiacomo Bosio arrived at Rome in 1587 and was appointed representative of the Hospitaller Order of the Holy See to the cardinal Gregorio Petrocchini. \nHe took advantage of his stay in Rome to write the history of his order, under the title Dell'istoria della Sacra Religione, Giovanni di Santo dell'illustrissima milizia Gierosolimitano. \nBosio gave his manuscript to two Franciscan brothers called the \"Big Brothers\" in Italy, who put his work into the form known today: forty books grouped into three volumes and printed in folio in Rome in 1621, in 1629/30, in 1678 and in Naples in 1684.\nBosio's work deals with the history of the Hospitallers order from its origin until 1571 with Jean Parisot de la Valette. \nHis story was continued by brother Bartolomeo dal Pozzo up to the year 1688 and first published in Verona in 1703 in two volumes, then in Venice in 1740 under the title Historia della Sacra di religione militare S.

His first cousin, King Hugh II of Cyprus, died in 1267 and despite Hugh's rights as senior heir, Hugh of Antioch was crowned Hugh III of Cyprus. When his second cousin's son Conradin, King of Jerusalem, was killed in 1268, the succession passed again to his junior cousin Hugh III.\nDeciding to seek his fortune in Europe rather than Outremer, Hugh entered the service of Charles I of Naples. Charles made him Captain-General of Brindisi, Otranto and Apulia and Lord of Conversano, and he was an enthusiastic partisan of the Angevin cause in Italy. For this service he was restored to his family's County of Lecce. He was captured with Charles II of Naples in the Battle of the Gulf of Naples in 1284 and again in the Battle of the Counts in 1287, both times in naval battles against Roger of Lauria. On one of these occasions he obtained his parole by leaving his only son Walter as a hostage. He was killed in Sicily, at the Battle of Gagliano, against the Catalan Almogavars, and was succeeded by Walter.\nIn 1291 he married Helena Angelina Komnene, widow of William de la Roche, Duke of Athens, and regent for her underage son Guy II de la Roche. He thus became Bailli of the Duchy of Athens until Guy II came of age in 1296.\n\nMarriages and issue\nHugh's first wife was Isabella de la Roche, heiress of Thebes. They had a son, Walter V (d. 1311), who succeeded Hugh, and a daughter, Agnes, who married Count John of Joigny.

Mary's parents were King Hugh I of Cyprus and Alice of Champagne, making her a maternal granddaughter of Queen Isabella I of Jerusalem. Her two surviving sons were John, Count of Brienne, and Hugh of Brienne.\n\nFamily and betrothal\nMary was born sometime before March 1215, the eldest daughter and child of King Hugh I of Cyprus and Alice of Champagne, the daughter of Queen Isabella I of Jerusalem and Henry II, Count of Champagne. She had a younger sister, Isabelle, and a brother, Henry, who succeeded as king upon the death of their father in January 1218. In 1225, Alice married secondly Bohemond V of Antioch, after she and her sister, Philippa had long become embroiled in a bitter dispute with Blanche of Navarre over the county of Champagne, which was later known as the Champagne War of Succession.\nBefore 21 July 1229, Mary was betrothed to Peter I, Duke of Brittany, whose wife Alix of Thouars had died in 1221; however, the Pope prohibited the match due to their fourth degree consanguinity.\n\nMarriage and issue\nBy 1233, Mary married Walter IV, Count of Brienne. The marriage had been arranged by his uncle John of Brienne. From the time of her marriage, she was styled Countess of Brienne.

He was the director of the Peabody Essex Museum in Salem for 17 months, resigning December 31, 2020. He was the director of the Toledo Museum of Art in Ohio from 2010 to 2019. He was the director of the Hood Museum of Art from 2005 to 2010, and the National Gallery of Australia (Canberra) from 1997 to 2004.\n\nCareer\nBrian Kennedy currently lives and works in the United States after leaving Australia in 2005 to direct the Hood Museum of Art at Dartmouth College. In October 2010 he became the ninth Director of the Toledo Museum of Art. On 1 July 2019, he succeeded Dan Monroe as the executive director and CEO of the Peabody Essex Museum.\n\nEarly life and career in Ireland\nKennedy was born in Dublin and attended Clonkeen College. He received B.A. (1982), M.A. (1985) and PhD (1989) degrees from University College-Dublin, where he studied both art history and history.\nHe worked in the Irish Department of Education (1982), the European Commission, Brussels (1983), and in Ireland at the Chester Beatty Library (1983–85), Government Publications Office (1985–86), and Department of Finance (1986–89). He married Mary Fiona Carlin in 1988.He was Assistant Director at the National Gallery of Ireland in Dublin from 1989 to 1997. He was Chair of the Irish Association of Art Historians from 1996 to 1997, and of the Council of Australian Art Museum Directors from 2001 to 2003. In September 1997 he became Director of the National Gallery of Australia.\n\nNational Gallery of Australia (NGA)\nKennedy expanded the traveling exhibitions and loans program throughout Australia, arranged for several major shows of Australian art abroad, increased the number of exhibitions at the museum itself and oversaw the development of an extensive multi-media site.  Although he oversaw several years of the museum's highest ever annual visitation, he discontinued the emphasis of his predecessor, Betty Churcher, on showing \"blockbuster\" exhibitions.\nDuring his directorship, the NGA gained government support for improving the building and significant private donations and corporate sponsorship. However, the initial design for the building proved controversial generating a public dispute with the original architect on moral rights grounds.  As a result, the project was not delivered during Dr Kennedy's tenure, with a significantly altered design completed some years later.  Private funding supported two acquisitions of British art, including David Hockney's A Bigger Grand Canyon in 1999, and Lucian Freud's After Cézanne in 2001. Kennedy built on the established collections at the museum by acquiring the Holmgren-Spertus collection of Indonesian textiles; the Kenneth Tyler collection of editioned prints, screens, multiples and unique proofs; and the Australian Print Workshop Archive. He was also notable for campaigning for the construction of a new \"front\" entrance to the Gallery, facing King Edward Terrace, which was completed in 2010 (see reference to the building project above).\nKennedy's cancellation of the \"Sensation exhibition\" (scheduled at the NGA from 2 June 2000 to 13 August 2000) was controversial, and seen by some as censorship. He claimed that the decision was due to the exhibition being \"too close to the market\" implying that a national cultural institution cannot exhibit the private collection of a speculative art investor. However, there were other exhibitions at the NGA during his tenure, which could have raised similar concerns. The exhibition featured the privately owned Young British Artists works belonging to Charles Saatchi and attracted large attendances in London and Brooklyn. Its most controversial work was Chris Ofili's The Holy Virgin Mary, a painting which used elephant dung and was accused of being blasphemous. The then-mayor of New York, Rudolph Giuliani, campaigned against the exhibition, claiming it was \"Catholic-bashing\" and an \"aggressive, vicious, disgusting attack on religion.\" In November 1999, Kennedy cancelled the exhibition and stated that the events in New York had \"obscured discussion of the artistic merit of the works of art\". He has said that it \"was the toughest decision of my professional life, so far.\"Kennedy was also repeatedly questioned on his management of a range of issues during the Australian Government's Senate Estimates process - particularly on the NGA's occupational health and safety record and concerns about the NGA's twenty-year-old air-conditioning system.

Ever since the death of their youngest brother Alphonse \"Allie Boy\" from a drug overdose at the hands of Marco, the leader of the Vipers, a neighboring rival street gang, they fiercely keep drugs off their turf. This puts them in strong opposition to the Vipers, who want to continue to sell drugs in the neighborhood. On the eve of Marco's return from a three-year stint in prison, a gang war seems imminent, as the Deuces violently retaliate with suspicion against Vipers muscleman and bookie Philly, who ekes out a vacant nightclub to establish business down the block. Marco, along with hoping to re-establish his drug pushing enterprise, plans revenge against Leon, whom he believes ratted him out to the police for selling the killing \"hot shot\" to Alphonse.\nBobby falls for a new girl who moves in across the street, Annie, the uninvolved younger sister of Jimmy \"Pockets\", a Vipers member and heroin dealer, who takes care of their elderly dementia ailing mother. Their attraction for each other complicates the gang rivalry, especially with Leon, who mistakenly fears, feels Annie may be using Bobby. After jumping Deuces member Jackie in kind for the earlier attack, causing more gang fights in the neighborhood, Marco begins his activities again and allows the Vipers to rampage and terrorize residents across the block to establish his return for good. Later, Marco and the Vipers intimidate Bobby while on a date at the beach with Annie, before beating and raping Betsy (Leon's girlfriend) to push him over the edge.\nAfter Leon runs a car through the Viper's main hangout, neighborhood Mafioso Fritzy orders Leon and Marco to make amends; unopposed to Marco's drug dealing, knowing he can profit off of his racket and without appeal to Leon's cause to keep the neighborhood safe, Leon and Marco agree to a gang war, much to Fritzy's disappointment. Annie defends her mother from another one of Jimmy's outbursts with a kitchen knife and having enough of their troubled life in Brooklyn, wishes to run away with Bobby and her mother. As the Deuces and the Vipers meet at the docks for their confrontation, battle ensues. Marco is killed by Leon in a duel, being saved by tag-along kid Scooch, while Jimmy Pockets is shot and killed by Philly, who accuses him of stealing the gang's stash of money. Leon is shot and killed by one of Fritzy's men in retaliation for ignoring his orders.\nAt Leon's funeral, Bobby and the gang, along with his and Annie's mother, pay their last respects to Leon. In a small epilogue, Bobby explains that his mother will go to live with their uncle in Long Island, he and Annie are free to take her mother to Los Angeles to start anew, gives Scooch and Father Aldo of the nearby Catholic church part of the stolen stash of money to invest and that after the funeral, this would be the last time he would see the Deuces again, as gangs throughout Brooklyn would eventually disappear. Before leaving, Bobby drops a wheelbarrow full of cinder blocks on Fritzy's car, presumably killing him, to uphold Leon's word that \"there would be no more junk on the streets\".\n\nCast\nProduction\nThe film was shot in Los Angeles, California and New York City, New York during 2000.

Fraser (31 March 1889 – 8 April 1974) was an American film director and screenplay writer.\n\nBiography\nBorn in 1889 in San Francisco, Fraser directed over 80 films between 1925 and 1951, including the 1934 John Wayne film Randy Rides Alone and the Frank Buck 1937 cliffhanger serial Jungle Menace.  He had a small acting role in the John Wayne film 'Neath the Arizona Skies. He also wrote screenplays.\nIn his autobiography, Fraser described filming a scene in Jungle Menace in which a boa constrictor attacks the heroine Dorothy (Charlotte Henry). The villain has tied Dorothy hand and foot and she thrashes about wildly, terrified when she suddenly sees the huge snake:\n\nThe snake was in no hurry. Slowly he slithered across the girl's body, while she screamed and struggled. He turned, looking for a spot to slip under her to make his first wrap. I motioned to the reptile crew to get ready, and a split-second later gave them the signal to move in. But now, the maddened snake fought them and did its best to coil around one of the men. Before that happened, however, I had cut, and we had a good cliff-hanger with our terror-stricken heroine to close the episode.\n\nFraser, like fellow silent-film directors William Beaudine, Christy Cabanne, Elmer Clifton, and Lambert Hillyer, was a resourceful director who could be relied upon to deliver a professional-quality feature film on ever-decreasing budgets. Fraser was exceptionally adept in this regard, as both a director and scriptwriter. He became the favorite director of the Weiss Brothers, who usually worked with tight schedules and rock-bottom budgets, and padded out their features with reels of footage taken from Weiss's older films. Fraser would be assigned to work the old films into new storylines.\nFraser's efficiency was noted by the serial unit at Columbia Pictures, where he worked as a second-unit director and scriptwriter for The Spider Returns (1941), Batman (1943), and Chick Carter, Detective (1946), among other cliffhangers.\nFraser died in 1974 in Pomona, California, eight days past his 85th birthday.\n\nPartial filmography\nThe Iron Claw (1916)\nThe Mystery of the Double Cross (1917)\nBurn 'Em Up Barnes (1921)\nSky's the Limit (1925)\nWest of Mojave (1925)\nSoft Cushions (1927)\nCactus Trails (1927)\nThe Lone Defender (1930)\nWings of Adventure (1930)\nThe Montana Kid (1931)\nLand of Wanted Men (1931)\nThe Savage Girl (1932)\nThe Man from Arizona (1932)\nWithout Honor (1932)\nBorder Devils (1932)\nGhost City (1932)\nMason of the Mounted (1932)\nLaw of the North (1932)\nVanishing Men (1932)\nHonor of the Mounted (1932)\nThe Night Rider (1932)\nBroadway to Cheyenne (1932)\nBreed of the Border (1933)\nThe Fugitive (1933)\nThe Wolf Dog (1933)\nDiamond Trail (1933)\nThe Fighting Parson (1933)\nThe Return of Casey Jones (1933)\nThe Gallant Fool (1933)\nGalloping Romeo (1933)\nRandy Rides Alone (1934)\nFighting Through (1934)\n'Neath the Arizona Skies (1934)\nSocial Error (1935)\nThe Tonto Kid (1935)\nWagon Trail (1935)\nFive Bad Men (1935)\nRustler's Paradise (1935)\nGhost Town  (1936)\nHair-Trigger Casey (1936)\nAces Wild (1936)\nHeroes of the Alamo (1937)\nJungle Menace (1937)\nSpirit of Youth (1938)\nSongs and Saddles (1938)\nLure of the Wasteland (1939)\nThe Spider Returns (1941)\nThe Old Chisholm Trail (1942)\nThe Valley of Vanishing Men (1942)\nTenting Tonight on the Old Camp Ground (1943)\nBatman (1943 serial)\nCaptain America (1944 serial)\nBrand of the Devil (1944)\nGunsmoke Mesa (1944)\nI Accuse My Parents (1944)\nThe Whispering Skull (1944)\nEnemy of the Law (1945)\nThe White Gorilla (1945)\nFlaming Bullets (1945)\nNavajo Kid (1945)\nSix Gun Man (1946)\nChick Carter, Detective (1946)\nSon of the Guardsman (1946)\nTex Granger (1948)\nChained for Life (1951)\n Dead or Alive (1951)\nAbilene Trail (1951)", "answers": ["Cavalcade Of The West"], "length": 4759, "dataset": "2wikimqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "569f8b123108053ea946f9efffbe0406abcfd288b5b13bf2"}

AD 40–69) was a Roman general best known as the commander who defeated the rebellion of Boudica.\n\nEarly life\nLittle is known of Suetonius' family, but it likely came from Pisaurum (modern Pesaro), a town on the Adriatic coast of Italy. He is not known to be related to the biographer Suetonius.\n\nMauretanian campaign\nHaving served as praetor in 40 AD, Suetonius was appointed governor of Mauretania the following year. In collaboration with Gnaeus Hosidius Geta, he suppressed the revolt led by Aedemon in the mountainous province that arose from the execution of the local ruler by Caligula. In 41 AD Suetonius was the first Roman commander to lead troops across the Atlas Mountains, and Pliny the Elder quotes his description of the area in his Natural History.\n\nGovernor of Britain\nIn 58, before being consul, he was appointed governor of Britain, replacing Quintus Veranius, who had died in office. He continued Veranius's policy of aggressively subduing the tribes of modern Wales, and was successful for his first two years in the post. His reputation as a general came to rival that of Gnaeus Domitius Corbulo. Two future governors served under him: Quintus Petillius Cerialis as legate of Legio IX Hispana, and Gnaeus Julius Agricola as a military tribune attached to II Augusta, but seconded to Suetonius's staff.\nIn 60 or 61 Suetonius made an assault on the island of Mona (Anglesey), a refuge for British fugitives and a stronghold of the druids. The tribes of the south-east took advantage of his absence and staged a revolt, led by queen Boudica of the Iceni. The colonia of Camulodunum (Colchester) was destroyed, its inhabitants tortured, raped, and slaughtered, and Petillius Cerialis's legion routed. Suetonius brought Mona to terms and marched along the Roman road of Watling Street to Londinium (London), the rebels' next target, but judged he did not have the numbers to defend the city and ordered it evacuated. The Britons duly destroyed it, the citizens of Londinium suffering the same fate as those of Camulodunum, and then did the same to Verulamium (St Albans).Suetonius regrouped with the XIV Gemina, some detachments of the XX Valeria Victrix, and all available auxiliaries. The II Augusta, based at Exeter, was available, but its prefect, Poenius Postumus, declined to heed the call. Nonetheless, Suetonius was able to assemble a force of about ten thousand men. Heavily outnumbered (the Britons numbered 230,000 according to Cassius Dio), the Romans stood their ground. The resulting battle took place at an unidentified location in a defile with a wood behind him, probably in the West Midlands somewhere along Watling Street – at Cuttle Mill, 2 miles southeast of Towcester in Northamptonshire, in front of a narrow defile which answers the topographical description of Tacitus, human bones have been found over a large area; High Cross in Leicestershire and Manduessedum near the modern day town of Atherstone in Warwickshire have also been suggested - where Roman tactics and discipline triumphed over British numbers. The Britons' flight was impeded by the presence of their own families, whom they had stationed in a ring of wagons at the edge of the battlefield, and defeat turned into slaughter. Tacitus heard reports that almost eighty thousand Britons were killed, compared to only four hundred Romans. Boudica poisoned herself, and Postumus, having denied his men a share in the victory, fell on his sword.Suetonius reinforced his army with legionaries and auxiliaries from Germania and conducted punitive operations against any remaining pockets of resistance, but this proved counterproductive. The new procurator, Gaius Julius Alpinus Classicianus, expressed concern to the Emperor Nero that Suetonius's activities would only lead to continued hostilities. An inquiry was set up under Nero's freedman, Polyclitus, and an excuse, that Suetonius had lost some ships, was found to relieve him of his command. He was replaced by the more conciliatory Publius Petronius Turpilianus. But Suetonius was not disgraced: a lead tessera found in Rome features both his and Nero's names and symbols of victory, and a man named Gaius Suetonius Paulinus was consul in 66, either a son of the same name  or the general himself appointed for a second time.\n\nYear of Four Emperors\nIn 69, during the year of civil wars that followed the death of Nero (see Year of Four Emperors), he was one of Otho's senior generals and military advisors. He and Aulus Marius Celsus defeated Aulus Caecina Alienus, one of Vitellius's generals, near Cremona, but Suetonius would not allow his men to follow up their advantage and was accused of treachery as a result. When Caecina joined his forces with those of Fabius Valens, Suetonius advised Otho not to risk a battle but was overruled, leading to Otho's decisive defeat at Bedriacum. Suetonius was captured by Vitellius and obtained a pardon by claiming that he had deliberately lost the battle for Otho, although this was almost certainly untrue. His eventual fate remains unknown.\n\nNotes\nPassage 4:\nThe Rebellion of the Brides\nThe Rebellion of the Brides (Uzbek: Келинлар қўзғолони, romanized: Kelinlar qoʻzgʻoloni; Russian: Бунт невесток) is a 1984 Uzbek comedy film based on an eponymous play by the Uzbek writer Said Ahmad and directed by Melis Abzalov. Kelinlar qoʻzgvoloni is one of the most critically acclaimed Uzbek films of the Soviet period. Like Melis Abzalov's previous film Suyunchi, Kelinlar qoʻzgʻoloni tells the story of an authoritative grandmother.\n\nPlot\nFarmon bibi (played by Tursunoy Jaʼfarova) is a wise and loving, but strict mother who lives with the families of her seven sons in one house. Nigora, the wife of her youngest son, rebels against Farmon Bibi and the other wives sympathize with her. In one scene, the mother and her daughters-in-law go to the bazaar. Toward the end of the film, Farmon bibi changes her attitude and gives in to the demands of her daughters-in-law.\nPassage 5:\nLe Masque de la Méduse\nLe masque de la Méduse (English: The Mask of Medusa) is a 2009 fantasy horror film directed by Jean Rollin. The film is a modern-day telling of the Greek mythological tale of the Gorgon and was inspired by the 1964 classic Hammer Horror film of the same name and the 1981 cult classic Clash of the Titans. It was Rollin's final film, as the director died in 2010.\n\nCast\nSimone Rollin as la Méduse\nSabine Lenoël as Euryale\nMarlène Delcambre as Sthéno\nJuliette Moreau as Juliette\nDelphine Montoban as Cornelius\nJean-Pierre Bouyxou as le gardien\nBernard Charnacé as le collectionneur\nAgnès Pierron as la colleuse d'affiche au Grand-Guignol\nGabrielle Rollin as la petite contrebassiste\nJean Rollin as l'homme qui enterre la tête\nThomas Smith as Thomas\n\nProduction\nIt was thought that Rollin's 2007 film La nuit des horloges was the final film of his career, as he had mentioned in the past. However, in 2009, Rollin began preparation foe Le masque de la Méduse. Rollin originally directed the film as a one-hour short, which was screened at the Cinémathèque de Toulouse, but after the release, Rollin decided to add 20 minutes of additional scenes and then cut the film into two distinct parts, as he did with his first feature, Le Viol du Vampire.  The film was shot on location at the Golden Gate Aquarium and Père Lachaise Cemetery, as well as on stage at the Theatre du Grande Guignol, which is where the longest part of the film takes place. It was shot on HD video on a low budget of €150,000. Before the release, it was transferred to 35mm film.\n\nRelease\nThe film was not released theatrically, although it premiered on 19 November 2009 at the 11th edition of the Extreme Cinema Film Festival at the Cinémathèque de Toulouse. As part of \"An Evening with Jean Rollin\", it was shown as a double feature with Rollin's 2007 film La nuit des horloges.\n\nHome media\nNo official DVD was released, although for a limited time, a DVD of La masque de la Méduse was included with the first 150 copies of Rollin's book Jean Rollin: Écrits complets Volume 1.\nPassage 6:\nCharles Canning, 1st Earl Canning\nCharles  Canning, 1st Earl Canning,  (14 December 1812 – 17 June 1862), also known as The Viscount Canning and  Clemency Canning, was a British statesman and Governor-General of India during the Indian Rebellion of 1857 and the first Viceroy of India after the transfer of power from the East India Company to the Crown of Queen Victoria in 1858 after the rebellion was crushed.Canning is credited for ensuring that the administration and most departments of the government functioned normally during the  rebellion and took major administrative decisions even during the peak of the Rebellion in 1857, including establishing the first three modern Universities in India, the University of Calcutta, University of Madras and University of Bombay based on Wood's despatch. Canning passed the Hindu Widows' Remarriage Act, 1856 which was drafted by his predecessor  Lord Dalhousie before the rebellion. He also passed the General Service Enlistment Act of 1856.After the rebellion he presided over a smooth transfer and reorganisation of government from the East India company to the crown,  the Indian Penal Code was drafted in 1860 based on the code drafted by Macaulay and came into force in 1862. Canning met the rebellion '\"with firmness, confidence, magnanimity and calm\" as per his biographer. Canning was very firm during the rebellion but after that he focused on reconciliation and reconstruction rather than retribution and issued a clemency proclamation.\n\nBackground\nBorn at Gloucester Lodge, Brompton, near London, Canning was the youngest child of George Canning and Joan, Viscountess Canning, daughter of Major-General John Scott, his father was Prime Minister for a few months in 1827. He was educated at Christ Church, Oxford, where he graduated B.A. in 1833, as first class in classics and second class in mathematics.\n\nPolitical career\nIn 1836 he entered Parliament, being returned as member for the town of Warwick in the Conservative interest. He did not, however, sit long in the House of Commons; for, on the death of his mother in 1837, he succeeded to the peerage and entered the House of Lords. His first official appointment was that of Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, in the administration formed by Sir Robert Peel in 1841, his chief being the Earl of Aberdeen. This post he held till January 1846; and from January to July of that year, when the Peel administration was broken up, Lord Canning filled the post of First Commissioner of Woods and Forests.\nHe served on the Royal Commission on the British Museum (1847–49). He declined to accept office under the Earl of Derby; but on the formation of the coalition ministry under the Earl of Aberdeen in January 1853, he received the appointment of Postmaster General. In this office, he showed not only a large capacity for hard work but also general administrative ability and much zeal for the improvement of the service. He retained his post under Lord Palmerston's ministry until July 1855, when, in consequence of the departure of Lord Dalhousie and a vacancy in the governor-generalship of India, he was selected by Lord Palmerston to succeed to that great position. This appointment appears to have been made rather on the ground of his father's great services than from any proof as yet given of special personal fitness on the part of Lord Canning. The new governor sailed from England in December 1855 and entered upon the duties of his office in India at the close of February 1856.According to the Encyclopædia Britannica of 1911, \"In the year following his accession to office, the deep-seated discontent of the people broke out in the Indian Rebellion of 1857. Fears were entertained, and even the friends of the Governor-General to some extent shared them, that he was not equal to the crisis. But the fears proved groundless. He had a clear eye for the gravity of the situation, a calm judgment, and a prompt, swift hand to do what was really necessary. ... He carried the Indian empire safely through the stress of the storm, and, what was perhaps a harder task still, he dealt wisely with the enormous difficulties arising at the close of such a war. ... The name of Clemency Canning, which was applied to him during the heated animosities of the moment, has since become a title of honour.\" He was derisively called \"Clemency\" on account of a Resolution dated 31 July 1857, which distinguished between sepoys from regiments which had mutinied and killed their officers and European civilians, and those Indian soldiers who had disbanded and dispersed to their villages, without being involved in violence. While subsequently regarded as a humane and sensible measure, the Resolution made Canning unpopular at a time when British popular opinion favoured collective and indiscriminate reprisals.\n\nThe Encyclopædia Britannica of 1911 continues, \"While rebellion was raging in Oudh he issued a proclamation declaring the lands of the province forfeited, and this step gave rise to much angry controversy. A secret despatch, couched in arrogant and offensive terms, was addressed to Canning by Lord Ellenborough, then a member of the Derby administration, which would have justified the Governor-General in immediately resigning. But from a strong sense of duty, he continued at his post, and ere long the general condemnation of the despatch was so strong that the writer felt it necessary to retire from office. Lord Canning replied to the despatch, calmly and in a statesman-like manner explaining and vindicating his censured policy\" and in 1858 he was rewarded by being made the first Viceroy of India.\nThe Encyclopædia Britannica of 1911 adds, \"In April 1859 he received the thanks of both Houses of Parliament for his great services during the rebellion. He was also made an extra civil grand cross of the Order of the Bath, and in May of the same year he was raised to the dignity of an Earl, as Earl Canning. ...By the strain of anxiety and hard work his health and strength were seriously impaired, while the death of his wife was also a great shock to him; in the hope that rest in his native land might restore him, he left India, reaching England in April 1862. But it was too late. He died in London on 17 June. About a month before his death he was created a Knight of the Garter. As he died without issue the titles became extinct.\"Prior to the rebellion, Canning and his wife, Charlotte, had desired to produce a photographic survey of Indian people, primarily for their own edification. This project was transformed into an official government study as a consequence of the rebellion, after which it was seen as useful documentation in the effort to learn more about native communities and thereby better understand them. It was eventually published as an eight-volume work, The People of India, between 1868 and 1875.\n\nPlaces named after Canning\nCanning Town in London\nFort Canning Hill, a hill in Singapore, is named after Viscount Charles Canning, although many people mistakenly believe that it is named after his father, George Canning\nCanning Street in Kemptown, Brighton is named after Viscount Canning\nCannington, a neighbourhood in Prayagraj (Allahabad), Uttar Pradesh, India, now known as Civil Lines\nCanning, South 24 Parganas in West Bengal, India\nUniversity of Lucknow, India, was formerly named Canning College\n\nSee also\nCharlotte Canning, Countess Canning\nCanning in West Bengal\nPassage 7:\nSam Newfield\nSam Newfield, born Samuel Neufeld (December 6, 1899 – November 10, 1964), also known as Sherman Scott or Peter Stewart, was an American B-movie director, one of the most prolific in American film history—he is credited with directing over 250 feature films in a career which began during the silent era and ended in 1958. In addition to his staggering feature output, he also directed one -and two-reel comedy shorts, training films, industrial films, TV episodes and pretty much anything anyone would pay him for. Because of this massive output—he would sometimes direct more than 20 films in a single year—he has been called the most prolific director of the sound era.Many of Newfield's films were made for PRC Pictures. This was a film production company headed by his brother Sigmund Neufeld. The films PRC produced were low-budget productions, the majority being westerns, with an occasional horror film or crime drama.\n\nFamily and education\nNewfield completed one year of high school, according to the 1940 US census. Brother Morris Neufeld was a stage actor, according to the 1930 US census.\n\nPseudonyms\nSam Newfield was credited as Sherman Scott and Peter Stewart on a number of films he made for PRC. He used these names in order to hide the fact that one person was responsible for so many of PRC's films.\n\nPartial filmography\nPartial filmography is listed below for the different names he used.\n\nFilm statistics\nBetween 1923 and 1930 Newfield directed over 50 comedies.

Following the collapse of the rebellion, he and a group of survivors established a base in Killaughrim Woods, north County Wexford from where they launched raids in the area and into County Carlow. In August 1801, an upsurge in Corcoran's activities saw him and his men being declared \"dangerous in case of invasion\" by Dublin Castle and consequently, a force of 200 soldiers was sent to find and destroy the group. However, they met with little success as the populace shielded them from the military.\nCorcoran's men were distinguished by their willingness to allow deserters from the military in their ranks and actively sought to subvert soldiers billeted among the populace or at least rob them of their arms. Their fearlessness was demonstrated in an incident near Mount Leinster in June 1802 when they turned to attack a number of pursuing Newtownbarry yeomen who were defeated and soon under pursuit themselves.\nThe defeat of Robert Emmet's rising in July 1803, saw renewed British intent to wipe out all remaining rebel activity in Ireland and a new campaign was launched against Corcoran. This time account was taken of the fact that Corcoran's men enjoyed support from the population in areas where they operated and also that their permanent bases were in remote localities. Consequently, arrests and severe penalties were handed out to those suspected of harbouring rebels, and the building of military roads and barrack were planned to cover the area between Mount Leinster and the Blackstair mountains.\n\nDefeat and death\nThe surrender of Michael Dwyer in December 1803 left Corcoran and his men as the only rebel faction still active in Ireland as 1804 began. The ongoing military offensive had by now forced Corcoran to relocate to south Kilkenny from where he continued operations and further incensed the government by targeting mail coaches. A reward of £500 was put on Corcoran's head and the pressure soon forced him to split his group into smaller factions and return to his old base at Killaughrim Woods outside Enniscorthy. The end finally came on 11 February 1804 when the reward offered prompted an informer to betray the location of Corcoran and his remaining few comrades who were surrounded by a party of yeomen at Killaughrim Woods. After fierce resistance all of the unit were killed or captured, Corcoran dying of his wounds shortly after the fighting. His body and that of his comrades were brought to Wexford where they were hung outside the town gaol and left on display for a time.\n\nSources\nRuan O'Donnell -  \"The Rebellion in Wicklow 1798\"   (1998) ISBN 0-7165-2659-X\nRuan O'Donnell -  \"Aftermath: Post-Rebellion Insurgency in Wicklow, 1799-1803\"   (2000) ISBN 0-7165-2638-7\nPassage 10:\nGang Busters (serial)\nGang Busters is a 1942 Universal movie serial based on the radio series Gang Busters.\n\nPlot\nThe city is terrorized by a crime wave masterminded by the elusive, soft-spoken Professor Mortis (Ralph Morgan) from his base in a forgotten cavern beneath the rails of the city's subway line. He declares over the radio that The League of Murdered Men will exact revenge upon the city unless all the city officials, especially the mayor and Chief of Police, are turned out of office. Mortis's gang members were officially pronounced dead in prison after having supposedly committed suicide (in reality taking a drug that suspended animation) but later revived by medical genius Mortis, who recruited them to do his bidding.\nPolice detective Bill Bannister (Kent Taylor), in charge of investigating the crime wave, is visited by his brother, a reformed criminal who will inform on Mortis. Mortis's men kill Bannister's brother before he talks, and Bannister vows to get Mortis. Together with his partner Tim Nolan (Robert Armstrong) and police chief Martin O'Brien (Joseph Crehan), Bannister uses the latest police methods to track down Mortis.

The directors were Ray Taylor, veteran director responsible for many hit serials, and Noel M. Smith, former silent-screen director who specialized in fast action (Smith directed many of Larry Semon's stunt-filled comedies of the 1920s). Some of the footage in Gang Busters was so good that Universal often reused it in its later cliffhangers.\nUniversal had been making adventure serials since the 1910s, and achieved major success with its Flash Gordon serials of the late 1930s. By the early 1940s, serials were usually shown to juvenile audiences at weekend matinees. Universal intended Gang Busters for adult audiences and possible weeknight showings, and staged the action as a straight crime drama. The studio introduced a new \"Streamlined Serials\" format to distinguish it from its previous chapter plays. Instead of beginning each chapter with a printed synopsis of the storyline, the new format had the action in each chapter starting immediately. The story characters were shown discussing the latest developments and recapping the story themselves.\nAs a publicity gimmick, Universal hired its \"serial queen\" of the 1910s, former action star Grace Cunard, to work in Gang Busters. She appears only in the first chapter, as the landlady of a boarding house, but she received prominent billing in the promotional posters and advertising.\n\nCritical reception\nGang Busters was very successful in its original release, and was re-released in 1949 by Film Classics, Inc.\nAuthors Jim Harmon and Donald F. Glut described Gang Busters as a \"well made and interesting serial.\", and William C. Cline considered the serial one of Universal's best and that Professor Mortis is one of the best characters ever created for a serial.\n\nChapter titles\nThe League of Murdered Men\nThe Death Plunge\nMurder Blockade\nHangman's Noose\nMan Undercover\nUnder Crumbling Walls\nThe Water Trap\nMurder by Proxy\nGang Bait\nMob Vengeance\nWanted at Headquarters\nThe Long Chance\nLaw and OrderSource:\n\nSee also\nList of film serials by year\nList of film serials by studio", "answers": ["The Rebellion Of The Brides"], "length": 4961, "dataset": "2wikimqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "47659268bc430f7e640db930b97fed4d0670cce46cdb83f8"}

Her mother died when she was seven and her father left court.\n\nClaim to the throne\nAccording to the will of Henry VIII, Margaret was in line to inherit the throne of England. Upon the death of her mother, Margaret became seventh in line. However, both her cousins Lady Jane Grey and Lady Mary Grey died without issue, and their sister, her other cousin, Lady Catherine Grey, died without the legitimacy of her two sons ever being proven (this was later established but only after the death of Elizabeth I). Margaret quickly moved up to becoming the first in line to the throne but died prior to the death of Elizabeth I.\n\nMarriage and family\nIn 1552, John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland suggested a marriage of his youngest son Guildford to Margaret, yet, although the proposal had the warm support of Edward VI, her father was against it. A year later, in June 1553, the Imperial ambassador Jehan Scheyfve reported that Northumberland's brother Andrew Dudley would marry Margaret. The Dudleys were imprisoned when Mary I gained the throne.\nMargaret joined Mary's court and married Henry Stanley, 4th Earl of Derby on 7 February 1555 in the Chapel Royal at Whitehall Palace. They had something of a stormy relationship. Margaret wrote that there were several \"breaches and reconciliations\", but that her husband finally left her leaving serious debt. In 1567, Lady Le Strange petitioned the Queen's advisor, William Cecil, for a financial settlement from her estranged husband.With whom she had at least four children:\nEdward Stanley. Died young.\nFerdinando Stanley, 5th Earl of Derby (c. 1559 – 16 April 1594).\nWilliam Stanley, 6th Earl of Derby (c. 1561 – 29 September 1642).\nFrancis Stanley (b. 1562). Died young.She later married Thomas Fitzwilliam Le Strange, and in 1563 gave birth to a daughter Frances Jenison (née Le Strange) and possibly several other children.\n\nDisgrace and death\nIn 1579, Margaret was arrested after she had been heard discussing a proposed marriage of Queen Elizabeth to the Duke d'Alençon. She was opposed to it as it threatened her own possible accession to the crown. She was then accused of using sorcery to predict when Elizabeth would die, and even of planning to poison Elizabeth.Simply predicting the death of a monarch was a capital offence at the time. The countess was put under house arrest. She wrote to Francis Walsingham insisting on her innocence. She claimed that the accused sorcerer, William Randall, was in fact her physician, who was staying with her because he could cure \"sickness and weakness in my body\". Randall was subsequently executed. No charges were brought against the countess, but she was banished from court. She wrote repeatedly to the queen complaining that she was in a \"black dungeon of sorrow and despair....overwhelmed with heaviness through the loss of your majesty's favour and gracious countenance.\" She continued to be plagued by demands from creditors.Margaret died in 1596 without having recovered royal favour, and having outlived her eldest son, Ferdinando. Her granddaughter, Lady Anne Stanley, Ferdinando's oldest daughter, inherited her claim. Elizabeth I was eventually succeeded by the genealogically senior claimant, James VI of Scotland.\n\nPortrait\nThere is a discrepancy as to who the sitter is in the Hans Eworth portrait which is featured. The coat of arms in the top left corner, which may have been added later, are the impaled arms (those of a husband and wife) of Henry Clifford, 2nd Earl of Cumberland, and his wife Lady Eleanor, daughter of Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk, and Mary Tudor, Dowager Queen of France. As a result, the painting has been frequently exhibited in the past as a portrait of Lady Eleanor, regardless of the fact that she died in 1547, well before the date of this portrait. It is, however, a rule of heraldry that impaled arms are not used by the children of a marriage, as they would have their own. Hence the later addition and erroneous use of the arms here suggests that the identity of the portrait was already unclear only two or three generations after it was painted, a situation by no means unusual amid the frequent early deaths, multiple marriages, and shifting alliances and fortunes of the most powerful families of the Tudor era. Later the portrait was thought to represent the only child of Eleanor and Henry to survive infancy, Margaret. The inscription on the right which might have provided a check (Margaret would have been aged 25–28 at the time of this portrait) has been truncated; although the Roman numerals of the year can apply only to 1565–8, the age of the sitter cannot be ascertained with any useful accuracy.\nThe National Portrait Gallery has an online sketch of this portrait identified as Lady Eleanor, but the portrait remains in dispute.\nPassage 2:\nHenry Clifford, 2nd Earl of Cumberland\nHenry Clifford, 2nd Earl of Cumberland (1517 – January 1570) was a member of the Clifford family, seated at Skipton Castle from 1310 to 1676. His wife was Lady Eleanor Brandon, a niece of King Henry VIII.\n\nOrigins\nHenry was a son of Henry Clifford, 1st Earl of Cumberland, by his wife, Margaret Percy, daughter of Henry Algernon Percy, 5th Earl of Northumberland, and Catherine Spencer.\n\nAncestry\nHis maternal great-grandfather was Henry Percy, 4th Earl of Northumberland, whose wife was Maud Herbert, Countess of Northumberland. His maternal grandmother was a daughter of Sir Robert Spencer and Eleanor Beaufort. Eleanor was a daughter of Edmund Beaufort, 2nd Duke of Somerset, and Eleanor Beauchamp. She was a granddaughter of Richard de Beauchamp, 13th Earl of Warwick, and Elizabeth Berkeley. He served as hereditary High Sheriff of Westmorland.\n\nMarriages and progeny\nHenry Clifford married twice.\nFirstly, before June 1537, Henry married Lady Eleanor Brandon (she was his fourth-cousin through his mother's side), the second daughter of Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk, by his third wife, Mary Tudor, former Queen Consort of France. According to the Third Succession Act of 23 March 1544, Lady Eleanor Brandon was the seventh-in-line to the throne of the Kingdom of England. With her death, her daughter, Lady Margaret Clifford, took her place in the line of succession. The expenses of this alliance seriously impoverished Henry's estate and obliged him to alienate the great manor of Temedbury, Herefordshire, the oldest estate then remaining in the family. Eleanor was a younger sister of Henry Brandon (who died very young) and Lady Frances Brandon, and an older sister of Henry Brandon, 1st Earl of Lincoln (named after their dead brother). Her paternal grandparents were Sir William Brandon and Elizabeth Bruyn. Her maternal grandparents were King Henry VII of England and his queen consort, Elizabeth of York.  Following her death in 1547, Henry retired to the country and concentrated on increasing his paternal inheritance, and is said to have visited the court only thrice: at the coronation of Queen Mary I, on his daughter's marriage, and again soon after the accession of Queen Elizabeth I. By his wife Eleanor Brandon, Henry had three children:\n\nLady Margaret Clifford (1540 – 29 September 1596), wife of Henry Stanley, 4th Earl of Derby.\nHenry Clifford, died an infant.\nCharles Clifford, died an infant.Secondly, Henry married Anne Dacre (c. 1521 – July 1581), the daughter of William Dacre, 3rd Baron Dacre, and Lady Elizabeth Talbot, daughter of George Talbot, 4th Earl of Shrewsbury, and Anne Hastings. Anne Hastings was a daughter of William Hastings, 1st Baron Hastings, and Lady Katherine Neville. Lady Katherine Neville was a daughter of Richard Neville, 5th Earl of Salisbury, and Alice Montacute, 5th Countess of Salisbury. By Anne Dacre, Henry had at least three children:\n\nGeorge Clifford, 3rd Earl of Cumberland (8 August 1558 – 30 October 1605)\nFrancis Clifford, 4th Earl of Cumberland (1559–1641)\nLady Frances Clifford (d. 1592), wife of Philip Wharton, 3rd Baron Wharton.\n\nCareer\nIn July 1561 Henry and Lord Dacre, his father-in-law, were accused of protecting the popish priests in the north. A similar charge was advanced in February 1562. He was in 1569 strongly opposed to the contemplated marriage of Mary Queen of Scots and Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk, and readily promised support to the great rebellion of that year. In May 1569 he was in London. As the year wore on he gave in his adherence to the scheme for proclaiming Mary queen of England; but when the critical moment arrived he did not act with vigour, but as a 'crazed man, leaving his tenants to the leadership of Leonard Dacres'. He assisted Lord Scrope in fortifying Carlisle against the rebels. Henry is described by his daughter as having 'a good library,' being 'studious in all manner of learning, and much given to alchemy.'\n\nDeath and burial\nHe died shortly after 8 January 1569–70, at Brougham Castle, and was buried at Skipton Castle.\nPassage 3:\nHenry Clifford, 5th Earl of Cumberland\nHenry Clifford, 5th Earl of Cumberland (28 February 1592 – 11 December 1643) was an English landowner and politician who sat in the House of Commons between 1614 and 1622. He was created a baron in 1628 and succeeded to the title Earl of Cumberland in 1641.\nClifford was the son of Francis Clifford, 4th Earl of Cumberland, and Grisold Hughes and a member of the Clifford family which held the seat of Skipton from 1310 to 1676. He was educated at Christ Church, Oxford. In 1607, he became joint Lord Lieutenant of Cumberland, Northumberland and Westmorland. He was elected Member of Parliament for Westmorland in 1614, and was returned in 1621. In 1621, he became Custos Rotulorum of Westmorland. He was created Baron Clifford in 1628.\nClifford was a supporter of Charles I during the so-called Bishops' Wars in Scotland, and also during the Civil War until his death. He succeeded to the title of Earl of Cumberland in 1641 and died two years later in 1643 at the age of 52; as he left no sons the earldom became extinct.Clifford married Lady Frances Cecil (1593 – 14 February 1644), daughter of Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury and Elizabeth Brooke on 25 July, 1610, at St Mary Abbots Church, Kensington. They had one child: Lady Elizabeth Clifford who married Richard Boyle, 1st Earl of Burlington.\nPassage 4:\nEleanor Brandon, Countess of Cumberland\nEleanor Clifford, Countess of Cumberland (née Lady Eleanor Brandon; 1519 – 27 September 1547) was the third child and second daughter of Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk and Princess Mary Tudor, the Dowager Queen consort of France. She was a younger sister of Lady Frances Brandon and an elder sister of Henry Brandon, 1st Earl of Lincoln. She was also a younger paternal half-sister of Lady Anne Brandon and Lady Mary Brandon from her father's second marriage. After her mother's death in 1533, her father remarried to Catherine Willoughby and Eleanor became an elder half-sister of Henry Brandon, 2nd Duke of Suffolk and Charles Brandon, 3rd Duke of Suffolk.\nHer paternal grandparents were Sir William Brandon and Elizabeth Bruyn. Her maternal grandparents were Henry VII of England and his queen consort Elizabeth of York. She was thus a niece of Henry VIII.\n\nCountess of Cumberland\nLady Eleanor was a descendant of a member of the Tudor dynasty and therefore her marriage would advance the political ambitions of any given husband. In March 1533, a marriage contract was written up for Lady Eleanor and Henry Clifford, the eldest son and heir of Henry Clifford, 1st Earl of Cumberland by Lady Margaret Percy. However, since her mother died nine months later, she waited to go and live with her young husband and in-laws. In anticipation of Eleanor's arrival, the Earl of Cumberland built two towers and the great gallery within Skipton Castle. Eleanor married Clifford in June 1535; her uncle King Henry VIII was present.In January 1536, Eleanor was designated the chief mourner for the funeral service of Catherine of Aragon, first Queen consort of Henry VIII, at Peterborough Cathedral.There is not much known about her later life and she left only one letter:\n\n\"Dear heart, After my most hearty commendations, this shall be to certify you that since your departure from me I have been very sick and at this present my water is very red, whereby I suppose I have the jaundice and the ague both, for I have none abide [no appetite for] meat and I have such pains in my side and towards my back as I had at Brougham, where it began with me first.

The National Portrait Gallery has an online sketch of this portrait identified as Lady Eleanor, but the portrait remains in dispute. There is, however, a portrait of Lady Eleanor featured at Skipton Castle. It is reportedly a very poor work of art, but nonetheless interesting.\nPassage 5:\nMargaret Clifford, Countess of Cumberland\nMargaret Clifford (née Russell), Countess of Cumberland (7 July 1560 – 24 May 1616) was an English noblewoman and maid of honor to Elizabeth I. Lady Margaret was born in Exeter, England to Francis Russell, 2nd Earl of Bedford and Margaret St John.\nOn 24 June 1577 she married George Clifford, 3rd Earl of Cumberland the son of Henry Clifford, 2nd Earl of Cumberland and Anne Dacre. Her sister, Anne Russell, Countess of Warwick, was married to Ambrose Dudley, brother of Robert Dudley, the Earl of Leicester, and Anne too was a great literary patron and a close friend to Queen Elizabeth I, attending her on her death bed.\nIn 1603 she travelled from London with her daughter Lady Anne Clifford and the Countess of Warwick to join others greeting Anne of Denmark and Prince Henry at Dingley, the house of Thomas Griffin on 24 June. Afterwards they rode with Anne Vavasour (later Lady Warburton) through Coventry to see Princess Elizabeth at Coombe Abbey. At this time her husband was not maintaining her, and she wrote to Sir Robert Cecil asking for his intervention so that she could buy suitable clothes to \"furnish her self\" to attend the new queen. The royal couple were entertained at Grafton Regis by her husband. Although the Countess was present, according to her daughter, she was marginalised, \"not held as mistress of the house\".She was a patron of the poet Emilia Lanier.In 1593, Lady Margaret Russell founded Beamsley Hospital, an almshouse for local widows. \nShe was interested in physic and alchemy, and had an alchemical recipe book compiled for her.She died at Brougham Castle, on 24 May 1616.The tomb of the Countess is at St Lawrence's Church, Appleby along with that of her daughter, Lady Anne Clifford. Lady Anne Clifford built the Countess Pillar to commemorate her.\n\nChildren\nFrancis Clifford (1584 – 8 December 1589)\nRobert Clifford (21 September 1585 – 24 May 1591)\nLady Anne Clifford (30 January 1590 – 22 March 1676), who married Richard Sackville, 3rd Earl of Dorset, and secondly Philip Herbert, 4th Earl of Pembroke\nLady Margaret Clifford (29 March 1594 - 4 February 1647)\nPassage 6:\nThomas Bruce, 2nd Earl of Ailesbury\nThomas Bruce, 2nd Earl of Ailesbury (later styled Aylesbury) and 3rd Earl of Elgin (1656 – 16 December 1741), styled Lord Bruce between 1663 and 1685, was an English politician and memoirist. He was the son of Robert Bruce, 2nd Earl of Elgin, and Lady Diana Grey. His maternal grandparents were Henry Grey, 1st Earl of Stamford, and Lady Anne Cecil, daughter of William Cecil, 2nd Earl of Exeter. His Memoirs, which were not published until long after his death, are a valuable source for English history in the last quarter of the seventeenth century.\n\nEarly life\nLord Bruce was elected member of parliament for Marlborough between 1679 and 1681, and for Wiltshire in 1685. He became a Gentleman of the Bedchamber in 1676. From 1685, when he inherited the earldom, to 1688, he was a Lord of the Bedchamber, Lord Lieutenant of Bedfordshire and Huntingdonshire (the latter in the absence of the Earl of Sandwich) and was a Page of Honour, at the coronation of King James II on 23 April 1685. He was devoted to Charles II, who remarked on his deathbed \"I see you love me dying as well as living\"; Bruce wrote later of Charles' death that \"Thus ended my happy days at a Court, and to this hour I bewail my loss\". He also admired Charles's brother and successor James II, though he was not blind to his faults as a ruler.\n\nFamily\nHe married, firstly, Lady Elizabeth Seymour, daughter of Henry Seymour, Lord Beauchamp and Mary Capell and granddaughter of William Seymour, 2nd Duke of Somerset, on 31 August 1676. She died in 1697 in premature childbirth, apparently brought on by a false report that her husband had been executed for treason. They had three children:\n\nRobert Bruce, Lord Bruce (1679–1685)\nCharles Bruce, 4th Earl of Elgin (1682–1747)\nLady Elizabeth Bruce (1689–1745), married George Brudenell, 3rd Earl of Cardigan and had issue.He married, secondly, Charlotte d'Argenteau, comtesse d'Esneux, in Brussels (St Jacques sur Coudenberg) on 27 April 1700. They had one daughter:\n\nLady Marie Thérèse Bruce (1704–1736), married Prince Maximilian Emmanuel of Hornes and had issue.\n\nLater life\nHe was one of only four peers who continued to support James II after the Prince of Orange embarked for England. On 18 December 1688 he accompanied King James to Rochester when he fled London. Elgin himself chose to remain in England; he was prepared in the short term to offer his support to the new regime, although his loyalty to it was always deeply suspect.\n\nIn May 1695, Lord Elgin was accused, almost certainly with good reason, of having conspired to plan the restoration of King James II and in February 1696 he was imprisoned in the Tower of London, but admitted to bail a year later and allowed to leave England for Brussels. After more than 40 years in exile, he died in Brussels and was buried there. \nSome historians have accused him of double-dealing in swearing allegiance to William III while plotting the restoration of James; others argue that his true loyalty was to the institution of the monarchy, and that he supported whichever monarch seemed best fitted to rule at any given time. William III clearly did not regard him as a dangerous character, as shown by the fact that he was left in peace once he fled from England; he was fortunate in having a great many friends and very few enemies. It seems that from about 1710 he was free to return to England, but he was by then happily settled in Brussels, where he had made a second marriage for love to Charlotte, comtesse d'Esneux, and, since he was able to draw at least part of the revenue from his English estates, he had no pressing need and no apparent desire to return home.\n\nCharacter\nAilesbury seems to have been almost universally liked even by his political opponents, having a reputation for honesty, decency and fair dealing. Charles II was clearly fond of him and confided in him to a degree unusual for such a secretive man; James II also liked him, and Louis XIV regarded him as almost the only British nobleman who was not motivated purely by self-interest. Though he changed allegiance himself he had no patience with time-servers: he detested Sunderland (while admitting that he was good company) and in 1689 told his cousin Danby that for his treachery to James II he deserved to \"be knocked on the head\".\n\nMemoirs\nAilesbury devoted many years to writing his Memoirs, which were not published until 1890. Historians have praised them highly, particularly for the vivid portraits of the leading figures in British life, including James II, William III, Danby, Sunderland, Lauderdale and Halifax. Perhaps the most striking feature of the memoirs is the author's absolute devotion to Charles II: \"my good and gracious master, the best that ever reigned over us\".\n\nAncestry\n\n\n== Notes ==\nPassage 7:\nThomas Wharton (died 1622)\nSir Thomas Wharton (c 1588 – 17 April 1622) was an English landowner and politician who sat in the House of Commons between 1614 and 1622.\n\nWharton was the second son of Philip Wharton, 3rd Baron Wharton  and his wife Frances Clifford, second daughter of Henry Clifford, 2nd Earl of Cumberland.  He purchased the estate of Aske Hall at Easby, Yorkshire from Lady Eleanor Bowes, a distant relative early in 1611 and was knighted at Whitehall on 25 April 1611. In 1614, he was elected Member of Parliament for Westmorland and re-elected in 1621.King James came to Aske on 16 April 1617.Wharton died at the age of about 34. He had married Lady Philadelphia Carey, daughter of Robert Carey, 1st Earl of Monmouth on 11 April 1611.  His elder brother George had been killed in a duel in 1609, and thus his eldest son young Philip inherited the barony when the 3rd Baron died in 1625. Wharton's second son Thomas was also MP for Westmorland.\nPassage 8:\nHenry Clifford, 1st Earl of Cumberland\nHenry Clifford, 1st Earl of Cumberland KG (1493 – 22 April 1542) was a member of the Clifford family which was seated at Skipton Castle, Yorkshire from 1310 to 1676.\n\nOrigins\nHe was born at Skipton Castle, a son of Henry Clifford, 10th Baron de Clifford by his wife Anne St John, daughter of  Sir John St John of Bletso by his first wife Alice Bradshaigh.\n\nCareer\nAs a youth, Clifford spent time at the court of King Henry VIII and was knighted at Henry's coronation in 1509. He was later appointed Sheriff of Yorkshire in 1522 and became hereditary Sheriff of Westmorland on the death of his father in 1523. As part of King Henry VIII's plans for the defence of the Scottish border, he was created Earl of Cumberland on 18 June 1525 and made Warden of the West Marches and Governor of Carlisle Castle. Replaced by William, Baron Dacre, he was reinstated to the post in 1534 after Dacre was accused of treason. During the Pilgrimage of Grace he remained loyal to the crown and was besieged in Skipton Castle by the rebels. He was made a Knight of the Garter by a grateful King Henry VIII in 1537.\n\nMarriages and progeny\nHe married twice:\n\nFirstly to Margaret Talbot (died before 1516), daughter of George Talbot, 4th Earl of Shrewsbury and Anne Hastings, daughter of William Hastings, 1st Baron Hastings and Katherine Neville.\nSecondly he married Margaret Percy, daughter of Henry Percy, 5th Earl of Northumberland and Catherine Spencer, daughter of Sir Robert Spencer of Spencer Combe, Devon. By Margaret Percy he had seven children, including:\nHenry Clifford, 2nd Earl of Cumberland, eldest son and heir, who married Lady Eleanor Brandon, a niece of King Henry VIII.\nCatherine Clifford (1513-1598) a notable recusant, married John Scrope, 8th Baron Scrope of Bolton, and secondly Sir Richard Cholmondely\n\nDeath and burial\nHe died in 1542 and was buried in Skipton church, where his monument survives.\nPassage 9:\nFrancis Clifford, 4th Earl of Cumberland\nFrancis Clifford, 4th Earl of Cumberland (1559 – 4 January 1641) was a member of the Clifford family which held the seat of Skipton from 1310 to 1676.\nHe was the second son of Henry Clifford, 2nd Earl of Cumberland and Anne Dacre and inherited his title and estates on the death of his brother George, who had willed them to him in place of his daughter Anne. A long lawsuit between them over the possession of the family estates was settled in 1617.He was elected Member of Parliament for Westmorland in 1584 and 1586 and for Yorkshire in 1604. He was appointed Sheriff of Yorkshire in 1600, constable of Knaresborough castle in 1604 and keeper of Carlisle castle in 1605. He was Custos Rotulorum of Cumberland from 1605 to 1639 and joint Lord Lieutenant of Northumberland (1607–1639), Westmorland (1607–1641) and Newcastle and a member of the Council of the North in 1619.He married Grisold Hughes, daughter of Thomas Hughes and Elizabeth Dwnn (or Don), daughter of Sir Griffith Dwnn (or Don) and Elizabeth Roche-Eden, circa March 1589.\nChildren of Francis Clifford, 4th Earl of Cumberland and Grisold Hughes:\n\nLady Frances Clifford, married Sir Gervase Clifton, 1st Baronet\nLady Margaret Clifford (died 1622) married Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford.\nHenry Clifford, 5th Earl of Cumberland b. 28 Feb 1591/92 – d. 11 Dec 1643He died on 21 January 1640/41.\nPassage 10:\nHenry Clifford (legal writer)\nHenry Clifford (2 March 1768 – 22 April 1813) was an English legal writer.\n\nLife\nClifford was the second son of the Hon.

He was born on 2 March 1768; studied at Liege with his eldest brother Thomas, created a baronet in 1815; and on his return to England applied himself to the law, and soon after the passing of the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1791 was called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn. He was very learned in the law and a warm advocate of the liberties of the people. His personal exertions in the memorable 'O. P.' contest at Covent Garden Theatre brought him prominently before the public. He was a sincere Catholic, and it was chiefly owing to his efforts that a Catholic chapel was opened at Chelsea in 1812.\nHe died at Bath on 22 April 1813.

Cura's Ferrer is a brilliant creation: a brilliant Iago in fact.\"In 2021, Cura founded production company and music label W.I.P. Media. Later that year, Cura released his debut music single Water on streaming platforms, accompanied by an official music video on VEVO followed by second single Toutes Les Couleurs and its accompanying VEVO music video and a third single Argento alongside a third VEVO music video.

It premiered in the United States on 9 August 2011.\n\nPlot\nCaptain Frank Tate leads a four-member SWAT team consisting of Tony Hunt, Jannard and Blanco. They manage to stop the robbery of a grocery store and save the hostages, but their reckless methods cause substantial property damage and emotional distress to the owner. Their superior gets angry and orders them to go through retraining, which they do not take seriously.\nIlya Kalashnikova and Demetrius, two Russian mobsters, bring a captive named Kenny to a warehouse outside the city. They demand Kenny recovers the \"item\" he has hidden there. Two members of the Italian mafia, Lampone and Storato, enter the same facility and start searching on their own. The two parties run into each other. Tate's team arrives on the same premises, and begins training with blank cartridges, not knowing about the events that just transpired.\nBoth criminal parties hide from the SWAT team, but tension rises between them. Blanco goes to check on the resulting noise, and is fatally shot, which alerts his colleagues. The Russians and the Italians realize that their law enforcement counterparts do not have real bullets, and form a fragile alliance to eliminate them. The SWAT team retreats to the upper level, locking the door behind them.\nIt is revealed that Demetrius stole the item from Lampone, before Kenny stole it from the former. Kenny reveals that the item is hidden somewhere beyond the locked door. Demetrius calls for backup. Tate and his squad realize that they must return to their truck to retrieve actual ammunition and call in police reinforcements. Kalashnikova and Storato bring the truck inside the warehouse. More members of the Russian mob, headed by a man named Vladimir, arrive. Vladimir decides to attack the upper floor through outside windows. Lampone secretly tells Storato that he has called his own operatives in order to secure the item for themselves.\nTate manages to reach the truck but finds the radio damaged. Hunt and Jannard fight off Vladimir's men. Jannard is nearly overpowered by Vladimir, before Tate returns and kills him. The mafia's reinforcements, led by tough guy Tagliaferro, show up and find another point of entry on the building's roof.\nTate decides to free Kenny, who gives him the briefcase containing the item. Kenny shows the SWAT team a hidden tunnel leading outside the hangar. Tate hides the item, before the group gets split. Tagliaferro knocks Tate unconscious, and hands him back to Kalashnikova and Demetrius. The others are captured by Storato and taken to another warehouse at the opposite end of the tunnel, where Lampone awaits. Lampone shoots Kenny, apparently killing him, and threatens to do the same to Jannard. Hunt agrees to go fetch the item in exchange for her safety, under escort from Storato. But he manages to kill Storato, neutralize Lampone and free Jannard.\nTagliaferro and his men return to Demetrius, Kalashnikova and Tate with orders to eliminate all three, but they escape in the truck and meet up with Hunt and Jannard at the other hangar. Tagliaferro catches up to them, and a final confrontation ensues. Tate kills Tagliaferro while Demetrius, Kalashnikova and Lampone are arrested.\nTate, Hunt and Jannard are congratulated by their superior. Kenny is revealed to be alive and an undercover FBI agent. He implies that Lampone is another undercover agent. The team is ordered to remain silent about the events.\n\nCast\nSteve Austin as SWAT Captain Frank Tate\nMichael Jai White as SWAT Sergeant Tony Hunt\nMichael Shanks as Demetrius\nKeith Jardine as Tagliaferro\nMichael Eklund as Kenny\nLexa Doig as Police Officer Third Class SWAT Member Jannard\nDarren Shahlavi as Storato\nAdrian Holmes as Lampone\nSteve Bacic as Police Officer Third Class SWAT Member Blanco\nCandace Elaine as Ilya Kalashnikova\nPeter Kent as Vladimir\n\nProduction\nThe film was developed independently by writer/director Cultraro, under the working title of Hangar 14. It was originally slated to star Cuba Gooding, Jr. The film later found financing from Jack and Joseph Nasser, who had inked WWE star Steve Austin to a multi-picture deal in 2008. It marked the fourth collaboration between Austin and the Nasser brothers. Like their other movies, it was shot around Vancouver, British Columbia, under the banner of Nasser Entertainment's Canadian subsidiary. Filming took place during snow season, which greatly contrasted with the light clothing and mild Los Angeles climate depicted in the film.Co-star Michael Jai White enjoyed Michael Eklund's performance as the weaselly Kenny, and asked Universal to cast him as main antagonist Jobe Davis in his 2020 film Welcome to Sudden Death.\n\nRelease\nTactical Force was released theatrically in the United Arab Emirates on 12 April 2012, ranking fourth at the box office behind Get the Gringo, StreetDance 2 and The Hunger Games.In the United States, the film was released on home video on 9 August 2011 by Vivendi Entertainment. Early copies came with a limited slipcover. It reached number 10 in the national DVD sales chart for its week of release. Canadian release followed on 23 August 2011. It was handled by Entertainment One, who also took care of the film in the UK and other international territories.\n\nReception\nTactical Force received mixed reviews. The Movie Scene and Todd Rigney of Beyond Hollywood both deemed the film \"absurd\", while mentioning that its implausibility somehow contributed to its entertainment factor.Genre critic Outlaw Vern was let down by the film's mundane locations. Movie Mavericks was more positive, calling it \"well produced\", and Explosive Action praised the inclusion of an extensive car chase in an otherwise stripped-down siege film.Tactical Force's flashy editing was widely criticized, but its high action quotient earned it moderate praise, with JoBlo calling it \"a step above the rest [of Austin vehicles]\". Jeffrey Kauffman of Blu-ray.com opined that \"Tactical Force looks fantastic. Cultraro the director simply needs to hire a better writer than Cultraro next time.\"The film earned notice for its inclusion of an Italian character of color, a relatively uncommon occurrence in popular media. It also elicited several comparisons with Walter Hill's 1992 feature Trespass.\n\nSee also\nRecoil (2011 film), a re-teaming of some of this film's principals\nPassage 5:\nBrian Johnson (special effects artist)\nBrian Johnson (born 29 June 1939 or 29 June 1940) is a British designer and director of film and television special effects.\n\nLife and career\nBorn Brian Johncock, he changed his surname to Johnson during the 1960s. Joining the team of special effects artist Les Bowie, Johnson started his career behind the scenes for Bowie Films on productions such as On The Buses, and for Hammer Films.  He is known for his special effects work on TV series including Thunderbirds (1965–66) and films including Alien (1979), for which he received the 1980 Academy Award for Best Visual Effects (shared with H. R. Giger, Carlo Rambaldi, Dennis Ayling and Nick Allder). Previously, he had built miniature spacecraft models for Stanley Kubrick's 1968 film 2001: A Space Odyssey.Johnson's work on Space: 1999 influenced the effects of the Star Wars films of the 1970s and 1980s. Impressed by his work, George Lucas visited Johnson during the production of the TV series to offer him the role of effects supervisor for the 1977 film. Having already been commissioned for the second series of Space: 1999, Johnson was unable to accept at the time. He worked on the sequel, The Empire Strikes Back (1980), whose special effects were recognised in the form of a 1981 Special Achievement Academy Award (which Johnson shared with Richard Edlund, Dennis Muren and Bruce Nicholson).\n\nAwards\nJohnson has won Academy Awards for both Alien (1979) and The Empire Strikes Back (1980). He was further nominated for an Academy Award for his work on Dragonslayer (1981). In addition, Johnson is the recipient of a Saturn Award for The Empire Strikes Back and a BAFTA Award for James Cameron's  Aliens.\n\nFilmography\nSpecial effects\nDirector\nScragg 'n' Bones (2006)\nPassage 6:\nJumanji\nJumanji is a 1995 American urban fantasy adventure film directed by Joe Johnston from a screenplay by Jonathan Hensleigh, Greg Taylor, and Jim Strain, based on the 1981 children's picture book of the same name by Chris Van Allsburg. The film is the first installment in the Jumanji film series.  It stars Robin Williams, Kirsten Dunst, David Alan Grier, Bonnie Hunt, Jonathan Hyde, and Bebe Neuwirth. The story centers on a supernatural board game that releases jungle-based hazards upon its players with every turn they take.\nJumanji was released on December 15, 1995, by Sony Pictures Releasing. The film received mixed reviews from critics, but was a box-office success, grossing $263 million worldwide on a budget of approximately $65 million. It was the tenth-highest-grossing film of 1995.\nThe film spawned an animated television series, which aired from 1996 to 1999, and was followed by a spin-off film, Zathura: A Space Adventure (2005), and two indirect sequels, Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle (2017) and Jumanji: The Next Level (2019).\n\nPlot\nIn 1969, Alan Parrish lives with his parents Sam and Carol in Brantford, New Hampshire. One day, he escapes a group of bullies and retreats to Sam's shoe factory. He meets his friend, Carl Bentley, who reveals a new shoe prototype he made by himself. Alan misplaces the shoe and damages a conveyor belt, but Carl takes responsibility and loses his job. After the bullies attack Alan and steal his bicycle, Alan follows the sound of tribal drumbeats to a construction site. He finds a board game called Jumanji, which was buried 100 years earlier, and brings it home.\nThat night, after arguing with Sam about attending a boarding school, Alan plans to run away, but his friend, Sarah Whittle, returns his bicycle. Alan shows her Jumanji and invites her to play. With each roll of the dice, the game piece moves by itself and a cryptic message describing the roll's outcome appears in the crystal ball at the center of the board. After Alan inadvertently rolls a five, a message tells him to wait in a jungle until someone rolls a five or eight, and he is sucked into the game. Shortly after, a swarm of bats appears and chases Sarah out of the mansion.\nTwenty-six years later, Judy and Peter Shepherd move into the now-vacant Parrish mansion with their aunt Nora, after their parents died in an accident on a ski trip in Canada the winter before. Discovering Jumanji in the attic, Judy and Peter begin playing it. Their rolls summon giant mosquitoes and swarms of monkeys. The game rules state everything will be restored when the game ends, so they continue playing. Peter then rolls a five which releases a lion and a grown-up Alan. As Alan makes his way out, he meets Carl, who is now working as a police officer. Alan, Judy, and Peter go to the now-abandoned shoe factory and learn that Sam abandoned the business to search for his son after his disappearance, until his 1991 death. Eventually, the factory closed, sending Brantford into economic decline.\nRealizing they need Sarah to finish the game, the three locate Sarah, now haunted by both Jumanji and Alan's disappearance, and persuade her to join them. Sarah's first move releases fast-growing carnivorous vines, and Alan's next move releases a big-game hunter named Van Pelt, whom Alan first met in the game's inner world. The next roll summons a stampede of various animals, and a pelican steals the game. Peter retrieves it, but Alan is arrested by Carl. Back in town, the stampede wreaks havoc, and Van Pelt steals the game.\nPeter, Sarah, and Judy track Van Pelt to a discount store, where they set booby traps to subdue him and retrieve the game, while Alan, after revealing his identity to Carl, is set free. When the four return to the mansion, it is now completely overrun by jungle wildlife. They release one calamity after another until Van Pelt arrives. When Alan drops the dice, he wins the game which causes everything that happened as a result of the game to be reversed.\nAlan and Sarah return to 1969, just in time for Alan to reconcile with Sam, who tells him that he does not have to attend boarding school. Alan also admits his responsibility for damaging the conveyor belt. After realizing that they have memories of the game, Alan and Sarah throw Jumanji into a river, then share a kiss.\nIn an alternate version of the present, Alan and Sarah are married and expecting their first child. Alan's parents are still alive and Alan is now successfully running the family business. Alan and Sarah meet Judy, Peter, and their parents Jim and Martha for the first time during a Christmas party. Alan offers Jim a job and convinces them to cancel their upcoming ski trip, averting their deaths.\nMeanwhile, two young girls hear drumbeats while walking on a beach. Jumanji is seen lying partially buried in the sand.\n\nCast\nRobin Williams as Alan Parrish\nKirsten Dunst as Judy Shepherd\nDavid Alan Grier as Carl Bentley\nAdam Hann-Byrd as young Alan Parrish\nBonnie Hunt as Sarah Whittle\nJonathan Hyde as Sam Parrish\nHyde also portrays Van Pelt, a big-game hunter who resides in Jumanji.\nBebe Neuwirth as Nora Shepherd\nBradley Pierce as Peter Shepherd\nJames Handy as the Exterminator\nPatricia Clarkson as Carol Parrish\nLaura Bell Bundy as young Sarah Whittle\n\nProduction\nWhile Peter Guber was visiting Boston, he invited author Chris Van Allsburg, who lives in Providence, Rhode Island, to option his book. Van Allsburg wrote one of the screenplay's drafts, which he described as \"sort of trying to imbue the story with a quality of mystery and surrealism\". Van Allsburg added that the studio nearly abandoned the project if not for his film treatment, which earned him a story credit given it added story material that was not from the book.TriStar Pictures agreed to finance the film on the condition that Robin Williams plays the starring role. However, Williams turned down the role based on the first script he was given. Only after director Joe Johnston and screenwriters Jonathan Hensleigh, Greg Taylor and Jim Strain undertook extensive rewrites did Williams accept. Johnston had reservations over casting Williams because of the actor's reputation for improvisation, fearing that he wouldn't adhere to the script. However, Williams understood that it was \"a tightly structured story\" and filmed the scenes as outlined in the script, often filming duplicate scenes afterward where he was allowed to improvise with Bonnie Hunt.Tom Hanks was the first choice to play Alan Parrish but turned it down due to his commitments to Apollo 13. Other stars were considered, including  Bruce Willis, who was unavailable because he was working on Die Hard with a Vengeance, Dan Aykroyd, Michael Keaton, Chevy Chase, Sean Penn, Kevin Costner, Richard Dreyfuss, Michael Douglas, Rupert Everett, Harrison Ford, Sean Connery, Bill Paxton, Bryan Cranston, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Alec Baldwin.Jodie Foster, Demi Moore, Madonna, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Kirstie Alley were considered for Sarah Whittle, while Scarlett Johansson auditioned for Judy Shepherd.Shooting took place in various New England locales, mainly Keene, New Hampshire, which represented the story's fictional town of Brantford, New Hampshire, and North Berwick, Maine, where the Olde Woolen Mill stood in for the Parrish Shoe Factory. Additional filming took place in Vancouver, British Columbia, where a mock-up of the Parrish house was built.Special effects were a combination of more traditional techniques like puppetry and animatronics (provided by Amalgamated Dynamics) with state-of-the-art digital effects overseen by Industrial Light & Magic. ILM developed two new software programs specifically for Jumanji, one called iSculpt, which allowed the illustrators to create realistic facial expressions on the computer-generated animals in the film, and another that for the first time created realistic digital hair, used on the monkeys and lion. Actor Bradley Pierce (Peter) underwent three and a half hours of prosthetic makeup application daily for a period of two and a half months to film the scenes where he slowly transformed into a monkey.The film was dedicated to visual effects supervisor Stephen L. Price, who died before the film's release.\n\nRelease\nJumanji was released in theaters on December 15, 1995.\n\nHome media\nJumanji was first released on VHS on May 14, 1996, and re-released as a Collector's Series DVD on January 25, 2000. In the UK, the film was also released on DVD as a special edition bundled with the Jumanji board game. The film was first released on Blu-ray on June 28, 2011, and re-released as a 20th Anniversary Edition on September 14, 2015. A restored version was released on December 5, 2017, on Blu-ray and 4K UHD to coincide with the premiere of the sequel, Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle.\n\nReception\nBox office\nJumanji did well at the box office, opening at No. 1 overtaking Toy Story, making $11 million. It collected $100.5 million in the United States and Canada and an additional $162.3 million overseas, bringing the worldwide gross to $262.8 million.\n\nCritical response\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 52% of 46 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 6/10. The website's consensus reads: \"A feast for the eyes with a somewhat shaky plot, Jumanji is a good adventure that still offers a decent amount of fun for the whole family.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 39 out of 100, based on 18 critics, indicating \"generally unfavorable reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A−\" on an A+ to F scale.Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times rated the film one-and-a-half out of four stars, criticizing its reliance on special effects to convey its story, which he felt was lacking. He questioned the decision to rate the film PG rather than PG-13 as he felt that young children would be traumatized by much of the film's imagery, which he said made the film \"about as appropriate for smaller children as, say, Jaws\". He specifically cited Peter's monkey transformation as making him \"look like a Wolf Man ... with a hairy snout and wicked jaws\" that were likely to scare children. Regarding the board game's unleashing one hazard after another at its main characters, Ebert concluded: \"It's like those video games where you achieve one level after another by killing and not getting killed. The ultimate level for young viewers will be being able to sit all the way through the movie\".Van Allsburg approved of the film despite the changes from the book and it not being as \"idiosyncratic and peculiar\", declaring that \"the film is faithful in reproducing the chaos level that comes with having a jungle animal in the house. It's a good movie\".\n\nSequels\nZathura: A Space Adventure\nZathura: A Space Adventure, the spiritual successor that was marketed as being from the same continuity of the Jumanji franchise, was released as a feature film in 2005. Unlike the book Zathura, the film makes no references to the previous film outside the marketing statement. Both films are based on books written by Chris Van Allsburg. With the films being based on books that take place in the same series, the films vaguely make reference to that concept from the novels by having a similar concept and themes.\n\nJumanji: Welcome to the Jungle\nA new film, Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is a sequel to the 1995 film. The film contains a whole new set of characters, with no original cast from the original film reprising their roles. The film sees four teenagers in 2017 who are stuck in Jumanji video game, whereas game avatars must finish the game and save Jumanji. \nPlans for a sequel started in the late 1990s by Sony Pictures Entertainment and the original director Ken Ralston, a visual effects supervisor of the original film, was hired to direct a film, with Christmas 2000 release date, but Ralston stepped down, and the sequel was cancelled. The development of the sequel again emerged in the 2010s, upon which then-president of Columbia Pictures Doug Belgrad teased a possibility of the project in July 2012; the project was confirmed three years later in August, with a new director Jake Kasdan directing it and starring Dwayne Johnson. The film was released on December 20, 2017, as a tribute to Robin Williams' lead and his character is mentioned within the film.\n\nJumanji: The Next Level\nA fourth film in the franchise titled, Jumanji: The Next Level, a sequel to Welcome to the Jungle was released on December 13, 2019. Bebe Neuwirth reprises her role as Nora Shepherd in a cameo at the end of the film.\n\nIn other media\nTelevision\nAn animated television series was produced between 1996 and 1999. While it borrowed heavily from the film – incorporating various characters, locations and props, and modelling Alan's house and the board game on the way they appeared in the film – the series retcons rather than using the film's storyline. In the series version, on each turn, the players are given a \"game clue\" and then sucked into the jungle until they solve it. Alan is stuck in Jumanji because he has not seen his clue. Judy and Peter try to help him leave the game, providing their motivation during the series, while Sarah is absent from the series, and Alan has a relationship with Aunt Nora instead of Sarah, which, unlike the film, gives a clear explanation about his position as Judy and Peter's uncle.\n\nGames\nJumanji: The Game is a board game originally published by Milton Bradley Company in the US in 1995.An updated version with new colorized artwork was released in 2017 by Cardinal Games. Some of the riddle message texts on the danger cards were changed, especially the unique danger messages. That year, designer Rachel Lowe won a British Game of the Year Award (awarded by the Toy Retailers Association) for the game.Jumanji: A Jungle Adventure Game Pack is a North American-exclusive game for Microsoft Windows that was released on October 9, 1996. It was developed by Studio Interactive and published by Philips Interactive Media. It contains five different action-arcade-based mini-games that are based on popular scenes from the film. Clips of cutscenes from the film can also be viewed. There are five different mini-games that the player can choose from, with different rules and objectives. Animals from the film provide instructions to the player for each mini-game, except for the Treasure Maze mini-game, where the Jumanji board game spirit provides instructions instead.

He is best known for directing  effects-driven films, including  Honey, I Shrunk the Kids (1989); The Rocketeer (1991); Jumanji (1995); Jurassic Park III (2001); The Wolfman (2010); and Captain America: The First Avenger (2011).\n\nEarly life\nJohnston was born in Austin, Texas, and attended California State University, Long Beach, and Pasadena's Art Center College of Design.\n\nCareer\nDesign and visual effects\nMuch of the work at the beginning of Johnston's screen career combined design and special effects. He began his career as a concept artist and effects technician on the first Star Wars film, directed by George Lucas, co-created the design of Boba Fett in The Empire Strikes Back, and was art director on one of the effects teams for the sequel Return of the Jedi. His association with Lucas would later prove fruitful, when he became one of four to win an Academy Award for Best Visual Effects for Lucas and Steven Spielberg's film Raiders of the Lost Ark. Johnston continued to work on many films as an effects expert.\nHe was also associate producer on fantasy Willow, and production designer on two mid-80s TV movies which featured the Ewoks seen in Return of the Jedi.\nJohnston is also author of Star Wars novel The Adventures of Teebo: A Tale of Magic and Suspense, which ties into Return of the Jedi (New York: Random House, 1984; ISBN 0-394-86568-5, ISBN 0-394-96568-X).In 1984, now 34, Johnston went to Lucas and stated his desire to leave Lucasfilm for a year. However, Lucas offered him to go to USC School of Cinematic Arts and study there for a year, complete with paid tuition and half-salary that would let Johnston take any class he wanted. Johnston left after a year, saying he \"was asked not to return\" because he \"broke too many rules\".\n\nDirecting\nJohnston made his directorial debut in 1989 with hit comedy adventure Honey, I Shrunk the Kids, starring Rick Moranis. He followed it with comic-book adaptation The Rocketeer (1991). The film was a commercial failure, as was his next, the animated and live-action The Pagemaster, starring Macaulay Culkin. Johnston rebounded, directing the family hit Jumanji, starring Robin Williams. The film overcame lukewarm reviews to gross over $260 million.Johnston was set to direct Hulk, but dropped out in July 1997. Johnston then switched gears from effects-driven action films to the more personal October Sky (1999), starring a teenage Jake Gyllenhaal as a 1950s West Virginia high school student who dreams of being a rocket scientist for NASA against his father's wishes.\nJohnston's first project of the 2000s was the sequel Jurassic Park III, which made over US$300 million at the box office. Johnston followed it with western Hidalgo, starring Viggo Mortensen. Johnston then took a six-year directorial break before signing on at a month's notice to take over the 2010 remake of 1941 horror classic The Wolfman. Shot in England, the film starred Benicio del Toro and Anthony Hopkins.\nIn part thanks to his experience with the period superhero film The Rocketeer, Johnston was selected to direct Marvel Studios superhero adaptation Captain America: The First Avenger. Released on July 22, 2011, the film stars Chris Evans as the comic book hero and Hugo Weaving as his archenemy the Red Skull. In 2012, Johnston directed the thriller Not Safe for Work for Blumhouse Productions.\nOn December 12, 2017, The Hollywood Reporter reported that Johnston would helm 32 days of reshoots on the film The Nutcracker and the Four Realms due to its director Lasse Hallström being unavailable.On December 5, 2019, it was reported that Joe Johnston was in negotiations with Disney to direct Shrunk, a legacy sequel to Honey, I Shrunk The Kids.\n\nFilmography\nDirector\nFilm\n\nTelevision\n\nOther credits\nFilm\n\nTelevision\n\nBooks written\n1977: The Star Wars Sketchbook\n1980: The Empire Strikes Back Sketchbook  (with Nilo Rodis-Jamero)\n1983: Return of the Jedi Sketchbook (with Nilo Rodis-Jamero)\n1984: The Adventures of Teebo: A Tale of Magic and Suspense\n2005 : Star Wars : Aux origines du mythe (with Doug Chiang)\n2007 : The Hill Culture\n2011 : The Mack Marsden Murder Mystery\n2014 : Franklin\n2014 : Necessary Evil: Settling Missouri with a Rope and a Gun\n2015 : It's End Here: Missouri's Last Vigilante\n\nAccolades", "answers": ["yes"], "length": 7056, "dataset": "2wikimqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "59d531329c51fbdcdfc3e9af4565136b072a2af1d3b68ea2"}

She \"was the widow of a Gettysburg Negro barber [Jacob Smith-died 1852], by whom she had two children.\" Her mother was a free mulatto woman of European and African descent, and her father was Irish.\n\nCareer with Stevens\nSeparated from her husband, Smith moved to Lancaster with her mother and sons in 1847 and accepted a position as housekeeper to prominent lawyer and abolitionist Thaddeus Stevens, who had moved from Gettysburg five years earlier but practiced law and had business interests in several counties in the Susquehanna River basin. Stevens was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives the following year, and Smith continued to keep the bachelor's house (including his house in Washington, D.C.) until Stevens died in 1868.Smith was described as \"giving great attention to her appearance,\" and in later years she had her clothes made to resemble those of Mary Lincoln. Carl Sandburg described Smith as \"a comely quadroon with Caucasian features and a skin of light-gold tint, a Roman Catholic communicant with Irish eyes ... quiet, discreet, retiring, reputed for poise and personal dignity.\"Smith had two sons, William and Isaac, by her late husband, Jacob Smith. She and Stevens also raised the latter's nephews, whom he adopted in the 1840s.  On April 2, 1861, Smith's older son, William Smith, fatally shot himself while handling a pistol at Stevens's home, as his mother watched. William Smith was 26 years old and worked as a shoemaker in Lancaster. Her other son, Isaac Smith, a banjo player and barber, enlisted in the 6th United States Colored Infantry Regiment in 1863 and served in Virginia.\nNo evidence exists as to the exact nature of the relationship between Stevens and Smith. In the one brief surviving letter from Stevens to her, he addresses her as \"Mrs. Smith,\" unusual deference to an African-American servant in that era. Family members also asked Stevens to be remembered to \"Mrs. Smith.\" Nonetheless, during her time with Stevens, neighbors considered her his common-law wife. Smith not only handled social functions for the politician, she also mingled with Stevens's guests, who were instructed to address her as \"Madame\" or \"Mrs. Smith.\" Opposition newspapers (for Stevens's views concerning racial equality were quite controversial) claimed she was frequently called \"Mrs. Stevens\" by people who knew her.Smith was at Stevens's bedside when he died in Washington, D.C. on August 11, 1868, along with his friend Simon Stevens and surviving nephew (Thaddeus Stevens Jr.), two African-American nuns, and several other people. Under Stevens's will, Smith was allowed to choose between a lump sum of $5,000 or a $500 annual allowance; she was also allowed to take any furniture in his house. With the inheritance, Smith purchased Stevens' house and the adjoining lot.\n\nBusinesswoman\nStevens and Smith were active in the Underground Railroad, which led to the burning of his ironworks, Caledonia Furnace, during the Civil War. Recent excavation of their house in Lancaster unearthed a cistern with a passageway to a nearby tavern, as well as a spittoon inside, which some historians think was used to shelter escaping slaves. Smith bought her house in Lancaster next to Stevens's house in 1860. During and after the Battle of Gettysburg in 1863, Smith hired a horse and wagon, and collected food and supplies for the wounded of both sides from neighbors in Adams, York and Lancaster counties and delivered them to the makeshift hospitals. After Stevens's death in 1868, in addition to buying his house in Lancaster, Smith operated a prosperous boarding house across from the Willard Hotel in Washington, D.C., as well as invested in real estate and other business ventures.\n\nDeath and legacy\nLydia Hamilton Smith died in Washington on her 71st birthday in 1884 and, per her wishes, was buried in St. Mary's Catholic cemetery in Lancaster, although she also left money for the continued upkeep of Stevens's grave at the Shreiner-Concord cemetery.In Steven Spielberg's 2012 film Lincoln, Smith was portrayed by actress S. Epatha Merkerson.\n\nNotes and references\nFurther reading\nCarlson, Peter. \"Lincoln's Feisty Foil.\" American History, vol. 48, no. 1 (Apr. 2013), pp. 50–55.\nDelle, James A., and Mary Ann Levine.  \"Archaeology, Intangible Heritage, and the Negotiation of Urban Identity in Lancaster, Pennsylvania.\" Historical Archaeology, vol. 45, no. 1 (2011), pp. 51–66\nPassage 5:\nThaddeus P. Mott\nThaddeus Phelps Mott (December 7, 1831 – November 23, 1894) was an American adventurer, sailor and soldier of fortune. A former Union Army officer during American Civil War, he also took part in wars in Mexico, Italy, and the Ottoman Empire. He was primarily responsible for recruiting former Union and Confederate soldiers for service in the Egyptian Army, in which he held the rank of major general, and was the first officer to take service with the Khedive Isma'il Pasha as his aide-de-camp in 1870. At the time of his death, he was also the last surviving son of the eminent surgeon Valentine Mott.\n\nBiography\nEarly life and military career\nMott was born in New York City, New York, the son of Dr. Valentine Mott (1785–1865) and Louisa Dunmore Munn. He was one of nine children born to the couple. Little is known of his early life except that, as a child, he \"developed a spirit of adventure\". He was a natural linguist and was educated at New York University where his father was emeritus professor of surgery.At age 17, he left the country to fight in revolutionary Italy, commissioned as a second lieutenant, serving under Giuseppe Garibaldi. Suffering from ill health following his Italian service, mostly due to exposure and privation, Mott subsequently served as a shipmate on various clipper ships during the next several years. He initially signed on to the Hornet bound for California, then as a third mate on the Hurricane in 1851, a second mate on the St. Denis in 1852 and the mate of the St. Nicholas in 1854. He returned to California a year later and spent 1856–57 in the Mexican Army under General Ignacio Comonfort prior to and during the Reform War. In 1858, he married Emily Josephine Daunton and had two children with her, Marie Louise and Valentine Mott.\n\nReturn to the United States and the American Civil War\nHe eventually returned to the United States and enlisted in the Union Army shortly before the American Civil War where he was assigned as captain of artillery at the Chain Bridge fortification in Washington, D.C. He initially served as captain of the 3rd Independent Battery, New York Volunteer Artillery, which was active on the upper Potomac during the first year of the war. Mott and the 3rd New York Artillery saw action during the Seven Days Battles fought for five consecutive hours defeating each Confederate force put against them though sustaining heavy casualties. All the officers from the battery were promoted from the ranks. Mott resigned as battery commander to accept a commission to the 19th Infantry Regiment but briefly returned in September 1862 to lead the regiment at Lewinsville, Virginia in battle with the famed Washington Battery and forced them to retreat.A year later, he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel of cavalry, and then reassigned to the 14th Regiment New York Volunteer Cavalry. Mott was one of the organizers of the regiment which mustered in on Rikers Island as part of a volunteer brigade sponsored by the New York Metropolitan Police. He led the regiment during the New York Draft Riots later that year. On the third day of the riots, in what would be the first major engagement of the day, Mott was dispatched along with units commanded by Captain John H. Howell and General Charles C. Dodge to confront rioters reportedly gathering at Thirty-Second Street and Eighth Avenue. With orders to confront and disperse the mob, Mott led a troop of cavalry and a battery of howitzers supporting General Dodge and the 8th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment. Upon reaching Eighth Avenue, the soldiers discovered three African-Americans hanging to lamp posts \"while a gang of ferocious women crowded about the dangling bodies, slashing them with knives as a mob of men estimated at more than five thousand yelled and cheered\". The crowd fell back as the soldiers advanced and Mott charged forward on his horse to cut one of the men down from the lamp post. As he was doing so, a rioter attempted to drag Mott off his horse and Mott was forced to kill him with his cavalry sabre.Almost immediately after returning to his command, Mott and his men were assaulted by bricks and stones hurled by the rioters, followed by \"a brisk fire from muskets and pistols\". The mob charged down the street. Believing they intended to capture the regiment's guns, Mott ordered Captain Howell to bring two howitzers into position in Seventh Avenue and prepare to sweep Thirty-Second Street with artillery fire. Mott led his men against the rioters; the cavalry and infantry units charged with sabre and bayonet and managed to drive the mob back to Eighth Avenue. The rioters returned, however, when the soldiers withdrew to protect the artillerymen. Howell shouted to the rioters to surrender. The crowd's jeers and taunts prompted Howell to give the order to fire. The howitzers, loaded with grape and canister shot, ripped through the tightly packed mob and inflicted heavy casualties. The crowd withstood six rounds before scattering and moving northward. The soldiers were broken up into small groups to clear the side streets and cut down the men hanging from the lamp posts before returning to their headquarters on Mulberry Street. A half-an-hour after the soldiers left, the rioters returned to carry away their dead and wounded, and \"again strung up the Negros\". The bodies would remain there until an NYPD squad under Captain Samuel Brower could safely remove them from the site. Afterwards, Mott was transferred to the Department of the Gulf where he was chief of outposts before finally resigning his commission in 1864.\n\nService to the Ottoman Empire\nMott remained in the United States for several years after the war. While in New York, he was a member of both the Freemasons' Holland Lodge No. 8 and Jerusalem Chapter No. 8, R.A.M. In 1867, he was nominated to replace General Lawrence as U.S. Minister to Costa Rica but declined the offer. A year later, he travelled to Turkey to join the Ottoman Army and then on to Cairo where he was appointed a major general or \"ferik-pacha\". That same year, he was named Grand Officer of the Imperial Order of the Madjidieh by Sultan Abdülaziz I. He also became a member of the \"Conseal de Guerre\" and saw plenty of service in the Balkans during the next few years.In early-1869, Mott was contacted by the then Egyptian Khedive Isma'il Pasha to enlist his help in recruiting American officers to reorganize Egypt's military forces. Being subordinate to the Ottoman Empire, and thus without official diplomatic representation, Isma'il was not able to request assistance directly from the U.S. Government and instead had to rely on independent agents. Mott was an ideal candidate given his mercenary background and family connections to the Ottomans. His father, Valentine Mott, had been personal physician to Sultan Mehmed II and one of his sisters was married to the Ottoman ambassador to the United States, Blacque Bey. Generals Charles Pomeroy Stone, Henry H. Sibley and William W. Loring, all recommended by General William T. Sherman, accompanied Mott to Egypt later that year. Many of the men recruited by Mott had fought on one side or the other during the Civil War, were graduates from West Point and Annapolis Naval Academy and helped rebuild both the Egyptian army and navy. Mott and others also commanded troops in exploration missions not only to improve the overall Egyptian military establishment but also to increase knowledge of Egypt's geography.In 1870, Mott was made the first aide-de-camp to the Isma'il Pasha. Two years later, he also became a Grand Officer of the Imperial Order of the Osmanieh. He remained in Egyptian service until his contract expired four years later. Declining to renew it, Mott instead turned over command to Charles Stone and returned to Turkey to take part in the wars between Serbia, the Russian and Ottoman Empires. He later distinguished himself during the Battle of Shipka Pass.\n\nRetirement and later years\nIn September 1876, he visited Paris to consult a French physician regarding a chronic ailment. He was forced to retire from military service for health reasons three years later. Prior to his retirement, he was awarded the war medal of the \"Croissant Rouge\" which, at the time, had been awarded to only 18 men including the Sultan himself. He settled in Toulon to work as an American consular agent and continued to live there with his family for over ten years until his death on November 23, 1894. He was the last surviving son of the Mott family. Mott's military career in Egypt, as well as those of other American officers, was featured in Real Soldiers of Fortune (1906) by Richard Harding Davis.\nPassage 6:\nValentine Mott\nValentine Mott (August 20, 1785 – April 26, 1865) was an American surgeon.\n\nLife\nValentine Mott was born at Glen Cove, New York. He graduated at Columbia College, studied under Sir Astley Cooper in London, and also spent a winter in Edinburgh. After acting as demonstrator of anatomy he was appointed professor of surgery in Columbia College in 1809. From 1811 to 1834 he was in very extensive practice as a surgeon, and most successful as a teacher and operator.He tied the innominate artery in 1818; the patient lived twenty-six days. He performed a similar operation on the carotid for the first time in the USA on 20 Sept 1829 before going on to carry out this operation forty-six times with good results; and in 1827 he was also successful in the case of the common iliac. He is said to have performed one thousand amputations and one hundred and sixty-five lithotomies.After spending seven years in Europe (1834-1841) Mott returned to New York where he was on the founding faculty of the university medical college of New York, now New York University School of Medicine. He translated AALM Velpeau's Operative Surgery, and was foreign associate of the Imperial Academy of Medicine of Paris.A collection of his correspondence is held at the National Library of Medicine in Bethesda, Maryland.\n\nFamily\nIn 1849, the same year he was elected President of the New York Academy of Medicine, Mott and his wife, the former Louisa Dunmore Munn, moved to a four-story Italianate brownstone mansion at #1 Gramercy Park West with their large family. The couple had 9 children: 6 sons, including Alexander Brown Mott (1826–1889), Valentine Mott, Jr. (1822–1854), and Thaddeus P. Mott; and 3 daughters, including Louisa Dunmore Mott, who in 1842 married the surgeon William Holme Van Buren. A son of Alexander B. Mott, the surgeon Dr. Valentine Mott (1852–1918) studied under Louis Pasteur in Paris and was the first to introduce rabies vaccine into the U.S.Upon his death in 1865, Mott was interred at Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York.\nPassage 7:\nAnthony Ellmaker Roberts\nAnthony Ellmaker Roberts (October 29, 1803 – January 23, 1885), was an American politician, member of the United States House of Representatives from 1855 to 1859, an abolitionist and close associate of Thaddeus Stevens.\n\nEarly life\nAnthony Ellmaker Roberts was born near Barneston Station in Chester County, Pennsylvania. He was the son of John Roberts and Mary Ellmaker. His family moved to Lancaster County in 1804. Growing up, Roberts received the limited education available from the local common school. In 1816, at the age of thirteen, Roberts began working for his uncle Isaac Ellmaker as a clerk in Isaac's country store in New Holland; at the age of twenty, Anthony received a share in the ownership of the store, and continued in the business until 1839.\n\nEarly political career\nOn October 8, 1839, Roberts was elected on the Democratic Antimasonic ticket as Sheriff of Lancaster County. He then moved to Lancaster City, where he served his three-year term as sheriff from 1839 to 1842. In the fall of 1843, Roberts ran for a seat on the Twenty-Eighth Congress on the Anti-Masonic Party ticket, but he was defeated by the Whig Party candidate, Jeremiah Brown. On May 16, 1850, Roberts was appointed by US President Zachary Taylor as the United States Marshal for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, a position he held until May 29, 1853.\n\nResistance at Christiana\nThe incident\nJust a few months after Roberts was appointed Marshal, the United States Congress passed the Fugitive Slave Law as part of the Compromise of 1850. The law put Roberts in a difficult position as a Marshal who was also an abolitionist, because he was expected to enforce laws promoting the return of runaway slaves to the South or risk a fine of one thousand US$ per incident.\nAfter many tense incidents in the north between local communities harboring runaway slaves\nand southern slave owners seeking to reclaim their \"property\". An incident arose in which blood was shed: on September 11, 1851, Edward Gorsuch, a Maryland slave owner, came to Christiana in Lancaster County to reclaim a runaway slave named Nelson Ford. A group of runaway slaves in Christiana, headed by William Parker, had formed a vigilante group to protect one another from any attempts by Southern slave owners to enslave them again.\nEdward Gorsuch soon learned that his former slave was staying with William Parker. He went to William Parker's house along with a small posse to take back the slave he claimed to own. The fugitive slaves, led by William Parker, sounded an alarm, which summoned other blacks as well as some local white abolitionists. As Edward Gorsuch advanced to reclaim his \"property\", William Parker led an active resistance, and a small battle ensued. One hour later the incident was over and Gorsuch lay dead.\nTwo days later, Anthony Roberts was on the scene with a detachment of Philadelphia police.\nThose who participated in the resistance, including the white bystanders, were arrested and put on trial for treason, beginning with Castner Hanway, a white man who was not a Quaker but was sympathetic to Quaker ideals. Thaddeus Stevens took on the case as the defense attorney, while Roberts was responsible for keeping those on trial in custody.\n\nInvolvement in the slaves' trial\nThe prosecuting attorneys held two blacks in \"voluntary\" custody for the case. These men discovered Edward Gorsuch's plot to reclaim his slaves the day before the resistance took place and warned William Parker. The prosecution was planning to use their testimony to prove that the Christiana incident was an organized effort to resist the laws of the United States. Two weeks before the trial began, however, the two blacks mysteriously disappeared from custody. The prosecution hinted that Marshal Roberts had let them go, since there was no evidence of a broken lock or use of force in their escape. The defense denied the accusation.\nTwenty-one years later, William Still, the black leader of the Philadelphia Underground Railroad, revealed the truth. While in custody, the two black men had been identified by their owner as runaway slaves. Still reports that the two men did indeed find a \"true friend and ally\" in Roberts. Still clarified the matter further when he wrote in response to the suspicions of the prosecuting attorney with respect to Anthony Roberts: \"To add now, that those suspicions were founded on fact, will doubtless do him no damage\".\nRoberts did other things within his power to sway the outcome of the case. As the Marshal, Roberts was responsible for summoning potential jurors. Robert J. Brent, Maryland's Attorney General, who was part of the prosecution team, later claimed that \"a large majority\" of the potential jurors called by Marshal Roberts were \"unfavorable to a conviction\". On November 27, 1851, Roberts permitted a Thanksgiving meal to be prepared for all the prisoners, and even joined them in the prison for the meal. The incident caused the Maryland Attorney General to censure Roberts's lack of \"impartiality\" and \"decorum\".\n\nScott's testimony\nLater in the trial, Roberts participated in another event that had a major role in determining the outcome of the case. A certain black named George Washington Scott was going to offer testimony to the fact that he was at the scene of the battle on September 11, that he saw the men who shot Gorsuch, and that the group was organized to \"resist all slave holders\". When called upon to testify in court, however, he changed his story and claimed that he was not present that day (an admission that came as quite a surprise to the prosecuting attorneys). It turned out that the night before, Roberts had allowed several black men into the prison to \"converse\" with Scott.\nMaryland's Attorney General cried foul, and indirectly accused Marshal Roberts of witness tampering, citing the interesting fact that all of the black men in custody had a neat appearance except for Scott who was \"ragged, dirty, and filthy\". Despite protests from the prosecution, Scott maintained that he was not at the battle scene and that he had initially lied about being there because he was scared. In the end, Castner Hanway was acquitted. Since his was a test case, the prosecution decided not to prosecute the remaining cases.\n\nLate political career\nIn the 1854 congressional election, Thaddeus Stevens put his support behind Roberts as the Know-Nothing candidate for the congressional seat of the ninth district of Pennsylvania. The Whigs were appalled by Roberts' candidacy; an article in the Lancaster Examiner reflects this attitude:\n\nInconsistent in everything else, he is consistent only in his blind obedience to Thaddeus Stevens. If he is elected, we shall be represented by the shadow of Mr. Stevens without his brains.\nDespite such resistance to Anthony Roberts, on October 13, 1854, Roberts defeated his rival and relative, Isaac Ellmaker Hiester, by a vote of 6,561 to 5,371 (with 4,266 votes going to the Democratic nominee). Thus Roberts won Pennsylvania's Ninth District seat in the Thirty-Fourth Congress.\nThat same year, the Republican Party was beginning to form around the central tenet of stopping the spread of slavery. In 1855 and 1856, Roberts was among the leaders who established the Party in Pennsylvania, and he strongly advocated its principles. When his first term in Congress ended, he sought re-election as a Republican, and won a second term. During his second term he served on the Public Buildings and Grounds Committee. Altogether, he served in Congress from March 4, 1855, to March 3, 1859, as the first Republican to represent Lancaster County in Congress.\nHe was not a candidate for re-nomination in 1858. Roberts continued in politics as an active organizer of the Republican Party in Pennsylvania. He ran for Mayor of Lancaster in 1867, but was defeated by the Democratic candidate in a city that had strong Democratic support. Roberts' obituary, published in the Clarion on January 24, 1885, states that his actions in Congress \"were always true to his constituents\".\n\nOther activities\nRoberts active public life resulted in his appointment to many committees. In 1830 he was\npart of a committee to distribute remonstrances (protests) in Earl Township, in response to a proposal to form Conestoga County from parts of Lancaster, Chester, and Berks counties.\nOn April 5, 1841, Roberts was chosen as a secretary of a meeting in which citizens of Lancaster adopted resolutions to express their sorrow and grief over the unexpected death of President William Henry Harrison. On June 13, 1848, Roberts was appointed to a committee to solicit contributions to mitigate the losses suffered two weeks earlier in a devastating fire in Allentown. After the death of President James Buchanan in 1868, Roberts was appointed as one of the vice-presidents of a committee to arrange the president's funeral services. Roberts also served for a time as chairman of the visiting committee of the School Board in Lancaster.\nRoberts owned a lot of real estate in and near New Holland in Lancaster County. He seems to have used his real estate holdings to promote education and the general public welfare. On October 22, 1845, he bought a plot of ground with a brick house on it known as the Methodist Meeting House. Six years later he sold it to the Earl School District.\nIn 1850, he completed construction on what was then the largest dwelling in eastern Lancaster County. The construction's purpose was mysterious until its completion, when Roberts announced that a select school would be opened in part of his home. He also assisted in freeing many pieces of property from rent structures that harmed the common people dwelling in New Holland. In 1860, in the City of Lancaster, he was one of the incorporators of an institution dedicated to providing homes for poor and uncared for children. One biographer notes that \"[the common people of New Holland] looked upon him as their friend and champion of their rights\". As a close friend of Thaddeus Stevens, Roberts was designated one of the executors of Stevens' will.\n\nFamily and late life\nIn 1840, Anthony married Emma Bushong, who was about eighteen years his junior, and they had twelve children. Anthony died in Lancaster City on January 23, 1885, at the age of eighty-one. He was buried in Lancaster Cemetery. One biographer summarized his life as\n\ncharacterized by firmly-established principles of justice and right to his fellowmen, independent thought and action, and a wellbalanced, reading, and reasoning mind. Throughout life he has sought to fulfill the full duties of the citizen, and both in public and private life enjoyed the confidence of those who knew him.\nPassage 8:\nPlace of birth\nThe place of birth (POB) or birthplace is the place where a person was born. This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person. Practice regarding whether this place should be a country, a territory or a city/town/locality differs in different countries, but often city or territory is used for native-born citizen passports and countries for foreign-born ones.\nAs a general rule with respect to passports, if the place of birth is to be a country, it's determined to be the country that currently has sovereignty over the actual place of birth, regardless of when the birth actually occurred. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth.\nSome countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents. For example, Sweden has used the concept of födelsehemort (\"domicile of birth\") since 1947. This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant.\nSimilarly, Switzerland uses the concept of place of origin. A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother's or father's place of origin. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder's place of origin is stated, not their place of birth. In Japan, the registered domicile is a similar concept.\nIn some countries (primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase jus soli. Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality(-ies) of the baby's parents (referred to as jus sanguinis).\nThere can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality(-ies) of the parents and/or the location of the plane or ship (if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country).\nSome administrative forms may request the applicant's \"country of birth\". It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant's \"place of birth\" or \"nationality at birth\". For example, US citizens born abroad who acquire US citizenship at the time of birth, the nationality at birth will be USA (American), while the place of birth would be the country in which the actual birth takes place.\n\nReference list\n8 FAM 403.4 Place of Birth\nPassage 9:\nBeaulieu-sur-Loire\nBeaulieu-sur-Loire (French pronunciation: ​[boljø syʁ lwaʁ], literally Beaulieu on Loire) is a commune in the Loiret department in north-central France.

He competed at the 1972 Summer Olympics and the 1976 Summer Olympics.\nPassage 2:\nPaul de Longpré\nPaul de Longpré (1855–1911), was a French painter of flowers, who worked mainly in the United States.\n\nEarly life\nPaul de Longpré was born in Lyon, France, in 1855, and was an entirely self-taught artist. From age 12, he practiced successfully in Paris as a painter of fans. In 1876, at 21, he first exhibited at the Paris Salon. Having lost his money by the failure of a Paris bank, he moved in 1890 to New York City and in 1896 held an exhibition of flower paintings which secured him instant recognition.\n\nLife in Hollywood\nDe Longpré arrived in Los Angeles, Southern California with his family in 1899. Daeida Wilcox, with husband H. H. Wilcox the founders of Hollywood, was so eager to attract culture to the town that she gave him her homesite for his estate, three lots on Cahuenga on the north of Prospect (later Hollywood Boulevard), in exchange for three of his paintings.In 1901, Canadian architect Louis Bourgeois designed a landmark residence for the 3 acres (1.2 ha) estate, in the Mission Revival style. The house included an art gallery to sell prints of de Longpré's paintings, and was surrounded by the expansive \"Le Roi de Fleur\" flower gardens. Estate tours became a popular tourist destination off an exclusive Balloon Route trolley spur of the Los Angeles Pacific Railroad, that later became a Pacific Electric Redcar line, and with print sales additional sources of income for de Longpré.Paul de Longpré is listed in the 1900 US Census, Los Angeles City Ward 5, Precincts 38 B and 73 A, with his wife Josephine and daughters Blance, Alice, and Pauline. His occupation is listed as Artist, but the last name is misspelled as De Lonpre, It indicates Paul, Josephine, Blance, and Alice were born in France, and Pauline was born in New York City. The architect Louis Bourgeois also taught French to de Longpré's daughters, and later married his daughter Alice.Paul de Longpré died at home in Los Angeles at age 56, on 29 June 1911.Afterwards, the family moved back to France. The increased property values in rapidly developing Hollywood resulted in demolition of the gardens by 1924, and the house in 1927.\n\nWorks\nDe Longpré only painted specimens of flowers. With a delicacy of touch and feeling for color he united scientific knowledge and art. He also knew how to give expression to the subtle essence of the flowers. Painting floral scenes almost exclusively in watercolors, in the 1900s de Longpre found inspiration in the 4,000 rose bushes he planted on his Hollywood estate. The finest of his paintings include Double Peach Blossoms and White Fringed Poppies (1902) – both widely known through popular reproductions.\n\nLegacy\nIn present-day Hollywood, the street De Longpre Avenue, and De Longpre Park on it are both named for him.\nPassage 3:\nPaul de Scherff\nPaul de Scherff (14 July 1820 – 22 July 1894) was a Luxembourgian politician.\nDe Scherff was born in Frankfurt to F. H. W. von Scherff-Arnoldi, who was minister plenipotentiary of the King-Grand Duke to the German Federal Diet.  After studying law, Paul de Scherff came to Luxembourg. For six years he was avocat géneral, and later became president of the superior court, at the age of 34. From 24 June 1856 to 11 November 1858 he was Administrateur général (Minister) for Public Works and Railways in the Simons Ministry. From 1869 to 1871, and then again from 1886 to 1892 he was a member of the Chamber of Deputies for the Centre, and was President of the Chamber of Deputies from 1869 until 1872.When the walls of the fortress of Luxembourg were demolished in the 1870s and 1880s, Paul de Scherff was working in the ministry of public works, where he dealt with the building of the municipal parks.\nHe married Marie Pescatore on 14 September 1842, daughter of Constantin Jos. Antoine Pescatore and niece of Theodore Pescatore.  De Scherff was a practising member of the Reformed Church.\n\nFootnotes\nPassage 4:\nPaul de Cordon\nPaul de Cordon (born in 1908 in Toulouse - died in 1998 in Paris) was a French photographer known for his photographs of the circus and the Crazy Horse Saloon. He was also recognized for his portraits and his nudes for which he was, in 1964, considered one of the greatest photographers in the world together with Guy Bourdin and Lucien Clergue. He produced portraits of many personalities such as Johnny Hallyday, Gilbert Bécaud, Mireille Darc, Jacques Brel, Fernand Raynaud, Anna Karina, Samy Davis Jr., Jeanne Moreau, Steve McQueen and his long-time friends, Daniel Sorano and Jacques Dufilho as well as Gonzague Saint Bris with whom he was very close  and who nicknamed him “The Toulouse-Lautrec of photography’’. In 1961 he participated alongside Edouard Boubat, Agnès Varda, Man Ray, Frank Horvat, William Klein and Robert Doisneau in the mythical exhibition \"Metamorphosis and invention of a face\" around the portrait of Anne- Marie Edvina. He was also an equestrian, fashion and advertising photographer, notably for Nikon and Beaulieu. He collaborated with Europe 1 in the years 1960/70. Paul de Cordon even tried his hand at television by co-presenting the Cirques du Monde program with Jean Richard on channel A2. His works are present in prestigious collections such as those of the National Library of France (BNF), the Rodin museum and W.M. Hunt.\n\nEarly years\nPaul de Cordon was born in Toulouse. His father, Comte Pierre de Cordon, was a cavalry officer; his mother, Marthe de Boyer-Montegut, a cultivated, book-loving woman, was the daughter of Paul de Boyer- Montégut, who, for many years, was mayor of Cugnaux, near Toulouse, where he owned the château de Maurens.\nIt was in Maurens that Paul de Cordon, as a child, spent his holidays and it was there that he discovered horses which were to become one of the great passions of his life. His grandfather Boyer-Montegut was what was the French call, a “Homme de cheval’’ whose four-in-hand teams were renowned in Toulouse and across the region. As a child, he also lived for several years in Mainz (Germany), where his father was stationed after the First World War. It was around this time that he started taking pictures with a small camera, a gift from his parents. He learned the basic techniques from an old German photographer during long hours spent in his shop.\nIt was also in Germany where his attraction to the circus was born. The large travelling circuses, like Althoff, then crisscrossed the country with quality shows and numerous animals.\nAs a teenager, he was a boarder in a Paris school. He was then able to discover a very intense artistic and cultural life thanks to his aunt, the Marquise du Crozet, his mother's elder sister. He attended performances by Serge de Diaghilev's Ballets Russes which, after the war, came on tour every year to Paris. He went to the theater and visited exhibitions with his first cousin, Aimar du Crozet, who was much older than him and took him \"under his wing\" to serve as his guide to the Paris of the 1920s. Aimar du Crozet also had a passion for horses and races. He was the owner of Master Bob, who won the 1924 Paris Grand Steeple Chase * and who became so famous an athlete that he is mentioned by Ernest Hemingway at the start of his book ‘’Death in the Afternoon’’.\nAfter his studies Paul de Cordon enlisted in the 18th Dragons cavalry regiment. More than a true military vocation, it was once again the love of horses that motivated him.\nAt that time almost all the cavalry regiments were mounted and each maintained and trained horses to enter in show jumping events and steeple chases, in which both officers and noncommissioned officers participated. In the 1930s, he thus took part in dozens of races on tracks in France and across Europe.\nAfter the 18th Dragons he was assigned to the 2nd Hussards, in Tarbes, the “Chamborant’’, where he continued his favorite activities; training and riding horses. By an amusing coincidence, his great-grandmother on his mother’s side was Louise de Séganville, daughter of Colonel Baron de Séganville who had been the regiment’s commanding officer between 1813 and 1815.\nIt was at the 2nd Hussards that he had two encounters that would mean a lot in his life. He befriended Jacques Dufilho who, after interrupting his studies in dental prosthesis, had signed an eighteen-month enlistment contract. * Dufilho will become one of his dearest friends when they meet again after the war. There he also meets Jean Devaivre who completed his military service at “Chamborant’’. Jean Devaivre then went to work in cinema and became a great director, it was he who enabled Paul de Cordon, after the war, to embark on a new life.\nDevaivre was not only a cineaste but also an authentic character actor: working during the occupation for the German group Continental Films in Paris, he was at the same time a very active member of the French resistance. His exploits include flying from the Nevers region to London clandestinely after having made the journey from Paris to Nevers in the afternoon... by bicycle. Bertrand Tavernier's film “Laissez-passer’’ is directly inspired by his life, as recounted in his autobiography, “Action’’.\nIn 1939, the 2nd Hussards broke up into reconnaissance groups which took part in the 1940 battles on the Ardennes front, * Paul de Cordon participated in these actions in a mounted squadron and was taken prisoner by the Germans. He ended his captivity in the fortress of Colditz where he was liberated by the US military on April 16, 1945.\nIn 1945 he married Dilette de Rigaud de Vaudreuil and they had three children. He remained in the army for a few more months and was assigned to the Cadre Noir in Saumur.\n\nSecond life\nAfter a few months in Saumur, he decided to leave the army. In 1947 Jean Devaivre who had just directed “La dame d’onze heure\" with Paul Meurisse, a film of astonishing modernity, offered him a job as his assistant and Paul de Cordon accepted.\nHe was Devaivre’s first assistant director for “La ferme des sept péchés\" ( he was also the stuntman for scenes on horseback) and for \"Vendetta en Camargue\" where he reunited with Jacques Dufilho. At that time, in addition to being a stuntman he was also an acrobatic and burlesque dancer.\nAt the beginning of the 1950s, Paul de Cordon decided to become a professional photographer. He set up a studio in Paris and started developing relations with various clients in the press, advertising agencies, fashion designers, show business ...\nHe also began to develop a large-scale personal project on the circus and the Crazy Horse Saloon cabaret. He spent many nights with his camera at Medrano, at the Bouglione brothers' Cirque d’Hiver and at the Crazy Horse Saloon. Until the 1990s he also traveled the world to visit\ncircuses and bring back photos. Over these years, he has developed close ties with the great dynasties of the circus ring : Schumann, Rancy, Knie, Gruss, Bouglione, Houcke, Medrano, Fratellini etc ... In all these families the horse occupied a central role in their performances. This equestrian culture and Paul de Cordon’s experience as a horseman facilitated and consolidated links with all these artists and strengthened their mutual confidence and friendship. His taste for spectacle, ballets and theater helped him to appreciate and better understand the work represented by all these artists. During these years, in addition to his work as a photographer, Paul de Cordon wrote a lot about the circus and this is how the Swiss magazine “L’Année Hippique\" often published his articles on horses and circus equestrians.\n\nCircus instants\n\"Faced with this obstinate pursuit of the perfect gesture, I understood that I was living there what I had always sought: a circus moment\". “Instants de Cirque’’ is the title of Paul de Cordon's most famous book, which brings together a selection of images taken over more than thirty years and which he considered particularly representative. The book was edited by Bernard de Fallois who was also a circus lover and an admirer of Paul de Cordon's photos.\nThis book, published in 1977 by Le Chêne, allows us, with hindsight, to better understand the originality and peculiarity of Paul de Cordon’s photos. The circus is a subject that has greatly inspired photographers attracted by the spectacular and flashy nature of the circus ring. But there is no flashiness in the photos that appear there, they are intimate, shrouded in mystery, charged with a secret emotion. A photo of Gilbert Houcke with his tiger Prince illustrates their peculiarity well: there is no circus ring nor lights, we are backstage, the tamer wears a worn bathrobe, there is a sort of semi-darkness which brings out the eye of the tiger and his outstretched paw, claws extended, which he offers to the caress of the human hand. Few images make you feel with as much force the reciprocal respect and the affection that there can be between a wild beast and his tamer but also the formidable danger, the courage it takes to face it and the amount of work and humility that represent a successful act. This photo may not be what people call a circus photo, but it illustrates what Paul de Cordon called the “instant de cirque’’. Paul de Cordon had a great admiration for tamers and loved wild animals. He liked to enter their cages, accompanied by the tamer of course. He also\nchose to include on the jacket of his book, a photo of himself with the lionesses of Georges Marck, wearing the uniform of the 2nd Hussards. The photo was shot by his brother, Benoît de Cordon.\nPaul de Cordon was passionately fond of the circus, but he did not like being labeled as a circus photographer because the documentary aspect often linked to that genre and most often sought after by circophiles, was of no interest to him. What he was interested in and what he wanted to express in his photos was, he said, “the peculiarity of an artist, the very core of his art’’. He had an exceptional talent for capturing what others didn't always see, which is probably why so many circus performers wanted to be photographed by him.\n\nCrazy Horse Saloon\nPaul de Cordon met Alain Bernardin at the very beginning of the Crazy Horse Saloon.The old coal cellar on the avenue George V had just been converted into a micro cabaret. The former antique dealer who invented the most cerebral strip show in the world and the recently converted cavalry officer shared a common aversion for rules and conventions and were both attracted to show business and pretty women. The friendship between them that lasted many years was punctuated with sulking. They both had a touch of dandyism and a taste for beautiful fabrics and bespoke suits which led them to share a Russian tailor before he emigrated to Hollywood to dress movie stars. Paul de Cordon took hundreds of photos at the Paris cabaret which illustrate the long history of the place . There are also many images shot in the dressing rooms. They are more intimate, devoid of any sort of voyeurism and translate the total confidence of the dancers.This part of his work is less well known as it reveals a different face of his talent.\n\nPortraits\nPaul de Cordon is not considered a portrait photographer and yet, one realizes when looking at his work, that he also excelled in this particular art as evidenced by portraits of his friends the Gruss brothers, Alexis and André, of the clown Pipo and of Jean Houcke. His striking portrait of the actor Jacques Dufilho, in a black leather coat captures all the austerity and intelligence of this comedian. His portraits of pop stars are of interest in that they totally ignore the canons of the yé-yé aesthetic\nimposed by the iconic music magazine « Salut les copains » (Hello mates).\nPaul de Cordon worked regularly for advertising, fashion, and the press.\nIn advertising he worked for Nikon and Beaulieu shooting their ads and catalogues for several years.\nIn the press he began working for horse magazines. During the 60’s he did many jobs for the music press and for record companies including photos of pop groups, yé-yé stars, or even latin music groups (Chaussettes noires, Johnny Hallyday, Hugues Aufray, Françoise Hardy, Sylvie Vartan and los Machucambos).\nHe was also involved in fashion photography and participated for several years in the July fashion show marathons when Paris studios were overbooked for night photoshoots.\n\n3 zebras\nIn the contemporary world, images are everywhere, and some photos are more famous than their photographers. Everyone knows “Le baîser de l’hôtel de Ville’’ by Robert Doisneau, “Death of a republican soldier’’ by Robert Capa, or “Dovima and the elephants\" by Avedon. Paul de Cordon most famous photo, undoubtedly, is “Three zebras’’ which has been presented in all his exhibitions and appears, of course, in Instants de Cirque although it was not shot in a circus but at the Amsterdam Zoo in 1957. This photo was published worldwide, including in the American edition of Life in March 1962.\nPaul de Cordon died in March 1998 in Paris, two years before his wife, Dilette, who had accompanied him to circuses around the world. They are buried in Verneuil in the Nièvre. Paul de Cordon is the grandfather of Pierre-Elie de Pibrac, a photographer known in\nparticular for his work on the Paris Opera. Photos from his book “In Situ’’ (2014) have been exhibited in France and around the world. It was thanks to his grandfather with whom he was very close, that Pierre-Elie de Pibrac developed his vocation for photography.\n\nBooks by Paul de Cordon\nGirls of the Crazy Horse Saloon Verlagspresse 1971\nInstants de Cirque Edition du chêne 1977\nLe Cadre Noir Julliard 1981\nPassage 5:\nPaul De Keyser\nPaul De Keyser (born 7 February 1957) is a former Belgian racing cyclist. He rode in the 1980 Tour de France.\nPassage 6:\nCatherine I of Russia\nCatherine I Alekseevna Mikhailova (Russian: Екатери́на I Алексе́евна Миха́йлова, tr. Ekaterína I Alekséyevna Mikháylova; born Polish: Marta Helena Skowrońska, Russian: Ма́рта Самуи́ловна Скавро́нская, tr. Márta Samuílovna Skavrónskaya; 15 April [O.S. 5 April] 1684 – 17 May [O.S. 6 May] 1727) was the second wife and empress consort of Peter the Great, and empress regnant of Russia from 1725 until her death in 1727.\n\nLife as a servant\nThe life of Catherine I was said by Voltaire to be nearly as extraordinary as that of Peter the Great himself. Only uncertain and contradictory information is available about her early life. Said to have been born on 15 April 1684 (o.s. 5 April), she was originally named Marta Helena Skowrońska. Marta was the daughter of Samuel Skowroński (later spelled Samuil Skavronsky), a Roman Catholic farmer from the eastern parts of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, born to Minsker parents. In 1680 he married Dorothea Hahn at Jakobstadt. Her mother is named in at least one source as Elizabeth Moritz, the daughter of a Baltic German woman and there is debate as to whether Moritz's father was a Swedish officer. It is likely that two stories were conflated, and Swedish sources suggest that the Elizabeth Moritz story is probably incorrect. Some biographies state that Marta's father was a gravedigger and handyman, while others speculate that he was a runaway landless serf.\nMarta's parents died of the plague around 1689, leaving five children. According to one of the popular versions, at the age of three Marta was taken by an aunt and sent to Marienburg (the present-day Alūksne in Latvia, near the border with Estonia and Russia) where she was raised by Johann Ernst Glück, a Lutheran pastor and educator who was the first to translate the Bible into Latvian. In his household she served as a lowly servant, likely either a scullery maid or washerwoman.  No effort was made to teach her to read and write and she remained illiterate throughout her life.\nMarta was considered a very beautiful young girl, and there are accounts that Frau Glück became fearful that she would become involved with her son. At the age of seventeen, she was married off to a Swedish dragoon, Johan Cruse or Johann Rabbe, with whom she remained for eight days in 1702, at which point the Swedish troops were withdrawn from Marienburg. When Russian forces captured the town, Pastor Glück offered to work as a translator, and Field Marshal Boris Sheremetev agreed to his proposal and took him to Moscow.\nThere are unsubstantiated stories that Marta worked briefly in the laundry of the victorious regiment, and also that she was presented in her undergarments to Brigadier General Rudolph Felix Bauer, later the Governor of Estonia, to be his mistress. She may have worked in the household of his superior, Sheremetev. It is not known whether she was his mistress, or household maid.  She travelled back to the Russian court with Sheremetev's army.Afterwards she became part of the household of Prince Alexander Menshikov, who was the best friend of Peter the Great of Russia. Anecdotal sources suggest that she was purchased by him. Whether the two of them were lovers is disputed, as Menshikov was already engaged to Darya Arsenyeva, his future wife. It is clear that Menshikov and Marta formed a lifetime alliance.\nIt is possible that Menshikov, who was quite jealous of Peter's attentions and knew his tastes, wanted to procure a mistress on whom he could rely. In any case, in 1703, while visiting Menshikov at his home, Peter met Marta. In 1704, she was well established in the Tsar's household as his mistress, and gave birth to a son, Peter. In 1703, she converted to Orthodoxy and took the new name Catherine Alexeyevna (Yekaterina Alexeyevna). She and Darya Menshikova accompanied Peter and Menshikov on their military excursions.\n\nMarriage and family life\nThough no record exists, Catherine and Peter are described as having married secretly between 23 October and 1 December 1707 in Saint Petersburg. They had twelve children, two of whom survived into adulthood, Anna (born 1708) and Elizabeth (born 1709).\nPeter had moved the capital to St. Petersburg in 1703. While the city was being built he lived in a three-room log cabin with Catherine, where she did the cooking and caring for the children, and he tended a garden as though they were an ordinary couple. The relationship was the most successful of Peter's life and a great number of letters exist demonstrating the strong affection between Catherine and Peter. As a person she was very energetic, compassionate, charming, and always cheerful. She was able to calm Peter in his frequent rages and was often called in to do so.\nCatherine went with Peter on his Pruth Campaign in 1711. There, she was said to have saved Peter and his Empire, as related by Voltaire in his book Peter the Great. Surrounded by overwhelming numbers of Turkish troops, Catherine suggested before surrendering, that her jewels and those of the other women be used in an effort to bribe the Ottoman grand vizier Baltacı Mehmet Pasha into allowing a retreat.\nMehmet allowed the retreat, whether motivated by the bribe or considerations of trade and diplomacy. In any case Peter credited Catherine and proceeded to marry her again (this time officially) at Saint Isaac's Cathedral in St. Petersburg on 9 February 1712.  She was Peter's second wife; he had previously married and divorced Eudoxia Lopukhina, who had borne him the Tsarevich Alexis Petrovich. Upon their wedding, Catherine took on the style of her husband and became Tsarina. When Peter elevated the Russian Tsardom to Empire, Catherine became Empress. The Order of Saint Catherine was instituted by her husband on the occasion of their wedding.\n\nIssue\nCatherine and Peter had twelve children, all of whom died in childhood except Anna and Elizabeth:\n\nPeter Petrovich (1704–1707), died in infancy\nPaul Petrovich (October 1705–1707), died in infancy\nCatherine Petrovna (7 February 1707–7 August 1708)\nGrand Duchess Anna Petrovna (27 January 1708–15 May 1728)\nGrand Duchess Elizabeth Petrovna (29 December 1709–5 January 1762)\nGrand Duchess Mary Natalia Petrovna (20 March 1713–17 May 1715)\nGrand Duchess Margaret Petrovna (19 September 1714–7 June 1715)\nGrand Duke Peter Petrovich (9 November 1715–6 May 1719)\n\nGrand Duke Paul Petrovich (13 January 1717–14 January 1717)\nGrand Duchess Natalia Petrovna (31 August 1718–15 March 1725)\nGrand Duke Peter Petrovich (7 October 1723–7 October 1723)\nGrand Duke Paul Petrovich (1724–1724)\n\nSiblings\nUpon Peter's death, Catherine found her four siblings, Krystyna, Anna, Karol, and Fryderyk, gave them the newly created titles of Count and Countess, and brought them to Russia.\n\nKrystyna Skowrońska, renamed Christina (Russian: Христина) Samuilovna Skavronskaya (1687–14 April 1729), had married Simon Heinrich (Russian: Симон Гейнрих) (1672–1728) and their descendants became the Counts Gendrikov.\nAnna Skowrońska, renamed Anna Samuilovna Skavronskaya, had married one Michael-Joachim N and their descendants became the Counts Efimovsky.\nKarol Skowroński, renamed Karel Samuilovich Skavronsky, was created a Count of the Russian Empire on 5 January 1727 and made a Chamberlain of the Imperial Court; he had married Maria Ivanovna, a Russian woman, by whom he had descendants who became extinct in the male line with the death of Count Paul Martinovich Skavronskyi (1757-1793), father of Princess Catherine Bagration.\nFryderyk Skowroński, renamed Feodor Samuilovich Skavronsky, was created a Count of the Russian Empire on 5 January 1727 and was married twice: to N, a Lithuanian woman, and to Ekaterina Rodionovna Saburova, without having children by either of them.\n\nReign as empress regnant\nCatherine was crowned in 1724. The year before his death, Peter and Catherine had an estrangement over her support of Willem Mons, brother of Peter's former mistress Anna, and brother to one of the current ladies in waiting for Catherine, Matryona. He served as Catherine's secretary. Peter had fought his entire life to clear up corruption in Russia. Catherine had a great deal of influence over who could gain access to her husband. Willem Mons and his sister Matryona had begun selling their influence to those who wanted access to Catherine and, through her, to Peter. Apparently this had been overlooked by Catherine, who was fond of both. Peter found out and had Willem Mons executed and his sister Matryona exiled. He and Catherine did not speak for several months. Rumors flew that she and Mons had had an affair, but there is no evidence for this.\nPeter died (28 January 1725 Old Style) without naming a successor. Catherine represented the interests of the \"new men\", commoners who had been brought to positions of great power by Peter based on competence. A change of government was likely to favor the entrenched aristocrats. For that reason during a meeting of a council to decide on a successor, a coup was arranged by Menshikov and others in which the guards regiments with whom Catherine was very popular proclaimed her the ruler of Russia. Supporting evidence was \"produced\" from Peter's secretary Makarov and the Bishop of Pskov, both \"new men\" with motivation to see Catherine take over. The real power, however, lay with Menshikov, Peter Tolstoy, and other members of the Supreme Privy Council.\nCatherine viewed the deposed empress Eudoxia as a threat, so she secretly moved her to Shlisselburg Fortress near St. Petersburg to be put in a secret prison under strict custody as a state prisoner.\n\nDeath\nCatherine I died two years after Peter I, on 17 May 1727 at age 43, in St. Petersburg, where she was buried at St. Peter and St. Paul Fortress. Tuberculosis, diagnosed as an abscess of the lungs, caused her early demise.\nBefore her death she recognized Peter II, the grandson of Peter I and Eudoxia, as her successor.\n\nAssessment and legacy\nCatherine was the first woman to rule Imperial Russia, opening the legal path for a century almost entirely dominated by women, including her daughter Elizabeth and granddaughter-in-law Catherine the Great, all of whom continued Peter the Great's policies in modernizing Russia.  At the time of Peter's death the Russian Army, composed of 130,000 men and supplemented by another 100,000 Cossacks, was easily the largest in Europe.  However, the expense of the military was proving ruinous to the Russian economy, consuming some 65% of the government's annual revenue.  Since the nation was at peace, Catherine was determined to reduce military expenditure.  For most of her reign, Catherine I was controlled by her advisers.  However, on this single issue, the reduction of military expenses, Catherine was able to have her way.  The resulting tax relief on the peasantry led to the reputation of Catherine I as a just and fair ruler.The Supreme Privy Council concentrated power in the hands of one party, and thus was an executive innovation. In foreign affairs, Russia reluctantly joined the Austro-Spanish league to defend the interests of Catherine's son-in-law, the Duke of Holstein, against Great Britain.\nCatherine gave her name to Catherinehof near St. Petersburg, and built the first bridges in the new capital. She was also the first royal owner of the Tsarskoye Selo estate, where the Catherine Palace still bears her name.\nThe city of Yekaterinburg is named after her, Yekaterina being the Russian form of her name.\nShe also gave her name to the Kadriorg Palace (German: Katharinental, meaning \"Catherine's Valley\"), its adjacent Kadriorg Park and the later Kadriorg neighbourhood of Tallinn, Estonia, which today houses the Presidential Palace of Estonia. The name of the neighbourhood is also used as a metonym for the institution of the President.\nIn general, Catherine's policies were reasonable and cautious.  The story of her humble origins was considered by later generations of tsars to be a state secret.\n\nSee also\nBibliography of Russian history (1613–1917)\nRulers of Russia family tree\n\nNotes\nPassage 7:\nLyudmyla Olyanovska\nLyudmyla Olyanovska (Ukrainian: Людмила Оляновська; born 20 February 1993, in Kyiv) is a Ukrainian race walker.\n\nCareer\nShe won the bronze medal in the 20 kilometer racewalking event at the 2015 World Championships in Athletics in Beijing, China.\nIn 2014, she won the silver medal in the 20 kilometres racewalking event at the 2014 European Championships in Athletics.\nIn February 2017, she was disqualified for doping rules violation for four years since 30 November 2015 until 29 November 2019.\n\nNational records\nShe holds three national records in racewalking:\nPassage 8:\nAntoine Pescatore\nConstantin-Joseph-Antoine Pescatore, known as Antoine Pescatore, was born on 16 December 1787 in Luxembourg City, and died on 31 October 1858 in Sandweiler.

He later changed his surname to \"de Maleingreau\". From 1905 to 1912 he studied at the Brussels Conservatory where his principal teachers were Alfons Desmet, Paul Gilson and Edgar Tinel. He began teaching at the Conservatory in 1913 and was professor of organ (succeeding Desmet) from 1929 until 1953.  His pupils included Pierre Froidebise, Charles Koenig, Robert Kohnen, Marcel Druart, Paul Sprimont and Herman Roelstraete.\nIn 1921 and 1922 he was the first to play Bach’s complete organ works in Brussels.\nGregorian plainsong forms the basis of most of Malengreau’s compositions, and indeed part of his output is intended for the liturgy. He also wrote programme music, his organ symphonies being inspired by paintings by Rogier van der Weyden and the van Eyck brothers.

In 1893 he won a scholarship for composition to the Royal College of Music.\nIn his early twenties he contributed to The Scottish Students' Song Book, with three of his own song compositions and numerous arrangements.\nBy the end of 1897 he had published dozens of songs, such as Sir Patrick Spens, The Death of Cuthullin, an album of his own compositions, and arrangements of ten songs by Samuel Lover.\nHe then, living in London, turned his attention to staged musical comedy, co-creating, with Adrian Ross, The Tree Dumas Skiteers, a skit, based on Sydney Grundy's The Musketeers that starred Herbert Beerbohm Tree. He co-composed with Howard Talbot the successful Kitty Grey (1900).He continued to write songs and to receive recognition for them. The 1901 and 1902 BBC Promenade Concerts, \"The Proms\", included four of his compositions, namely Come back, sweet Love, The Mermaid, My Peggy and Private Donald.\nHis setting of My Ships, a poem by Ella Wheeler Wilcox, was performed by Clara Butt and republished several times. It also appeared four times, with different singers, in the 1913 and 1914 Proms.\n\nAmerica\nIn September 1904 he went to live in New York City, finding employment with shows on Broadway, including the following roles:\n\non-stage actor (Sir Benjamin Backbite) in Lady Teazle (1904-1905), a musical version of The School for Scandal;\nmusical director of The Little Michus (1907), also featuring songs by Barratt;\nco-composer of Miss Pocahontas (1907), a musical comedy;\nmusical director of The Love Cure (1909–1910), a musical romance;\ncomposer of The Girl and the Drummer (1910), a musical romance with book by George Broadhurst.

In 1924, he became a naturalized American citizen. He died on 12 April 1947 in New York City.\n\nNote on his first name\nThe book British Musical Biography by Brown & Stratton (1897) in its entry for John Barratt refers to \"his son William Augustus Barratt\" with details that make it clear that Walter Augustus Barratt is the same person and that a \"William\" Augustus Barratt is a mistake.

The film charts the fictional music career of Denise Waverly, an aspiring singer who writes for other artists in the pop music world of the mid-1960s. It premiered at the 1996 Toronto International Film Festival and went into limited release on September 13, 1996. \nThe soundtrack features artists Burt Bacharach, Elvis Costello, Joni Mitchell, Gerry Goffin and Jill Sobule, replicating the musical style that emerged from the Brill Building, New York City's  music factory in the heyday of girl groups and \"pre-fab\" acts like The Monkees.\n\nPlot\nIn 1958, Philadelphia steel heiress Edna Buxton enters and wins a talent contest. When she attempts to record a demo, a studio producer tells her that girl singers are not currently getting signed and record companies are even trying to get rid of the ones on their rosters. However, when Edna tells him that she wrote the song she wants to record, he is impressed enough to direct her to producer Joel Milner, who takes her under his wing, renames her \"Denise Waverly\" and invents a blue-collar persona for her. Milner reworks her song for a male doo-wop group, the Stylettes, as male groups are far more marketable, and the song becomes a hit.\nDenise moves to New York City and becomes a songwriter in the Brill Building. At a party, she meets the arrogant songwriter Howard Caszatt, and despite an awkward initial meeting, they begin a relationship. Denise offers to write a song specifically for her three girlfriends, which culminates in Joel auditioning the girls and creating the girl group the Luminaries. Howard and Denise also begin writing together and eventually get married and have a child. They pen a song called “Unwanted Number,” based on a young girl's unwanted pregnancy. Although it is banned from radio, it attracts the attention of prominent and influential disc jockey John Murray, who, despite the negative attention around the song, credits Denise with sparking the girl group craze.\nJoel recruits the beautiful English songwriter Cheryl Steed, who immediately catches Howard's eye, and initially, Denise's disdain. Cheryl diffuses Denise’s suspicion by informing her that she already has a songwriting partner – her husband Matthew. Joel tasks Denise and Cheryl with writing a song for the ingénue singer Kelly Porter. The two women bond over the realization that the young songstress is in a closeted lesbian relationship with her roommate Marion. They write the coded song \"My Secret Love\" for Kelly, which becomes a hit.\nDenise’s relationship with Howard becomes strained due to his philandering with other women. When she learns she is pregnant with Howard's second baby, Cheryl convinces her to see an obstetrician, who safely performs an illegal abortion. Denise and Cheryl then become close friends and Denise eventually breaks up with Howard.\nIn 1966, Milner offers to send Denise to the studio to sing for herself. As an added incentive, he offers the production assistance of Jay Phillips, the frontman of California rock group the Riptides, to produce her single. Although initially hesitant as she says she finds the whole \"surf and turf\" sound laughable, she writes and sings the song \"God Give Me Strength\" and is delighted by Jay's skillful orchestral arrangement. The record she puts out with him, however, is a commercial failure. Between the loss suffered by her foundering single and the advent of the British Invasion, Milner's fortunes are depleted. Denise blames herself for making the song too personal and bankrupting Joel. He tells her she did more for him than she realized and that it was time for them both to move on.\nDenise and Jay become a couple and resettle in California. Jay treats Denise’s daughter Luna as his own, but he is reclusive and a user of recreational drugs like marijuana and peyote. Denise has since joined forces with the newly-divorced Cheryl to write songs for a bubblegum pop TV show, Where the Action Is, though Jay insists to Denise that writing music for TV is beneath her.\nJay's behavior becomes more erratic and he becomes increasingly paranoid, causing his bandmates to distance themselves from him. He falls into a period of deep depression that seemingly abates after a visit from his friend \"Jonesy\", who reminds him of the things that are important in his life, including his \"groovy new old lady\", Denise.\nThinking that the worst is over, Denise invites Jay to join her and Cheryl at the Whisky a Go Go to see Doris, a former Luminary member who embarked on a solo career after the girl group broke up, perform. Jay declines, saying he has a song idea he wants to explore, so Denise ends up going with Cheryl. While the women celebrate, Jay is revealed to be still in the throes of his depression; having put on a brave face for Denise's benefit. He walks into the ocean, taking his own life. Denise is further distraught to discover that Jay's fans blame her for not intervening in his death.\nNumbed by the loss, Denise retires with her family to a hippie commune in northern California and tries to make sense of everything that has happened. Some time later, Joel visits Denise at the commune and takes her and the children to dinner. That night, he criticizes how far down she's allowed her grieving to take her and says that it's destroying her and her talent. Denise angrily lashes out, telling Milner that he'd be nothing without her success. He agrees; however, the more he agrees with her, the angrier she becomes. She strikes him then collapses in tears, grieving for Jay. Milner consoles her and the two are reconciled.\nWith Joel's help, Denise creates the platinum-selling work \"Grace of My Heart\". As she lays down the piano track for the song, her life is recounted in pictures, leading to the moment when her own mother receives a copy of her album in the mail with a handwritten note. Seemingly proud of her daughter's success, she smiles.\n\nCast\nProduction\nThe story is loosely based on the career arc of singer-songwriter Carole King, who, like Denise, started out writing songs in the Brill Building for artists like Aretha Franklin, The Drifters, and Little Eva. The character Jay Phillips is loosely modeled on Brian Wilson of The Beach Boys.Allison Anders said she was inspired to make the film as a fan of the girl group The Shangri-Las. She was also inspired by the Alan Betrock book Girl Groups: The Story of A Sound, which contained photos of \"Carole King and Gerry Goffin then others like Cynthia Weil and Barry Mann...it was interesting to read what Alan had to say about what that time was like back then and how they were all really just kids when they had been a part of that.\"Martin Scorsese is credited as Grace of My Heart's executive producer, and the film is co-edited by Scorsese’s longtime editor Thelma Schoonmaker.\n\nReception\nRelease\nGrace of My Heart debuted at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 8, 1996. It was theatrically released a few days later on September 13, 1996, just weeks ahead of Oscar-winning actor Tom Hanks' directorial debut That Thing You Do!, which also covered the early to mid-1960s pop music scene and featured original, retro-styled songs on the soundtrack. Grace of My Heart grossed $660,313 worldwide.\n\nCritical response\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 79% of 28 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 6.9/10.David Ansen of Newsweek praised the film and wrote while it \"is not the smoothest trip\" story-wise, \"Anders's rough edges are more than offset by the story's contagious vitality...Denise's funky journey to self-discovery is a fresh feminist take on an era that has always been seen through men's eyes. It may not be precision-tooled, but it's triumphantly alive.\"Time Out wrote, \"There's a lovely sequence about a third of the way into Anders' delightful movie which follows a song from conception - the street scene that inspires it - through the writing, to the recording session. This seamlessly edited passage swings like the snappy '60s girl pop it emulates. Like the film as a whole, it works as a musical in its own right, and as history and critique of the pop process.\"\nCritics roundly praised the film's music, particularly the Brill Building scenes, and lauded the film's approach of pairing popular songwriters of the 1960s with contemporary artists. Mark Caro of the Chicago Tribune wrote:What Anders captures is the feel of the time: the nervous thrill of singing a song you love; the sanctified atmosphere of a recording studio, with red padded walls that match the singer's lipstick and a slit of a window that reveals a live bassist; the songwriter's excitement in realizing that songs can be about people's actual lives and still be commercial; the breathlessness of keeping up with an industry that may love a cappella vocal groups one day and rock bands the next.Criticism centered on the film's shift of the action from New York City to California to center on Denise's relationship with Jay, with many arguing it is where the story loses focus. Roger Ebert praised the music and Douglas' performance, but said Anders tries to cover too much ground and would have liked a less condensed story.In a 2020 episode of his podcast Kermode on Film, film critic Mark Kermode named Grace of My Heart number one on his countdown of the top five most underrated films of all time. Jim Hemphill of Filmmaker wrote the film \"feels both completely of the period in which it takes place and like something that could only have been made in the mid-1990s, an age when the American independent film movement and the studio system intersected in a way that allowed auteurs like Anders to broaden their ambitions and expand their canvasses.\"\n\nMusic\nActress Douglas’ singing voice is dubbed by singer Kristen Vigard, while the fictional Luminaries are dubbed by girl group For Real.In the beginning, Edna/Denise performs a version of \"Hey There\", from the musical The Pajama Game, and popularized by singers such as Rosemary Clooney. Another of Denise's big musical moments occurs in the studio to sing tracks for \"God Give Me Strength\", an expensively produced single that fails to generate excitement on the charts, alluding to Phil Spector's recording of \"River Deep – Mountain High\" for Tina Turner (written by Spector, Ellie Greenwich and Jeff Barry). Singer Elvis Costello, who co-wrote \"God Give Me Strength\" with Burt Bacharach for the film, also wrote \"Unwanted Number\", which is crafted by Denise and Cazsatt for the Luminaries and causes a scandal due to its story of a young, unmarried mother.Singer-composer Lesley Gore co-wrote the song \"My Secret Love\", performed by the character of young singer Kelly Porter. Gore chose not to be credited as a co-writer because she felt she'd \"been brought in too late for a real collaboration\" and was not invited to the film's New York City premiere, a logistical oversight Anders regretted.\n\nSoundtrack\nThe soundtrack was released in September 1996 by MCA Records. It was produced by Larry Klein, Joni Mitchell's former husband and producer. Klein contributed to the writing of several songs on the soundtrack and appears briefly in the movie as a recording engineer. \nJoni Mitchell contributed the song \"Man from Mars\", which is performed by Vigard as heard in the fillm. The soundtrack's initial pressing of 40,000 CD copies contained a version featuring Mitchell's vocals instead of Vigard's. This CD was recalled and re-released a week later with Vigard's vocal restored. Mitchell later re-recorded the song with different-styled music for her 1998 album Taming the Tiger.\n\nOther songs\nSeveral songs did not make the album soundtrack, such as both of Vigard's renditions of \"Hey There\"—the contest version and the polished demo. Her version of \"In Another World\" is swapped out for the fictional Stylettes' rendition (via Portrait). Vigard's \"God Give Me Strength\" is also swapped for the Costello/Bacharach version. \"A Wave Dies\", written and performed by Andrew Allen-King and produced by Klein, was also not included in the final cut. The Williams Brothers perform two songs, \"Heartbreak Kid\" and \"Love Doesn't Ever Fail Us\", but only the latter is on the album.\n\nHome media\nGrace of My Heart was released as a Blu-ray Collector’s Edition by Scorpion Releasing on November 17, 2020. The Blu-ray includes an audio commentary by Anders and a making-of featurette.\nPassage 5:\nPiece of My Heart (disambiguation)\n\"Piece of My Heart\" is a song written by Jerry Ragovoy and Bert Berns, best known through performances by Janis Joplin.\nPiece of My Heart may also refer to:\n\nFilm and television\nPiece of My Heart (film), a 2009 New Zealand film\nA Piece of My Heart (film), a 2019 Swedish film\n\"Piece of My Heart\" (Grey's Anatomy), a television episode\n\nLiterature\nPiece of My Heart (novel), a 2006 Inspector Banks novel by Peter Robinson\nPiece of My Heart, a 2020 Under Suspicion novel by Mary Higgins Clark and Alafair Burke\nA Piece of My Heart, a 1976 novel by Richard Ford\n\nMusic\n\"Piece of My Heart\" (Intermission song), 1993\n\"Piece of My Heart\" (Tara Kemp song), 1991\nPiece of My Heart, a 1996 album by Faith Hill\n\"A Piece of My Heart\", a song by Gang of Four from Hard\nPiece of My Heart: The Bert Berns Story, a 2014 jukebox musical\nPassage 6:\nKing of My Heart\nKing of My Heart may refer to:\n\n\"King of My Heart\", a song by Taylor Swift from Reputation (2017)\n\"King of My Heart\", a song by Tara Dettman from Sea to Sea: I See the Cross (2005)\n\"King of My Heart\", a song by Bethel Music from Starlight (2017)\n\"King of My Heart\", a song by Leeland from Invisible (2016)\n\"King of My Heart\", a song from the 2007 London revival of Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat\n\"King of My Heart\", a song by Melba Moore from Read My Lips (1985)\nPassage 7:\nBurden of My Heart\nBurden of My Heart (Sydämeni taakka) is a 2011 Finnish documentary film about the surviving victims of the genocide in Rwanda.

The documentary also received the Jury Youth Prize and Best Domestic Documentary Award at the Tempo film festival in Finland.\nPassage 8:\nFrom the Bottom of My Heart\nFrom the Bottom of My Heart may refer to:\n\n\"From the Bottom of My Heart\" (Chuck Willis song), recorded by both The Clovers and The Diamonds\n\"From the Bottom of My Heart\" (Stevie Wonder song), 2006\nPassage 9:\nAllison Anders\nAllison Anders (born November 16, 1954) is an American independent film director whose films include Gas Food Lodging, Mi Vida Loca and Grace of My Heart. Anders has collaborated with fellow UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television graduate Kurt Voss and has also worked as a television director. Anders' films have been shown at the Cannes International Film Festival and at the Sundance Film Festival. She has been awarded a MacArthur Genius Grant as well as a Peabody Award.\n\nEarly life\nAnders was born in Ashland, Kentucky, to mother Alberta \"Rachel\" Anders (née Steed) and father Robert \"Bob\" Anders. She has four sisters, one of whom, Luanna Anders, starred in her first film, Border Radio. Her paternal side has ancestry that traces back to the Southern Hatfield family and, more distantly, to George Washington's spy, Caleb Brewster, while her maternal side includes another Washington spy, Abraham Woodhull.When Anders was 4 years old, her father abandoned the family. Anders' mother and father were divorced when she was 5.  At age 12, she was gang raped by three boys at a party in Cape Canaveral, Florida, an event that influenced several of her films. After her mother moved her and her sisters to Los Angeles, Anders suffered a mental breakdown at the age of 15 and was hospitalized. When she came out of the psychiatric ward, she was placed into foster care but ran away. She hitchhiked across the country, at one point ending up in jail. After turning 17, Anders dropped out of her Los Angeles high school and moved back to Kentucky. She later moved to London with the man who fathered her first child.In her early 20s, Anders moved back to Los Angeles with her daughter and attended junior college, Los Angeles Valley College, while working odd jobs. Due to constant relocation as a child, Anders had not had a steady education. She said that growing up, most of her time was spent watching TV and going to movie theaters. Inspired by the films of Wim Wenders and other filmmakers, Anders applied to UCLA Film School. During her time at UCLA, Anders produced her first sound film. Wenders attended the screening. She has called Wenders' 1974 film Alice in the Cities \"one of my very favorite films, and a guiding light, since I first saw it at the Nuart in Santa Monica in the 1970s.\" In 1986, Anders got her B.A. in Motion Picture-Television from the University of California Los Angeles.\n\nCareer\nFilm\nIn 1986, Anders won a Samuel Goldwyn Writing Award for a script called Lost Highway that she wrote about her father. She said that after writing the script she shared it with her father, and was able to have a relationship with him again.Anders' first film, the punk music-heavy Border Radio, was co-written and co-directed with Kurt Voss and Dean Lent and was made while they were at UCLA. It was nominated for Best Feature of 1988 by the Independent Feature Project for Best First Feature. The film told the story of three musicians who stole money owed to them from a job and then fled to Mexico. The story is set amid the Los Angeles punk-rock scene of the 1980s. With a $2,000 contribution from actor Vic Tayback and loans from Voss's parents to fund the film, the filmmakers made up for the small budget by using local locations and casting performers they knew. For the starring role, they cast Anders' sister, Luanna Anders, and musician Chris D., as the leading man, as well as Anders' daughter, Devon Anders, who played Luanna's daughter in the film. Violating UCLA policy, the filmmakers cut the film at night in the school's editing bays, while Anders' two young daughters slept on the floor. In 2007, Border Radio was given a special release on DVD as part of the Criterion Collection and was lauded as groundbreaking independent cinema.Anders' second feature, the 1992 film Gas Food Lodging, earned her a New York Film Critics Circle Award and National Society of Film Critics honors for Best New Director; and nominations from the Independent Spirit Awards for Best Screenplay and Best Director. Actress Fairuza Balk won a Spirit Award for her role in the film. The film also won the Deauville Film Festival Critics Award and was also nominated for the Golden Bear at the 42nd Berlin International Film Festival. Gas Food Lodging is a coming-of-age story about a truck stop waitress and her two daughters, three vibrant, restless women in an isolated Western town. The screenplay was loosely adapted by Anders from the novel Don't Look and It Won't Hurt by Richard Peck.Her next film, Mi Vida Loca (My Crazy Life), was about girl gangs in the poor Hispanic Echo Park neighborhood of Los Angeles, where Anders lived. It premiered at the Cannes Film Festival in 1993, and saw wide release in 1994. The story features a female perspective on growing up in the inner city.\nAnders' 1996 film, Grace of My Heart, was a musical drama executive produced by Martin Scorsese, about a songwriter (played by Illeana Douglas) and her career over several years, including work in the early 1960s in music publishing and production offices, a setting based on the Brill Building. This marriage to a songwriting partner and her emergence as a singer-songwriter in the 1970s are among elements paralleling the career of Carole King, but the film is neither a biography nor entirely fiction. The original soundtrack features new songs written in various styles of the era. Elvis Costello and Burt Bacharach had their first collaboration composing a song for the film, \"God Give Me Strength,\" and were nominated for a Grammy Award.\nIn the late 1980s, Anders had become friends with members of pop group Duran Duran, and frequently inserted small references to the band in her films (character names, posters on walls, and so on). In 1999, after bassist John Taylor had left Duran Duran and was beginning to launch an acting career, she and Voss co-wrote and co-directed Sugar Town, about the Los Angeles film and music industry. The film starred several musical friends of Anders', including Taylor, X singer John Doe, Spandau Ballet bassist Martin Kemp, and singer/actor Michael Des Barres. Sugar Town followed the interconnected lives of a handful of power brokers, wanna-bes and has-beens. Gwen (played by Jade Gordon), a self-centered would-be rock star, is working as an assistant to production designer Liz (Ally Sheedy); when Gwen discovers Liz has a date with a music producer (Larry Klein), any loyalty she has to her boss disappears. The film received two Independent Spirit Award nominations, for Best Film and Best Newcomer (Jade Gordon). The film also won Anders and Voss the Fantasporto award for Best Screenplay.Her 2001 autobiographical film, Things Behind the Sun, deals with the long-term aftermath of rape. It was released on the Showtime cable TV network. The film earned an Emmy nomination for actor Don Cheadle as Best Supporting Actor; and three Independent Spirit Award nominations: Cheadle for Best Supporting Actor, Kim Dickens for Best Actress, and Best Film. Anders and co-writer Kurt Voss also received a nomination for an Edgar Award. The film was awarded the SHINE Award as well as the Peabody Award. Things Behind the Sun was inspired by an experience Anders had in 1967 when she was raped by a group of boys. Anders actually shot some of the film in the same location in Cocoa Beach, Florida, where the gang rape occurred.Anders' 2012 film, Strutter, co-directed with Voss, completed a loose trilogy of films about Southern California musicians that began with Border Radio and Sugar Town. A black-and-white road picture, the film featured Luanna Anders from Border Radio, a scene in the motel room where Gram Parsons died, and a score with music by Ariel Pink and J Mascis. The film was funded by a Kickstarter campaign.In 2013, Anders released the Lifetime-produced TV movie Ring of Fire, a June Carter Cash biopic that featured the musician Jewel. The film was inspired by John Carter Cash's book, Anchored in Love: A Tribute to June Carter Cash.\n\nTelevision\nAnders began directing shows for broadcast and cable television in 1999, including several episodes in the second and third seasons of Sex and the City, as well as episodes of Grosse Pointe, Cold Case, The L Word, Men In Trees, The Mentalist, and What About Brian?\nIn 2011, she directed an episode of the John Wells production, Southland, which involved a car chase scene. Anders directed an episode of Turn: Washington's Spies, which was especially interesting to her because she has distant relatives on both sides of her family who were spies for George Washington.\n\nOther work\nIn 2013, Anders interviewed 94-year-old actress and Hollywood legend Marge Champion, who appeared at a 2013 Hollywood film festival screening of 1968 cult film The Swimmer, which starred Burt Lancaster. The interview was featured among behind-the-scenes supplementary material on a 2014 Blu-ray/DVD release of the film by Grindhouse Releasing/Box Office Spectaculars Blu-ray/DVD restoration of the film.Anders and her musician daughter, Tiffany Anders, started the Don't Knock the Rock Film and Music Festival in 2003 in Los Angeles.In 2006, she appeared in the road-trip documentary Wanderlust. Anders has also contributed to the web series Trailers from Hell.\nIn 2013, Anders bid on and won a rock and roll record collection formerly owned by the actress Greta Garbo. She created a website called \"Greta's Records\" to curate and share the collection of 50 records.\n\nIn development / past projects\nQuanah Parker project at AMC Networks with writer Terry Graham\n\nLong-term associations\nAnders counts filmmaker Wim Wenders as a mentor. She started as a fan, sending him letters and music, and Wenders eventually responded. Anders said that she created a faux grant that she \"won\" so that she and at least one other friend could study under Wenders on location for his film Paris, Texas. They have been friends for over 30 years.\n\nTeaching\nIn 2003, Anders became a Distinguished Professor at the University of California Santa Barbara, where she teaches in the Film And Media Studies Department one quarter each year. She has taught courses on topics including autobiographic writing, rock and roll films, and music supervision.\n\nAwards\n1986: Nicholl Fellowships in Screenwriting – Lost Highway\n1986: Samuel Goldwyn Writing Awards – Lost Highway\n1988: Independent Spirit Awards for Best First Feature – Border Radio\n1992: New York Film Critics Circle for Best New Director – Gas Food Lodging\n1992: National Society of Film Critics for Best New Director – Gas Food Lodging\n1992: Independent Spirit Awards for Best Screenplay nomination – Gas Food Lodging\n1992: Independent Spirit Awards for Best Director nomination – Gas Food Lodging\n1995: MacArthur Fellows Program\n2001: Independent Spirit Award for Best Film nomination – Things Behind the Sun\n2002: Spirit of Silver Lake Award from the Silver Lake Film Festival\n2002: Peabody Award for distinguished achievement and meritorious service – Things Behind the Sun\n2013: Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Directing of a Drama nomination – Ring of Fire\n\nPersonal life\nAnders has three children.

{"input": "Where was the father of Bonne Of Bourbon born?", "context": "Passage 1:\nBeatrice of Bourbon, Queen of Bohemia\nBeatrice of Bourbon (1320 – 23 December 1383) was a French noblewoman. A member of the House of Bourbon, she was by marriage Queen of Bohemia and Countess of Luxembourg.\nShe was the youngest daughter of Louis I, Duke of Bourbon, and Mary of Avesnes.\n\nLife\nMarriage\nOn 28 September 1330, Queen Elisabeth of Bohemia, wife of King John of Bohemia, died:\n\n\"The news was that the King, distraught for the loss of his wife manifested his feelings using mourning clothes, after all, they were married for twenty years, and yet remained completely himself with a brief time, this was in Bohemia, the other side used to be mostly in their county or elsewhere, where he discussed the matter.\"Despite the fact that John and Elisabeth became estranged during the last years of their marriage, the king remained a widower for the next four years. The French King Philip VI wanted to tie John more closely with France, and he suggested to the Bohemian king a second marriage. The proposed bride was Beatrice, youngest daughter of the Duke of Bourbon and member of a cadet branch of the House of Capet. Beatrice was already betrothed, however, to Philip, the second son of Philip I, Prince of Taranto, as of 29 May 1321. The engagement was broken soon after the marriage negotiations with Bohemia started.\nThe marriage of King John of Bohemia and Beatrice of Bourbon was solemnized in the Château de Vincennes in December 1334, at which time she was fourteen years old. But because the two were related in a prohibited degree (they were second cousins through their common descent from Henry V, Count of Luxembourg, and his wife Margaret of Bar), Pope Benedict XII had to give dispensation for the marriage, which was granted in Avignon on 9 January 1335 at the request of Philip VI.\nThe marriage contract stipulated that if a son was born from the marriage, the County of Luxembourg (King John's paternal heritage), as well as lands belonging to it, would go to him. King John's sons from his first marriage, Charles and John Henry, were not informed of the contents of the marriage contract, but both princes were compelled to accept it along with the knights and citizens of Luxembourg in August 1335.\n\nLife in Bohemia\nBeatrice arrived in Bohemia on 2 January 1336:\n\n\"...our father came to Bohemia and brought him a wife, named Beatrix, daughter of the Duke of Bourbon and relative of the King of the Frenchs...\"In the Bohemian court, Beatrice took care of the wife of her oldest stepson Charles, Blanche of Valois. Both women could easily communicate in French. The Queen soon felt ill-at-ease in Prague, where she was always compared unfavorably with the Margravine of Moravia (Blanche's title as wife of the Bohemian heir). Also, the Czech people were offended by her coldness, insolence and aversion to learning their language.\nThe new Queen of Bohemia and Countess of Luxembourg brought with her an annual income of 4,000 livres extracted from her father's County of Clermont. On 25 February 1337, Beatrice gave birth in Prague to her only child, a son named Wenceslaus after the holy patron of the Přemyslid dynasty; probably calling her son with this name either the queen or her husband tried to gain the favor of the Bohemians. There is some indirect evidence that this was the first caesarean section that was survived by both the mother and child. However, the relationship between Beatrice and her new subjects remained estranged: her coronation as Queen of Bohemia in St. Vitus Cathedral three months later, on 18 May, was an event of spectacular indifference  from the citizens of Prague.\nShortly after her coronation, in June 1337, Beatrice left Bohemia leaving her son behind, and went to live in Luxembourg. After this, she rarely visited the Bohemian Kingdom.\n\nLater Years\nOn 26 August 1346 King John was killed in the Battle of Crécy and Beatrice ceased to be queen consort. Her stepson, now King Charles of Bohemia, confirmed the provisions of her marriage contract. Beatrice, now Dowager Queen of Bohemia, received in perpetuity lands in the County of Hainaut, the rent of 4,000 livres and the towns of Arlon, Marville and Damvillers (where she settled her residence) as her widow's estate. These revenues were used not only for their own needs, but also for the education of her son. King Charles also left her all the movable property and income from the mines in Kutná Hora. In addition, when her father Duke Louis I of Bourbon died in 1342, she received the sum of 1,000 livres, which was secured from the town of Creil.\nAround 1347, Beatrice married for a second time to Eudes II, Lord of Grancey, (then a widower) at her state of Damvillers. Despite her new marriage, she retained the title of Queen of Bohemia. The couple had no children. Soon after her second marriage, she arranged the betrothal of her son Wenceslaus with the widowed Joanna, Duchess of Brabant, daughter and heiress of John III, Duke of Brabant, who was fifteen years older than he was. The marriage took place in Damvillers four years later, on 17 May 1351.\nDespite all the grants of land and money given to Beatrice, the Bohemian king delayed the investiture of his young half-brother Wenceslaus as Count of Luxembourg. In fact, he held on to the title until 1353, when Wenceslaus finally obtained sovereignty over the County.  One year later (13 March 1354) the County was elevated to the rank of a Duchy.\nBeatrice died on 27 December 1383, having outlived her son (for only sixteen days) and all her stepchildren. She was buried in the now-demolished church of the Couvent des Jacobins in Paris - her effigy is now in the Basilica of St Denis. Her second husband survived her by six years.\nPassage 2:\nObata Toramori\nObata Toramori (小畠虎盛, 1491 – July 14, 1561) was Japanese samurai warrior of the Sengoku Period. He is known as one of the \"Twenty-Four Generals of Takeda Shingen\" \nHe also recorded as having been wounded 41 times in 36 encounters. \nHe was the father of Obata Masamori.\n\nSee also\nIsao Obata\nPassage 3:\nBonne of Armagnac\nBonne of Armagnac (19 February 1399 – 1430/35) was the eldest daughter of Bernard VII, Count of Armagnac and Constable of France, and his wife Bonne of Berry.\n\nMarriage\nOn 15 April 1410 at the age of 11, she married Charles, Duke of Orléans (left an orphan by his father Louis's assassination in 1407). This marriage made the constable not only Charles's father-in-law but also his natural defender. The Orléans party, left without a leader by Louis's death, thus became the Armagnac party, the name it held up to the treaty of Arras in 1435.Following the French defeat at the Battle of Agincourt on 25 October 1415, Charles was taken prisoner by the English. Bonne had not borne any children prior to his imprisonment. She died sometime between 1430 and 1435 while her husband was still in captivity.\n\nIn literature and art\nBonne appears in the critically acclaimed historical novel Het woud der verwachting (1949) by Hella Haasse, (translated into English in 1989 under the title \"In a Dark Wood Wandering\"). The novel portrays the life of Bonne's husband Charles. \nCharles and Bonne's marriage at the Chateau de Dourdan is thought to be depicted in the elaborate illuminated manuscript entitled Très Riches Heures du duc de Berry (Very Rich Hours of the Duke of Berry) in the illustration for April.\n\nAncestry\nPassage 4:\nMathilde of Bourbon\nMathilde of Bourbon (French: Mahaut de Bourbon; c. 1165/69 – 18 June 1228) was a French noblewoman who was the ruling Lady of Bourbon from 1171 until her death.\n\nLife\nMathilde was the only child of Archambault of Bourbon and his wife Alix (or Adelaide) of Burgundy (daughter of Odo II).  She was born in the second half of the 1160s.\nHer father, the heir apparent of Bourbon, died in 1169, without ever inheriting the lordship.  Her grandfather, Archambault VII, died in 1171.  Mathilde, as his only surviving grandchild, succeeded him.\nBefore 1183, she married Gaucher IV of Vienne, Lord of Salins.  After he returned from the Third Crusade, they frequently quarreled.  In the end, he became violent and had her locked up.: p. 117   She fled to her grandmother's estate in Champagne: p. 217   During her escape, she allegedly also used violence,: p. 117  and for this she was excommunicated by Archbishop Henri de Sully of Bourges.  After she arrived in Champagne, she asked Pope Celestine III for a divorce from her husband, arguing that Gaucher IV and she were close relatives and that the marriage therefore had been inadmissible.  The Pope tasked the bishops of Autun and Troyes and the abbot of Monthiers-en-Argonne with investigating her claim.  These men found that Mathilde and her husband were third cousins, as they were both great-great-grandchildren of William II, Count of Burgundy, and that, therefore, her claim that they were too closely related was justified.  The pope granted the divorce, and also lifted the excommunication.\nIn September 1196, only a few months after her divorce, she married Lord Guy II of Dampierre.  Thus, the Bourbonnais fell to the House of Dampierre.  This marriage lasted 20 years: he died in 1216.\nMathilde died twelve years after her husband.  After her death, Margaret, her daughter from her first marriage claimed the Lordship of Bourbon.  Guy II had initially recognized Margaret as heir of Bourbon, however, he later claimed the Lordship for his oldest son, Archambault VIII.  In the end, Archambault prevailed.\n\nMarriages and issue\nMathilde married Gaucher IV of Vienne, Lord of Salins.

He was Duke of Bourbon and Auvergne from 1456 to his death.\n\nLife\nJohn earned his nicknames \"John the Good\" and \"The Scourge of the English\" for his efforts in helping drive out the English from France.\nHe was made constable of France in 1483 by his brother Peter and sister-in-law Anne, to neutralize him as a threat to their regency.In an effort to win discontented nobles back to his side, Louis XI of France made great efforts to give out magnificent gifts to certain individuals; John was a recipient of these overtures. According to contemporary chronicles, the King received John in Paris with \"honours, caresses, pardon, and gifts; everything was lavished upon him\".\nJohn is notable for making three brilliant alliances but leaving no legitimate issue.\n\nFirst Marriage\nIn 1447, his father, the Duke of Bourbon, had John married to a daughter of Charles VII, King of France, Joan of Valois. They were duly married at the Château de Moulins. They had no surviving issue.\n\nSecond marriage\nIn 1484 at St. Cloud to Catherine of Armagnac, daughter of Jacques of Armagnac, Duke of Nemours, who died in 1487 while giving birth to:\n\nJohn of Bourbon (Moulins, 1487 - 1487), styled Count of Clermont\n\nThird marriage\nIn 1487 he married Jeanne of Bourbon-Vendôme, daughter of John of Bourbon, Count of Vendôme (from a cadet branch of the House of Bourbon), by whom he had one son:\n\nLouis of Bourbon (1488 - 1488), styled Count of Clermont\n\nIllegitimate issue\nBy Louise of Albret, daughter of Jean I d'Albret (- 8 September 1494): \n\nCharles, Bastard of Bourbon (- 1502), Viscount of Lavedan jure uxoris, married before 1462 Louise du Lion (- aft. 25 February 1505), Viscountess of Lavedan, and had issue, four sonsBy Marguerite de Brunant: \n\nMathieu, the Great Bastard of Bourbon (- Château de Chambrou-en-Forez, 19 August 1505), Lord of Botheon and Lord and Baron of Roche-en-Régnier, unmarried and without issueBy unknown women: \n\nHector, Bastard of Bourbon (- 1502, bur.

However, this succession was strongly contested due to the political strength of Peter and Anne.  Within a span of days, Charles was forced to renounce his claims to the Bourbon lands to Peter in exchange for a financial settlement.\n\nAncestry\nNotes\nPassage 6:\nBernard d'Armagnac, Count of Pardiac\nBernard d'Armagnac, Count of Pardiac (died 1462) was a younger son of Bernard VII, Count of Armagnac and Bonne of Berry.\nBernard fought at the Battle of Patay in 1429. That year he married Eleanor of Bourbon-La Marche, daughter and ultimately heir of James II, Count of La Marche. Count James was the consort of Queen Joanna II of Naples. Bernard served as lieutenant-general in La Marche and governor of Limousin in 1441, and later as lieutenant-general of Languedoc and Roussillon in 1461.\nBernard was the father of:\n\nJacques d'Armagnac, Duke of Nemours\nJohn d'Armagnac (1440-1493)\nPassage 7:\nPrincess Urraca of Bourbon-Two Sicilies\nPrincess Urraca of Bourbon-Two Sicilies (Italian: Urraca Maria Isabella Carolina Aldegonda Carmela, Principessa di Borbone delle Due Sicilie; 14 July 1913, Nymphenburg Palace, Munich, Kingdom of Bavaria – 3 May 1999, Sigmaringen, Baden-Württemberg, Germany) was a member of the House of Bourbon-Two Sicilies and a Princess of Bourbon-Two Sicilies.\n\nEarly life and family\nPrincess Urraca of Bourbon-Two Sicilies was born on 14 July 1913, at Nymphenburg Palace in Munich, Kingdom of Bavaria. She was the sixth and youngest child of Prince Ferdinand Pius of Bourbon-Two Sicilies, Duke of Castro (1869–1960) and his wife Princess Maria Ludwiga Theresia of Bavaria (1872–1954). Ferdinand Pius was the Head of the House of Bourbon-Two Sicilies and pretender to the defunct throne of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies from 26 May 1934 to 7 January 1960. Urraca had five older siblings, four sisters and one brother: Princess Maria Antonietta (1898–1957), Princess Maria Cristina (1899–1985), Prince Ruggiero Maria, Duke of Noto (1901–1914), Princess Barbara Maria (1902–1927), and Princess Lucia (1908–2001).Through her father, Urraca was a granddaughter of Prince Alfonso of Bourbon-Two Sicilies, Count of Caserta (1841–1934) and his wife Princess Maria Antonietta of Bourbon-Two Sicilies (1851–1938). Urraca was descended from King Francis I of the Two Sicilies (1777–1830) through her paternal great-grandfathers, King Ferdinand II of the Two Sicilies (1810–1859) and Prince Francis of Bourbon-Two Sicilies, Count of Trapani (1827–1892). Through her mother, she was a granddaughter of King Ludwig III of Bavaria (1845– 1921) and his wife Archduchess Maria Theresa of Austria-Este (1849–1919).Urraca chose not to celebrate her birthday, stating: \"How can a Bourbon celebrate on the day of the Bastille's taking?\"\n\nAdult life\nAs the daughter of the heir-apparent, then head of the House of Bourbon-Two Sicilies, Urraca regularly represented her family at royal and aristocratic functions and charitable events. She attended the funeral of her great uncle Prince Leopold of Bavaria on 3 October 1930, at St. Michael's Church in Munich. Urraca, her mother, and her sister Lucia attended an afternoon dance tea at the Hotel Vier Jahreszeiten and the Hungarian Aid Association's Hungarian Ball in Munich in January 1934. She also took part in the closing events of Munich's Carnival celebrations in February 1936. On 16 April 1936, Urraca attended the wedding of her first cousin Infante Alfonso of Spain, Prince of Bourbon-Two Sicilies to Princess Alicia of Bourbon-Parma at the Minoritenkirche in Vienna. She was a guest of honor at the Austrian Armed Forces' Spring Parade in April 1936, along with Alfonso XIII of Spain, Princess Maria Anna of Bourbon-Parma, and Prince Elias of Bourbon-Parma. Urraca attended the Baltic Red Cross Ball and the ball of Countess Adelheid Arco-Valley in the Cherubinsälen of the Hotel Vier Jahreszeiten in February 1938. On 23 October 1957, she attended the wedding of her first cousin  Princess Marie Gabrielle of Bavaria and Georg, Prince of Waldburg zu Zeil und Trauchburg in Munich.On the night of 10 January 1957, Urraca was driving her eldest sister Maria Antonietta to her home in Lindau, Germany when their automobile collided with a truck that had skid on ice near Winterthur, Switzerland. Maria Antonietta was killed in the accident and Urraca was seriously injured.Urraca was also an active supporter of Duosicilian historical societies and other royalty and nobility organizations. In October 1993, she attended a conference of over 200 Italian nobles and aristocrats at the Palazzo Pallavicini-Rospigliosi in Rome, which advocated for the nobility's renewed leadership in the defense of Catholic principles in political and cultural institutions. Her first cousin once removed and claimant to the Duosicilian throne, Infante Carlos, Duke of Calabria, was also in attendance. In February 1994, Urraca traveled to Gaeta where she participated in a tribute to the centenary of the death of Francis II, King of the Two Sicilies and an observation of the 133rd anniversary of the conclusion of the Siege of Gaeta which marked the victory of the Kingdom of Sardinia over Two Sicilies.\n\nDeath\nUrraca died on 3 May 1999, in Sigmaringen, Baden-Württemberg, Germany.\n\nTitles, styles, honours and arms\nTitles and styles\n14 July 1913 – 3 May 1999: Her Royal Highness Princess Urraca of Bourbon-Two Sicilies\n\nHonours\nDame Grand Cross of Justice of the Sacred Military Constantinian Order of Saint George\nDame of Honor and Devotion of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta\n\nAncestry\nPassage 8:\nPeter II, Duke of Bourbon\nPeter II, Duke of Bourbon (1 December 1438 – 10 October 1503 in Moulins), was the son of Charles I, Duke of Bourbon, and Agnes of Burgundy, and a member of the House of Bourbon. He and his wife Anne of France ruled as regents during the minority of Charles VIII of France.\n\nLife, marriage, and royal favour\nA loyal and capable subject of the crown, Peter earned the grudging respect of Louis XI through his demonstration of the Bourbon family's \"meekness and humility\". Initially he was betrothed to Marie d'Orleans, sister of Louis, Duke of Orleans (the future Louis XII); Louis XI, who wanted to prevent such an alliance between two of the greatest feudal houses in France, broke the engagement, and took measures to bind both families closer to the crown.\nA marriage between Peter and the King's elder daughter, Anne, was arranged (as was another marriage between Louis of Orleans and Anne's younger sister, Joan); as a mark of his favour, the King forced Peter's older brother John II, Duke of Bourbon to grant the Bourbon fief of Beaujeu (Beaujolais) to Peter, who was also given a seat on the royal council. Peter and Anne were married on 3 November 1473.\n\nRegent of France and Duke of Bourbon\nAt the time of Louis XI's death in 1483, Peter was one of the few royal servants to have remained consistently in favour during the King's reign, and it was to him that Louis, on his deathbed, granted guardianship over the new King, Charles VIII. Peter and his wife Anne immediately took up their duties, and began to position themselves as leaders of a regency government. The King was swiftly crowned, preventing the need for a regency government; instead, the thirteen-year-old King undertook personal rule of the Kingdom—theoretically on his own, but in reality guided by the Beaujeu couple.\nHaving assisted his wife in the governing of France, in 1488 both were able to begin building up a power-base of their own in the Bourbonnais. Anne was already Countess of Gien, and Peter was Count of Clermont and La Marche, as well as Lord of Beaujeu; but the death of his eldest brother, John II, and the subsequent enforced renunciation of the family rights by his next eldest brother, Charles II, delivered the Bourbon inheritance (the Duchies of Bourbon and Auvergne, and the Counties of Forez and l'Isle-en-Jordain) into Peter's hands.\nThe new Duke and Duchess of Bourbon then proceeded to add to these domains, adding Bourbon-Lancy in December 1488, and trading l'Isle-en-Jordain with the Armagnacs in June 1489 for Carlades and Murat. These domains were granted to them by the King in absolute right – they would not revert to the crown, and were not obligated to pass to the next heirs to the Bourbon inheritance, the Bourbon-Montpensiers – the Duke and Duchess could bequeath them to whomsoever they wished. On 10 May 1491, the pair finally acquired an heir of their own, a daughter, Suzanne (Anne had an earlier pregnancy in 1476, but about this existed contradictory accounts: some say the baby was miscarried or been stillborn, but others reported that a living son was born, Charles, styled Count of Clermont in 1488 as was customary for the heir of the Duchy of Bourbon, who died aged 22 in 1498 and was buried in the Abbey of Souvigny, Auvergne).\n\nBy 1491, the Bourbon influence over the crown was waning; Charles VIII was an adult now, unwilling to accept tutelage from his family. Against the better judgement of Anne and Peter, Charles chose to renounce his unconsummated marriage to Margaret of Austria, and instead marry Anne, Duchess of Brittany; he then went against them by returning Margaret's dowry – Artois and Franche-Comté – to her brother, Philip the Handsome. Nor were either able to prevent Charles' disastrous Italian expeditions, although both were left in control of France on several of his absences. Both continued to be major figures in the court for the rest of Charles VIII's reign, but restricted in power. After Charles VIII's death, and the accession of Louis XII, Peter largely retired from court politics and devoted his few remaining years to his family, being particularly devoted to his daughter Suzanne.\n\nSuccession to the Duchy of Bourbon\nWithout surviving male issue, the next heir to the Bourbon Duchy was Suzanne. It was in the question of the future of Suzanne and the Bourbon territories that Peter and Anne found themselves opposing each another in his final years. With Charles VIII dead and the more cautious Louis XII on the throne, Suzanne needed a husband to support her in her inheritance, which risked being disputed by the crown and the Montpensiers. The Duke and Duchess had initially groomed the next Bourbon heir, Louis of Bourbon-Montpensier, as a son-in-law; but he mortally offended Peter by condemning letters patent of Louis XII which confirmed Suzanne's rights of inheritance (having been wrung from him as the price of Bourbon support upon his accession).\nPeter then decided to betroth Suzanne to Charles IV, Duke of Alençon, a favourite of Louis XII, and so likely to protect the duchy against royal encroachment and Montpensier challenges. This contract was signed on 21 March 1501 at Moulins, Charles being 11, Suzanne 9. Before this marriage could be completed, however, Peter died of a fever. Following this, Anne arranged for Suzanne to marry the next Bourbon heir-male, Charles of Bourbon-Montpensier (Louis of Bourbon-Montpensier having died the year before), thereby averting a succession dispute over the Bourbon inheritance, which the young pair inherited jointly.\n\nFamily tree\nPassage 9:\nPeter I, Duke of Bourbon\nPeter I of Bourbon (Pierre Ier, Duc de Bourbon in French; 1311 – 19 September 1356) was the second Duke of Bourbon, from 1342 to his death. Peter was son of Louis I of Bourbon, whom he also succeeded as Grand Chamberlain of France, and Mary of Avesnes.\nPeter is reported to have been somewhat mentally unstable, a trait of nervous breakdowns (presumably hereditary, if mental illness is hereditary) that showed clearly for example in his daughter Joan of Bourbon, the queen, and in her son, king Charles VI of France, as well as in Peter's only surviving son, Duke Louis II.\n\nEarly career\nPeter took part in several of the early campaigns of the Hundred Years War which broke out in 1337. In the summer of 1339, he took part in Jean de Marigny, Bishop of Beauvais's failed attack on Bordeaux. In autumn 1341 he took part in the John, Duke of Normandy's campaign in Brittany. He was present at the coronation of Pope Clement VI at Avignon 19 May 1342.By the summer 1342, Peter together with the Raoul I of Brienne, Count of Eu, was given command of the covering force protecting France from attacks from the north while King Philip VI campaigned in Brittany. In August 1343 he and the Dauphin of Viennois were the French ambassadors at a peace conference at Avignon, but the negotiations were fruitless, as Edward III of England declined to send any but the most junior members of the embassy.\n\nLieutenant in Languedoc\nOn 8 August 1345 Peter was appointed by Philip VI as his lieutenant on the south-west march. His opponent was to be Henry, Earl of Derby (later Earl and Duke of Lancaster) who completed disembarking his army at Bordeaux the day after Peter's appointment.\nPeter arrived to take up his lieutenancy in Languedoc in September. By then the Earl of Derby had already opened his campaign, throwing the French defences into disarray with the capture of Bergerac and the destruction of the French army present there the previous month. Bourbon set up headquarters at Angoulême and begun an extensive recruitment campaign to raise a new army, command of which fell to the Duke of Normandy. However on 21 October the Earl of Derby won another crushing victory outside Auberoche over parts of this force. The Duke of Normandy abandoned his campaign once he heard the news. In early November he disbanded his army and left for the north.\nThe Earl of Derby exploited the absence of a French commander in the field to lay siege to the important fortress-city of La Réole. Bourbon proclaimed the arrière-ban in Languedoc and the march provinces in an attempt to find troops to relieve the siege. However the results were poor as many of the potential recruits were still on their way home from the army just disbanded by John of Normandy. Attempts by John I, Count of Armagnac to raise troops from his domains in the Rouergue also produced little. Early January 1346 the garrison of La Réole marched away under truce.\nWinter 1346 Bourbon kept his winter quarters at the provincial capital of Agen, a city which quickly was becoming isolated as many of the lesser towns were captured or defected to the English. Spring however opened with the so far greatest French effort in the south-west. Bourbon and the Bishop of Beauvais raised a new army at Toulouse, in part financed by the Pope whose nephew had been captured by Derby the previous year, while John of Normandy brought with him a substantial number of nobles from the north including such dignitaries as the Eudes IV, Duke of Burgundy, Raoul II of Brienne, Count of Eu the Constable of France, both Marshals and the Master of Crossbowmen. In April Normandy laid siege to the town of Aiguillon which controlled the confluence of the Lot and the Garonne. There they still remained in August when John of Normandy was urgently recalled to the north to help stop Edward III who had landed in Normandy. Derby exploited this with a devastating autumn campaign. And so the French 1346 campaign in the south ended having accomplished nothing.\n\nDiplomatic missions\nIn July 1347 he took part in fruitless negotiations with the English outside Calais in the days just before that city's capitulation.\nOn 8 February 1354, Peter was together with the Guy, Cardinal of Boulogne appointed as King John II's commissioners to King Charles II of Navarre, empowered to offer whatever Charles wanted. The two met the King of Navarre in the castle of Mantes, accompanied by the two dowager Queens and droves of courtiers and ministers, most of who more or less openly sympathized with Charles of Navarre. The treaty concluded 22 February granted to Charles of Navarre a considerable part of Lower Normandy which he was to hold with the same rights as the Duke of Normandy.\nIn January 1355, Peter was sent together with the Chancellor of France Pierre de la Forêt on a diplomatic mission to Avignon where they were to meet with an English embassy led by Henry of Lancaster and Richard FitzAlan, 10th Earl of Arundel. The purpose of the mission was to formally ratify a peace treaty based on a draft drawn up at Guînes the previous year. However since then French policy had changed, the French ambassadors had only come to reject the English demands and had nothing new to offer. Negotiations therefore quickly broke down and the conference ended having accomplished nothing except prolonging the existing truce a few more months until 24 June.\nMay 1355 when it became apparent that open war was about to break out between the King of France and a King of Navarre allied to England the Duke of Bourbon belonged to the party fronted by the Dowager Queens who lobbied John II on Charles of Navarre's behalf. In the end John II gave way and on 31 May agreed to pardon Charles of Navarre.\nIn July the Duke of Bourbon and the Chancellor met with English ambassadors to negotiate the extension of the truce. As both the French and English governments had decided to resume the war these negotiations were naturally quite empty and fruitless.\nPeter was killed in the Battle of Poitiers 19 September 1356 and buried in the now-demolished church of the Couvent des Jacobins in Paris.\n\nMarriage and issue\nOn 25 January 1336 he married Isabella of Valois, daughter of Charles, Count of Valois and his third wife Mahaut of Châtillon. Peter and Isabella had:\n\nLouis II (1337–1410)\nJoanna (1338–1378), married King Charles V of France\nBlanche (1339–1361, Medina-Sidonia), married King Pedro of Castile in 1353 in Valladolid, poisoned by her husband\nBonne (1341 – 19 January 1402, Château de Mâcon), married Amadeus VI, Count of Savoy in 1355 in Paris\nCatherine (1342–1427, Paris), married John VI of Harcourt\nMargaret (1344–1416), married Arnaud Amanieu, Viscount of Tartas\nIsabelle (b. 1345)\nMarie (1347–1401, Poissy), Prioress of Poissy\nPassage 10:\nBonne of Bourbon\nBonne of Bourbon (1341 – 19 January 1402) was a Countess of Savoy by marriage to Amadeus VI of Savoy. She served as regent of Savoy during the absence of her spouse from 1366 to 1367, with her son in 1383, and finally during the minority of her grandson Amadeus VIII, Duke of Savoy in 1391–1395.\n\nBiography\nBonne was the daughter of Peter I, Duke of Bourbon, and Isabella of Valois. She was engaged to Amadeus VI, Count of Savoy as part of the Treaty of Paris (1355), which included a dowry of three thousand florins per year.  She married Amadeus in September 1355 in Paris.  Immediately after their wedding, her husband had to return to his army, still engaged in the Hundred Years' War.\n\nFirst regency\nIn 1366, when her husband left on a crusade to Bulgaria, he named her as regent of Savoy for the duration of his absence, to be advised by his council.  In 1367, James, lord of Piedmont, a cousin of Amadeus, died.  There was a dispute over his inheritance between his eldest son, Philip and his widow, Margaret of Beaujeu, representing the interests of her young sons, Amadeus and Louis.  Bonne, acting as regent, was only able to keep them from open war.  She was not able to settle the dispute, and Philip had to go to Amadeus in Venice to try to get resolution.She greatly enjoyed the Alpine mountain lakes of Savoy, and tried to ensure the castles she stayed in had good views of them.  In 1371, she oversaw the building of the chateau at Ripaille, seeking to build a manor that would more easily accommodate the larger court of the Count.  The new chateau had large windows overlooking Lake Geneva.  She was a great patron of music, and was known for her skill on the harp.In July 1382, funds were running low for her husband's ongoing wars in Italy, so she sold some of her jewelry for more than 400 florins to help him re-equip.\n\nSecond regency\nIn 1383, when her husband, Amadeus VI, died, he left a will granting his wife power over the government of Savoy despite their son, Amadeus VII, being in his early twenties. With the support of the Council, led by Louis de Cossonay and composed of several of her allies, such as Otton de Grandson, Bonne governed Savoy in her son's name. According to Max Bruchet, one of the fears of the Council in those days was the growing influence of French princes over Savoy: the Duke of Berry had married his daughter to Amadeus VII and his grandson, Amadeus VIII, would one day rule Savoy. The young Amadeus was also betrothed to Mary, the daughter of Philip II, the Duke of Burgundy. Both princes had been younger brothers of Charles V, the King of France, and were now acting as regents for their nephew, Charles VI.\n\nThird regency\nWhen Amadeus VII died of tetanus in 1391, and Bonne became regent. Her influence over Savoy came to an end when Amadeus VII's doctor (widely seen to have been responsible for the Count's death) accused the Countess of ordering her son's death in 1395. The Dukes of Berry and Burgundy also accused several members of the Count's Council of being complicit in the murder and Bonne was relieved of the regency and of caring for her grandson, the new Count Amadeus VIII.\nBonne died at the Château de Mâcon.\n\nIssue\nShe and Amadeus had three children:\n\nA daughter, born 1358, who  died after a few weeks\nAmadeus VII of Savoy (March 1360 – November 1, 1391). He married Bonne of Berry (1365–1435), daughter of Duke John of Berry and a niece of Bonne of Bourbon.\nLouis of Savoy, born late 1364, died before the end of the year\n\nAncestry", "answers": ["Poitiers"], "length": 5848, "dataset": "2wikimqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "d524ca109e5ac6284dec16931f2403ef7859225cfde19e9e"}

The film was originally released straight to VHS. VHS copies of the film have become collector's items due to their difficulty to locate and extremely limited quantities, with one copy selling for $2000 on eBay.Turner has expressed interest in creating a sequel and began writing the film's script in 2013. Tales from the QuadeaD Zone was the only film produced by Erry Vision Film Co.\nSince its release Tales From the QuadeaD Zone has received several public screenings, one of which was a 2016 symposium at the Yale University Library, Terror on Tape.It was given a DVD release in 2013 through Massacre Video.\n\nSynopsis\nThe film is composed of two stories, plus a third wraparound story; \"Food For ?\" and \"The Brothers\", both of which are narrated by a mother (Shirley L. Jones) reading the tales to her deceased son Bobby. \"Food For ?\" centers upon a family that is so poor that they are unable to afford food for every family member. Their only solution is to get rid of some of their family in order to increase the amount of dinner for everyone else. \"The Brother\" follows two brothers who have hated each other their entire lives and have each made cruel jokes and attacks against the other. When one of them dies, the living brother tries to have the last laugh by stealing his brother's corpse and making him look like a circus clown. Little does he know that his brother's spirit has returned to his body, unhappy with his brother's plans.\n\nCast\nProduction\nWork on Tales from the QuadeaD Zone began three years after Turner completed his first film, Black Devil Doll From Hell, which was initially intended to be one of the anthology's stories. Two of the film's stories, \"Food For ?\" and the wraparound story \"Unseen Vision\", were shot in Alabama while \"The Brothers\" was shot in Chicago.\n\nRelease\nAs Turner released the film on his own, along with star Shirley L. Jones, Tales from the QuadeaD Zone was released in an extremely limited amount, estimated to be at or less than 100 copies. The copies were only circulated in the Chicago area due to the cost of gas and travel required by Turner and Jones and it is believed that many of these copies have been lost.Over time the video achieved cult status and VHS copies became much sought after collector's items. In 2011 one copy of the film sold for $665 on the online auction site eBay, a feat that was covered in the 2013 documentary Adjust Your Tracking. The winning bidder later sold his copy of the movie for twice the amount paid.The price reached an all time high when a copy was sold on eBay for $2000.\nIn 2013, Massacre Video released the movie as part of a DVD box set along with Black Devil Doll From Hell. The box set features commentary from Turner and Jackson, a documentary about both films, and the director's cut of Black Devil Doll From Hell, which upon release had been heavily edited from Turner's original version.\n\nReception\nHorronews.net commented that although the video could be seen as a \"complete and utter train wreck\", the film was made during a point in time when amateur filmmaking would be cost prohibitive for the average person and the creation of Tales from the QuadeaD Zone was evidence of Turner's \"heart and a dream to become a film maker\". Bloody Disgusting also reviewed the movie, stating that it was \"a no-budget, SOV labor of mad love\". DVD Talk reviewed the movie as part of Massacre Video's box set and gave it a poor review, which they felt was weaker than Black Devil Doll From Hell.\nPassage 2:\nHiroshi Ishikawa\nHiroshi Ishikawa (石川 寛, born May 18, 1963) is a Japanese film director and writer from Ōdate.

The film was released in Japan on February 26, 2006 and was also shown at the Hong Kong International Film Festival on April 8.\nCritical reviews were mixed. According to Variety's Eddie Cockrell (who viewed it at the NMFF), the film was filled with \"unchecked indulgences.\" He criticized the director, writing that: \"Jump cuts, cryptic silences, shots of various cloud formations and long takes bereft of movement are key weapons in Ishikawa's self-consciously arty arsenal, with little in the way of story or character development to engage viewers; Gus van Sant he's not.\"On the other hand, DVDBeaver.com praised the film for its \"heartfelt story,\" \"excellent visuals,\" and \"great cast.\" The reviewer noted its lack of dialogue but also said that \"the characters' body language says more than any words could ever express.\"The DVD was released in Japan on September 22, 2006, by Big Time Entertainment. It includes English and French subtitles.\nPassage 4:\nGolden age of physics\nA golden age of physics appears to have been delineated for certain periods of progress in the physics sciences, and this includes the previous and current developments of cosmology and astronomy. Each \"golden age\" introduces significant advancements in theoretical and experimental methods. Discernible time periods marking a \"golden age\" of advancements are, for example, the development of mechanics under Galileo (1564–1642) and Newton (1642–1727). Another small epoch seen as a golden age is the unification of electricity, magnetism, and optics because of 19th century notables, including Faraday, Maxwell, and others.Significant advancements in methods of investigation were introduced for celestial mechanics, which includes realizing a universal gravitational force, with the introduction of the telescope. Basing mechanics on experimental results was possible with the development of devices that could measure time, and tools for measuring distance. The advances in electromagnetism in the 19th century enamored physicists, as another golden age closed, and there was a reluctance to perceive further advancement. Hence, the progress of one era, termed a \"golden age\" has appeared to mark the completion of physics as a science. Yet, this perception has turned out to be erroneous. For example, around 1980, Stephen Hawking predicted the end of theoretical physics within 20 years. Around 2001, he amended his prediction to twenty years more from that year. Steven Weinberg predicts a unified physics by 2050. Tadeusz Lulek, Barbara Lulek, and A. Wal – the authors of a 2001 book – believed themselves to be at the beginning of a new \"golden age of physics\".Paul Davies notes that whilst \"many elderly scientists\" may regard the first 30 years of the 20th century as a golden age of physics, historians may well, instead, regard it to be the dawning days of \"the New Physics\".The golden age of physics was the 19th century. According to Emilio Segrè, in Italy it came to an end in the 18th century, after the time of Alessandro Volta.  He reported in his autobiography that Enrico Fermi felt that it was coming to an end in 1933.  A golden age of physics began with the simultaneous discovery of the principle of the conservation of energy in the mid-19th century.  A golden age of physics was the years 1925 to 1927.  The golden age of nonlinear physics was the period from 1950 to 1970, encompassing the Fermi–Pasta–Ulam–Tsingou problem and others.  This followed the golden age of nuclear physics, which had spanned the two decades from the mid-1930s to the mid-1950s.  A golden age of physics started at the end of the 1920s.The golden age of physics cabinets was the 18th century, with the rise of such lecturer-demonstrators as John Keill, John Theophilus Desaguliers, and William Whiston, who all invented new physics apparatus for their lectures.\n\nSee also\nGolden age of general relativity\nGolden age of cosmology\nGolden age (metaphor)\nPassage 5:\nThe Vault of Horror (film)\nThe Vault of Horror (otherwise known as Vault of Horror, Further Tales from the Crypt and Tales from the Crypt II) is a 1973 British anthology horror film directed by Roy Ward Baker, and starring Terry-Thomas, Dawn Addams, Denholm Elliott, Curd Jürgens, Tom Baker, Michael Craig, Terence Alexander, Glynis Johns, Mike Pratt, Robin Nedwell, Geoffrey Davies, Daniel Massey and Anna Massey. None of the film's stories are actually from Vault of Horror comics. All but one appeared in Tales from the Crypt, the exception being from Shock SuspenStories. The film omits the Vault Keeper character from the comics.\n\nPlot\nIntro\nFive strangers board a descending lift, one by one, in a modern office block in London. They reach the sub-basement, though none of them have pressed for that destination. There they find a large, elaborately furnished room that appears to be a gentlemen's club. The lift door has closed; there are no buttons to bring it back, nor any other exit. Resigned to waiting for help, they settle down with drinks and talk. The conversation turns to dreams, and each man tells of a recurring nightmare.\n\"Midnight Mess\" (Tales from the Crypt #35)\nHarold Rogers tracks his sister Donna to a strange village, and kills her to claim her share of the family inheritance. After settling down to a post-murder meal at the local restaurant, he discovers the town is home to a nest of vampires: Donna is not as dead as he thinks, and he becomes the dish of the night when his jugular vein is tapped out as a beverage dispenser (this last scene is blacked-out in the U.S. DVD release).\n\"The Neat Job\" (Shock SuspenStories #1)\nThe obsessively neat Arthur Critchit marries Eleanor, a \"young\" trophy wife who is not quite the housekeeper he hoped for. His constant nagging about the mess she makes eventually drives her mad. Upon his shouting at her, \"Can't you do anything neatly? Can't you?\", she finally snaps and kills him with a hammer, then cuts up the corpse and puts all the different organs into neatly labelled jars.\n\"This Trick’ll Kill You\" (Tales from the Crypt #33)\nSebastian is a magician on a working holiday in India, where he and his wife Inez are searching for new tricks. Nothing impresses until he sees a girl charming a rope out of a basket with a flute. Unable to work out how the trick is done, he persuades her to come to his hotel room, where he and his wife murder her and steal the enchanted rope. Sebastian plays the flute, and the rope rises; realizing that they have discovered a piece of genuine magic, the couple begin plans to work it into their act. Inez experiments with climbing the rope, only to disappear with a scream. An ominous patch of blood appears on the ceiling, and the rope coils round Sebastian's neck and hangs him. Their victim reappears alive in the bazaar.\n\"Bargain in Death\" (Tales from the Crypt #28)\nMaitland is buried alive as part of an insurance scam concocted with his friend Alex. Alex double-crosses Maitland, leaving him to suffocate. Two trainee doctors, Tom and Jerry, bribe a gravedigger to dig up a corpse to help with their studies. When Maitland's coffin is opened, he jumps up gasping for air, scaring Tom and Jerry who run out into the middle of the road in front of Alex's car, which crashes into a tree and explodes. The gravedigger kills Maitland, and when trying to close the sale of the corpse apologizes to Tom and Jerry for the damage to the head.\n\"Drawn and Quartered\" (Tales from the Crypt #26)\nMoore is an impoverished painter living in Haiti. When he learns that his paintings have been sold for high prices by art dealers Diltant and Gaskill after being praised by critic Fenton Breedley, all of whom told him that they were worthless, he goes to a voodoo priest and his painting hand is given voodoo power; whatever he paints or draws can be harmed by damaging its image. Rather awkwardly, these events coincide with his completing a self-portrait, which he keeps under lock and key to prevent the magic from turning on him. Returning to London, Moore paints portraits of the three men who cheated him, and mutilates the paintings to exact his revenge. He is also obliged to put his own portrait out in the open, because leaving it in an airless strongbox nearly suffocated him. A workman subsequently drops a can of paint thinner on the picture through a skylight, and Moore, as a result of the voodoo, suffers a correspondingly messy death.\nFinale\nWhen the story of the final dream is told, the five ponder the meaning of their nightmares. The lift door opens, and they find themselves looking out onto a graveyard. Rogers, Critchit, Maitland, and Moore walk out into the graveyard and disappear one by one. Sebastian remains behind and explains that they are all damned souls compelled to tell the stories of their evil deeds for all eternity. He then turns back into the room, which is now a mausoleum, walks towards the casket and disappears himself. Then the door slams shut.\n\nCast\nDaniel Massey as Harold Rogers\nTerry-Thomas as Arthur Critchit\nCurd Jürgens as Sebastian\nMichael Craig as Maitland\nTom Baker as Moore\nAnna Massey as Donna Rogers\nGlynis Johns as Eleanor Critchit\nDawn Addams as Inez\nEdward Judd as Alex\nDenholm Elliott as Diltant\nRobin Nedwell as Tom\nGeoffrey Davies as Jerry\nTerence Alexander as Fenton Breedley\nJohn Witty as Arthur Gaskill\nJasmina Hilton as Indian Girl\nIshaq Bux as Fakir\nJohn Forbes-Robertson as Wilson\nMaurice Kaufmann as Bob Dickson\nArthur Mullard as Gravedigger\nMike Pratt as Clive\nMarianne Stone as Jane\nErik Chitty as Old Waiter\nTommy Godfrey as Landlord\nJerold Wells as Waiter\n\nProduction\nIn the segment \"Bargain in Death\", Maitland can be seen reading a copy of the novelisation of the earlier Amicus film Tales from the Crypt (1972). The same installment features Geoffrey Davies and Robin Nedwell, who both appeared in the British TV show Doctor in the House. \"Midnight Mess\" features a brother and sister as characters. They are played by real-life brother and sister Anna Massey and Daniel Massey, whose parents were actors Adrianne Allen and Raymond Massey.\n\nFilming\nThe film was shot on location and at Twickenham Studios.\nThe tower featured in the opening scenes is the Millbank Tower in London.\n\nRelease\nReception\nRoger Greenspun of The New York Times was dismissive, writing that of the several distinguished actors who appeared in the film, \"none is ever quite so bad as the material warrants.\" Variety wrote, \"Quality for the material is uneven, ranging from camp comedy to the belabored grotesque ... Performances, given the limited nature of the script, are above par for this sort of exercise.\" Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times called the film \"a very tepid, static affair despite the presence of many luminaries of the English stage and screen.\" Tom Milne of The Monthly Film Bulletin wrote that the film was \"even less satisfactory\" than Tales from the Crypt, \"mainly because the Freddie Francis atmospherics have been replaced by pedantically flat direction by Roy Ward Baker in which each story plods squarely through yards of exposition before erupting in all too brief explosions of Grand Guignol.\"Halliwell's Film Guide described the film as \"plainly but well staged.\" Jeremy Aspinall of Radio Times gave the film three stars out of five, describing it as a \"suitably ghoulish companion piece to the excellent Tales from the Crypt\", \"fiendishly fun\", with \"a touch of class in the cast\", concluding \"if you like your fright fables darkly droll, then this should certainly do the trick.\"\n\nDVD and Blu-ray releases\nTogether with Tales from the Crypt, The Vault of Horror was released on a Midnite Movies double feature DVD on 11 September 2007. The version used is the edited U.S. theatrical PG re-release (the original theatrical release in the U.S. was the unedited R-rated version), which replaces some of the gorier scenes with still images (notably the final shot of \"Midnight Mess\" showing Daniel Massey's neck being tapped for blood, and Terry Thomas dropping from a hammer blow in \"The Neat Job\") to receive an MPAA PG rating. The U.K. Vipco DVD release featured the original unedited U.K. print.\nAn uncensored version was first shown on the British TV channel Film4 on 25 August 2008, and later released by Scream Factory on a double-feature Blu-ray with Tales From The Crypt. Questions have been raised as to if these prints are still missing a scene in which the characters who walk to the graveyard are seen with dead, skeletal faces. It may be that this shot has been lost; no prints containing it have ever surfaced, and there is no evidence it was ever included in the final release prints, as even the original unedited prints that have surfaced do not include a scene resembling the photo. It also has been widely speculated that the image was just a photo taken for promotional purposes and was never a filmed scene, as Curd Jürgens' character is portrayed by a different actor in the photo. Jürgens' character is the main focus of the end sequence; hence, some have stated that a scene is unlikely to have been filmed with a different actor portraying the character, for audiences would have noticed the change.\nPassage 6:\nBroadway: The Golden Age, by the Legends Who Were There\nBroadway: The Golden Age is a 2003 documentary film by Rick McKay, telling the story of the \"golden age\" of Broadway by the oral history of the legendary actors of the 1940s and 1950s, incorporating rare lost footage of actual performances and never-before-seen personal home movies and photos.  This was the final film Sally Ann Howes starred in before her death in 2021.\n\nSubjects\nThe film includes interviews (filmed over a span of six years) with the following people:\n\nThe intrinsic value of the documentary as a historical record is underscored by the fact that seven of the interviewees (Hume Cronyn, Uta Hagen, Al Hirschfeld, Kim Hunter, Ann Miller, Harold Nicholas and Gwen Verdon) died before the film was released in June 2004, and another 51 interviewees have died since then (as of September 2021). Filmmaker Michael Stever shared some noteworthy recollections of his 3+ years as UPM with McKay after his passing in 2018.\n\nReception\nBroadway: The Golden Age won the Audience Award for Best Documentary at the Palm Beach International Film Festival, the Audience Choice Award for Best documentary at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival, and the Audience Award and Festival Award at the San Diego Film Festival, both for Best Documentary.\nIn 2006, McKay was honored with a Special Award for his work on the film by the New England Theatre Conference with the New England Theatre Conference Special Contribution to Theatre Award.\n\nSequel\nA sequel by the name of Broadway: Beyond the Golden Age had been in development since the release of the original documentary. McKay successfully funded a Kickstarter campaign in 2017 to help get the film completed, but his untimely passing in 2018 made its future uncertain. It premiered August 14, 2021 on PBS as part of Great Performances.\nPassage 7:\nTales from the Golden Age\nTales from the Golden Age (Romanian: Amintiri din epoca de aur) is a 2009 Romanian omnibus film. It was screened as part of the Un Certain Regard section at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival.The film is composed of six whimsical yet blackly comic short stories, each one set in the late communist period in Romania and based on urban myths from the time, reflecting the perspective of ordinary people. The title of the film refers to the alleged \"Golden Age\" (by communist propaganda) of the last 15 years of Nicolae Ceaușescu's regime.  Each episode concludes with \"legend tells us ... \", each item being legend because, of course, no such thing could have happened during the \"Golden Age\".\n\nEpisodes\nThe Legend of the Official Visit (Romanian: Legenda Activistului în Inspectie)\n\nAlexandru Potocean - The Secretary\nTeodor Corban - The Mayor\nEmanuel Parvu - The Party InspectorLocal Party officials scurry into action when a motorcade of VIPs and foreign dignitaries promises to pass through the village. A government official arrives and attention is paid to the smallest detail, yet the people are let down when a phone call reveals the motorcade is no longer coming. With everyone disconsolate and the worse for drink, the official orders everyone to ride together on the children's carousel, but as the mayor passes out, they realize that there is no one to switch the machine off and get them down. Legend tells that they were all still trapped there when the motorcade did after all pass through.\nThe Legend of the Party Photographer (Romanian: Legenda Fotografului Oficial)\n\nAvram Birau - The Photographer\nPaul Dunca - The Photographer's Assistant\nViorel Comanici - The Party SecretaryNewspaper editors and Party officials fret over a photograph of Ceaușescu and the visiting Giscard d'Estaing to be published in tomorrow's paper. Much argument is had over how best to doctor the photograph to make Ceaușescu appear taller than d'Estaing, and whether he should be wearing a hat. Pressure is mounting as the deadline to get the paper out to the workers approaches.  A hat is duly provided for Ceaușescu in the photograph, but no one notices until too late that he was already carrying one, leaving the image of him comically carrying one hat while wearing another.  Police are sent out to retrieve all the copies that had been sent out.  One copy is left uncollected on a train, and its reader laughs at the picture.  Legend tells us that this was the only time that the paper, Scînteia, did not reach the workers.\nThe Legend of the Zealous Activist (Romanian: Legenda Politrucului Zelos)\n\nCalin Chirila - The Party Activist\nRomeo Tudor - The ShepherdThe audience at a large county level Communist Party meeting is told by an outside official that their county, home to four notables that he names, has an unacceptably low literacy rate in its villages and towns.  He urges the young activists to spare no effort to remedy this disgrace.  One such activist is next seen being driven out to a remote village until the washed out road forces him to complete the journey on foot over difficult territory.  The first person he meets is a shepherd.  He wastes no time establishing himself as a know-it-all, informing the shepherd that his cooking method is dangerous.  He heads into town to meet the mayor, who offers various excuses, such as lack of electricity and the demands of farm work, for the poor attendance at the local school and other problems.  The activist will accept no excuse insisting that all illiterate locals old and young must come in for class.  Only a few children attend the first session when the activist insists that the mayor round up the adults.  Some come; others, including the shepherd, send food items instead.  A boy who has learned to read starts reading labels and warning signs to the shepherd, who ignores the information doing what he pleases as always.  The activist, fed up with the shepherd's resistance goes out in the rain to get the shepherd to class.  The activist stops to work on his shoe leaning against a power line tower.  The shepherd, fed up with the activist's meddling, uses the pretext that the activist is being electrocuted by the tower to strike him with his crook.  Next we see the activist, arm in sling, sitting on a cart loaded with food stuffs and chickens, while the mayor reads an appreciative farewell praising the activist and feigning sorrow at his early departure.  On the way out the activist offers his hand to the shepherd who does not accept the gesture but hands him a bag of cheese to say goodbye and good riddance.  Legend tells us that the next year the village reported a literacy rate of 99%.\nThe Legend of the Greedy Policeman (Romanian: Legenda Milițianului Lacom)\n\nIon Sapdaru - Policeman Alexa\nVirginia Mirea - Policeman's Wife\nGabriel Spahiu - Neighbor\nIngrid Bisu - VivianaA policeman is promised a pig by his brother, but when it is delivered, is found to still be alive. Uncertain how to slaughter a pig, and unwilling to share the pig with their neighbours, the family manage to gas it with butane in their apartment's kitchen. Believing the gas to have completely dissipated, they try to burn the hairs from its corpse with a blow lamp, but instead succeed in blowing up their apartment.  Legend tells us that the family used what remained of the animal for the seasonal celebrations.\nThe Legend of the Air Sellers (Romanian: Legenda Vânzătorilor de Aer)\n\nDiana Cavallioti - Crina\nRadu Iacoban - BughiHigh school student Crina meets small-time con-artist Bughi, who ekes a living pretending to be a water inspector: calling door-to-door, he asks residents to provide a sample of their tap water in a bottle they supply, which he turns in for the deposit. She joins him on one of his trips, but persuades him that collecting multiple air samples will be faster. They discuss how many bottles it would take to buy a car, if not a Dacia then an inferior Lăstun.  Their scheme unravels when they become overambitious and try to scam an entire apartment block out of its bottles.  Legend tells us that with the end of Communism, Romanians bought Dacia cars with empty bottles.\nThe Legend of the Chicken Driver (Romanian: Legenda Şoferului de Găini)\n\nVlad Ivanov - Grigore\nTania Popa - Camelia\nLiliana Mocanu - MarusiaA poultry truck driver, disillusioned with his loveless marriage, tries to win the heart of the manageress of a roadside inn. He brings her the eggs laid overnight by the chickens in his truck, but the two of them realize with Easter coming up, it would be more profitable to sell them on to the general public instead. Their scheme collapses when he is found out and jailed for embezzlement. He is eventually permitted a visitor to his prison, though it proves to be not his mistress, but his angry wife.  Legend tells us that many Romanians were forced to steal to survive during the 80s.\n\nSee also\nRomanian New Wave\nCinema of Romania\nPassage 8:\nTales from the Crypt\nTales from the Crypt may refer to:\n\nTales from the Crypt (album), by American rapper C-Bo\nTales from the Crypt (comics), published by EC Comics during the 1950s\nTales from the Crypt (film), a 1972 Amicus film starring Ralph Richardson partially based on the comic book\nThe Vault of Horror, also known as Tales from the Crypt II, a 1973 sequel starring Terry-Thomas, Dawn Adams, Denholm Elliott, and Curt Jurgens also partially based on the comic book\nTales from the Crypt (TV series), a horror anthology series that ran from 1989 to 1996 based on the comic book\nTales from the Crypt (radio series), an American radio series spun off from the TV series\nDemon Knight, also known as Tales from the Crypt: Demon Knight, a 1995 film starring Billy Zane, William Sadler and Jada Pinkett Smith that acted as a spin-off from the television series\nBordello of Blood, also known as Tales from the Crypt Presents: Bordello of Blood, a 1996 film starring Dennis Miller, Erika Eleniak, Angie Everhart and Corey Feldman based on the television series\nRitual (2002 film), also known as Tales From the Crypt Presents: Ritual, the fifth installment (third of the HBO spinoffs) in the series starring Tim Curry, Jennifer Grey and Craig Sheffer\n\nSee also\nList of Tales from the Crypt episodes\nTales from the Crib, the first full-length album by Canadian punk band d.b.s.; it was released in 1995\nTales from the Cryptic, a 2002 album by accordionist Guy Klucevsek and saxophonist Phillip Johnston\nTales from the Cryptkeeper, a 1993 animated TV series based on the Tales of the Crypt movies and comics\nPassage 9:\nTales from the Crapper\nTales from the Crapper is a 2004 American straight-to-video anthology film that was a spoof of the Tales from the Crypt comics. The film was released by Troma Entertainment.\n\nPlot\nTroma Entertainment co-founder and B-movie director and producer Lloyd Kaufman plays the Crap Keeper. He presents the viewers with two horror stories that contain gore, nudity, fat men, talking penises, lesbian scenes, vampires, UFOs, and appearances by porn star Ron Jeremy and the band New Found Glory. The film was purportedly shot over three years with six directors and close to fifteen writers.\n\nCast\nProduction\nThe film started pre-production in early 2001, after a successful digitized web-comic starring Yaniv Sharon entitled Tales From the Crapper hit the Troma website. After the three-part comic was done, Troma President Lloyd Kaufman wanted a real series on their website to be made. A contract was done with India Allen, who had recently produced and directed the film The Rowdy Girls which Troma distributed. The budget for the first season was $200,000 USD.\nAfter more than a year of production, Troma received the footage that was shot and it was unwatchable. In some cases, there was missing sound, the camera-work seemed unprofessional. All of the episodes were unfinished. Lloyd Kaufman and Michael Herz were even more displeased when they found out that the entire budget was gone. In order to salvage the project, Lloyd Kaufman got former Troma alumni to re-work the script and find new uses for the footage shot. In 2003, re-shooting began both in Los Angeles and New York with Kaufman overseeing production. Gabriel Friedman, Troma's editor at the time, had made a list of the shots that were needed for the rewrites that they were working on. Despite Friedman and Kaufman being clear on what to do, many problems arose as well in the re-shoot with incompetent crew members. This led to years of post-production.  In order to make scenes fit together and due to the lack of sound on most of the footage, many scenes had to be re-dubbed. Both segments, which started out as horror films with a slice of comedy, had now become over-the-top comedy.\n\nSee also\nTroma Entertainment\nLloyd Kaufman\nTales from the Crypt\nPassage 10:\nTales from the Vienna Woods (disambiguation)\nTales from the Vienna Woods (\"Geschichten aus dem Wienerwald\") is a waltz by Johann Strauss II.\nTales from the Vienna Woods may also refer to:\n\nTales from the Vienna Woods (play), a 1931 play by Ödön von Horváth\nTales from the Vienna Woods (1928 film), a German silent film\nTales from the Vienna Woods (1934 film), an Austrian musical film\nTales from the Vienna Woods (1979 film), an Austrian drama film", "answers": ["Su-Ki-Da"], "length": 5606, "dataset": "2wikimqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "339cb93913d08713e8202ffe6e4043f35e844ac9b7de591d"}

Although the KGB has checked in with Rybakov several years later, Rybakov insisted on writing the final draft of the novel using previous remaining drafts and memory. The novel was later published a decade later. In 1983, Rybakov had met Konstantin Lopushansky to discuss writing the screenplay for his film Dead Man's Letters. The process of developing the film allowed both artists to freely express their visions for the production of the film and further productions further on, this was a stark contrast to Russia's strict censorship rules at the time.\n\nScience fiction\nAmong Rybakov's works were first published and include the prize-winning novels: Fireplace on a Tower (Ochag na bashne, 1990), and Gravilyot Tsesarevitch (1993) which depicts an alternative world featuring a Russian Empire in which communism is merely a religion, and our world is just an insane scientific experiment.\nHis Death of Ivan Ilyich (1997) reveals the inner world of a contemporary person in a moment before his death.\nThe novel Na budushchiy god v Moskve (In the adjacent year in Moscow, 2003) explores a Russia torn apart into small, poor countries, ruled by those idealists of the late Soviet Union who sincerely hated totalitarianism but didn't notice any good features of the nation, ruined the whole system of government and survived with help of the West. In the story, space is ruled by Darths and Vaders, and a Russian rocket scientist Ivan Obiwankin attempts to resurrect his people's feelings of nationalism by launching his own space ship.\nRybakov preaches equality of cultures and states that cultures are often based on restrictions, and that simply removing the restrictions as anti-democratic may ruin the culture. Rybakov's novel also examines the Russian mentality, criticizing its tendency to understand and agree with the positions of others as an inappropriate way to deal with the encroaching Western civilization. He argues that all living civilizations are unique, and that in the future it may become essential to save some other civilization from stagnation, because a world ruled by only one civilization has no future.\nHe shows through an example of the ruined family of the main character Alexey that, \n\n\"the surest way for you to cease being esteemed and appreciated... even just loved... is to implicitly cede something essential and principal.\"\nVyacheslav Rybakov and Igor Alimov were also the authors  of There are no bad people. The work was originally attributed to Holm van Zaichik but was later proved to be a hoax. The series tells the story of the world of the Orduss, a fictional country with a humane and rich culture, that unifies lands of China, Russia and the Near East.\n\nEnglish translations\nArtist (Story)\nThe Trial Sphere (Story)\nPassage 3:\nThe Dance of Death (1948 film)\nThe Dance of Death (French: La danse de mort, Italian: La prigioniera dell'isola) is a 1948 French-Italian drama film directed by Marcel Cravenne and starring Erich von Stroheim, Denise Vernac and Palau.

He wrote it along with Vyacheslav Rybakov and Boris Strugatsky. It marks his directorial debut.\nThe film was screened at the International Critics' Week section of the Cannes Film Festival in 1987\nand received the FIPRESCI prize at the 35th International Filmfestival Mannheim-Heidelberg.In the aftermath of nuclear apocalypse, a group of people are forced to live underground in bunkers. They cannot go outside their dwellings without wearing protective clothing and gas masks. They try to find hope in the disturbing new world. Among these people is a history teacher who tries to contact via letters his missing son.\n\nPlot\nThe film is set in a town after a nuclear war; the town is destroyed and polluted with radioactive elements. The main character, Professor Larsen, played by Rolan Bykov, is a Nobel Prize in Physics laureate, who lives in the basement of a museum along with his sick wife and several other people who used to work at the museum. He often writes letters to his son Eric, though he has no way of contacting him. Larsen believes the war has ended and that more surviving humans exist outside the central bunker, but nobody else believes his theories.\nLarsen visits an orphanage where the current caretaker of the surviving children explains that she's thinking of evacuating to the central bunker, though may have to leave the children behind as they likely won't be allowed in since they're sick, to Larsen's disapproval. Larsen is informed that he also might be rejected from entering the central bunker due to his old age. With his wife's health declining, Larsen sneaks past several soldiers during curfew hours and attempts to find medicine for his wife, escaping from a military raid in the process. When he returns to the museum's basement, however, he finds that his wife died. The other museum employees bury her body.\nIn one of his letters to Eric, Larsen tells a darkly humorous story on how someone failed to prevent the nuclear war. According to him, an operator from an electronics center had a chance to cancel the first missile launch (which happened due to a computer error), but was unable to reach the computer in time to abort the launch as he was slowed down by a cup of coffee in his hands. The operator then hung himself in return.\nLarsen makes a trip to the central bunker in an effort to find Eric. After sneaking into a medical facility, he enters the children's department, only to find all the children sick, injured, and screaming in agony, much to Larsen's horror.\nAfter returning to the museum's basement, he finds that a museum employee is about to take his life as he thinks the history of mankind has ended and that mankind was doomed from the very beginning. He then leaves the group, lies down in a grave, and shoots himself dead, to the horror of his son. Later, while salvaging books from a flooded library, Larsen talks with a man who disagrees with his theory on how there's hope for mankind, referencing how Jesus said mankind was doomed.\nLarsen visits the orphanage where he learns the children were rejected from entering the central bunker. The caretaker leaves the children for Larsen to look after, as she is evacuating to the central bunker herself. The remaining museum employees also evacuate to the central bunker, though Larsen stays behind to look after the children (it's assumed they're the only people left in the town). On Christmas Day, Larsen creates a makeshift Christmas tree out of sticks and candles while the children design Christmas ornaments to decorate it with. In his final letter to Eric, Larsen writes that he finally found purpose in life and that he hopes his son doesn't leave him alone in the world.\nThe final scene is narrated by one of the children Larsen looked after, who explains that Larsen died some time later. On his deathbed, he told the children to leave the museum and find somewhere else to go while they have the strength, still believing that life exists elsewhere. The film ends with the children wandering through the apocalyptic landscape together, their fates unknown.\n\nCast\nRolan Bykov - Professor Larsen\nVatslav Dvorzhetsky - Pastor\nVera Mayorova - Anna\nVadim Lobanov\nViktor Mikhaylov\nSvetlana Smirnova - Theresa\nVladimir Bessekernyh\nVyacheslav Vasiliev - doctor dosimetrist\nNatalya Vlasova\n\nThemes\nDue to the heated climate between North America and Russia during the events of The Cold War, many critics believe that Dead Man's Letters is a response to American films like WarGames and The Day After discussing their perspective on the Nuclear Arms Race. TBS purchased the rights to show Dead Man's Letters, deciding to air it alongside Amerika, a twelve-hour ABC miniseries about what the United States would be like as a Soviet satellite state. The heavy reliance on themes like warfare, uncertainty, and grief as well as Americans involved in the war are interwoven through the production design from Yelena Amshinskaya and Viktor Ivanov. The use of defense equipment in the film, including gas masks and shelter equipment,  makes its portrayal of a post-nuclear setting an eerie mirror image of the Soviet program.\n\nProduction\nAround the time the film started production, it was common knowledge that Russia had a strict censorship policy following the death of Stalin, resulting in a three year waiting period for Lopushansky and the crew consisting of various re-rewrites, possibly most likely due to Vyacheslav Rybakov's involvement with anti-Soviet literature and run-ins with the KGB. However, censorship started to loosen around the mid to late 80s towards discussing sensitive topics regarding current or previous events in Russia's history, so producers and film studios became more lenient with what was shown in cinemas. Gorbachev established a policy of allowing more open discussion of previously sensitive political issues making it possible for well connected civil defense skeptics to popularize their views. The patronage of Anatoly Gromyko-historian, member of the USSR Academy of Sciences, and son of Soviet foreign minister Andrei Gromyko enabled the production by Lenfilm in 1986 of the first portrayal of the aftermath of nuclear war in Soviet cinema.Before production started on this film and his short Solo, Lopunshansky served as an apprentice for Tarkovsky and would later work as a production assistant for his 1979 film Stalker. Tarkovsky's teachings played a huge influence on Lopushansky's directing style as well as many aspects of the film from the set design, cinematography, and signature slow yet otherworldly pacing. In a 2017 interview with Indie Cinema, Lopunshansky states  \"I noticed that his lectures, in fact, are not about certain professional skills, but are more philosophical, about understanding the essence of art, its essence.\" This can be seen through the film's brutal realism and constant feelings of hopelessness and confusion, a sentiment shared with by various members of the crew. The use of monochrome coloring on the film stock gives a resemblance to the greenish tint seen in various scenes in Stalker, in order to give the film a more foreboding atmosphere.\n\nReception\nIn 1989, The New York Times  published a somewhat positive review of the film. Praising the film for its brutal realism and stunning set design, but found that the film was somewhat dismissed by its meandering in certain scenes stating \"despite its technical virtues, seems just a bit too contrived to truly convince, much less to deeply move. Yet, in stripping the ideological gloss from the vision of ultimate calamity, Mr. Lopushinsky does succeed in creating a cultural artifact that makes the specter of the most dreadful possible event common to both sides of the superpower divide\".\n\nSee also\nVyacheslav Rybakov\nList of nuclear holocaust fiction\nNuclear weapons in popular culture\nPassage 5:\nMichael Verhoeven\nMichael Verhoeven (born 13 July 1938) is a German film director.\n\nLife and work\nVerhoeven is the son of the German film director Paul Verhoeven (not to be confused with the Dutch film director Paul Verhoeven).

Augustus Barratt\nW. Augustus Barratt (3 June 1873 – 12 April 1947) was a Scottish-born, later American, songwriter and musician.\n\nEarly life and songs\nWalter Augustus Barratt was born 3 June 1873 in Kilmarnock, the son of composer John Barratt; the family later lived in Paisley. In 1893 he won a scholarship for composition to the Royal College of Music.\nIn his early twenties he contributed to The Scottish Students' Song Book, with three of his own song compositions and numerous arrangements.\nBy the end of 1897 he had published dozens of songs, such as Sir Patrick Spens, The Death of Cuthullin, an album of his own compositions, and arrangements of ten songs by Samuel Lover.\nHe then, living in London, turned his attention to staged musical comedy, co-creating, with Adrian Ross, The Tree Dumas Skiteers, a skit, based on Sydney Grundy's The Musketeers that starred Herbert Beerbohm Tree. He co-composed with Howard Talbot the successful Kitty Grey (1900).He continued to write songs and to receive recognition for them. The 1901 and 1902 BBC Promenade Concerts, \"The Proms\", included four of his compositions, namely Come back, sweet Love, The Mermaid, My Peggy and Private Donald.\nHis setting of My Ships, a poem by Ella Wheeler Wilcox, was performed by Clara Butt and republished several times. It also appeared four times, with different singers, in the 1913 and 1914 Proms.\n\nAmerica\nIn September 1904 he went to live in New York City, finding employment with shows on Broadway, including the following roles:\n\non-stage actor (Sir Benjamin Backbite) in Lady Teazle (1904-1905), a musical version of The School for Scandal;\nmusical director of The Little Michus (1907), also featuring songs by Barratt;\nco-composer of Miss Pocahontas (1907), a musical comedy;\nmusical director of The Love Cure (1909–1910), a musical romance;\ncomposer of The Girl and the Drummer (1910), a musical romance with book by George Broadhurst. Tried out in Chicago and elsewhere, it did not do well and never reached Broadway;\nmusical director of The Quaker Girl (1911–1912);\nco-composer and musical director of My Best Girl (1912);\nmusical director of The Sunshine Girl (1913);\nmusical director of The Girl who Smiles (1915), a musical comedy;\nmusical director and contributor to music and lyrics of Her Soldier Boy (1916–1917);\ncomposer, lyricist and musical director of Fancy Free (1918), with book by Dorothy Donnelly and Edgar Smith;\ncontributor of a song to The Passing Show of 1918;\ncomposer and musical director of Little Simplicity (1918), with book and lyrics by Rida Johnson Young;\ncontributor of lyrics to The Melting of Molly (1918–1919), a musical comedy;\nmusical director of What's in a Name? (1920), a musical revue\n\n1921 in London\nThough domiciled in the US, he made several visits back to England. During an extended stay in 1921 he played a major part in the creation of two shows, both produced by Charles B. Cochran, namely\n\nLeague of Notions, at the New Oxford Theatre, for which he composed the music and co-wrote, with John Murray Anderson, the lyrics;\nFun of the Fayre, at the London Pavilion, for which similarly he wrote the music and co-wrote the lyrics\n\nBack to Broadway\nBack in the US he returned to Broadway, working as\ncomposer and lyricist of Jack and Jill (1923), a musical comedy;\nmusical director of The Silver Swan (1929), a musical romance\n\nRadio plays\nIn later years he wrote plays and operettas mostly for radio, such as:\n\nSnapshots: a radioperetta (1929)\nSushannah and the Brush Wielders: a play in 1 act (1929)\nThe Magic Voice: a radio series (1933)\nMen of Action: a series of radio sketches (1933)\nSay, Uncle: a radio series (1933)\nSealed Orders: a radio drama (1934)\nSergeant Gabriel (with Hugh Abercrombie) (1945)\n\nPersonal\nIn 1897 in London he married Lizzie May Stoner. They had one son. In 1904 he emigrated to the US and lived in New York City. His first marriage ended in divorce in 1915 and, in 1918, he married Ethel J Moore, who was American. In 1924, he became a naturalized American citizen. He died on 12 April 1947 in New York City.\n\nNote on his first name\nThe book British Musical Biography by Brown & Stratton (1897) in its entry for John Barratt refers to \"his son William Augustus Barratt\" with details that make it clear that Walter Augustus Barratt is the same person and that a \"William\" Augustus Barratt is a mistake. For professional purposes up to about 1900 he appears to have written as \"W. Augustus Barratt\", and thereafter mostly as simply \"Augustus Barratt\".\nPassage 7:\nDance of Death (film)\nDance of Death, also called Danse Macabre, is a late-medieval allegory of the universality of death.\nDance of Death or The Dance of Death may also refer to:\n\nBooks\nDance of Death, a 1938 novel by Helen McCloy\nDance of Death (Stine novel), a 1997 novel by R.

She became best known for Letters from a Living Dead Man (1914), War Letters from the Living Dead Man (1915), and Last Letters From the Living Dead Man (1919), books containing what she said were messages from a dead man produced through automatic writing.\n\nBiography\nBarker was born in 1869 in Leicester, Vermont to Albert G. and Louise Marie Barker, both of whom died while she was young. Her earliest work was as a shorthand reporter, teacher, and newspaper writer. She was an  editor of the Consolidated Encyclopedia Library in 1901, was a lecturer for the New York Board of Education in 1904-1905, and was on the editorial staff of Hamptons magazine in 1909-1910. She also authored a \"labor play\", The Scab, produced in New York and Boston in 1904-1906. Her first novel, The Son of Mary Bethel, was published in 1909.Barker's father had been interested in the occult and she shared this interest, becoming a member of the Theosophical Society. She also was initiated into the Rosicrucian Order of Alpha et Omega.Barker lived in Europe from 1910 to 1914, first in Paris and then in London. She was in London at the outbreak of World War I. In 1912, while in Paris, she felt compelled to write a passage, although she said she did not know where the words came from. She said she was \"strongly impelled to take up a pencil and write.\" She signed the passage \"X\", which at first meant nothing to her. She was told that \"X\" was the nickname of a Los Angeles judge called David P. Hatch and then discovered that Hatch had died before she \"received\" the message. In 1914 she published a book of these messages called Letters from a Living Dead Man. She said that the passages were genuine messages from the dead man and Hatch's son also believed that the communications were from his father. She published two more volumes of Hatch's messages — War Letters from the Living Dead Man (1915), and Last Letters From the Living Dead Man (1919).\nAround the time of the publication of War Letters from the Living Dead Man in 1915, Barker developed an interest in psychoanalysis. By 1919 she was studying 14 hours a day. From 1928 to 1930 she lived on the French Riviera. Barker died August 31, 1954.\n\nSelected works\nThe Son of Mary Bethel (1909)\nThe Frozen Grail & Other Poems (1910)\nStories from the New Testament for Children (1911)\nThe Book of Love (1912)\nLetters from a Living Dead Man (1914, 1920)\nWar Letters from the Living Dead Man (1915)\nSongs of a Vagrom Angel (1916)\nLast Letters From the Living Dead Man (1919)\nFielding Sargent (1922)\nThe Cobra Candlestick (1928)\nThe C.I.D. of Dexter Drake (1929)\nThe Redman Cave Murder (1930)\nPassage 10:\nAvenger X\nAvenger X (Italian: Mister-X) is a 1967 film based on the Italian comic series Mister-X.\n\nPlot\nGeorge Lamarro is the head of a pharmaceutical company that is also involved in the production and distribution of illegal narcotics.  When his secretary attempts to blackmail him for a share of the profits and his hand in marriage, he has her killed with her death arranged in a way to implicate a master criminal called \"Mister X\" who is a master of disguise, efficient killer and professional golf champion.

The comic was first published by Milan's Edizioni Cervinia in October 1964. Unlike other fumetti neri of the era, Mister-X had very little violent content, with the titular character being a gentleman thief similar to Arsène Lupin. In the film, the titular character Mister X visually differs from the comics design who had a black hood and leotard opposed to the red cape, white boots and hood that covers his face that his comic book counterpart wears.Parts of the film were shot in Rome including location shooting at the Stadio dei Marmi.\n\nRelease\nAvenger X was released in Italy in 1967 as Mister X. The English-language title of the film ignores the characters name and is titled Avenger X. Director Piero Vivarelli stated most of the violent scenes in the film were removed from the Italian version of the film to earn a V.M.14 rating.  Censors documents only suggested that 47 seconds of the film were cut in Italy This included scenes where a blowtorch approaches Mister-X's bare chest and a shot of a speedboat moving towards a reef. The film grossed 112 million Italian lire in Italy during its theatrical run. The film was distributed by Euro International.The film was released in Spain on 22 January 1968 where it sold 707,889 admissions.\n\nSee also\nList of films based on comics\nList of Italian films of 1967\nList of Spanish films of 1967", "answers": ["Dead Man'S Letters"], "length": 5645, "dataset": "2wikimqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "d8a4ba25a31cde41c5ce4581f3c4cbd827cc6fc61b31ffe1"}

At the end of the song, the singer's lover jumps in to defend the singer, who is confronting his lover's brother (the singer's \"sworn enemy\") and is killed by the bullet intended for the singer.\n\nTrack listing\nThe 7\" single sold in the UK was mispressed, with \"Culling of the Fold\" as the B-side despite the artwork and record label listing \"After the Bombs\" as the B-side.\n\nMusic videos\nFor the \"O Valencia!\" music video, The Decemberists filmed themselves in front of a green screen and asked fans to complete it by digitally adding in background images or footage. Stephen Colbert of The Colbert Report, having recently asked fans to do the same with a video of him with a light saber in front of a green screen, brought up The Decemberists on his segment \"Look Who's Riding on My Coattails Now\" and accused the band of stealing the idea. The Decemberists' response was to challenge Stephen Colbert to a guitar solo showdown on December 20, 2006, on The Colbert Report.On January 19, 2007, The Decemberists premiered an alternate music video of \"O Valencia!\", directed by Aaron Stewart-Ahn, on MTV2. The video follows a character named Patrick, played by Meloy, as he and his love Francesca (Lisa Molinaro), daughter of \"the Boss\", plan an escape to an unknown location. At a cafe, a man in a suit, portrayed by the band member Chris Funk, tells him to hide in the \"Valencia\" hotel (the Super Value Inn on North Interstate Avenue in Portland, Oregon) while he gets them the necessary documentation to escape. Above the name of the hotel, there is a neon sign that reads \"Office\". The letters have all burnt out except for the \"O\", creating the title of the song. The video then introduces other characters - various assassination teams - who sit in different rooms of the hotel waiting for the chance to catch the two lovers. Most are portrayed by other members of the band (along with Meloy's wife, Carson Ellis). They kill off any potential witnesses to their plan. Patrick manages to take down one member from each team, before they gang up on him. The Boss arrives, along with the man from the cafe, who reveals that he snitched on Patrick and Francesca. They execute Francesca, while forcing Patrick to watch. After they leave, Patrick finds a note by Francesca, which reveals that she never fell in love with him, and only wanted protection. 2 months later, Patrick and the man, who has lost an eye from a previous assassination attempt, have a sit-down at the same cafe. The man reveals that he snitched on Patrick just to take over the town. Patrick reveals that he poisoned a drink the man was having, but before he could get away, the man stabs Patrick in the neck with a fork before dying, followed by Patrick.\nThe video is somewhat influenced by the distinct style and themes of director Wes Anderson, with bold fonts being used to introduce characters and groups on the bottom of the screen (much like in the film The Royal Tenenbaums). The band had previously (and more explicitly) drawn influence from Anderson's Rushmore in their video for \"Sixteen Military Wives\". The layout of the hotel is also similar to the one used in Bottle Rocket.\nKurt Nishimura was chosen as the winner by mtvU for his video that depicted a love affair between a woman and her television, with the TV containing the green-screened Decemberists video footage.\nPassage 2:\nObata Toramori\nObata Toramori (小畠虎盛, 1491 – July 14, 1561) was Japanese samurai warrior of the Sengoku Period.

She has won several awards for her music and, as of 2023, had sold more than 50 million records worldwide. Billboard named her the top jazz artist of the 2000's decade. She has won nine Grammy Awards and was ranked 60th on Billboard magazine's artists of the 2000s decade chart.In 2002, Jones launched her solo music career with the release of Come Away with Me, which was a fusion of jazz with country, blues, folk and pop.

Her seventh studio album, Pick Me Up Off the Floor, was released on June 12, 2020. Jones made her feature film debut as an actress in My Blueberry Nights, which was released in 2007 and was directed by Wong Kar-Wai.\nJones is the daughter of Indian sitarist and composer Ravi Shankar and concert producer Sue Jones, and is the half-sister of fellow musicians Anoushka Shankar and Shubhendra Shankar.\n\nEarly life\nJones was born Geethali Norah Jones Shankar on March 30, 1979, in Manhattan, New York City, to American concert producer Sue Jones and Indian Bengali musician Ravi Shankar.After her parents separated in 1986, Jones lived with her mother, growing up in Grapevine, Texas. As a child, Jones began singing in church and also took piano and voice lessons. She attended Colleyville Middle School and Grapevine High School before transferring to Booker T. Washington High School for the Performing and Visual Arts in Dallas. Her music took its first form early on in the local Methodist Church where she regularly sang solos. While in high school, she sang in the school choir, participated in band, and played the alto saxophone. At the age of 16, with both parents' consent, she officially changed her name to Norah Jones, removing the Indian elements from her name.Jones always had an affinity for the music of Bill Evans and Billie Holiday, among other \"oldies\". She once said, \"My mom had this eight-album Billie Holiday set; I picked out one disc that I liked and played that over and over again\".She attended Interlochen Center for the Arts during the summers. While at high school, she won the Down Beat Student Music Awards for Best Jazz Vocalist (twice, in 1996 and 1997) and Best Original Composition (1996).Jones attended the University of North Texas (UNT), where she majored in jazz piano and sang with the UNT Jazz Singers. During this time, she had a chance meeting with future collaborator Jesse Harris. She gave a ride to a band playing at the university whose members happened to be friends of Harris. He was on a cross-country road trip with friend and future Little Willies member Richard Julian, and stopped to see the band play. After meeting Jones, Harris started sending her lead sheets of his songs.\nIn 1999, Jones left Texas for New York City. Less than a year later, she started a band with Harris, and her recordings with them were bestsellers.\n\nMusical career\nJones was a lounge singer before becoming a recording artist. Before releasing her first studio album, she performed with Wax Poetic, Peter Malick, and jazz guitarist Charlie Hunter.\n\n2000–2001: New York City, First Sessions\nAs Peter Malick states in the liner notes, \"I started looking for a singer who might be open to recording [my latest songs] for me. On a Tuesday night, I walked into the Living Room just as the singer announced the last song of the set. The Dinah Washington classic 'Since I Fell for You' filled the room and I was struck breathless. Here, in the tradition of Billie Holiday, was a stunningly beautiful, blues infused voice. This was my first contact with Norah Jones.\" Malick asked her to participate in sessions at Room 9 from Outer Space in South Boston, during August and September 2000. They recorded Malick's songs \"New York City\", \"Strange Transmissions\", \"Deceptively Yours\" and \"Things You Don't Have to Do\" in addition to cover versions of \"All Your Love\" by Sam Maghett and \"Heart of Mine\" by Bob Dylan. These songs became the album New York City (Koch, 2003) by the Peter Malick Group Featuring Norah Jones.After moving to New York City, Jones signed to Blue Note, a label owned by EMI Group. The signing came as an indirect result of her performing as lead singer for the JC Hopkins Biggish Band. Shell White, who was the wife of J. C. Hopkins, worked for EMI Publishing and gave Jones's three-track demo to Bruce Lundvall, the label's president, and Brian Bacchus, its artists and repertoire agent (A&R). The demo contained two jazz standards and a song by Jesse Harris. The two executives agreed that Jones had potential. Despite their misgivings about the direction of her music, they signed her to the label. Bacchus told HitQuarters, \"We let her find her own direction ... We knew that if she could develop her songwriting and we could find great songs, it would work.\"\n\n2002: Come Away with Me\nBacchus thought producer and engineer Jay Newland's experience in jazz, blues, rock, country, and folk music would give a \"feeling for her sound.\" Jones and Newland recorded nine demo tracks. Four appeared on the sampler First Sessions (2001). The rest were set aside for her debut album. Come Away with Me (2002) was praised for its blend of acoustic pop with soul and jazz. Debuting at No. 139, it reached No. 1 on the U.S. Billboard 200. The single \"Don't Know Why\" hit No. 1 on the Top 40 Adult Recurrents in 2003 and No. 30 in the Billboard Hot 100 Singles Chart. At the 45th Grammy Awards in 2003, Jones was nominated for eight Grammy Awards and won five: Best New Artist, Album of the Year, Best Pop Vocal Album, Record of the Year, and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance for \"Don't Know Why\". This tied Lauryn Hill and Alicia Keys for most Grammy Awards received by a female artist in one night. Jesse Harris won Song of the Year for \"Don't Know Why\" while Arif Mardin won Producer of the Year. The album won Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical. Come Away with Me was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for having sold one million copies.

Not Too Late was mostly recorded at Jones's home studio. It is her first album without producer Arif Mardin, who died in the summer of 2006. Jones described the sessions as \"fun, relaxed and easy\" and without a deadline; Blue Note executives reportedly did not know she was recording an album. The song \"My Dear Country\" is political commentary; she wrote it before the United States Presidential election day in 2004. Not Too Late reached the No. 1 position in twenty countries. Not Too Late had the third-best first week of sales in 2007, behind Avril Lavigne's The Best Damn Thing and Linkin Park's Minutes to Midnight. It reached No. 1 in the U.S., selling 405,000 copies. EMI announced that Not Too Late reached gold, platinum or multi-platinum in 21 countries as of February 2007. The album has sold 4 million copies worldwide. That same year she sang \"American Anthem\" for the Ken Burns documentary The War.\n\n2009: The Fall\nJones's fourth studio album, The Fall, debuted at No. 3 on the Billboard 200 in November 2009, selling 180,000 copies in its first week.

Her art inspired Ballew to consider making music that \"sounded like her art looked\" as he has said. Ballew began writing original songs and digging up nursery rhymes and folk songs in the public domain to interpret and make his own. The first album, Here I Am!, was recorded during the summer of 2008 and released in February 2009.\nBallew began to perform solo as Caspar Babypants in the Seattle area in January 2009. Fred Northup, a Seattle-based comedy improvisor, heard the album and offered to play as his live percussionist.  Northrup also suggested his frequent collaborator Ron Hippe as a keyboard player. \"Frederick Babyshirt\" and \"Ronald Babyshoes\" were the Caspar Babypants live band from May 2009 to April 2012. Both Northup and Hippe appear on some of his recordings but since April 2012 Caspar Babypants has exclusively performed solo. The reasons for the change were to include more improvisation in the show and to reduce the sound levels so that very young children and newborns could continue to attend without being overstimulated. \nBallew has made two albums of Beatles covers as Caspar Babypants. Baby Beatles! came out in September 2013 and Beatles Baby! came out in September 2015.\nBallew runs the Aurora Elephant Music record label, books shows, produces, records, and masters the albums himself. Distribution for the albums is handled by Burnside Distribution in Portland, Oregon.\nCaspar Babypants has released a total of 17 albums. The 17th album, BUG OUT!, was released on May 1, 2020. His album FLYING HIGH! was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Children's Album.

Performed by Norah Jones during the film's opening credits, the song was used as the film's main theme song. It was released by Universal Republic Records on June 26, 2012.In January 2013, the song was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song at the 85th Academy Awards, but lost to \"Skyfall\" from the film of the same name. MacFarlane was also the host of the Oscars while also being nominated.\n\nBackground\nSeth MacFarlane had sent Walter Murphy the script of Ted and said, \"first of all, he wanted an old-fashioned score that would have themes for the individual characters. That idea intrigued me because in most summer films the score goes in and out of pop songs and isn't usually constructed that way. He also wanted a main title song that I could quote throughout the film.\"\nMacFarlane had sent Murphy a set of lyrics, a different set of lyrics than the ones they used in \"Everybody Needs a Best Friend,\" and Murphy would then write the theme. When MacFarlane had started filming of Ted Murphy thought it would be funnier if the song were sung from the standpoint of Ted so he rewrote the lyrics. Murphy then did a Nelson Riddle–type arrangement–and when they started recording he got the idea of taking it Norah Jones. Murphy flew to New York City with the Pro Tools files of the work they did on the scoring stage at Fox with a big band and string orchestra.\n\nLive performance and cover versions\nNorah Jones performed the song live for the first time on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. Jones performed the song at the 85th Academy Awards ceremony on February 24, 2013. Seth MacFarlane performed the song in August 2014 at the Hollywood Bowl during a John Williams concert.", "answers": ["Ravi Shankar"], "length": 5850, "dataset": "2wikimqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "2820f5f6db2a73a11f6269437ced07bf92dd3636cfda02ee"}
{"input": "Where did Elizabeth Brooke (1503–1560)'s husband study at?", "context": "Passage 1:\nNancy Baron\nNancy Baron is an American rock singer who was active in New York City in the early 1960s, known for the singles \"Where Did My Jimmy Go?\" and \"I've Got A Feeling\".\n\nEarly life\nBorn into a family of singers and writers, Baron was introduced to many musical genres by her family at an early age. Noting her singing talents, her parents brought their young child to auditions for musical theater productions in New York City. The singer joined Glee clubs at school and formed her own female singing groups at school. At the age of 11, she heard her first \"Rock and Roll\" song. This affected her taste in music and desire to emulate the style; it was the first time she heard a Rock group with a female lead singer. This was significant since she realized that she could be a lead singer.\n\nRecording career\nAt the age of 15, her parents sent her for vocal coaching in Manhattan, N.Y. After a while her coach sent her to record a demonstration record in a sound studio near Broadway. Upon hearing her sing, the sound engineer contacted his friend who was a producer of a small record company in N.Y.C.; he was impressed by her voice and immediately signed her to a contract. The singer's mother co-signed the document since Baron was a fifteen-year-old minor at the time.Baron became one of the many girl group/girl sound singers of the early 1960s. Baron was not a member of a group; her producers would hire \"pay for hire\" backup groups for her recordings. This \"sound\" as it is referred to had much to do with Phil Spector, one of its major creators; Spector produced recordings of this genre prolifically. The groups were composed of young adult or teenage girls, each with a lead singer and any number of back up singers.At the time, the troubled label (a small N.Y.C. record company owned by Wally Zober) could not promote Baron's \"I've Got A Feeling\"/\"Oh Yeah\" 45 vinyl and so she eventually signed a contract with Jerry Goldstein producer of FGG productions, also located in Manhattan. \"Where Did My Jimmy Go\"/\"Tra la la, I Love You\" was the result (Diamond).\n\nLater life\nBaron left the music industry at the age of 19, choosing to enter higher education due to changes in the music industry of those days; she eventually received an advanced degree.\nBaron's \"I've Got a Feeling\" was covered by The Secret Sisters on their 2010 self-titled album as well as being released as a single. AllMusic describes Baron's song as \"an early-'60s pop/rock obscurity\".\nPassage 2:\nElizabeth Brooke (1503–1560)\nElizabeth Brooke, Lady Wyatt (1503–1560) was the wife of Sir Thomas Wyatt, the poet, and the mother of Thomas Wyatt the younger who led Wyatt's Rebellion against Mary I. Her parents were Thomas Brooke, 8th Baron Cobham and Dorothy Heydon, the daughter of Sir Henry Heydon.  She was the sister of George Brooke, 9th Baron Cobham and was considered a possible candidate for the sixth wife of Henry VIII of England.\n\nMarriage and issue\nElizabeth married twice.\n\nFirst Marriage\nIn 1520, Elizabeth married Sir Thomas Wyatt (1503 – 6 October 1542) and a year later, bore him a son:\nSir Thomas (1521–1554), who led an unsuccessful rebellion against Mary I in 1554. The aim of the rebellion was to replace the Catholic Queen Mary with her Protestant half-sister, Elizabeth.Early in the marriage, marital difficulties arose, with Wyatt claiming they were  'chiefly'  her fault. He repudiated her as an adulteress, although there is no record linking her with any specific man. Elizabeth separated from Thomas Wyatt in 1526 and he supported her until around 1537, when he refused to do so any longer and sent her to live with her brother, Lord Cobham. In that same year, Lord Cobham attempted to force Wyatt to continue his financial support. He refused. It wasn't until 1541, when Wyatt, accused of treason, was arrested and his properties confiscated, that the Brooke family was able to force a reconciliation as a condition for Wyatt’s pardon.In a letter to Charles V, the imperial ambassador, Eustace Chapuys wrote that Wyatt had been released from the Tower at the request of Catherine Howard. Chapuys noted that the king had imposed two conditions; that Wyatt  'confess his guilt'  and that  'he should take back his wife from whom he had been separated upwards of 15 years, on pain of death if he be untrue to her henceforth.'  There is no evidence that this provision was ever enforced or existed. After pursuing Anne Boleyn, before her relationship with the King, Wyatt had begun a long-term affair with Elizabeth Darrell and he continued his association with his mistress.On 14 February 1542, the night after Catherine Howard had been condemned to death for adultery, Henry VIII held a dinner for many men and women. The king was said to have paid great attention to Elizabeth and to Anne Basset and both were thought to be possible choices for his sixth wife. In early 1542, more than a year before Wyatt’s death, Elizabeth Brooke's name appeared in Spanish dispatches as one of three ladies in whom Henry VIII was said to be interested as a possible sixth wife.The imperial ambassador, Chapuys, wrote that the lady for whom the king \"showed the greatest regard was a sister of Lord Cobham, whom Wyatt, some time ago, divorced for adultery. She is a pretty young creature, with wit enough to do as badly as the others if she were to try.\" It would appear that the ambassador was mistaken, as at the time, Elizabeth Brooke was nearly forty years old. Perhaps Elizabeth Brooke had been confused with her beautiful young niece, Elisabeth Brooke, the eldest daughter of George Brooke, 9th Baron Cobham, who married William Parr, 1st Marquess of Northampton. Elisabeth Brooke, Lord Cobham’s daughter, may have been at court on this occasion, since she was definitely there the following year. She would have been nearly sixteen in January 1542 and in later years was accounted one of the most beautiful women of her time. More important to a king who had just rid himself of a wife (Catherine Howard) who had committed adultery, this second  Elisabeth had a spotless reputation.\n\nSecond marriage\nFollowing Wyatt’s death, Elizabeth Brooke married Sir Edward Warner (1511–1565), of Polstead Hall and Plumstead, Norfolk,  Lord Lieutenant of the Tower. The couple had three sons:\nEdward, who died in infancy\nThomas\nHenryWarner was removed from his position on July 28, 1553, at the start of the reign of Mary I, and was arrested on suspicion of treason the following January at his house in Carter Lane when Thomas Wyatt the younger rebelled against the Crown. Warner was held for nearly a year. Elizabeth’s son was executed. Edward, the son she had with Warner, died young. Two other sons died in infancy. The family fortunes were restored under Elizabeth I and Warner reclaimed his post at the Tower of London. His wife died there in August 1560 and was buried within its precincts.\n\nAncestry\nPassage 3:\nElizabeth Jocelin\nElizabeth Brooke Jocelin (sometimes spelled \"Joceline\" or \"Joscelin\") was an English writer believed to have lived from 1595–1622. She is best known for her work The Mother's Legacy to her Vnborn Child. The book was first published two years after Jocelin's death in childbirth.\n\nEarly life\nShe was the daughter of Sir Richard Brooke of Norton, Cheshire, and his wife Joan, daughter of William Chaderton, bishop of Lincoln. Her parents separated, and her mother returned home. Jocelin's grandfather, Bishop Chaderton, was mainly responsible for her upbringing. Elizabeth's childhood was therefore passed in the house of Bishop Chaderton, who educated her. She was extremely well versed in art, religion and language. According to her editor Thomas Goad, she had an exceptional memory.\n\nLater life\nIn 1616 she married Tourell Jocelin of Cambridgeshire. Foreboding her death in childbirth, she wrote a letter which gently but earnestly exhorted her son or daughter to piety and good conduct; and a letter to her husband, giving him advice as to the bringing up of the child. These works are thought to have been written at Crowlands, Oakington. She bore a daughter on 12 October 1622, and died nine days afterwards. The child, named Theodora, became the wife of Samuel Fortrey.\nThe Jocelins appeared to lead a rather happy marriage, one that appeared to be mainly based on genuine love. In The Mother's Legacy to her Vnborn Child Jocelin writes of how excited she is to be carrying her husband's child and that they have been working together to plan the best possible life for their child\nJocelin is noted for being \"one of the most notable young women of the times of James I”\n\nThe Legacie\nThe Legacie was first published in 1624 with a long Approbation by Thomas Goad giving some account of Elizabeth Jocelin's life. The second edition is dated 1624 and the third 1625. An exact reprint of the third edition, with an introduction by an anonymous Edinburgh editor, appeared in 1852. The edition printed at Oxford, 'for the satisfaction of the person of quality herein concerned,' in 1684, and reprinted at the end of C. H. Cranford's Sermons in 1840, is an altered one, the editor having made changes in religious matters. The manuscript of the Legacie is in the British Museum (Addit. MS. 27467). It is still somewhat contentious whether the manuscript is by Jocelin, and whether Goad's editorial work brought in substantive change in the content.Jocelin wrote The Mother’s Legacy to her Vnborn Child during the Early Modern period when women were typically defined by their existence in the domestic sphere. Jocelin's work kept in line with the expectations of women during the period because of her clear dedication to her position as a mother.\nOne of the idiosyncratic things about the mother's advice text is Jocelin's choice of tone and word use to insure that whether her child is a boy or a girl he or she will be able to follow the advice she leaves behind. There are clearly different expectations and techniques to raising a son or daughter and Jocelin makes sure to acknowledge these differences while leaving advice for both. For example, she addresses her daughter to respect, obey and be a good mother. Jocelin writes about her desire to protect her daughter “from a potentially difficult and uncomfortable way of life.” Jocelin has been criticised for her different approaches to raising her child based on its gender. Much like women of her time Jocelin desired for her daughter to be acceptable to society even if it meant limiting her intelligence or unhappiness.\nOne of the largest parts of The Mother’s Legacy to her Vnborn Child is the religious advice that Jocelin offers to her unborn child. She urges the child to pray regularly, avoid temptations, acknowledge holy days and be charitable.\nThe tone of the book is one filled with optimism and pride over becoming a new mother. Jocelin is clearly excited about meeting her child even though she seems to understand that birthing the child will be a great risk to herself.\nMuch of the books instruction is directed toward Jocelin's husband including how to properly select a wet nurse for their child if Elizabeth should die.\nExcerpts from The Mother's Legacy to her Vnborn Child:\n“I desire her bringing up may bee learning the Bible, as my sisters doe, good housewifery, writing, and good works: other learning a woman needs not; though I admire it in those whom God hath blest with descretion, yet I desired not much in my owne, having seene that sometimes women have greater portions of learning than wisdome, which is of no better use to them than a main saile to a flye-boat, which runs it under water. But where learning and wisdom meet in a vertuous disposed woman she is the fittest closet for all goodnesse. She is like a well-balanced ship that may beare all her saile. She is, Indeed, I should but shame my selfe, if I should goe about to praise her more...Yet I leave it to thy will...If thou desirest a learned daughter, I pray God give her a wise and religious heart, that she may use it to his glory, thy comfort, and her own salvation.”\n“And if thou beest a daughter, thou maist perhaps thinke I have lost my labour; but reade on, and thou shalt see my love and care of thee and thy salvation is as great, as if thou wert a sonne, and my feare greater”.\n\nPosthumous legacy\nElizabeth Jocelin is remembered as a dedicated mother and an iconic woman of her time because of her dedication to making sure her child was raised properly even after her death. The Mother's Legacy to her Vnborn Child is regarded as one of the most significant works of the time because of the intimate view it gives of the mindset, beliefs and ideals of women of the time.\n\nNotes\nPassage 4:\nThomas Wyatt (poet)\nSir Thomas Wyatt (1503 – 11 October 1542) was a 16th-century English politician, ambassador, and lyric poet credited with introducing the sonnet to English literature. He was born at Allington Castle near Maidstone in Kent, though the family was originally from Yorkshire. His family adopted the Lancastrian side in the Wars of the Roses. His mother was Anne Skinner, and his father Henry, who had earlier been imprisoned and tortured by Richard III, had been a Privy Councillor of Henry VII and remained a trusted adviser when Henry VIII ascended the throne in 1509. \nThomas followed his father to court after his education at St John's College, Cambridge. Entering the King's service, he was entrusted with many important diplomatic missions. In public life, his principal patron was Thomas Cromwell, after whose death he was recalled from abroad and imprisoned (1541). Though subsequently acquitted and released, shortly thereafter he died.  His poems were circulated at court and may have been published anonymously in the anthology The Court of Venus (earliest edition c. 1537) during his lifetime, but were not published under his name until after his death; the first major book to feature and attribute his verse was Tottel's Miscellany (1557), printed 15 years after his death.\n\nEarly life\nThomas Wyatt was born at Allington, Kent, in 1503, the son of Sir Henry Wyatt by Anne Skinner, the daughter of John Skinner of Reigate, Surrey. He had a brother Henry, assumed to have died an infant, and a sister, Margaret who married Sir Anthony Lee\n(died 1549) and was the mother of Queen Elizabeth's champion, Sir Henry Lee.\n\nEducation and diplomatic career\nWyatt was over six feet tall, reportedly both handsome and physically strong. He was an ambassador in the service of Henry VIII, but he entered Henry's service in 1515 as \"Sewer Extraordinary\", and the same year he began studying at St John's College, Cambridge. His father had been associated with Sir Thomas Boleyn as constable of Norwich Castle, and Wyatt was thus acquainted with Anne Boleyn.Following a diplomatic mission to Spain, in 1526, he accompanied Sir John Russell, 1st Earl of Bedford, to Rome to help petition Pope Clement VII to annul Henry VIII's marriage to Catherine of Aragon, freeing him to marry Anne Boleyn. Russell being incapacitated, Wyatt was also sent to negotiate with the Republic of Venice.  According to some, Wyatt was captured by the armies of Emperor Charles V when they captured Rome and imprisoned the Pope in 1527, but he managed to escape and make it back to England.\nBetween 1528 and 1530 Wyatt acted as high marshal at Calais. In the years following he continued in Henry's service; he was, however, imprisoned in the Tower of London for a month in 1536, perhaps because Henry hoped he would incriminate the queen. He was knighted in 1535 and appointed High Sheriff of Kent for 1536. At this time he was sent to Spain as ambassador to Charles V, who was offended by the declaration of Princess Mary's illegitimacy; he was her cousin and they had once been briefly betrothed. Although Wyatt was unsuccessful in his endeavours, and was accused of disloyalty by some of his colleagues, he was protected by his relationship with Cromwell, at least during the latter's lifetime.Wyatt was elected knight of the shire (MP) for Kent in December 1541.\n\nMarriage and issue\nIn 1520 Wyatt married Elizabeth Brooke (1503–1560). A year later, they had a son Thomas (1521–1554) who led Wyatt's rebellion some twelve years after his father's death. In 1524, Henry VIII assigned Wyatt to be an ambassador at home and abroad, and he separated from his wife soon after on grounds of adultery.\n\nWyatt's poetry and influence\nWyatt's professed object was to experiment with the English language, to civilise it, to raise its powers to equal those of other European languages. His poetry may be considered as a part of the Petrarchism movement within Renaissance literature. A significant amount of his literary output consists of translations and imitations of sonnets by Italian poet Petrarch; he also wrote sonnets of his own. He took subject matter from Petrarch's sonnets, but his rhyme schemes are significantly different. Petrarch's sonnets consist of an \"octave\" rhyming abba abba, followed by a \"sestet\" with various rhyme schemes. Wyatt employs the Petrarchan octave, but his most common sestet scheme is cddc ee. Wyatt experimented in stanza forms including the rondeau, epigrams, terza rima, ottava rima songs, and satires, as well as with monorime, triplets with refrains, quatrains with different length of line and rhyme schemes, quatrains with codas, and the French forms of douzaine and treizaine. He introduced the poulter's measure form, rhyming couplets composed of a 12-syllable iambic line (Alexandrine) followed by a 14-syllable iambic line (fourteener), and he is considered a master of the iambic tetrameter.Wyatt's poetry reflects classical and Italian models, but he also admired the work of Geoffrey Chaucer, and his vocabulary reflects that of Chaucer; for example, he uses Chaucer's word newfangleness, meaning fickleness, in They Flee from Me. Many of his poems deal with the trials of romantic love and the devotion of the suitor to an unavailable or cruel mistress. Other poems are scathing, satirical indictments of the hypocrisies and pandering required of courtiers who are ambitious to advance at the Tudor court.\nWyatt's poems are short but fairly numerous. His 96 love poems appeared posthumously (1557) in a compendium called Tottel's Miscellany. The most noteworthy are thirty-one sonnets, the first in English. Ten of them were translations from Petrarch, while all were written in the Petrarchan form, apart from the couplet ending which Wyatt introduced. Serious and reflective in tone, the sonnets show some stiffness of construction and a metrical uncertainty indicative of the difficulty Wyatt found in the new form. Yet their conciseness represents a great advance on the prolixity and uncouthness of much earlier poetry. Wyatt was also responsible for the important introduction of the personal note into English poetry, for although he followed his models closely, he wrote of his own experiences. His epigrams, songs, and rondeaux are lighter than the sonnets, and they reveal the care and the elegance typical of the new romanticism. His satires are composed in the Italian terza rima, again showing the direction of the innovating tendencies.\n\nAttribution\nThe Egerton Manuscript is an album containing Wyatt's personal selection of his poems and translations which preserves 123 texts, partly in his handwriting. Tottel's Miscellany (1557) is the Elizabethan anthology which created Wyatt's posthumous reputation; it ascribes 96 poems to him, 33 not in the Egerton Manuscript. These 156 poems can be ascribed to Wyatt with certainty on the basis of objective evidence. Another 129 poems have been ascribed to him purely on the basis of subjective editorial judgment. They are mostly derived from the Devonshire Manuscript Collection and the Blage manuscript. Rebholz comments in his preface to Sir Thomas Wyatt, The Complete Poems, \"The problem of determining which poems Wyatt wrote is as yet unsolved\".\n\nAssessment\nCritical opinions have varied widely regarding Wyatt's work. Eighteenth-century critic Thomas Warton considered Wyatt \"confessedly an inferior\" to his contemporary Henry Howard, and felt that Wyatt's \"genius was of the moral and didactic species\" but deemed him \"the first polished English satirist\". The 20th century saw an awakening in his popularity and a surge in critical attention. His poems were found praiseworthy by numerous poets, including Ezra Pound, Marianne Moore, John Berryman, Yvor Winters, Basil Bunting, Louis Zukofsky and George Oppen. C. S. Lewis called him \"the father of the Drab Age\" (i.e. the unornate), from what he calls the \"golden\" age of the 16th century. Patricia Thomson describes Wyatt as \"the Father of English Poetry\".\n\nRumoured affair with Anne Boleyn\nMany have conjectured that Wyatt fell in love with Anne Boleyn in the early- to mid-1520s. Their acquaintance is certain, but it is not certain whether the two shared a romantic relationship. George Gilfillan implies that Wyatt and Boleyn were romantically involved. In his verse, Wyatt calls his mistress Anna and might allude to events in her life:\n\nGilfillan argues that these lines could refer to Anne's trip to France in 1532 prior to her marriage to Henry VIII and could imply that Wyatt was present, although his name is not included among those who accompanied the royal party to France. Wyatt's sonnet \"Whoso List To Hunt\" may also allude to Anne's relationship with the King:\n\nIn still plainer terms, Wyatt's late sonnet \"If waker care\" describes his first \"love\" for \"Brunette that set our country in a roar\"—presumably Boleyn.\n\nImprisonment on charges of adultery\nIn May 1536, Wyatt was imprisoned in the Tower of London for allegedly committing adultery with Anne Boleyn. He was released later that year thanks to his friendship or his father's friendship with Thomas Cromwell, and he returned to his duties. During his stay in the Tower, he may have witnessed Anne Boleyn's execution (19 May 1536) from his cell window, as well as the executions of the five men with whom she was accused of adultery; he wrote a poem which might have been inspired by that experience.Around 1537, Elizabeth Darrell was Thomas's mistress, a former maid of honour to Catherine of Aragon. She bore Wyatt three sons.\nBy 1540, he was again in the king's favour, as he was granted the site and many of the manorial estates of the dissolved Boxley Abbey. However, he was charged once more with treason in 1541; the charges were again lifted, but only thanks to the intervention of Queen Catherine Howard and on the condition of reconciling with his wife. He was granted a full pardon and restored once again to his duties as ambassador. After the execution of Catherine Howard, there were rumours that Wyatt's wife Elizabeth was a possibility to become Henry VIII's next wife, despite the fact that she was still married to Wyatt. He became ill not long after and died on 11 October 1542 around age 39. He is buried in Sherborne Abbey.\n\nDescendants and relatives\nLong after Wyatt's death, his only legitimate son Sir Thomas Wyatt the Younger led a thwarted rebellion against Henry's daughter Mary I, for which he was executed. The rebellion's aim was to set on the throne the Protestant-minded Elizabeth, the daughter of Anne Boleyn. Wyatt was an ancestor of Wallis Simpson, wife of the Duke of Windsor, formerly King Edward VIII. Thomas Wyatt's great-grandson was Virginia Colony governor Sir Francis Wyatt.\n\nNotes\nPassage 5:\nRobert Paul Smith\nRobert Paul Smith (April 16, 1915 – January 30, 1977) was an American author, most famous for his classic evocation of childhood, Where Did You Go? Out. What Did You Do? Nothing.\n\nBiography\nRobert Paul Smith was born in Brooklyn, grew up in Mount Vernon, NY, and graduated from Columbia College in 1936. He worked as a writer for CBS Radio and wrote four novels: So It Doesn't Whistle (1946) (1941, according to Avon Publishing Co., Inc., reprint edition ... Plus Blood in Their Veins copyright 1952); The Journey, (1943); Because of My Love (1946); The Time and the Place (1951).\nThe Tender Trap, a play by Smith and Dobie Gillis creator Max Shulman, opened in 1954 with Robert Preston in the leading role. It was later made into a movie starring Frank Sinatra and Debbie Reynolds. A classic example of the \"battle-of-the-sexes\" comedy, it revolves around the mutual envy of a bachelor living in New York City and a settled family man living in the New York suburbs.\nWhere Did You Go? Out. What Did You Do? Nothing is a nostalgic evocation of the inner life of childhood. It advocates the value of privacy to children; the importance of unstructured time; the joys of boredom; and the virtues of freedom from adult supervision. He opens by saying \"The thing is, I don't understand what kids do with themselves any more.\" He contrasts the overstructured, overscheduled, oversupervised suburban life of the child in the suburban 1950's with reminiscences of his own childhood. He concludes \"I guess what I am saying is that people who don't have nightmares don't have dreams. If you will excuse me, I have an appointment with myself to sit on the front steps and watch some grass growing.\"\nTranslations from the English (1958) collects a series of articles originally published in Good Housekeeping magazine. The first, \"Translations from the Children,\" may be the earliest known example of the genre of humor that consists of a series of translations from what is said (e.g. \"I don't know why. He just hit me\") into what is meant (e.g. \"He hit his brother.\")\nHow to Do Nothing With Nobody All Alone By Yourself (1958) is a how-to book, illustrated by Robert Paul Smith's wife Elinor Goulding Smith. It gives step-by-step directions on how to: play mumbly-peg; build a spool tank; make polly-noses; construct an indoor boomerang, etc. It was republished in 2010 by Tin House Books.\n\nList of works\nEssays and humor\nWhere Did You Go?

Thomas Vesey, 1st Viscount de Vesci and 2nd Baron Knapton (c. 1735 – 13 October 1804), was an Anglo-Irish peer.\nLord de Vesci was the son of the 1st Baron Knapton and Elizabeth Brownlow. He succeeded to his father's peerage on 25 June 1761 and assumed his seat in the Irish House of Lords. On 22 June 1776 he was made Viscount de Vesci, of Abbeyleix in the Queen's County, in the Peerage of Ireland.On 24 September 1769, Lord Knapton, as he then was, married Elizabeth-Selina Brooke, the eldest daughter and co-heiress of Sir Arthur Brooke, 1st Baronet. Lord de Vesci was succeeded in his titles by his eldest son, John Vesey.\nPassage 7:\nElizabeth Darrell (courtier)\nElizabeth Darrell (born c. 1513 – c. 1556) was the long-term mistress and muse of Sir Thomas Wyatt. They had one surviving child, Francis. Wyatt was married to Elizabeth Brooke, Lady Wyatt whom he had accused of committing adultery, resulting in their separation. She was later rumoured to have been involved with Henry VIII.\n\nEarly years\nElizabeth Darrell (sometimes spelt Darell) was the daughter of Sir Edward Darrell of  Littlecote, Wiltshire. If she was born circa 1513, she must have been the daughter of Sir Edward's third wife, Alice Flye Stanhope who married him before 1513. Sir Edward was Chamberlain to Catherine of Aragon. Elizabeth was a servant of the Marchioness of Dorset and then afterward, on an unknown date, she became maid of honour to Queen Catherine. Possibly out of loyalty to Catherine or due to her dislike of Anne Boleyn, Elizabeth refused to take the Oath of Supremacy. When Catherine of Aragon died in January 1536, she left Elizabeth a gift of £200 for her future marriage.\n\nThomas Wyatt\nAround the year 1537, Elizabeth became the mistress of the poet and cousin of the late queen Anne Boleyn, Sir Thomas Wyatt (1503 – 11 October 1542). He was legally married to Elizabeth Brooke, the mother of his son Thomas, although they were separated. Elizabeth bore Sir Thomas three sons:\nHenry, who died in early infancy\nFrancis, born in 1541 and took the surname of Darrell\nEdward, whose date of birth is unknown. He may have been born after his father's death.The identity of Edward Wyatt, who was later executed for his part in the Wyatt's Rebellion of 1554, led by Sir Thomas Wyatt, the younger is unclear. Some sources claim that he was the illegitimate son of Thomas Wyatt the elder and Elizabeth Darrell, while others insist that he was the son of Thomas Wyatt the younger. Kenneth Muir in  'The Life and Letters of Sir Thomas Wyatt' , asserts that Elizabeth Darrell was the mistress of Sir Thomas Wyatt the elder and quotes various state papers to support this view. Only Francis is mentioned in Thomas Wyatt the elder's will, although it is possible that Edward may have been born after his father's death. Sir Thomas Wyatt the elder is known to have had an illegitimate daughter, however, the identity of the mother is unknown.Sir Thomas left Elizabeth properties in Dorset. Sir Thomas the Younger transferred Tarrant, Kent to Francis  Wyatt in 1542 (or, according to other sources, to Elizabeth in 1544). With the attainder of Sir Thomas the Younger in 1554, those properties held by Elizabeth that would have gone to him on her death, went to the Crown instead. She was in possession of Tintinhull in 1547 but it was occupied by the Crown's tenant, Sir William Petre, in 1556, and papers relating to the lease suggest that Elizabeth had died. The parsonage at Stoke, Somerset was leased to Elizabeth in 1548 and around 1554, at about the same time Mary I seems to have paid Elizabeth a legacy left to her by Queen Catherine of Aragon, Elizabeth married Robert Strode.\n\nIn popular culture\nCanadian actress Krystin Pellerin portrayed Darrell in several episodes of the second season of The Tudors. Her fate is however dramatically altered. Instead of returning to royal service after the death of her mistress, as is historically accurate, Darrell hangs herself from the beams of her mistress's former home. The show is correct however in portraying Darrell's and Wyatt's affair. This is the only known portrayal of Elizabeth Darrell in popular culture. She also appears in Hilary Mantel’s Wolf Hall trilogy as an attendant of Catherine of Aragon and later of Princess Mary, and in Elizabeth Cook's Lux as she moves from loyalty to Katherine (as it is spelt in the novel) to Wyatt.\nPassage 8:\nJoseph J. Sullivan (vaudeville)\nJoseph J. Sullivan was a blackface comedian and acrobat in New York.  He composed the song Where Did You Get That Hat? and first performed it in 1888.  It was a great success and he performed it many times thereafter.\nPassage 9:\nBenny Rubinstein\nBenny Rubinstein (בני רובינשטיין) is an Israeli former footballer and current real estate developer. He played soccer for Maccabi Netanya and Hapoel Netanya. At the 1969 Maccabiah Games, Rubinstein played soccer for Israel, winning a gold medal.\n\nBiography\nRubinstein was born in Netanya, Israel. His wife is Sarah Rubinstein. Benny's son, Aviram also played football for Maccabi Netanya.He played soccer for Maccabi Netanya and Hapoel Netanya. At the 1969 Maccabiah Games, Rubinstein played soccer for Israel, winning a gold medal.Rubinstein then worked as a real estate agent, and now works in real estate development.\n\nHonours\nIsraeli Premier League (1):\n1970-71\nPassage 10:\nAndrew Allen (singer)\nAndrew Allen (born 6 May 1981) is a Canadian singer-songwriter from Vernon, British Columbia.

He was the son of the Reverend Edward Moore and Lady Harriet Janet Sarah Montagu-Scott, who was one of the daughters of the 4th Duke of Buccleuch. One of his brothers, Arthur, became an admiral and was knighted. Their great \ngrandfather was John Moore, Archbishop of Canterbury from 1783 to 1805. One of their sisters was a maid of honour to Queen Victoria.Moore went to New Zealand in the 1870s and lived in Geraldine and Christchurch. He married Henrietta Lysaght of Hāwera in November 1879, and they had one son. In May 1884 she died a few days after giving birth to a daughter, who also died.In 1886 Moore became a Justice of the Peace in Geraldine. In 1897 he married Alice Fish of Geraldine. They moved to England four years before his death in 1916.\n\nCricket career\nMoore was a right-handed middle-order batsman. In consecutive seasons, 1876–77 and 1877–78, playing for Canterbury, he made the highest score in the short New Zealand first-class season: 76 and 75 respectively. His 76 came in his first match for Canterbury, against Otago. He went to the wicket early on the first day with the score at 7 for 2 and put on 99 for the third wicket with Charles Corfe before he was out with the score at 106 for 3 after a \"very fine exhibition of free hitting, combined with good defence\". Canterbury were all out for 133, but went on to win the match. His 75 came in the next season's match against Otago, when he took the score from 22 for 2 to 136 for 6. The New Zealand cricket historian Tom Reese said, \"Right from the beginning he smote the bowling hip and thigh, going out of his ground to indulge in some forceful driving.\" Canterbury won again.Moore led the batting averages in the Canterbury Cricket Association in 1877–78 with 379 runs at an average of 34.4. Also in 1877–78, he was a member of the Canterbury team that inflicted the only defeat on the touring Australians. In 1896–97, at the age of 47, he top-scored in each innings for a South Canterbury XVIII against the touring Queensland cricket team.\nPassage 2:\nWale Adebanwi\nWale Adebanwi (born 1969) is a Nigerian-born first Black Rhodes Professor at St Antony's College, Oxford where he was, until June 2021, a Professor of Race Relations, and the Director of the African Studies Centre, School of Interdisciplinary Area Studies, and a Governing Board Fellow.

It was directed by Milton Rosmer. It is based on the true story of the 1827 Red Barn Murder where a 25 year old mother is shot dead by her lover (Squire William Corder) and her stepmother claims to have dreamt of the murder the night of the event, before the young woman's body was discovered. The film is also known as Murder in the Red Barn (short UK title).\nThe film is based on the popular 19th-century melodramas about the case and is highly theatrical, with an opening in which all the characters are introduced by a Master of Ceremonies in front of a painted backdrop, but is also slightly more lavishly produced and cinematically inventive than the later films directed by Tod Slaughter's producer George King. Slaughter gives a full-throated over-the-top performance in a calculatedly melodramatic style, encouraging the audience to vicariously share in his villainy; this approach became his trademark and gives his films a cult status of their own peculiar kind.\n\nPlot\nWilliam Corder seduces then murders innocent country maiden Maria Marten in the red barn before burying her body beneath the barn floor. She gets murdered because she becomes pregnant and too annoying for William. Her gypsy lover Carlos is hunted down as a suspect, but brings Corder to justice.\n\nCast\nTod Slaughter as Squire William Corder\nSophie Stewart as Maria Marten\nD. J.

It is based on the real story of the Red Barn Murder in the 1820s, and is one of five film versions of the events. The film shifted the action to fifty years earlier to the height of the Georgian era. This was the last of the silent film adaptations of the Maria Marten story, and its success paved the way for the much better 1935 sound film remake starring Tod Slaughter. A 35mm print of the 1928 silent film exists in the British Film Institute's archives.\n\nPlot\nWhen his secret lover Maria Marten tells him she is pregnant with his child and asks him to marry her, the villainous Squire Corder murders her and buries her body in the red barn. The dead woman's ghost later visits her mother in a dream, and leads her to find her daughter's body, incriminating the squire.\n\nCast\nTrilby Clark as Maria Marten\nWarwick Ward as Squire William Corder\nDora Barton\nJames Knight as Carlos\nCharles Ashton as Sam Giles\nVesta Sylva as Ann Marten\nFrank Perfitt as John Marten\nMargot Armand as Lady Maud Derringham\nJudd Green as William Giles\nTom Morris as Ishmael\nChili Bouchier\nPassage 6:\nViva Knievel!\nViva Knievel! is a 1977 American action film directed by Gordon Douglas and starring Evel Knievel (as himself), Gene Kelly and Lauren Hutton, with an ensemble supporting cast including Red Buttons, Leslie Nielsen, Cameron Mitchell, Frank Gifford, Dabney Coleman and Marjoe Gortner.\n\nPlot\nDaredevil motorcycle rider Evel Knievel stars as himself in this fictional story. The film opens with  Knievel sneaking into an orphanage late at night to deliver presents: Evel Knievel action figures. One of the boys casts away his crutches, telling Knievel that he'll walk after his accident just as Knievel had.\nKnievel then prepares for another of his stunt jumps. We are introduced to his alcoholic mechanic Will Atkins (Gene Kelly), who was a former stunt rider himself before his wife died, driving him to drink. While signing autographs, Knievel is ambushed by photojournalist Kate Morgan (Lauren Hutton), who has been sent to photograph the jump: if Knievel is killed, it will be a great story.\n\nAs it happens, Evel does crash while attempting the stunt, and though badly injured, survives. He berates Morgan, announces his retirement, and is taken to the hospital.\nWhile rehabilitating, Knievel resists all attempts to get back on the horse, including those from Jessie (Marjoe Gortner), a former protégé with mysterious backers who want Evel to do a jump in Mexico. Eventually, though, Knievel relents and agrees.\nA subplot develops when Will's estranged son Tommy shows up from boarding school, and asks to join the tour. Will, who is reminded of his dead wife, is cold to Tommy, leaving Knievel to show the boy kindness. Likewise, Kate reappears, apologetic for her previous motives, and now wishes that he will never stop jumping.\nMeanwhile, Jessie's benefactor is revealed: drug lord Stanley Millard (Leslie Nielsen). Millard (without Jessie's knowledge) plans to cause a fatal accident during the jump. He will then have Knievel's body transported back to America in an exact duplicate of the tour trailer, but one that has a massive supply of drugs hidden in the walls.\nWill, however, stumbles onto the plot, is drugged, and sent to a psychiatric ward under the control of the corrupt Ralph Thompson (Dabney Coleman) to prevent him from spilling the beans. Evel sneaks into the ward late at night when Will has dried out, but all Will can remember is that someone knocked him out. Knievel leaves him there to keep whoever is behind the plot in the dark.\nAs Knievel prepares for the jump (down a massive ramp and over a fire pit), Jessie—hopped up on drugs—confronts Evel, claiming that he will prove who the best jumper is. Jessie knocks Evel out and dresses in Knievel's signature red, white, and blue outfit. Jessie then successfully makes the jump, however, the bike has been sabotaged and he is killed as he lands (footage from a real Knievel crash was used). While the body is taken away for the drug smuggling plot, Evel wakes up, gets on another bike, and goes to free Will.\nAfter breaking out of the psych ward, the two find the mockup trailer, in which, by an amazing coincidence, both Tommy and Kate have been taken hostage. Pursuing the truck, Will and Evel decide to split up: Will will disable the semi, Evel will lead off the gun-toting drug lords riding guard in another car.\nAt the end of several extended chase scenes, the drug lords are defeated, Will and his son are reunited, and Kate has fallen head over heels for Knievel. The film ends with Knievel performing a daredevil jump over a pit of fire, this time successfully.\nThe end jump is stopped in a freeze-frame shot and a color matte, similar to that of the one that appears in the opening credits, appears over Evel in mid-air. The song that plays over the opening credits also plays over the film's end credits.\n\nCast\nProduction\nThe production was done under the Irwin Allen banner, with Allen serving as the uncredited Supervisor Producer.  Irwin Allen's wife, Sheila Allen, has a credited role as Sister Charity.\nFor the more dangerous motorcycle stunts, the producers hired the professional stuntman Gary Charles Davis.  However, Davis' role in the production was kept under wraps to avoid questions about Knievel himself performing his own motorcycle stunts.\nThe original footage used for Jessie's failed jump was from Evel Knievel's May 1975 crash at Wembley Stadium.\nTo allow for a love interest to occur with Lauren Hutton's character, Evel is apparently single and there is no mention of Knievel's then-wife, Linda, or his (at the time) three children.\n\nPopular culture reception\nThe film premiered in June 1977, three months before Knievel and his associates attacked promoter Shelly Saltman with an aluminum baseball bat on September 21, 1977. With Knievel losing most of his sponsorship and marketing deals as a result of the bad publicity, the film became much less commercially attractive, only opening in four further international markets after Knievel's conviction. In addition, the wholesome image of Knievel the movie promoted and the plot point concerning Knievel's promoter being corrupt seemed ill-judged in the light of the events that saw Knievel imprisoned. As a result, the film fell into comparative obscurity until the 2005 DVD release was rediscovered by film review sites such as The A.V. Club and Ruthless Reviews.In 2013, the film received an internet release with a RiffTrax audio commentary by comedians and Mystery Science Theater 3000 alumni Mike Nelson, Kevin Murphy and Bill Corbett.\nPassage 7:\nLester Raymer\nLester Wilton Raymer (September 24, 1907 – 1991) was an American artist from Alva, Oklahoma.\nRaymer studied at the Art Institute of Chicago from 1930 to 1933, received a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree. While there, he studied with Russian painter Boris Anisfeld and art historian Helen Gardner.Most well known for his paintings, Raymer worked in many mediums including prints, fiber art, metal work, mosaics, ceramics, wood carving, jewelry, cast concrete, sculptures, tin ornaments, furniture, toys, and more.Many of his works are now on display at the Red Barn Studio in Lindsborg, Kansas.\nPassage 8:\nClaude Weisz\nClaude Weisz is a French film director born in Paris.\n\nFilmography\nFeature films\nUne saison dans la vie d'Emmanuel (1972) with Germaine Montéro, Lucien Raimbourg, Florence Giorgetti, Jean-François Delacour, Hélène Darche, Manuel Pinto, etc.Festival de Cannes 1973 - Quinzaine des réalisateurs\nJury Prize: Festival Jeune Cinéma 1973\n\nLa Chanson du mal aimé (1981) with Rufus, Daniel Mesguich, Christine Boisson, Věra Galatíková, Mark Burns, Philippe Clévenot, Dominique Pinon, Madelon Violla, Paloma Matta, Béatrice Bruno, Catherine Belkhodja, Véronique Leblanc, Philippe Avron, Albert Delpy, etc.Festival de Cannes 1982 - Perspectives du cinéma français\nCompetition selections: Valencia, Valladolid, Istanbul, Montréal\n\nOn l'appelait... le Roi Laid (1987) with Yilmaz Güney (mockumentary)Valencia Festival 1988 - Grand Prix for documentaries \"Laurel Wreath\"\nCompetition selections: Rotterdam, Valladolid, Strasbourg, Nyon, Cannes, Lyon, Cairo\n\nPaula et Paulette, ma mère (2005) Documentary - Straight to DVD\n\nShort and mid-length\nLa Grande Grève (1963 - Co-directed CAS collective, IDHEC)\nL'Inconnue (1966 - with Paloma Matta and Gérard Blain - Prix CNC Hyères, Sidney)\nUn village au Québec\nMontréal\nDeux aspects du Canada (1969)\nLa Hongrie, vers quel socialisme ?

It also features Marjorie Taylor, D. J. Williams and Eric Portman. It was made at Shepperton Studios, with sets designed by Philip Bawcombe.\nThis is the third of Tod Slaughter's film outings, billed as a 'new-old melodrama'. In the introduction Slaughter appears in person, in a BBC studio, where he describes with relish his murderous activities in his two previous films: Maria Marten or Murder in the Red Barn (1935) and Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (1936).\nIn the film Slaughter plays a seemingly kindly money-lender who dotes on his daughter Julia. He has however a double life as the notorious 'Spine-Breaker', Victorian England's most maniacal serial killer. His nefarious activities are eventually detected by his daughter's suitor Matthew Trimble, the son of one of his victims, who after pursuing and failing to catch him somewhat charitably opines to his daughter:\n\n'Julia, Julia, my darling, listen to me. I know that he's the notorious 'Spine-Breaker' and he ought to be dead a hundred times but I also know that his death cannot bring my father back to life. But alive or dead it cannot alter my love for you.'In the end Slaughter comes out of hiding to kill another unwelcome suitor of his daughter, before falling to his death from the roof of his house in a dramatic final exit.\n\nCast\nTod Slaughter as Stephen Hawke\nMarjorie Taylor as Julia Hawke\nD.J.

He also worked at MGM as a book-keeper.\n\nCareer\nHal Roach and Our Gang\nAs a teenager, Douglas got a job at the Hal Roach Studios, working in the office and appearing in bit parts in various Hal Roach films. He made walk-on appearances in at least three Our Gang shorts: Teacher's Pet (1930), Big Ears (1931) and Birthday Blues (1932).\nBy 1934, Douglas was assistant to director Gus Meins and served as assistant director on Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy's 1934 film Babes in Toyland and on the Our Gang comedies made between 1934 and mid-1936.\nBeginning with Bored of Education in 1936, Our Gang moved from two-reel (20-minute) comedies to one-reel (10-minute) comedies, and Douglas became the senior director of the series. Bored of Education won the 1936 Academy Award for Live Action Short Film, and was the only Our Gang entry ever honored with the award. Douglas remained with the series as director for two years.\nHis Our Gang shorts, featuring Spanky, Alfalfa, Darla, Porky, Buckwheat, Waldo, Butch and Woim, are the most familiar in the series’ 22-year canon.\nDouglas worked on the Our Gang feature General Spanky (1936). His shorts included Spooky Hooky (1936) and Pay as You Exit (1936).\nRoach sold the Our Gang unit to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in May 1938. Douglas directed two MGM Our Gangs on loan from Roach, The Little Ranger (1938) and Aladdin's Lantern (1938) before deciding that he could not get used to the more industrialized atmosphere at the larger studio.\nReturning to his home studio, Douglas directed the feature Zenobia (1939) with Oliver Hardy teamed with Harry Langdon instead of Stan Laurel; it was a box office disappointment. Laurel and Hardy were reunited for Douglas' next film, Saps at Sea (1940) (Laurel and Hardy's last film produced by the Hal Roach Studio) which was followed by All-American Co-Ed with former Our Gang member Johnny Downs (and Langdon).\nDouglas next helmed Niagara Falls (1941), one of Hal Roach's Streamliners, a series of short features less than 50 minutes, and he co-wrote and directed Roach’s’’ feature Broadway Limited (1941) and provided the story for Topper Returns (1941). His last effort for Roach was the featurette The Devil with Hitler (1942). He might have stayed with Roach indefinitely, but Roach turned his studio over to the U.S. Army for the production of wartime training films.\n\nRKO Films\nDouglas moved over to RKO Pictures. He made a series of low budget comedies including The Great Gildersleeve (1942), based on the radio show; and its sequel Gildersleeve on Broadway (1943), Gildersleeve's Bad Day (1943) and Gildersleeve's Ghost (1944). He also helmed The Falcon in Hollywood (1944), Girl Rush (1944), A Night of Adventure (1944) and First Yank into Tokyo (1945).\nHe made Zombies on Broadway (1945) with the comedy team of Brown and Carney, then San Quentin (1946), Dick Tracy vs. Cueball (1946) and If You Knew Susie (1948).\n\nColumbia Films\nIn 1948, Douglas migrated from RKO to producer Edward Small who had a releasing deal with Columbia Pictures.

They loaned him to British Lion to make State Secret (1950) in England.\n\nCagney Productions and Warner Bros.\nJames Cagney was making a film for Warner Bros., Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye (1950) with his brother William, and they hired Douglas to direct. Douglas signed long-term deals with Cagney Productions and Warners.\nIn May 1950, Douglas signed a non exclusive two-picture deal with Paramount. The first of these was The Great Missouri Raid (1951). He was meant to make a second film for Paramount but they released him so Cagney could use him again on Only the Valiant (1951) a Western with Gregory Peck.Douglas went on to establish himself as one of Warners' leading directors of the 1950s, working in all genres: I Was a Communist for the FBI (1951); Come Fill the Cup (1951), produced by Cagney starring James Cagney; The Iron Mistress (1952) a biopic of Jim Bowie starring Alan Ladd; Mara Maru (1952), an adventure story with Errol Flynn; So This Is Love (1953), a musical biopic of Grace Moore; The Charge at Feather River (1954), a 3D Western; She's Back on Broadway (1953), a musical; Them!

{"input": "Who is the father-in-law of Chiang Fang-Liang?", "context": "Passage 1:\nDemos Chiang\nDemos Yu-bou Chiang (Chinese: 蔣友柏), born on 10 September 1976 in Taipei, Taiwan, is a Taiwanese and Canadian businessman. He founded DEM Inc. (橙果設計), a popular design studio in Taiwan in July 2003 and has served as its chairman since then. He is also known for being the great-grandson of the late Republic of China (ROC) President Chiang Kai-shek and the grandson of late President Chiang Ching-kuo. His grandmother was Faina Ipatyevna Vakhreva, also known as Chiang Fang-liang.\n\nBiography\nBorn to Chiang Ching-kuo's third son Chiang Hsiao-yung and his wife Chiang Fang Chi-yi, he is the eldest of three sons. Demos Chiang was raised in Taipei until his grandfather's death in 1988. After his grandfather's death, Chiang's parents sent him to live in Canada and later the United States, though he still retained his ROC nationality, it also started the departure from politics for Demo's parents. Chiang received a bachelor's degree in Information Management from New York University in late 1990s. After graduating, Chiang worked in the entertainment and fashion industries in Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore, until founding DEM Inc. in 2003.\nIn Spring 2001, Chiang began a relationship with local starlet Lin Heng-yi (林姮怡), the daughter of Buddhist Tzu Chi General Hospital's then president Lin Hsin-jung (林欣榮). The couple married in February 2003 and now have a daughter born in 2003 and a son born in 2005.\nDespite his pedigree and celebrity identity, Demos Chiang has repeatedly announced in recent years that he is not interested in political affairs. He has also accused both the Kuomintang and the Democratic Progressive Party for \"poor political tactics\", especially for utilizing Chiang Kai-shek and Chiang Ching-kuo as figures of worship or denigration. In contrast to other prominent members of the Chiang family, such as John Chiang and his mother Chiang Fang Chi-yi, Demos Chiang has expressed his belief that the controversies of his ancestors should be faced fairly and left to history. He started a personal blog in January 2008 to further explain his beliefs.\nPassage 2:\nChiang Hsiao-wen\nChiang Hsiao-wen (Chinese: 蔣孝文; also known as Alan Chiang; 14 December 1935 – 14 April 1989) was the eldest son of Chiang Ching-kuo, the President of the Republic of China in Taiwan from 1978 to 1988. His mother is Faina Ipatyevna Vakhreva, also known as Chiang Fang-liang. He had one younger sister,  Hsiao-chang, and two younger brothers, Hsiao-wu and Hsiao-yung.  He had two half-brothers, Winston Chang and John Chiang, with whom he shared the same father.\nHe married Xu Nai Jin (Nancy) (Chinese: 蔣徐乃錦) in 1960 and had a daughter, Yomei, in 1961. He suffered brain damage in 1970 while being treated for diabetes. He died of throat cancer on April 14, 1989.\nPassage 3:\nJohn Adams (merchant)\nJohn Adams (1672 or 1673 – c. 1745) was an American-born Canadian merchant and member of the Nova Scotia Council. He was the father-in-law of Henry Newton.\n\nBiography\nAdams was born in Boston in either 1672 or 1673 to John and Avis Adams. Growing up as a petty merchant, Adams joined Sir Charles Hobby's New England regiment, participating in the capture of Port-Royal in 1710. Shortly thereafter, Adams settled in Annapolis Royal, Nova Scotia, returning to civilian life. There, he traded manufactured goods with the province's Acadian and Native Americans, and took up the role of a real estate agent and contractor. Adams joined the Executive Council of Nova Scotia on 28 April 1720, holding his position there for 20 years; the records show that few served as long as he did. He also held several other public positions in the province. Adams was appointed a notary public and deputy collector of customs for Annapolis Royal in 1725, and he was commissioned a justice of the peace in March 1727.Around the mid-1720s, Adams' poor eyesight began to fail, leading to his near-blindness in 1730. After this, he was less active in community activities and trade. Adams petitioned to the king for a pension several times, but failed. He blamed his disability on over-exposure to the sun during an Indian attack on Annapolis Royal in 1724. In December 1739, Lieutenant Governor Lawrence Armstrong died. With the absence of Major Mascarene to take Armstrong's place, Adams became the new president of the council and head of the civil government. (Alexander Cosby was also vying for the position.) In a meeting on 22 March 1740, with the return of Mascarene, the councilors declared that he was the council's rightful president. This turn of events led Adams to retire to Boston in late August or early September 1740, where he stayed for the rest of his life. He died some time after 1745.\n\nNotes\nPassage 4:\nBarthold A. Butenschøn Sr.\nHans Barthold Andresen Butenschøn (27 December 1877 – 28 November 1971) was a Norwegian businessperson.\nHe was born in Kristiania as a son of Nils August Andresen Butenschøn and Hanna Butenschøn, and grandson of Nicolay Andresen. Together with Mabel Anette Plahte (1877–1973, a daughter of Frithjof M. Plahte) he had the son Hans Barthold Andresen Butenschøn Jr. and was through him the father-in-law of Ragnhild Butenschøn and grandfather of Peter Butenschøn. Through his daughter Marie Claudine he was the father-in-law of Joakim Lehmkuhl, through his daughter Mabel Anette he was the father-in-law of Harald Astrup (a son of Sigurd Astrup) and through his daughter Nini Augusta he was the father-in-law of Ernst Torp.He took commerce school and agricultural school. He was hired in the family company N. A. Andresen & Co, and became a co-owner in 1910. He eventually became chief executive officer. The bank changed its name to Andresens Bank in 1913 and merged with Bergens Kreditbank in 1920. The merger was dissolved later in the 1920s. He was also a landowner, owning Nedre Skøyen farm and a lot of land in Enebakk. He chaired the board of Nydalens Compagnie from 1926, having not been a board member before that.He also chaired the supervisory council of Forsikringsselskapet Viking and Nedre Glommen salgsforening, and was a supervisory council member of Filharmonisk Selskap. He was a member of the gentlemen's club SK Fram since 1890, and was proclaimed a lifetime member in 1964.He was buried in Enebakk.\nPassage 5:\nChiang Ching-kuo\nChiang Ching-kuo (27 April 1910 – 13 January 1988) was a politician of the Republic of China. The eldest and only biological son of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, he held numerous posts in the government of the Republic of China and ended martial law in 1987. He served as premier of the Republic of China between 1972 and 1978, and was president of the Republic of China from 1978 until his death in 1988.\nBorn in Zhejiang, Ching-kuo was sent as a teenager to study in the Soviet Union during the First United Front in 1925, when his father's Nationalist Party and the Chinese Communist Party were in alliance. He attended university there and spoke Russian fluently, but when the Chinese Nationalists violently broke with the Communists, Stalin sent him to work in a steel factory in the Ural Mountains. There, Chiang met and married Faina Vakhreva. With war between China and Japan imminent in 1937, Stalin sent the couple to China. During the war, Ching-kuo's father gradually came to trust him, and gave him more and more responsibilities, including administration.\nAfter the Japanese surrender, Ching-kuo was given the job of ridding Shanghai of corruption, which he attacked with ruthless efficiency. The victory of the Communists in 1949 drove the Chiang family and their ROC government to retreat to Taiwan. Ching-kuo was first given control of the secret police, a position he retained until 1965 and in which he used arbitrary arrests and torture to ensure tight control as part of the White Terror. He then became Minister of Defense (1965–1969), Vice-Premier (1969–1972) and Premier (1972–1978). After his father's death in 1975, he took leadership of the Kuomintang (KMT) as chairman, and was elected president in 1978 and again in 1984.\nUnder his tenure as president, the government of the Republic of China in Taiwan, while remaining authoritarian, became more open and tolerant of political dissent. Chiang courted Taiwanese voters, and reduced the preference for those who had come from the mainland after the war. Toward the end of his life, Chiang decided to relax government controls on the media and speech, and allowed Han born in Taiwan into positions of power, including his eventual successor Lee Teng-hui. He is the last president of the Republic of China to be born during the rule of the Qing dynasty. Ching-kuo was credited for his Soviet-inspired city planning policies, economic development with Ten Major Construction Projects in Taiwan, efforts to clamp down on corruption, as well as the democratic transition of Taiwan and gradually shifting away from the authoritarian dictatorial rule of his own father Chiang Kai-shek.\n\nBiography\nEarly life\nThe son of Chiang Kai-shek and his first wife, Mao Fumei, Chiang Ching-kuo was born in Fenghua, Zhejiang, with the courtesy name of Jiànfēng (建豐). He had an adopted brother, Chiang Wei-kuo. \"Ching\" literally means \"longitude\", while \"kuo\" means \"nation\"; in his brother's name, \"wei\" literally means \"parallel (of latitude)\". The names are inspired by the references in Chinese classics such as the Guoyu, in which \"to draw the longitudes and latitudes of the world\" is used as a metaphor for a person with great abilities, especially in managing a country.\nWhile the young Chiang Ching-kuo had a good relationship with his mother and grandmother (who were deeply rooted to their Buddhist faith), his relationship with his father was strict, utilitarian and often rocky. Chiang Kai-shek appeared to his son as an authoritarian figure, sometimes indifferent to his problems. Even in personal letters between the two, Chiang Kai-shek would sternly order his son to improve his Chinese calligraphy. From 1916 until 1919 Chiang Ching-kuo attended the \"Grammar School\" in Wushan in Hsikou. Then, in 1920, his father hired tutors to teach him the Four Books, the central texts of Confucianism. On 4 June 1921, Ching-kuo's grandmother died. What might have been an immense emotional loss was compensated for when Chiang Kai-shek moved the family to Shanghai. Chiang Ching-kuo's stepmother, historically known as the Chiang family's \"Shanghai Mother\", went with them. During this period Chiang Kai-shek concluded that Chiang Ching-kuo was a son to be taught, while Chiang Wei-kuo was a son to be loved.\nDuring his time in Shanghai, Chiang Ching-kuo was supervised by his father and made to write a weekly letter of 200–300 Chinese characters. Chiang Kai-shek also underlined the importance of classical books and of learning English, two areas he was hardly proficient in himself. On 20 March 1924, Chiang Ching-kuo was able to present to his now-nationally famous father a proposal concerning the grass-roots organization of the rural population in Hsikou. Chiang Ching-kuo planned to provide free education to allow people to read and to write at least 1000 characters. In his own words:\n\nI have a suggestion to make about the Wushan School, although I do not know if you can agree to it. My suggestion is that the school establish a night school for common people who cannot afford to go to the regular school. My school established a night school with great success. I can tell you something about the night school:\nName: Wuschua School for the Common People\nTuition fee: Free of charge with stationery supplied\nClass hours: 7 pm to 9 pm\nAge limit: 14 or older\nSchooling protocol: 16 or 20 weeks.\nAt the time of the graduation, the trainees will be able to write simple letters and keep simple accounts. They will be issued a diploma if they pass the examinations. The textbooks they used were published by the Commercial Press and were entitled \"One thousand characters for the common people.\" I do not know whether you will accept my suggestion. If a night school is established at Wushan, it will greatly benefit the local people.\n\nIn early 1925, Chiang entered Shanghai's Pudong College, but Chiang Kai-shek decided to send him on to Beijing because of warlord action and spontaneous student protests in Shanghai. In Beijing, he attended the school organized by a friend of his father, Wu Zhihui, a renowned scholar and linguist. The school combined classical and modern approaches to education. While there, Ching-kuo started to identify himself as a progressive revolutionary and participated in the flourishing social scene inside the young Communist community. The idea of studying in Moscow now seized his imagination. Within the help program provided by the Soviet Union to the countries of East Asia there was a training school that later became the Moscow Sun Yat-sen University. The participants to the university were selected by the CPSU and KMT members, with a participation of CPC Central Committee.Chiang Ching-kuo asked Wu Zhihui to name him as a KMT candidate. Wu did not try to dissuade him, even though Wu was a key figure of the right-leaning and anti-Communist \"Western Hills Group\" of the KMT. In the summer of 1925, Chiang Ching-kuo traveled south to Whampoa Military Academy to discuss his plans for study in Moscow with his father. Chiang Kai-shek was not keen, but after a discussion with Chen Guofu he finally agreed. In a 1996 interview, Ch'en's brother, Chen Li-fu, recalled that Chiang Kai-shek accepted the plan because of the need to have Soviet support at a time when his hold over the KMT was tenuous.\n\nMoscow\nWith or without his father's enthusiastic approval, Chiang Ching-kuo went on to Moscow in late 1925. He stayed in the Soviet Union for nearly twelve years. While there, Chiang was given the Russian name Nikolai Vladimirovich Elizarov (Николай Владимирович Елизаров) and put under the tutelage of Karl Radek at the Communist University of the Toilers of the East. Noted for having an exceptional grasp of international politics, his classmates included other children of influential Chinese families, most notably the future Chinese Communist party leader, Deng Xiaoping. Chiang Ching-kuo joined the Communist Youth League under Deng. Soon Ching-kuo was an enthusiastic student of Communist ideology, particularly Trotskyism; though following the Great Purge, Joseph Stalin privately met with him and ordered him to publicly denounce Trotskyism. Chiang even applied to be a member of the All-Union Communist Party, although his request was denied.\nIn April 1927, however, Chiang Kai-shek purged KMT leftists, had Communists arrested or killed, and expelled his Soviet advisers. Chiang Ching-kuo responded from Moscow with an editorial that harshly criticized his father's actions but was nonetheless detained as a \"guest\" of the Soviet Union, a practical hostage. Debate still continues as to whether he was forced to write the editorial, but he had seen Trotskyist friends arrested and killed by the Soviet secret police. The Soviet government sent him to work in the Ural Heavy Machinery Plant, a steel factory in the Urals, Yekaterinburg (then Sverdlovsk), where he met Faina Ipat'evna Vakhreva, a native Belarusian. They married on 15 March 1935, and she would later take the Chinese name, Chiang Fang-liang. In December of that year, their son, Hsiao-wen was born.\nChiang Kai-shek refused to negotiate a prisoner swap for his son in exchange for a Chinese Communist Party leader. He wrote in his diary, \"It is not worth it to sacrifice the interest of the country for the sake of my son.\" In 1937, he maintained that \"I would rather have no offspring than sacrifice our nation's interests\", since he had no intention of stopping the war against the Communists.\n\nReturn to China and WWII\nStalin allowed Chiang Ching-kuo to return to China with his Belarusian wife and son in April 1937 after living in the USSR for 12 years.By then, the NRA under Chiang Kai-shek and the Communists under Mao Zedong had signed a ceasefire to create the Second United Front and fight the Japanese invasion of China, which began in July 1937. Stalin hoped the Chinese would keep Japan from invading the Soviet Pacific coast, and he hoped to form an anti-Japanese alliance with the senior Chiang.On Ching-kuo's return, his father assigned a tutor, Hsu Dau-lin, to assist with his readjustment to China. Chiang Ching-Kuo was appointed as a specialist in remote districts of Jiangxi where he was credited with training of cadres and fighting corruption, opium consumption, and illiteracy. Chiang Ching-kuo was appointed as commissioner of Gannan Prefecture (贛南) between 1939 and 1945; there he banned smoking, gambling and prostitution, studied governmental management, allowed for economic expansion and a change in social outlook. His efforts were hailed as a miracle in the political war in China, then coined as the \"Gannan New Deal\" (贛南新政). During his time in Gannan, from 1940 he implemented a \"public information desk\" where ordinary people could visit him if they had problems, and according to records, Chiang Ching-kuo received a total of 1,023 people during such sessions in 1942.In regard to the ban on prostitution and closing of brothels, Chiang implemented a policy where former prostitutes became employed in factories. Due to the large number of refugees in Ganzhou as a result from the ongoing war, thousands of orphans lived on the street; in June 1942, Chiang Ching-kuo formally established the Chinese Children's Village (中華兒童新村) in the outskirts of Ganzhou, with facilities such as a nursery, kindergarten, primary school, hospital and gymnasium. During the last years of the 1930s, he met Wang Sheng, with whom he would remain close for the next 50 years.The paramilitary \"Sanmin Zhuyi Youth Corps\" was under Chiang's control. Chiang used the term \"big bourgeoisie\", in a disparaging manner to call H.H. Kung and T. V. Soong.While in mainland China, Chiang and his wife had a daughter, Hsiao-chang, born in Nanchang (1938), and two more sons, Hsiao-wu, born in Chungking (1945), and Hsiao-yung, born in Shanghai (1948).\n\nRelationship with Chang Ya-juo and her death\nChiang met Chang Ya-juo when she was working at a training camp for enlistees and he was serving as the head of Gannan Prefecture during the war. The two had a relationship that brought twin sons: Chang Hsiao-tz'u and Chang Hsiao-yen, born in 1942. In August 1942, Chang felt sick at a dinner party, and died the next day in a Guilin hospital. The circumstances of her death raised speculation that it was murder. Over the years, many of her relatives, including her sons and highly ranked ex-security personnel, insisted that KMT's security apparatus orchestrated her murder to keep a lid on CCK's marital affair, and to protect CCK's political career.\n\nHostage claim\nJung Chang and Jon Halliday claim Chiang Kai-shek allowed the Communists to escape on the 1934–1935 Long March because he wanted Stalin to return Chiang Ching-kuo. This is contradicted by Chiang Kai-shek's diary, \"It is not worth it to sacrifice the interest of the country for the sake of my son.\" He refused to negotiate for a prisoner swap of his son in exchange for the Chinese Communist Party leader. Again in 1937 he stated about his son: \"I would rather have no offspring than sacrifice our nation's interests.\" Chiang had absolutely no intention of stopping the war against the Communists. \nChang and Halliday likewise claim that Chiang Ching-kuo was \"kidnapped\" in spite of the evidence that he went to study in the Soviet Union with his father's own approval.\n\nEconomic policies in Shanghai\nAfter the Second Sino-Japanese War and during the Chinese Civil War, Chiang Ching-kuo briefly served as a liaison administrator in Shanghai, trying to eradicate the corruption and hyperinflation that plagued the city. He was determined to do this because of the fears arising from the Nationalists' increasing lack of popularity during the Civil War. Given the task of arresting dishonest businessmen who hoarded supplies for profit during the inflationary spiral, he attempted to assuage the business community by explaining that his team would only go after big war profiteers.\nChiang Ching-kuo copied Soviet methods, which he learned during his stay in the Soviet Union, to start a social revolution by attacking middle class merchants. He also enforced low prices on all goods to raise support from the Proletariat.As riots broke out and savings were ruined, bankrupting shopowners, Chiang Ching-kuo began to attack the wealthy, seizing assets and placing them under arrest. The son of the gangster Du Yuesheng was arrested by him. Ching-kuo ordered KMT agents to raid the Yangtze Development Corporation's warehouses, which was privately owned by H.H. Kung and his family, as the company was accused of hoarding supplies. H.H. Kung's wife was Soong Ai-ling, the sister of Soong Mei-ling who was Chiang Ching-kuo's stepmother. H.H. Kung's son David was arrested, and the Kungs responded by blackmailing the Chiangs, threatening to release information about them. He was eventually freed after negotiations, and Chiang Ching-kuo resigned, ending the terror on the Shanghainese merchants.\n\nPolitical career in Taiwan\nAfter the Nationalists lost control of mainland China to the Communists in the Chinese Civil War, Chiang Ching-kuo followed his father and the retreating Nationalist forces to Taiwan. On 8 December 1949, the Nationalist capital was moved from Chengdu to Taipei, and early on 10 December 1949, Communist troops laid siege to Chengdu, the last KMT-controlled city on mainland China. Chiang Kai-shek and Chiang Ching-kuo directed the city's defense from the Chengdu Central Military Academy, before the aircraft May-ling evacuated them to Taiwan; they would never return to mainland China.\nIn 1950, Chiang's father appointed him director of the secret police, which he remained until 1965. An enemy of the Chiang family, Wu Kuo-chen, was kicked out of his position of governor of Taiwan by Chiang Ching-kuo and fled to America in 1953. Chiang Ching-kuo, educated in the Soviet Union, initiated Soviet-style military organization in the Republic of China Military, reorganizing and Sovietizing the political officer corps, surveillance, and KMT party activities were propagated throughout the military. Opposed to this was Sun Li-jen, who was educated at the American Virginia Military Institute.\nChiang orchestrated the controversial court-martial and arrest of General Sun Li-jen in August 1955, allegedly for plotting a coup d'état with the American CIA against his father. General Sun was a popular Chinese war hero from the Burma Campaign against the Japanese and remained under house arrest until Chiang Ching-kuo's death in 1988. Ching-kuo also approved the arbitrary arrest and torture of prisoners. Chiang Ching-kuo's activities as director of the secret police remained widely criticized as heralding a long era of human rights abuses in Taiwan.\nFrom 1955 to 1960, Chiang administered the construction and completion of Taiwan's highway system. Chiang's father elevated him to high office when he was appointed as the ROC Defense Minister from 1965 until 1969. He was the nation's Vice Premier between 1969 and 1972, during which he survived a 1970 assassination attempt while visiting the U.S. Afterwards he was appointed the nation's Premier between 1972 and 1978. As Chiang Kai-shek entered his final years, he gradually gave more responsibilities to his son, and when he died in April 1975, Vice President Yen Chia-kan became president for the balance of Chiang Kai-shek's term, while Chiang Ching-kuo succeeded to the leadership of the KMT (he opted for the title \"Chairman\" rather than the elder Chiang's title of \"Director-General\").\n\nPresidency\nChiang Ching-kuo was elected president of the ROC in the 1978 Taiwanese presidential election by the National Assembly on 20 May 1978. He was reelected to another term in the 1984 Taiwanese presidential election. At that time, the National Assembly consisted mostly of \"ten thousand year\" legislators, men who had been elected in 1947–48 before the fall of mainland China and who would hold their seats indefinitely. Starting from the 1970s when his father grew sick, Chiang became the de facto leader of the regime and reformed many of his father's autocratic policies and gradually phased out of the white terror by allowing the freedom of peaceful assemblies and political pluralism of the Tangwai movement, which later became the DPP. Chiang also turned down many of the suggestions of the conservatives in the KMT regime to violently suppress the protesters.In a move he launched the \"Ten Major Construction Projects\" and the \"Twelve New Development Projects\" which contributed to the \"Taiwan Miracle\". Among his accomplishments was accelerating the process of economic modernization to give Taiwan a 13% growth rate, $4,600 per capita income, and the world's second largest foreign exchange reserves. On 16 December 1978, U.S. president Jimmy Carter announced that the United States would no longer recognize the ROC as the legitimate government of China. Under the Taiwan Relations Act, the United States would continue to sell weapons to Taiwan, but the TRA was purposely vague in any promise of defending Taiwan in the event of an invasion.\nChiang Ching-kuo also enacted major labor rights reforms throughout the 1970s and the 1980s that addressed child labor, women's employment, working time, pensions, paid leave, employment contract with several legislations such as the \"Labor Safety and Hygiene Law\" in 1974 and the \"Factory Law\" in 1975. The average salary of Taiwanese workers tripled under his rule. Chiang Ching-kuo also loosened the harsh anti-strike laws and union busting practice, thus giving the labor movement more opportunity to bargain for fairer wages as he lifted the martial law provisions.In an effort to bring more Taiwan-born citizens into government services, Chiang Ching-kuo \"exiled\" his over-ambitious chief of General Political Warfare Department, General Wang Sheng, to Paraguay as an ambassador (November 1983), and hand-picked Lee Teng-hui as vice-president of the ROC (formally elected May 1984), first-in-the-line of succession to the presidency. Chiang emphatically declared that his successor would not be from the Chiang family in a Constitution Day speech on 25 December 1985:\nThe first question is the succession to the presidency. This sort of question only exists in despotic and totalitarian countries. It does not exist in the Republic of China, based on the Constitution. So the next president will be elected in accordance with constitutional procedure by the National Assembly on behalf of the people. Some people may raise the question whether any member of my family would run for the next presidency. My answer is: it can't be and it won't be.\nChiang Wei-kuo, Chiang's younger brother, would later repudiate the declaration in 1990 after he was selected as a vice-presidential candidate.On 15 July 1987, Chiang finally ended martial law and allowed his family to visit the mainland. The ban on tourism to Hong Kong and Macau was also lifted. His administration saw a gradual loosening of political controls and opponents of the Nationalists were no longer forbidden to hold meetings or publish political criticism papers.\nOpposition political parties, though still formally illegal, were allowed to operate without harassment or arrest. When the Democratic Progressive Party was established on 28 September 1986, President Chiang decided against dissolving the group or persecuting its leaders, but its candidates officially ran in elections as independents in the Tangwai movement.\nChiang Ching-kuo also increased the political representation of Native Taiwanese under his rule, allowing them to have various positions, which paved the way for Lee Teng-hui to come to power and further democratize Taiwan.\n\nDeath and legacy\nChiang Ching-kuo died at Taipei Veterans General Hospital on 13 January 1988, aged 77, from a heart attack. He used a wheelchair during the last months of his life, and also had diabetes, alongside vision and heart problems.\nHe was interred temporarily in Daxi Township, Taoyuan County (now Daxi District, Taoyuan City), but in a separate mausoleum in Touliao, a mile down the road from his father's burial place. The hope was to have both buried at their birthplace in Fenghua once mainland China was recovered. Composer Hwang Yau-tai wrote the Chiang Ching-kuo Memorial Song in 1988.\nIn January 2004, Chiang Fang-liang asked that both father and son be buried at Wuchih Mountain Military Cemetery in Hsichih, Taipei County (now New Taipei City). The state funeral ceremony was initially planned for Spring 2005, but was eventually delayed to winter 2005. It may be further delayed due to the recent death of Chiang Ching-kuo's oldest daughter-in-law, who had served as the de facto head of the household since Chiang Fang-liang's death in 2004. Chiang Fang-liang and Soong Mei-ling had agreed in 1997 that the former leaders be first buried, but still be moved to mainland China.Murray A. Rubinstein called Chiang Ching-kuo more of a civilian leader than his father, whom Rubenstein refers to as a \"quasi-warlord.\"Jay Taylor has described Chiang Ching-kuo as a figure who mixed the ideologies of Soviet communism, Chinese nationalism, Taiwanese localism and American democracy, who became the helmsman of the democratization of Taiwan.Unlike his highly controversial father, Chiang Ching-kuo's reputation is overwhelmingly positive among the Taiwanese population as the people of Taiwan recognizes his economic and social achievements, as well as his efforts of democratization. 38.7% of the population considers him the best president who contributed the most to Taiwan, and he was rated 84.8/100 by the Taiwanese population.\n\nMemorials\nRoad names\nJingguo road (in Hsinchu)\nJingguo road (in Taoyuan)\n\nThe Republic of China Air Force\nThe AIDC, the ROC's air defense company, has nicknamed its AIDC F-CK Indigenous Defense Fighter the Ching Kuo in his memory.\n\nCoin\n27 April 2010. 蔣經國先生百年誕辰紀念流通硬幣」 [Coin commemorating the 100th anniversary of Chiang Ching-kuo's birth]\n\nSong\nChiang Ching-kuo Memorial Song\n\nFamily\nWife: Faina Chiang Fang-liang, Chiang and she had 3 sons and 1 daughter.\nFirst son: Alan Chiang Hsiao-wen (14 December 1935 – 14 April 1989)\nChiang Yu-mei (1961–), British Chinese.\nFirst daughter: Chiang Hsiao-chang (1938–), married to Yu Yang-ho (俞揚和) until his death in 2010.\nTheodore Yu Tsu-sheng (俞祖聲)\nSecond son: Alex Chiang Hsiao-wu (25 April 1945 – 1 July 1991)\nAlexandra Chiang Yo-lan (蔣友蘭)\nJohnathan Chiang Yo-sung (蔣友松), married in 2002.\na daughter (May 2003–)\nThird son: Eddie Chiang Hsiao-yung (1 October 1948 – 22 December 1996)\nDemos Chiang Yo-bo (10 September 1976–), DEM Inc (橙果設計) founder.

He was the youngest son of Philipp von Westphalen (1724–92), who himself was the son of a Blankenburg postmaster. Philipp von Westphalen had been ennobled in 1764 with the predicate Edler von Westphalen by Duke Ferdinand of Brunswick for his military services. He had served as the duke's de facto \"chief of staff\" during the Seven Years' War. Through his mother, Jane Wishart of Pittarrow, he was the descendant of many Scottish and European noble families.He received extensive education and spoke German and English, and read Latin, Greek, Italian, French and Spanish. He studied at the Collegium Carolinum, the forerunner of today's Braunschweig University of Technology, and at Göttingen.\n\nCareer\nIn 1794, he entered government's service in Brunswick. In 1797 he married Elisabeth von Veltheim, who bore him four children. In 1804 he entered the government service of the Duchy of Brunswick and Lunenburg (Wolfenbüttel).\nWith the establishment of the Napoleonic state in Westphalia (the Kingdom of Westphalia) in 1807, he entered its service. He was likely motivated in this by a desire to see reforms carried out. He did, however, oppose the French dominance of the local government, and other policies, and for his critique he was eventually arrested by orders from Louis-Nicolas Davout and imprisoned in the fortress of Gifhorn. In the same year, he lost his first wife. In the summer of 1809 Louis was appointed sub-prefect of Salzwedel, where three years later in 1812 he married Karoline Heubel; they had three children. After Salzwedel was again under Prussian administration, in 1816 Ludwig von Westphalen was transferred to the newly established regional government in Trier.\n\nPersonal life\nIt was in Trier that he met and befriended Heinrich Marx, the father of Karl Marx. The children of the respective families, in particular Jenny and Edgar von Westphalen, and Sophie and Karl Marx, became close friends as well. In 1836, Jenny von Westphalen and Karl Marx became engaged; at first secretly but Ludwig approved the marriage in 1837, even though some saw Marx, who was both middle class and younger than her, as well as of Jewish descent, as an inappropriate partner for the noble daughter. In fact, Ludwig was seen as the mentor and role model of Karl Marx, who referred to him as a \"dear fatherly friend\". Ludwig filled Marx with enthusiasm for the romantic school and read him Homer and Shakespeare, who remained Marx's favorite authors all his life. Marx also read Voltaire and Racine with Ludwig. Ludwig devoted much of his time to the young Marx and the two went for intellectual walks through \"the hills and woods\" of the neighbourhood. It was Ludwig who first introduced Marx to the personality and socialist teachings of Saint-Simon. Marx dedicated his doctoral thesis \"The Difference Between the Democritean and Epicurean Philosophy of Nature\" written in 1841 to Ludwig in a most effusive manner in which Marx wrote \"You, my fatherly friend, have always been for me the living proof that idealism is no illusion, but the true reality\" In 1842, Marx was present at the deathbed of Ludwig von Westphalen. Jenny and Karl became married in 1843, a year after Ludwig's death.\nHe was the father of Ferdinand von Westphalen, a conservative and reactionary Prussian Minister of the Interior.\n\nDeath\nHe died on 3 March 1842 in Trier.\nPassage 7:\nPeter Burroughs\nPeter Burroughs (born 27 January 1947) is a British television and film actor and the director of Willow Management. He is the father-in-law of actor and TV presenter Warwick Davis.\n\nEarly career\nBurroughs initially ran a shop in his village at Yaxley, Cambridgeshire.\nHis first dramatic role was that of the character \"Branic\" in the 1979 television series The Legend of King Arthur. He also acted in the television shows Dick Turpin, The Goodies, Doctor Who in the serial The King's Demons and One Foot in the Grave.\n\nFilm career\nBurroughs played roles in Hollywood movies such as Flash Gordon, George Lucas' Star Wars: Episode VI – Return of the Jedi (a swinging ewok), Willow, The Dark Crystal, Labyrinth and The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. In 1995, Burroughs set up Willow Management, an agency for short actors, along with co-actor Warwick Davis. He portrayed a bank goblin in the Harry Potter series (Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2).\n\nPersonal life\nHis daughter Samantha (born 1971), is married to Star Wars: Episode VI – Return of the Jedi and Willow film star Warwick Davis. He has another daughter, Hayley Burroughs, who is also an actress. His granddaughter is Annabelle Davis.\n\nFilmography\nPassage 8:\nChiang Hsiao-chang\nChiang Hsiao-chang (Chinese: 蔣孝章; pinyin: Jiǎng Xiàozhāng; born 1938) is the only daughter of Chiang Ching-kuo, the President of the Republic of China in Taiwan from 1978 to 1988.  Her mother was Chiang Fang-liang.  She had one older brother, Hsiao-wen, and two younger brothers, Hsiao-wu and Hsiao-yung. She is the only living member of Chiang Ching-kuo's legitimate children, and was the only one among the siblings who could converse in Russian with their mother.\nShe also has twin half-brothers,  Winston Chang and John Chiang, with whom she shares the same father. She attended Mills College and was featured in LIFE during her college years. She was married to Yu Yang-ho (俞揚和; Yú Yánghé) until his death in 2010; he was the son of former Taiwan defense minister Yu Ta-wei (俞大維; Yú Dàwéi). She and Yu have one son, Theodore Yu Tsu-sheng (俞祖聲; Yú Zǔshēng).\nPassage 9:\nOgawa Mataji\nViscount Ogawa Mataji (小川又次, 22 August 1848 – 20 October 1909) was a general in the early Imperial Japanese Army. He was also the father-in-law of Field Marshal Gen Sugiyama.\n\nLife and military career\nOgawa was born to a samurai family; his father was a retainer to the daimyō of Kokura Domain, in what is now Kitakyushu, Fukuoka. He studied rangaku under Egawa Hidetatsu and fought as a Kokura samurai against the forces of Chōshū Domain during the Bakumatsu period.\nAfter the Meiji Restoration, Ogawa attended the Imperial Japanese Army Academy and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in January 1871 and promoted to lieutenant in February 1874. He participated in the Taiwan Expedition of April 1874. Afterwards, he served with the IJA 1st Infantry Regiment under the Tokyo Garrison, and as a battalion commander with the IJA 13th Infantry Regiment from April 1876. From February 1877, he fought in the Satsuma Rebellion, but was wounded in combat in April and promoted to major the same month.\nIn March 1878, Ogawa was Deputy Chief-of-Staff to the Kumamoto Garrison. He was sent as a military attaché to Beijing from April to July 1880. In February 1881, he was promoted to lieutenant-colonel and chief of staff of the Osaka Garrison. In March 1882, he was chief of staff of the Hiroshima Garrison. Promoted to colonel in October 1884, he was assigned the IJA 8th Infantry Regiment. In May 1885, he joined the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff Office. German General Jakob Meckel, hired by the Japanese government as a foreign advisor and instructor in the Imperial Japanese Army Academy highly praised Ogawa and fellow colonel Kodama Gentarō as the two most outstanding officers in the Imperial Japanese Army. Ogawa was especially noted for his abilities as a military strategist and planner, and earned the sobriquet “the modern Kenshin\") from General Kawakami Soroku.\n\nFirst Sino-Japanese War\nOgawa was promoted to major general in June 1890, and given command of the IJA 4th Infantry Brigade, followed by command of the 1st Guards Brigade. At the start of the First Sino-Japanese War in August 1894, he was chief of staff of the Japanese First Army. In August 1895, he was elevated to the kazoku peerage with the title of danshaku (baron). He commanded the 2nd Guards Brigade from January 1896 and was subsequently promoted to lieutenant general in April 1897, assuming command of the IJA 4th Infantry Division. In May 1903, he was awarded the Order of the Sacred Treasures, first class.\n\nRusso-Japanese War\nDuring the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-1905, Ogawa retained command of the IJA 4th Division under the Japanese Second Army of General Oku Yasukata.  The division was in combat at the Battle of Nanshan, Battle of Telissu and Battle of Liaoyang. At the Battle of Liaoyang, Ogawa was injured in combat, and forced to relinquish his command and return to Tokyo. In January 1905, he was promoted to general, but took a medical leave from December 1905. He was awarded the Order of the Golden Kite, 2nd class in 1906.  In September 1907 he was elevated to viscount (shishaku) He officially retired in November.\nOgawa died on 20 October 1909 due to peritonitis after being hospitalized for dysentery.

Faina was orphaned at a young age and raised by her older sister Anna.\n\nCareer\nAt age 16, as a member of the Soviet Union's Communist Youth League, Faina worked at the Ural Heavy Machinery Plant, where she met Chiang Ching-kuo, her supervisor.\n\nBiography\nIn December 1936, Joseph Stalin granted Chiang's return to China. By some other account, however, the couple fled fearing arrest of Chiang Ching-kuo. After the couple was received by Chiang Kai-shek and his wife Soong Mei-ling in Hangzhou, they traveled to the Chiang home in Xikou, Zhejiang, where they held a second marriage ceremony. Fang-liang stayed behind to live with Chiang Ching-kuo's mother, Mao Fumei. She was assigned a tutor to learn Mandarin Chinese, but she learned the local Ningbo dialect of Wu Chinese instead. She reportedly got along well with Mao Fumei and did her own housework.\n\nAs a First lady\nWhen Chiang Ching-kuo became President, Fang-liang rarely performed the traditional roles of First Lady. That is partly due to her lack of formal education; her husband also encouraged her not to get into politics. She largely stayed out of the public spotlight and little was ever known of her in an anti-communist atmosphere in the government.  She never returned to Russia, and traveled abroad only three times in the last 50 years of her life, all to visit her children and their families. In 1992, she received a visit from a delegation including future president Alexander Lukashenko, a mayor of Minsk (the capital of Belarus) at the time.\n\nPersonal life\nFaina met Chiang Ching-kuo, son of Chiang Kai-shek, while working at the Ural Heavy Machine Plant in Sverdlovsk, Russian SFSR. On 15 March 1935, aged 18, Faina married him.\n\nChildren\nOn 14 December 1935, their first son Chiang Hsiao-wen was born in the Soviet Union. Each of her three younger children were born in different parts of China, reflecting turbulent years as an official of China. Faina had four children:\n\nChiang Hsiao-wen (b. 1935, Sverdlovsk)\nChiang Hsiao-chang (b. 1938 in Nanchang)\nChiang Hsiao-wu (b. 1945 in Chekiang)\nChiang Hsiao-yung (b. 1948 in Shanghai)All her children were sent to study in foreign universities – Hsiao-wen to West Point and Park College, MO, Hsiao-wu to Munich, West Germany and the remaining children to the United States. All three sons died shortly after Ching-kuo's death in 1988: Hsiao-wen in April 1989, Hsiao-wu in July 1991, and Hsiao-yung in December 1996. Fang-liang then lived in the suburbs of Taipei. She received occasional visitors, such as some prominent politicians who went to pay their respects every few years. In the Taiwanese media, if she ever received coverage, she was depicted as a virtuous wife who never complained and endured her loneliness with dignity.\n\nDeath\nChiang died of respiratory and cardiac failure stemming from lung cancer in Taipei Veterans General Hospital at the age of 88 (or 89 according to East Asian age reckoning).\n\nLegacy\nChiang's funeral was held on 27 December 2004, with President Chen Shui-bian and Vice President Annette Lu in attendance. Kuomintang politicians Wang Jin-pyng, Lin Cheng-chih, P. K. Chiang, and Ma Ying-jeou draped her casket with the Kuomintang party flag, and Kuomintang party elders Lee Huan, Hau Pei-tsun, Chiu Chuang-huan, and Shih Chi-yang draped her casket with the ROC national flag.\nChiang was cremated and her ashes taken to her husband's temporary mausoleum in Touliao, Taoyuan County (now Taoyuan City). They were buried together in the Wuchih Mountain Military Cemetery.\n\nSee also\nCafe Astoria\nFranziska Donner", "answers": ["Chiang Kai-shek"], "length": 7360, "dataset": "2wikimqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "079131850286083a72ba811e3124c3c266f7a7aba5b7f5b6"}

He made 75 appearances for the club in the Midland League and five appearances in the FA Cup before joining Stockport County in 1925, where he made no league appearances.\nPassage 5:\nAndrew, Duke of Slavonia\nAndrew, Duke of Slavonia (Hungarian: András szlavóniai herceg; 1268–1278) was the youngest son of King Stephen V of Hungary and his wife, Elizabeth the Cuman. Two rebellious lords kidnapped him in 1274 in an attempt to play him off against his brother, Ladislaus IV of Hungary, but the king's supporters liberated him. He was styled \"Duke of Slavonia and Croatia\" in a 1274 letter. Years after his death (in 1290 and in 1317), two adventurers claimed to be identical with Andrew, but both failed.\n\nFamily\nAndrew was born in 1268. He was the second son (and youngest child) of Stephen V, the junior king of Hungary at the time of Andrew's birth. The senior king was Andrew's grandfather Béla IV. Andrew's mother was Stephen's wife, Elizabeth the Cuman.Andrew's father, Stephen, became the sole King of Hungary in 1270, but died two years later. Stephen was succeeded by his elder son (Andrew's ten-year-old brother) Ladislaus IV. In theory, Ladislaus's ruled under the regency of his mother, Elizabeth, but in fact, competing parties of the most wealthy noble families, including the Csáks and Kőszegis, were fighting against each other for the control of government.\n\nDuke of Slavonia\nHenry Kőszegi, the Ban of Slavonia, and his ally, Joachim Gutkeled, the Master of the treasury, who had earlier held Ladislaus IV in captivity, kidnapped the six-year-old Andrew in July 1274, taking him to Slavonia in an attempt to play him off against his brother. However, Kőszegi's and Gutkeled's rival, Peter Csák, and his allies annihilated their united troops in late September and liberated Andrew. In a letter dated to the end of 1274, Andrew is mentioned as \"Duke of Slavonia and Croatia\", but otherwise he was only referred to as \"Duke Andrew\". According to a scholarly theory, the former title was only used to emphasize that Andrew was the lawful heir to his 12-year-old elder brother at the time the letter, which referred to a planned marriage between Andrew and a relative of Rudolf I of Germany, was written. Andrew died at the age of ten between 6 April and 6 November 1278.\n\nTwo false Andrews\nAndrew's childless brother, Ladislaus IV was murdered on 10 July 1290. His distant relative, Andrew III, succeeded him and was crowned king on 23 July. However, an adventurer announced that he was identical with King Ladislaus's younger brother, claiming Hungary to himself against Andrew III. Through showing his specific birthmark, the impostor even convinced Stephen V's sister – the late Duke Andrew's aunt – Kinga, wife of Bolesław V the Chaste, Duke of Cracow. The false Duke Andrew invaded Hungary from Poland, but King Andrew's commander, George Baksa routed his troop, forcing him to return to Poland before 18 November. The pretender was in short killed by his Hungarian retainers.In 1317, a new adventurer declared himself Duke Andrew, on this occasion in Majorca. He and his imprisonment was mentioned in the correspondence between Sancho, King of Majorca, and Robert, King of Naples who was the uncle of Charles I of Hungary. The second false Duke Andrew's further fate is unknown.\nPassage 6:\nStephen V of Hungary\nStephen V (Hungarian: V. István, Croatian: Stjepan V., Slovak: Štefan V; before 18 October 1239 – 6 August 1272, Csepel Island) was King of Hungary and Croatia between 1270 and 1272, and Duke of Styria from 1258 to 1260. He was the oldest son of King Béla IV and Maria Laskarina. King Béla had his son crowned king at the age of six and appointed him Duke of Slavonia. Still a child, Stephen married Elizabeth, a daughter of a chieftain of the Cumans whom his father settled in the Great Hungarian Plain.\nKing Béla appointed Stephen Duke of Transylvania in 1257 and Duke of Styria in 1258. The local noblemen in Styria, which had been annexed four years before, opposed his rule. Assisted by King Ottokar II of Bohemia, they rebelled and expelled Stephen's troops from most parts of Styria. After Ottokar II routed the united army of Stephen and his father in the Battle of Kressenbrunn on 12 July 1260, Stephen left Styria and returned to Transylvania.\nStephen forced his father to cede all the lands of the Kingdom of Hungary to the east of the Danube to him and adopted the title of junior king in 1262. In two years, a civil war broke out between father and son, because Stephen accused Béla of planning to disinherit him. They concluded a peace treaty in 1266, but confidence was never restored between them. Stephen succeeded his father, who died on 3 May 1270, without difficulties, but his sister Anna and his father's closest advisors fled to the Kingdom of Bohemia. Ottokar II invaded Hungary in the spring of 1271, but Stephen routed him. In next summer, a rebellious lord captured and imprisoned Stephen's son, Ladislaus. Shortly thereafter, Stephen unexpectedly fell ill and died.\n\nChildhood (1239–1245)\nStephen was the eighth child and first son of King Béla IV of Hungary and his wife, Maria, a daughter of Theodore I Lascaris, Emperor of Nicaea. He was born in 1239. Archbishop Robert of Esztergom baptised him on 18 October. The child, heir apparent from birth, was named after Saint Stephen, the first King of Hungary.Béla and his family, including Stephen, fled to Zagreb after the Mongols had annihilated the royal army in the Battle of Mohi on 11 April 1241. The Mongols crossed the frozen Danube in February 1242 and the royal family ran off as far as the well-fortified Dalmatian town of Trogir. The King and his family returned from Dalmatia after the Mongols unexpectedly withdrew from Hungary in March.\n\nJunior king\nDuke of Slavonia (1245–1257)\nA royal charter of 1246 mentions Stephen as \"King, and Duke of Slavonia\". Apparently, in the previous year, Béla had his son crowned as junior king and endowed with the lands between the river Dráva and the Adriatic Sea, according to historians Gyula Kristó and Ferenc Makk. The seven-year-old Stephen's provinces—Croatia, Dalmatia and Slavonia—were administered by royal governors, known as bans.In a letter addressed to Pope Innocent IV in the late 1240s, Béla IV wrote that \"[o]n behalf of Christendom we had our son marry a Cuman girl\". The bride was Elizabeth, the daughter of a leader of the Cumans whom Béla had invited to settle in the plains along the river Tisza. Elizabeth had been baptized, but ten Cuman chieftains present at the ceremony nevertheless took their customary oath upon a dog cut into two by a sword.\n\nDuke of Transylvania and Styria (1257–1260)\nWhen Stephen attained the age of majority in 1257, his father appointed him Duke of Transylvania. Stephen's rule in Transylvania was short-lived, because his father transferred him to Styria in 1258. Styria had been annexed in 1254, but the local lords rose up in rebellion and expelled Béla IV's governor, Stephen Gutkeled, before Stephen's appointment. Stephen and his father jointly invaded Styria and subdued the rebels. In addition to Styria, Stephen also received two neighboring counties—Vas and Zala—in Hungary from his father. He launched a plundering raid in Carinthia in the spring of 1259, in retaliation of Duke Ulrich III of Carinthia's support of the Styrian rebels.Stephen's rule remained unpopular in Styria. With support from King Ottokar II of Bohemia, the local lords again rebelled. Stephen could preserve only Pettau (present-day Ptuj, Slovenia) and its region. On 25 June 1260, Stephen crossed the river Morava to invade Ottokar's realm. His military force, which consisted of Székely, Romanian and Cuman troops, routed an Austrian army. However, in the decisive Battle of Kressenbrunn King Béla's and Stephen's united army was vanquished on 12 July, primarily because the main forces, which were under King Béla's command, arrived late. Stephen, who commanded the advance guard, barely escaped from the battlefield. The Peace of Vienna, which was signed on 31 March 1261, put an end to the conflict between Hungary and Bohemia, forcing Béla IV to renounce of Styria in favor of Ottokar II.\n\nConflicts and civil war (1260–1270)\nStephen returned to Transylvania and started to rule it for the second time after 20 August 1260. He and his father jointly invaded Bulgaria and seized Vidin in 1261. His father returned to Hungary, but Stephen continued the campaign alone. He laid siege to Lom on the Danube and advanced as far as Tirnovo in pursuit of Tsar Constantine Tikh of Bulgaria. However, the Tsar succeeded in avoiding any clashes with the invaders and Stephen withdrew his troops from Bulgaria by the end of the year.Stephen's relationship with Béla IV deteriorated in the early 1260s. Stephen's charters reveal his fear of being disinherited and expelled by his father. He also accused some unnamed barons of inciting the old monarch against him. On the other hand, Stephen's charters prove that he made land grants in Bihar, Szatmár, Ugocsa, and other counties which were situated outside Transylvania.\nArchbishops Philip of Esztergom and Smaragd of Kalocsa undertook to mediate after some clashes occurred between the two kings' partisans in the autumn. According to the Peace of Pressburg, which was concluded around 25 November, Béla IV and his son divided the country and Stephen received the lands to the east of the Danube. When confirming the treaty on 5 December, Stephen also promised that he would not invade Slavonia which had been granted to his younger brother, Béla, by their father. On this occasion, Stephen styled himself \"Junior King, Duke of Transylvania and Lord of the Cumans\".A Bulgarian nobleman, Despot Jacob Svetoslav sought assistance from Stephen after his domains, which were situated in the regions south of Vidin, were overrun by Byzantine troops in the second half of 1263. Stephen sent reinforcements under the command of Ladislaus II Kán, Voivode of Transylvania to Bulgaria. The Voivode routed the Byzantines and drove them out of Bulgaria. Stephen granted Vidin to Jacob Svetoslav who accepted his suzerainty.The reconciliation of Stephen and his father was only temporary. Stephen confiscated the domains of his mother and sister, Anna—including Beszterce (present-day Bistrița, Romania) and Füzér—which were located in the lands under his rule. Béla IV's army crossed the Danube under Anna's command sometime after the autumn of 1264. She besieged and took Sárospatak and seized Stephen's wife and children. Voivode Ladislaus Kán turned against Stephen and led an army, which consisted of Cuman warriors, to Transylvania. Stephen routed him at the fort of Déva (now Deva, Romania). King Béla's Judge royal, Lawrence arrived at the head of a new army and forced Stephen to retreat to Feketehalom (now Codlea, Romania). The Judge royal lay siege to the fortress, but Stephen's partisans relieved it. Stephen launched a counter-offensive and forced his father's army to retreat. He gained a decisive victory over his father's army in the Battle of Isaszeg in March 1265. The two archbishops mediated a new consolidation between father and son, which confirmed the 1262 division of the country. Béla and Stephen signed the peace treaty in the Convent of the Blessed Virgin on the Rabbits' Island (now Margaret Island in Budapest) on 23 March 1266.During the civil war in Hungary, Stephen's vassal, Despot Jacob Svetoslav submitted himself to Tsar Constantine Tikh of Bulgaria. In the summer of 1266, Stephen invaded Bulgaria, seized Vidin, Pleven and other forts and routed the Bulgarians in five battles. Jacob Svetoslav again accepted Stephen's suzerainty and was reinstalled in Vidin. From then on, Stephen used the title \"King of Bulgaria\" in his charters.Béla and Stephen together confirmed the liberties of the \"royal servants\", from then on known as noblemen, in 1267. A double marriage alliance between Stephen and King Charles I of Sicily—Stephen's son, Ladislaus married Charles's daughter, Elisabeth, and Charles's namesake son married Stephen's daughter, Mary—strengthened Stephen's international position in 1269. Confidence was never restored between Béla and Stephen. On his deathbed, the old King requested King Ottokar II of Bohemia to give shelter to his daughter Anna and his partisans after his death.\n\nReign (1270–1272)\nThe senior King died on 3 May 1270. His daughter, Anna, seized the royal treasury and fled to Bohemia. Henry Kőszegi, Nicholas Geregye, and Lawrence Aba—Béla's closest advisors—followed her and handed over Kőszeg, Borostyánkő (Bernstein, Austria) and their other castles along the western borders to Ottokar II. Instead of leaving Hungary, Nicholas Hahót garrisoned Styrian soldiers in his fort at Pölöske, and made plundering raids against the nearby villages. Stephen nominated his own partisans to the highest offices; for instance, Joachim Gutkeled became Ban of Slavonia, and Matthew Csák was appointed Voivode of Transylvania. Stephen granted Esztergom County to Archbishop Philip who crowned him king in Esztergom on or after 17 May.The Polish chronicler Jan Długosz writes that Stephen made \"a pilgrimage to the tomb of St. Stanisław\" in Cracow and visited his brother-in-law, Boleslaw the Chaste, Duke of Cracow at the end of August. The two monarchs renewed \"the old alliance between Hungary and Poland\" and entered into an alliance \"to have the same friends and the same enemies\". Stephen also met Ottokar II on an island of the Danube near Pressburg (present-day Bratislava, Slovakia), but they only concluded a truce.Stephen launched a plundering raid into Austria around 21 December. King Ottokar invaded the lands north of the Danube in April 1271 and captured a number of fortresses, including Dévény (now Devín, Slovakia), Pressburg and Nagyszombat (present-day Trnava, Slovakia). Ottokar routed Stephen at Pressburg on 9 May, and at Mosonmagyaróvár on 15 May, but Stephen won the decisive battle on the Rábca River on 21 May. Ottokar withdrew from Hungary and Stephen chased his troops as far as Vienna. The two kings' envoys reached an agreement in Pressburg on 2 July. According to their treaty, Stephen promised that he would not assist Ottokar's opponents in Carinthia, and Ottokar renounced the castles he and his partisans held in Hungary. The Hungarians soon recaptured Kőszeg, Borostyánkő and other fortresses along the western border of Hungary.\nAccording to the Life of Stephen's saintly sister, Margaret, who had died on 18 January 1270, Stephen was present when the first miracle attributed to her occurred on the first anniversary of her death. Stephen, in fact, initiated Margaret's canonization at the Holy See in 1271. In the same year, Stephen granted town privileges to the citizens of Győr. He also confirmed the liberties of the Saxon \"guests\" in the Szepesség region (present-day Spiš, Slovakia), contributing to the development of their autonomous community. On the other hand, Stephen protected the Archbishop of Esztergom's rights against the conditional nobles of the archbishopric who attempted to get rid of their obligations.Ban Joachim Gutkeled kidnapped Stephen's ten-year-old son and heir, Ladislaus and imprisoned him in the castle of Koprivnica in the summer of 1272. Stephen besieged the fortress, but could not capture it. Stephen fell ill and was taken to the Csepel Island. He died on 6 August 1272. Stephen was buried near to the tomb of his sister, Margaret, in the Monastery of the Blessed Virgin on Rabbits' Island.\n\nFamily\nStephen's wife, Elizabeth, was born around 1239, according to historian Gyula Kristó. A charter of her father-in-law, Béla IV, refers to one Seyhan, a Cuman chieftain as his kinsman, implying that Seyhan was Elizabeth's father. Stephen's first child by Elizabeth, Catherine, was born around 1256. She was given in marriage to Stephen Dragutin, the elder son and heir of King Stephen Uroš I of Serbia, in about 1268. Her sister Mary was born around 1257 and married the future Charles II of Naples in 1270. Their grandson Charles Robert became King of Hungary in the first decade of the 14th century.According to historian Gyula Kristó, Stephen's third (unnamed) daughter was the wife of Despot Jacob Svetoslav. Stephen's third (or fourth) daughter, Elizabeth, who was born in about 1260, became a Dominican nun in the Monastery of the Blessed Virgin on Rabbits' Island. She was appointed prioress in 1277, but her brother, Ladislaus, kidnapped and married her to a Czech baron, Zavis of Falkenstein, in 1288. Stephen's youngest daughter, Anna, was born in about 1260. She married Andronikos Palaiologos, son and heir of the Byzantine Emperor, Michael VIII.Stephen's first son, Ladislaus IV, was born in 1262. He succeeded his father in 1272. Stephen's youngest child, Andrew, was born in 1268 and died at the age of 10.\nPassage 7:\nTheodred II (Bishop of Elmham)\nTheodred II was a medieval Bishop of Elmham.\nThe date of Theodred's consecration unknown, but the date of his death was sometime between 995 and 997.\nPassage 8:\nAndrew, Duke of Calabria\nAndrew, Duke of Calabria (30 October 1327 – 18 September 1345) was the first husband of Joanna I of Naples, and a son of Charles I of Hungary and brother of Louis I of Hungary.\n\nBackground and engagement\nAndrew was the second of three surviving sons of King Charles I of Hungary and his third wife, Elizabeth of Poland. He was betrothed in 1334 to his cousin Joanna, granddaughter and heiress apparent of King Robert of Naples; Andrew's father was a fraternal nephew of King Robert, making Andrew and Joanna both members of the Capetian House of Anjou.\nRobert's claim to the throne was rather tenuous and did not follow primogeniture. Andrew's grandfather, Charles Martel of Anjou, had died young; therefore, the throne should have passed to Andrew's father. However, due to fears of impending invasion from Sicily, it was felt that a seven-year-old heir was too risky and would not be able to hold off invasions. The throne was offered to the next son of Charles II of Naples, Louis, but he refused on religious grounds, and it thus passed to Robert. To recompensate Andrew's father, Charles II decided to assign him the claim to Hungary.\nWhen King Robert died in 1343, in his last will and testament, he formally bequeathed his kingdom to his granddaughter Joanna, making no mention of Andrew and thus denying him the right to reign along with Joanna.\n\nStruggle for the crown\nWith the approval of Pope Clement VI, Joanna was crowned sole monarch of Naples in August 1344. Fearing for his life, Andrew wrote to his mother Elizabeth that he would soon flee the kingdom. She intervened, and made a state visit, before she returned to Hungary allegedly bribing Pope Clement to reverse himself and permit the coronation of Andrew. She also gave a ring to Andrew, which was supposed to protect him from death by blade or poison, and returned with a false sense of security to Hungary.\nWhen Joanna fell ill in the summer of 1344, Andrew caused great controversy when he released the Pipini brothers. They had been locked up by Robert the Wise after having been convicted for murder, rape, pillage, treason and several other offences. Their possessions had been given to other nobles, who now became increasingly hostile to Andrew.\n\nMurder and aftermath\nHearing of the Pope's reversal, a group of noble conspirators (the involvement of Queen Joanna has never been proven) determined to forestall Andrew's coronation. During a hunting trip at Aversa, Andrew left his room in the middle of the night and was set upon by the conspirators. A treacherous servant barred the door behind him, and, as Joanna cowered in their bed, a terrible struggle ensued, Andrew defending himself furiously and shrieking for aid. He was finally overpowered, strangled with a cord, and flung from a window. Isolde, Andrew's Hungarian nurse took the Prince's corpse to the church of the monks, and remained with it until next morning mourning it. When the Hungarian knights arrived she told them everything in their mother tongue so no one else would learn about the truth, and soon they left Naples reporting everything to the Hungarian King.The deed would taint the rest of Joanna's reign, although she was twice acquitted of any charge in the trials that followed. Andrew's elder brother Louis I of Hungary several times invaded the Kingdom of Naples and drove out Joanna, only to meet with reverses. Ultimately, 37 years later, their kinsman Charles of Durazzo (King Charles III of Naples) conquered Naples with Hungarian aid and put Joanna to death. She had been married three times more since Andrew.\nAndrew and Joanna had one posthumous son, Charles Martel (Naples, 25 December 1345 – aft. 10 May 1348) who died young in Hungary.\n\nAncestry\nSee also\nPhilippa of Catania\nPassage 9:\nHarry Wainwright (footballer)\nHarry Wainwright (born 1899; date of death unknown) was an English footballer.\n\nCareer\nWainwright played for Highfields before joining Port Vale as an amateur in December 1919.

{"input": "Who is Charles Gordon, 2Nd Earl Of Aboyne's paternal grandmother?", "context": "Passage 1:\nGeorge Gordon, 2nd Earl of Huntly\nGeorge Gordon, 2nd Earl of Huntly (died 8 June 1501) was a Scottish nobleman and Chancellor of Scotland from 1498 to 1501.\n\nLife\nGeorge was the son of Alexander (Seton) Gordon, 1st Earl of Huntly and his second wife Elizabeth Crichton, daughter of William Crichton, 1st Lord Crichton. George is first mentioned by name in 1441 when the lands which later became part of the Earldom were settled on him and his heirs. George was almost certainly born shortly before this time, c. 1441 as his parents married before 18 March 1439–40.In his contract with Elizabeth Dunbar, Countess of Moray, dated 20 May 1455 he is styled the Master of Huntley. He is addressed as \"Sir George Seton, knight\", in a royal precept dated 7 March 1456–7, and in a crown charter dated a year later he uses the name of Gordon for the first time, indicating he had assumed that surname. As George, Lord Gordon, he was keeper of the castles of Kildrummy, Kindrochat and Inverness. He succeeded his father as Earl of Huntly c. 15 July 1470.Shortly after becoming Earl of Huntly he was involved with the Earl of Ross in a private war in which the king, James III of Scotland, interceded. Ross was charged with treason, but after refusing a summons from the king, was outlawed. One of the expeditions sent against the errant Earl of Ross was led by Alexander. After he captured Dingwall Castle and pressed his army into Lochaber, Ross relented and sought pardon for his actions from the king. In 1479 he was justiciary north of the River Forth, one of his primary duties was the suppression of feuds between Highland clans. In 1497 George Gordon was appointed High Chancellor of Scotland, the honour probably bestowed at the same time as his daughter Catherine married Perkin Warbeck, an adventurer in favour with King James IV of Scotland. George was Chancellor until 1500. George, the second earl, died at Stirling Castle on 8 June 1501.\n\nFamily\nOn 20 May 1455, George Gordon was married by contract to Lady Elizabeth Dunbar, daughter of James Dunbar, 7th Earl of Moray. The marriage was annulled due to affinity, before March 1459–60; the couple had no children.George secondly married, before March 1459–60, Princess Annabella of Scotland, youngest daughter of King James I of Scotland and Joan Beaufort (the granddaughter of John of Gaunt). After several years of marriage, the Earl of Gordon instituted proceedings to have this marriage annulled as well, on the grounds that Princess Annabella was related in the third and fourth degrees of consanguinity to his first wife, Elizabeth Dunbar, and the marriage was dissolved on 24 July 1471.George Gordon had a number of children, but with few exceptions, there remains no clear consensus as to which child was of the second marriage and which was of the third:\n\nLady Isabella Gordon (d. 1485), wife of William Hay, 3rd Earl of Erroll (d. 1507).\nAlexander Gordon, 3rd Earl of Huntly (died 21 January 1523/24)\nAdam Gordon, who married Lady Elizabeth de Moravia, daughter and heir of John de Moravia, 8th Earl of Sutherland, and in her right became Countess of Sutherland after her brother's death. Their son was Alexander Gordon, Master of Sutherland.\nWilliam Gordon, who married Janet Ogilvy and was the ancestor of the Gordons of Gight, from whom Lord Byron was a descendant.\nJames Gordon, mentioned in an entail in 1498.\nLady Janet Gordon, who married firstly, Alexander Lindsay, Master of Crawfurd; secondly, Patrick, Master of Gray (annulled); thirdly, Patrick Buttar of Gormark; and fourthly, James Halkerston of Southwood. She died before February 1559.\nLady Elizabeth Gordon, mother was Annabella, who was contracted to marry William Keith, 3rd Earl Marischal, in 1481.George obtained an annulment from his second marriage on 24 July 1471. He then married, thirdly, his mistress, Lady Elizabeth Hay, daughter of William Hay, 1st Earl of Erroll, and swore a solemn oath to have no 'actual delen' with the lady until after they were married. He married Elizabeth Hay on 12 May 1476, and they had the following children:\n\nLady Catherine Gordon (died October 1537), probably a daughter of Elizabeth Hay, she married firstly, Perkin Warbeck (d. 1499), notorious for claiming to be Richard of Shrewsbury, 1st Duke of York, one of the young princes who disappeared from history in the Tower of London; s
