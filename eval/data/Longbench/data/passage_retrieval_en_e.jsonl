{"input": "During a race, the starter mistakenly waved the green flag too early, causing a chain reaction accident involving 11 cars. One car had ignition problems and slowed down, causing other cars to shift towards the outside to avoid it. Another car collided with another, overturning and crashing into the catch fence. This impact damaged the fence and caused the car's fuel tanks to rupture, resulting in a massive fireball and injuries to spectators. The car then landed upside-down on the track and spun out of control, hitting several other cars. The intense heat from the fire affected the visibility of some drivers.", "context": "Paragraph 1: The story opens with an unknown narrator addressing a letter to someone referred to as \"V\". The narrator writes his letter from New York having obtained \"V\" 's address from a mutual acquaintance, Gleb Alexandrovich Gekko, who finds \"V\"'s writings to be anti-nationalist. Both \"V\" and the narrator are revealed to be Russian born immigrants who spent time together in France and the narrator recalls his literary excursions with \"V\" but admits he is no longer a poet. The narrator explains that after \"V\"'s departure from France he married a much younger woman. Although the narrator states he has papers to prove matrimony he is certain his wife was not a real entity and he is therefore \"...able to speak of her with as much detachment as I would of a character in a story...\" Due to the narrator's published criticism of Germany he admits attempting to expatriate from occupied France using his wife's relatives in New York but they never responded. Through other contacts, the narrator reveals he was able secure passage towards Paris to await the necessary papers for full departure to the United States. The narrator and his wife depart and travel by train across the country, spending their honeymoon witnessing refugees and destitution. During this period the narrator's wife laments what conditions their dog would have to endure should they have bought a dog and left that dog behind to face its own death. Traveling to Nice by railway the narrator is separated from his wife when he briefly departs at a stop for food, having both tickets with him. Unable to locate his wife the narrator decides to travel to the following stop in Montpellier sending telegrams for her hoping he will find her having traveled ahead to their destination. After arriving in Nice the narrator receives little help from police as he reflects on his misfortune in comparison to the stories he hears concerning people of Jewish descent from his fellow Russian immigrants. A week passes and the narrator discovers his wife by chance at a nearby market. His wife explains she sought help from the Commissariat and a few elderly women refugees who provided the means to reach her and her husband's destination. Soon after the wife changes her story during an intimate moment to reveal she spent her time with another man in Montpellier with whom she had relations with. The narrator demands to be given every detail of her memories during the days that follow while awaiting paperwork that will allow for escape from the country. His wife states while upset that it is possible she did not do it, it is possible that she did it to test him, and it is possible there is a multiplicity in her experience.\n\nParagraph 2: Nas also attacks Jay-Z's street cred, claiming, \"In '88, you was gettin' chased to your buildin'/ Callin' my crib, and I ain't even give you my numbers/ All I did was give you a style for you to run with.\" He also accuses Jay of selling out, \"Y'all niggas deal with emotions like bitches/ What's sad is I love you cause you're my brother, you traded your soul for riches.\" Nas also criticized him for copying KRS-One ideas on the name of Jay-Z's current album at the time, The Blueprint, which was quite similar to the Boogie-Down Production's album, Ghetto Music: The Blueprint of Hip Hop, with the line \"KRS already made an album called Blueprint.\" He had lines calling Jay unattractive and accusing him of misogyny, as well as having an affair with Foxy Brown in the late 1990s (which she would confirm years later in her track \"Let em Know\") rapping, \"You seem to be only concerned with dissin' women/ Were you abused as a child, scared to smile, they called you ugly?\" and \"Foxy kept you hot, kept your face in her puss/ What you think you gettin' girls now because of your looks?\", \"started cocking up my weapon slowly loading up this ammo to explode it on a Camel and his soldiers I can handle \". He also accuses Jay of brown nosing other rappers for fame: \"Your ass went from Jaz to hangin' with Kane, to Irv to Big/ And, Eminem murdered you on your own shit.\" Not only does he criticize the usage of other rappers' influence for increased fame, he mentions that Eminem outshined him on his song, \"Renegade\". Finally, Nas insults Jay-Z's biting of Big's lyrics claiming that Jay-Z stole his rhyming skills off Biggie, \"How much of Biggie's rhymes gonna come out your fat lips?\". The intro of Ether starts with gunshots from Notorious B.I.G.'s \"Who Shot Ya?\", immediately followed by a screwed voice of 2Pac saying \"Fuck Jay-Z\", originally taken from the song \"Fuck Friendz\". In the outro of \"Ether\", Nas mocks the chorus of \"Takeover\", which Jay-Z raps \"R-O-C, we runnin' this rap shit\", Nas changes it to \"R-O-C, get gunned up and clapped quick\" and so on.\n\nParagraph 3: Each of the three main areas of the game has four levels, three of them contain pieces of that area's Fairy Spirit Stone, and the fourth a Castle where that area's king is imprisoned. Each king has the power to put their areas stone back together. In order to reach the Devil all three stones must be repaired. The game for most levels is a standard platform game with jumping and shooting. There are four other levels that are played in different ways. (1) Meet and ride in the pouch of a Kangaroo-like Dinosaur. (2) Race a car in an under water course. (3) Ride on the back of a bird-like dragon that can shoot balls of fire, as enemies fall from the top of the screen. (4) Fly using a hat that has a spinning propeller on its top. The main character that is being used to play can be switched by pausing the game and selecting another character, each has their own unique abilities, a sixth character the princess Corona, whose name also means sun's outer layer Corona, can also be unlocked as a playable character once the game has been beaten. Small voice clips from the cartoon actors can be heard when starting any of the levels or when the character is defeated. Many of the boss enemies come from other cultures such as a Minotaur, Harpy, Centaur, and an evil version of Santa Claus. As the demo story plays a Pentagram is seen as the Devil is released form is barrier. The text of the game is entirely in Japanese and appears in a window bar at the bottom of the screen along with an image of the person that it speaking, the image changes when the person is happy, sad, or another person is talking.\n\nParagraph 4: He was educated at Eduardo Mondlane University (Diploma in Development Studies), the University of East Anglia (Diploma in Development Economics, 1991, and MA Industrial Development, 1992), the University of Oxford (MSc Development Economics, 1997) and SOAS, University of London (PhD Economics, 2002). He was an associate professor in industrialization and development economics at Eduardo Mondlane University, from 1992 to 2019, when he retired, was the director of the Instituto de Estudos Sociais e Económicos (Institute for Social and Economic Studies) (IESE) from 2007 to 2012, and coordinator of IESE's research group on economics and development, from 2007 to 2017. He is, currently, a visiting professor at the Lisbon School of Economics and Management, ISEG, of the University of Lisbon (https://www.iseg.ulisboa.pt), and a researcher of ISEG's Centre for African and Development Studies, CEsA (https://web.archive.org/web/20180213201026/http://pascal.iseg.utl.pt/~cesa/). His research is focused on the political economy of economic crisis and transformation and systems of capital accumulation in Africa. Within this broad area, he is working, currently, on crisis and dependent capitalism, public debt and financialization, and financialization and premature deindustrialization in the African context. With CEsA, IESE and the Centro de Estudos Sociais (Centre for Social Studies), CES, of the Coimbra University, he is involved in two studies focused on the political economy of African Socialisms and the political economy of African capitalisms in the era of global financialization and of crisis of and in neoliberalism. In 2015, he was awarded the Ruth First prize for the best article on political economy of African development by the Review of African Political Economy, ROAPE, as well as two prizes for dedication to major public causes, one by the city of Quelimane, Zambézia, Mozambique (by which he was made honorary citizen of the city) and another by the civil society coordination mechanism, MASC, also in Mozambique. He is a member of the Mozambican Academy of Sciences, the Mozambican Association of Economists (AMECON), the Portuguese Association of Political Economy (APEP) and of the editorial board of the Journal for Southern African Studies (JSAS), and a member of the group of reviewers of ROAPE. Information about his work and publications (most of which can be accessed online for free) is available from Research Gate, a data base of scientific research and publications, https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Carlos_Castel-Branco/stats/profile_views. He has recently co-edited, with Elisa Greco, a special issue of the Review of African Political Economy (RoAPE, vol 49, Issue 171, March 2022) titled \"Capital accumulation, financialization and social reproduction in Mozambique\", https://www.tandfonline.com/toc/crea20/current, in which he also published two articles, \"The historical logic of the mode of capital accumulation in Mozambique\" and, co-authored with Diogo Maia, \"Financialization, narrow specialisation of production and capital accumulation in Mozambique\" (both articles, and the editorial of the special issue, \"Mozambique - neither miracle nor mirage\", co-authored with Elisa Greco, can be freely accessed from his research gate website).\n\nParagraph 5: The band's name (meaning \"dancing manias\" in German) came about by randomly pointing to words in a German dictionary, the same technique Stipe had employed to find the R.E.M. moniker (except with an English dictionary). The band toured the U.S. southeast and recorded a single for David Healy's Dasht Hopes label. In his book \"It crawled from the South\", Marcus Grey writes: \"Determined to pursue his art-noise interests parallel to his more conventional activities with R.E.M., Michael hooked up with William Lee Self, Neil McArthur and David Pierce in Tanzplagen. The connection was strengthened when Oh-OK Lynda Stipe and Linda Hopper contributed backing vocals at a 40 Watt Club appearance that was taped to provide a rough-and ready three track demo. It includes the Self compositions 'Living By the Neck' and 'Peter Pan', and the Stipe-Self song 'meeting'. In addition to further occasional appearances in town and one short local tour Tanzplagen even got as far as recording tracks for a single, intended for release on David Healys ill-fated Dasht Hopes label. The studio chosen was Bombay in Smyrna where back in February R.E.M. had made its first recordings. Neil McArthur had left by the time of the session, and so William Lee Self, the groups real leader, doubled on bass while Lynda Stipe supplied vocals. However it is Michaels contribution to the two songs recorded ('meeting' and Self's 'treason') that Producer Joe Perry remembers: 'Micheal would sing and bang on a Farfisa organ creating a large explosion. It was a different time. Experimental stuff'\". Soon later, R.E.M. were signed to IRS and released the Chronic Town EP (which had been recorded for Healy's label's debut release), but the Tanzplagen single went unreleased until 1991 when Strangeways Records brought it out as their inaugural release. The CD includes a duet with Stipe and his sister Lynda and some improvised live recordings that include Linda Hopper, her bandmate at the time in the band Oh-OK. Self describes the contents of \"The Lost Single and Live at the 40 Watt club, Athens Georgia 1981\": \"thus I wrote the song 'Living By The Neck' but had no title for it, Stipe came up with the title only meaning 'living by the guitar neck'. We also intentionally booked all our in town shows on full moon nights - this truly made a drastic but wonderful difference in the atmosphere and audiences behaviour.\" Tanzplagen dissolved in late 1982 when Self relocated to Germany. David Pierce went on to form Buzz Of Delight with Mathew Sweet. Neil McArthur continued his studies at the University of Georgia.\n\nParagraph 6: At the start, race starter Pat Vidan erroneously threw the green flag a lap early, triggering an 11-car accident which unfolded on the main stretch approximately 200 yards past the start/finish line, which halted the race immediately. As the green flag fell, Steve Krisiloff's car developed ignition problems and slowed on the front straightaway, falling back to parallel with the fifth row by the time he crossed the start/finish line. This caused the rest of the field behind Krisiloff to shuffle towards the outside to avoid the slowing car. Seconds later in the sixth row, just past the start/finish line, Salt Walther tangled wheels with Jerry Grant, climbed over Grant's left-front wheel, overturned in the air and slammed into the catch fence. The car cut a  chunk out of the fence on impact, breaking two 4 inch steel stanchions before being thrown back onto the track by the reinforcing cables positioned behind the fence. The impact ripped open both of Walther's fuel tanks, sending 75 gallons of flaming methanol in a massive pale blue fireball (not apparent on TV or film footage) and dousing many spectators; with the blast of heat felt at least 100 yards away in the Paddock grandstand and Track Boxes, per eyewitness accounts. Eleven grandstand spectators were injured, and nine required hospitalization. As the front of Walther's car dug into the fence, the nose was also sheared off and Walther's legs were exposed. The car landed back on the racing surface upside-down, and spun wildly down the main stretch, spraying burning fuel in all directions. The spinning car was hit by at least two other cars, and a total of at least ten other cars became involved in the crash, including: Wally Dallenbach, Mike Hiss, Lee Kunzman, John Martin, David Hobbs, Mike Mosley, Jim McElreath and Dick Simon. Several cars were damaged extensively, and debris and burning fuel now littered the track. Kunzman later recalled that he thought he had been blinded by hitting the burning fuel until his car stopped and he flipped up his visor, as the intense heat had crinkled it so severely, he could not see where he was going.\n\nParagraph 7: The Return of Ishtar is an adventure game that requires two players. It was also the first game from Namco to have a password feature, to give players the opportunity to continue from where they left off, and their first to not feature a scoring system. Player 1 controls the priestess Ki who fights with magic, while Player 2 controls the sword-wielding Prince Gilgamesh. This sequel starts off directly after Gilgamesh has saved Ki from Druaga, and focuses on their escape from the tower (and its inhabitants) who are after Gilgamesh and Ki to avenge their former master. There are a total of 128 rooms in the sixty-floor tower, and the screen will only scroll according to Ki's location, so the second player will have to stay close to their partner as they traverse the tower. Ki attacks by casting spells at the enemies, while Gilgamesh automatically draws his sword whenever an enemy gets close enough to him, allowing him to attack the enemy by bumping into it with his blade (similar to Adol from the Ys games). However, colliding with enemies will also damage Gilgamesh, and the counter in the bottom-right of the screen will decrease by a preset amount, depending on what enemy type it was. If the counter reaches 0, he will disappear, and the game will be over for both players (which will also happen if Ki is touched by any enemy at all). There are also several different items that can be found in the rooms and collected to aid Gilgamesh and Ki in their quest. As an easter egg, the game's designer, Masanobu Endō, appears unconscious at his desk in the \"Dead End\" room. Ki can use the Blue Crystal Rod spell on him to wake him up; he will then proceed to warp her and Gilgamesh to the \"Calvary Prison\" room.\n\nParagraph 8:  McCartney has enjoyed a successful solo career releasing four albums, and spawning three top ten singles. He's appeared on many television shows, including Disney's Hannah Montana and The Suite Life of Zack & Cody, as well as a 2008 episode of Law & Order: Special Victims Unit. McCartney had a starring role on The WB's show Summerland, alongside future stars like Zac Efron, and was set to star in Locke and Key; however, the pilot was not picked up for an entire season. In 2008, McCartney was cast as the lead role in the independent film Keith. McCartney had a recurring role in Season 4 of the ABC Family series, Greek, and appeared as a lead in the 2012 movie Chernobyl Diaries, which was a moderate box office success. In June 2011, McCartney released a fragrance for women, \"Wanted\".  McCartney has also forayed into voice acting, performing as Dick Grayson/Robin on the show Young Justice, Terence in the Tinker Bell films, Theodore in the Alvin and the Chipmunks films, and voicing Roxas and Ventus in the popular (English versions) of Kingdom Hearts series of video games. He starred on the hit series Young & Hungry as Cooper. In 2020, he was named the runner-up on the third season of The Masked Singer as the \"Turtle\".\n\nParagraph 9: CDI triggered by two sets of points. A basic problem with the rotary engine design is a lack of engine braking, partially due to the mass of the rotor. Leaning of the mixture on overrun also contributes to erratic and \"lumpy\" running. One way to solve the problem is to shut off ignition entirely on overrun, but this leads to excessive contamination of the combustion chamber by unwanted deposits, which can cause the apex seals to stick. Suzuki opted for a compromise by using two sets of ignition points. One set of points ran on a dual lobe cam for normal operation, firing the rotor every face. The other set ran on a single cam on the same shaft for triggering the spark plug on overrun. The second set (the B points) were triggered by an rpm sensor (the speed relay) and a vacuum switch, which meant that they worked on engine deceleration (high vacuum) and above 1,700 rpm. This system fired the rotor every second face. This kept the combustion chambers relatively clean. It also served to smooth the lumpy feel of the bike as RPM reduced on overrun and addressed some issues with backfiring (more correctly, \"afterfiring\"). Engine braking is also significantly improved. The B point system was discontinued on the \"A\". It is believed that the factory also employed mechanics to visit dealerships and disconnect the B points on any \"M\" (1975) models still in the showrooms. Suzuki toyed with the idea of two plugs like the Mazda's, but as with so much of their engineering on this bike, overthought the application, believing that they would require two plugs of different heat ranges. The idea was dropped, and the bike shipped with a single 18 mm conical seat gold palladium spark plug housed in a copper insert in the rotor housing (NGK A9EFV).\n\nParagraph 10: Lake Hula was historically referred to by different names. The 14th century BCE Egyptians called the lake Samchuna, while the Hebrew Bible records it as Merom. In the 1st century CE, the Jewish-Roman historian Flavius Josephus termed it Semechonitis (), John Lightfoot writing it as Samochonitis, while in the Talmud it is called Yam Sumchi – i.e. Sea of Sumchi. Currently the lake is called Buheirat el Huleh in Arabic and Agam ha-Hula in Hebrew, stemming from the Aramaic Hulata or Ulata. The \"Waters of Merom\" has sometimes been used in scientific literature, although that term refers specifically to springs on the western side of the valley.", "answers": ["Paragraph 6"], "length": 3446, "dataset": "passage_retrieval_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "f363b5cfe63d7095514d7273aaa2e31dbfa73f10a71fd7d8"}
{"input": "In April 2009, during the filming of Season 6, Duane Chapman, also known as Dog the Bounty Hunter, was allegedly shot at by a fugitive named Hoang Nguyen in Colorado Springs. Chapman's crew, along with bail bondsman Bobby Brown, were attempting to arrest Nguyen when the incident occurred. Nguyen managed to escape on a motorcycle but was captured by Chapman several hours later. However, the A&E airing of the episode, titled \"Easy Rider\", contradicted this version of events. According to Chapman's website and TMZ, Nguyen was arrested and charged with attempted murder in relation to the shooting attempt. However, on May 15, 2009, the charges were dropped by the El Paso County Assistant District attorney due to a lack of evidence and conflicting statements from Chapman, his son Leland, and Bobby Brown.

The first \"improvements\" on nature's design involved a simple polishing of the octahedral crystal faces to create even and unblemished facets, or to fashion the desired octahedral shape out of an otherwise unappealing piece of rough. This was called the point cut and dates from the mid 14th century; by 1375 there was a guild of diamond polishers at Nürnberg. By the mid 15th century, the point cut began to be improved upon: the top of the octahedron would be polished or ground off, creating the table cut. The importance of a culet was also realised, and some table-cut stones may possess one. The addition of four corner facets created the old single cut (or old eight cut). Neither of these early cuts would reveal what diamond is prized for today; its strong dispersion or fire. At the time, diamond was valued chiefly for its adamantine lustre and superlative hardness; a table-cut diamond would appear black to the eye, as they do in paintings of the era. For this reason, colored gemstones such as ruby and sapphire were far more popular in jewelry of the era.\n\nParagraph 3: Santa Maria Assunta. This parish church dates from the 6th-7th century, but was rebuilt starting in 1530 by Giovanni Matteo Giberti. However, the construction was stopped due to lack of funds, and the church, dedicated to the Assumption of the Virgin Mary, was completed only in 1764. The door portals (1824) are made with white Veronese stone. The interior consists of a nave and two aisles. The eastern side is divided by on six heavy columns, while the southern side has four lighter ones. They are all connected by round arches. The statues of Saints Peter and Paul (1886) were made by the Veronese sculptor Righetti, while a large wooden crucifix dates from the 14th-15th centuries. Behind the crucifix is the printed edict of Pope Innocent II (November 1138) resolving the allocation of tithes. The side altar of St. Anthony of Padua dates from 1720. The altarpiece was painted by Simone Brentani, while the statues in Carrara marble represent San Fabiano and San Sebastiano. The two walnut confessionals (17th century) were carved by the workshop of Andrea Brustolon in Rococo style. The side altar (1648) in the \"Capella dei Caduti\" contains a wooden statue of \"Madonna and Child\" (in Veronese style, 15th century). In the right aisle is located the side altar with the paintings of Saints Luigi Gonzaga and Vincenzo Ferreri by Gaspare Diziani (1764). The baptismal font dates from the 17th century.  The main altar dates from mid 16th century and stands in front of the organ (1958). Behind the altar on the wall is an Assumption of Mary (17th century). The two statues of angels in front of the altar were sculpted by Francesco Filippini (1600). The pulpit was made out of briar root and walnut.\n\nParagraph 4: After a short campaign in North Africa against a Turkish attack on the Suez Canal in 1915, the SA Scottish were sent to France. Here they took part in the Battle of Delville Wood as part of the Battle of the Somme in 1916. In the days between 15 July and 19 July the total casualty rate was at 74 percent of those who had gone into action. By the end of July the South African Scottish suffered 868 casualties. The final German forces were driven from Delville Wood after an Allied assault on 3 September 1916. After Delville Wood the shattered SA Scottish were reformed and served on the Western front, in particular at Vimy Ridge, the Somme, the Battle of Passchendaele, Marrieres Wood and the Battle of Messines. During its time on the Western Front, the South African Brigade and its Scottish heritage 4th Battalion, first served a lengthy stint with the British 9th (Scottish) Division, and following the Brigade's decimation in March 1918, was reconstituted and incorporated in September into the 66th (2nd East Lancashire) Division until the end of the war.\n\nParagraph 5: The 1962 World Series was the championship series of Major League Baseball's (MLB) 1962 season. The 59th edition of the World Series, it was a best-of-seven playoff that matched the defending American League (AL) and World Series champion New York Yankees against the National League (NL) champion San Francisco Giants. The Yankees won the series in seven games for the 20th championship in team history. It is best remembered for its dramatic conclusion in Game 7; with runners on second and third base and two outs in the bottom of the ninth inning, the Giants’ Willie McCovey hit a hard line drive that was caught by Yankees second baseman Bobby Richardson to preserve New York's one-run victory. Yankees pitcher Ralph Terry was named the World Series Most Valuable Player.\n\nParagraph 6: The use of the name Murray Park significantly reduced after the club was sold to Craig Whyte in 2011. Moreover, after the liquidation of the company running the club and its assets, many fans held David Murray partly or wholly responsible, and so began calling the facility Auchenhowie (after the geographic area where it is based). In June 2012, the then Rangers Chief executive Charles Green stated he would ask Rangers season ticket holders to vote on renaming the club's training ground. Green proposed that it could be renamed the Moses McNeil Academy or the Davie Cooper Academy after former Rangers players. In June 2016, then chairman Dave King revisited the issue of the renaming of Murray Park and asked Rangers fans to suggest an alternative name.\n\nParagraph 7: Built in 1963, Zolder hosted the Formula One Belgian Grand Prix on 10 separate occasions in the 1970s and 1980s, as well as the 1980 Belgian motorcycle Grand Prix. F1 moved to Zolder in 1973 and with the exception of a race at Nivelles-Baulers in 1974, Zolder was the location of the Belgian Grand Prix until 1982. That year, Canadian driver Gilles Villeneuve was killed during qualifying at the 1982 Belgian Grand Prix. Villeneuve's Ferrari 126C2 collided at speed with the March 821 of Jochen Mass. The Ferrari was torn up in the accident and when rolling, Villeneuve was thrown from the car.\n\nParagraph 8: Lucas Hay is the son of Ste Hay (Kieron Richardson) and Amy Barnes (Ashley Slanina-Davies), and the brother of Leah Barnes (Elà-May Demircan) and Hannah Hay-O'Connor and was played by a child actor William Hall since 2013. He was born on 3 April 2009 and was delivered by Ste and his friend Daniel Raven's (Chris Hargreaves) wife, Abi Raven (Elaine Glover). His name was chosen by Ste. After his birth, Josh Ashworth (Sonny Flood) tried to stop Ste seeing Lucas, but Amy's sister Sarah Barnes (Loui Batley) blackmails Josh into handing Lucas over to Ste and Lucas moves in with Ste. In July, Amy and Sarah's father, Mike (Tony Hirst) found Ste asleep whilst caring for Lucas. As a result, Mike took Lucas and decided to look after him. Ste found Mike and taunted him about his family, Mike then hit him. The next day, Mike approached Abi about her interests in Ste and Lucas. Ste then told Mike that he would no longer be seeing Lucas and he was going to a solicitor. In August 2009, after weeks of drugging Ste, Daniel went behind Abi's back and interviewed a couple who hoped to adopt Lucas. Ste was pushed to the limit and almost shook Lucas, Daniel used this as an excuse to give him to the adopters. Sarah and Mike's ex-girlfriend Zoe Carpenter (Zoë Lister) help Ste as Abi took Lucas. Abi then made the decision to hand Lucas back to Ste. When a fire is set in Il Gnosh while Lucas and Leah are being looked after by Amy in the flat above, Steph Cunningham (Carley Stenson) saves them after the fire spreads. In 2012, Amy moves away from the village and takes Lucas and Leah to live with her. Lucas and Leah return to the village in December 2012 to stay with Ste, while Amy goes abroad with her new fiancée. Amy returns to the village in February 2013 after discovering Ste's relationship with Brendan Brady (Emmett J. Scanlan) she then leaves once more with Leah and Lucas, leaving Ste upset. Ste begins a relationship with John Paul McQueen (James Sutton) and they later get married in December 2014. They later separated and Ste later begins a relationship with Harry Thompson (Parry Glasspool). In August 2016, Amy returns with her fiancé Ryan Knight (Duncan James) and they begin battling custody of Leah and Lucas with Ste and Harry. In December 2016, Amy and Ryan won full custody and they keep Leah and Lucas away from Ste when they tell them not to see Ste. In March 2017, Amy and Ryan get married. The next day, Amy gets murdered by an unknown person and Ste gets arrested for Amy's murder. After Mike returned, he tells Leah and Lucas that Amy has died. In August 2017, when being looked after by Tegan, Lucas tells her that he saw Ryan with Kyle Kelly (Adam Rickitt), and Ryan lies to Lucas that he wasn't with Kyle. In September 2017, Amy's mother, Kathy Barnes (Sarah Jane Buckley), decides to take Leah and Lucas but they stay with Ryan, which leads to Kathy leaving the village. In November 2017, Ryan and Ste's half-sister Tegan Lomax (Jessica Ellis) tell Leah and Lucas that they are in a relationship and Leah and Lucas are worried when Tegan is going to replace Amy. \n\nParagraph 9:  Powerful Stuff: An Electricity safety film from 1988, based on the same principles as Play Safe. It shows of a group of boys, Darren, his brother Tom and Andy walking to school together. On the way they set off a gang of teenagers who chase them all the way to an electricity substation. Tom spots a football in there which Darren tries to break in and get, despite there being danger signs and foolishly believing you only have to touch what's inside to get hurt, but a reluctant Andy talks him out of it; instead, they play football with other friends to school. Once they enter the class, Mr. Jones who works for the electricity board, teaches them the dangers of electricity like touching overhead cables, being careless around cables and climbing pylons, showing clips of what happened when people ignored or did not know the danger that could be present in the situation, even stating that electricity can easily kill you, just by being near it, never mind touching it. Darren ignores all of this by listening to his Walkman and daydreaming of going on a motorcycle that his friend was using earlier in the beginning. On the way back from school, the boys see the friend's motorcycle. They come over until Darren sees his friend's ball is deflated, thus making Darren remember the football in the substation and takes Tom with him. Darren breaks through a fence while Tom keeps lookout. Darren runs up to the ball, and as Andy sees the deflated ball he realises that Darren has broken inside the substation to get the football. Darren throws the football but it gets him electrocuted. Tom runs in to help him but gets electrocuted as well, much to the horror of Andy and his friends. Later, the fire brigade, ambulances and the police arrive at the scene at night as Andy remembers Mr. Jones' lecture to the class about dangers of electricity followed by the song \"Yesterday's Men\" by Madness in the background along with the news report of the incident as Andy and his friends mourn for the deceased boys.\n\nParagraph 10: The Constitution of Medina, written shortly after hijra, addressed some points regarding the civil and religious situation for the Jewish communities living within the city from an Islamic perspective. For example, the constitution stated that the Jews \"will profess their religion, and the Muslims theirs\", and they \"shall be responsible for their expenditure, and the Muslims for theirs\". After the Battle of Badr, the Jewish tribe of Banu Qaynuqa breached treaties and agreements with Muhammad. Muhammad regarded this as casus belli and besieged the Banu Qaynuqa. Upon surrender the tribe was expelled. The following year saw the expulsion of the second tribe, the Banu Nadir, accused of planning to kill the prophet Muhammad. The third major Jewish tribe in Medina, Banu Qurayza was eliminated after  betraying the Muslims during the Battle of the Trench. However, there were many Jewish communities in Medina who continued to live in Medina peacefully after these events such as Banu Awf, Banu Harith, Banu Jusham Banu Alfageer, Banu Najjar, Banu Sa'ida, and Banu Shutayba.\n\nParagraph 11: On the July 3 SmackDown, Ziggler defeated Alex Riley to qualify for a spot in the World Heavyweight Championship Money in the Bank ladder match. On July 13, Ziggler, Zack Ryder and Justin Roberts were involved in a car accident in San Diego while driving from Comic-Con; none of them suffered severe injuries. Two days later at the Money in the Bank pay-per-view, Ziggler won the Money in the Bank ladder match to guarantee him the opportunity to challenge for the World Heavyweight Championship at a time of his choosing within the next year. Later that night, Ziggler attempted to cash in the briefcase on Sheamus after Alberto Del Rio attacked him after their match, but Del Rio stopped Ziggler from cashing in. On the following episode of SmackDown, Ziggler again attempted to cash in the briefcase on Sheamus following a tag team match with Del Rio, but was laid out by Rey Mysterio and Sheamus before he could do so. During this time, Ziggler began a feud with Chris Jericho after claiming he had lost his touch, which resulted in Jericho attacking him on two occasions, and defeating him in a singles match at SummerSlam on August 19. The night after SummerSlam, Ziggler defeated Jericho in a rematch; as a result Ziggler retained his Money in the Bank contract and Jericho's WWE contract was terminated. Following this, Ziggler began feuding with Randy Orton on SmackDown four days later, after Orton hit him with an RKO when Ziggler tried to cash his Money in the Bank contract on a vulnerable Sheamus. The following week on SmackDown, Ziggler faced Orton in a match that was won by Orton, Ziggler defeated him in a rematch on Raw by pinning him while holding his tights. Ziggler faced Orton again at Night of Champions on September 16 where he lost again, ending the feud. On November 18 at Survivor Series, Ziggler captained the traditional 5-on-5 elimination tag team match opposite Mick Foley and won the match by last pinning Orton, making him the sole survivor of the match.\n\nParagraph 12: Plesiosaurs showed two main morphological types. Some species, with the \"plesiosauromorph\" build, had (sometimes extremely) long necks and small heads; these were relatively slow and caught small sea animals. Other species, some of them reaching a length of up to seventeen metres, had the \"pliosauromorph\" build with a short neck and a large head; these were apex predators, fast hunters of large prey. The two types are related to the traditional strict division of the Plesiosauria into two suborders, the long-necked Plesiosauroidea and the short-neck Pliosauroidea. Modern research, however, indicates that several \"long-necked\" groups might have had some short-necked members or vice versa. Therefore, the purely descriptive terms \"plesiosauromorph\" and \"pliosauromorph\" have been introduced, which do not imply a direct relationship. \"Plesiosauroidea\" and \"Pliosauroidea\" today have a more limited meaning. The term \"plesiosaur\" is properly used to refer to the Plesiosauria as a whole, but informally it is sometimes meant to indicate only the long-necked forms, the old Plesiosauroidea.\n\nParagraph 13: The Canadian forces began their advance on Falaise, planning to meet up with the Americans with the goal of encircling and destroying most of the German forces in Normandy. The Hitlerjugend division was holding the northern point of what became known as the Falaise pocket. After several days of fighting Meyer's unit was reduced to about 1,500 men, whom he led in an attempt to break out of the pocket. Meyer described the conditions in the pocket in his memoirs: \"Concentrated in such a confined space, we offer unique targets for the enemy air power. [...] Death shadows us at every step\". Meyer was wounded during the fight with the 3rd Canadian Division, but escaped from the Falaise pocket with the division's rearguard. The remnants of the division joined the retreat across the Seine and into Belgium. On 27August, Meyer was awarded the Swords to the Knight's Cross with Oak Leaves and promoted to SS-Brigadeführer. He led his retreating unit as far as the Meuse, where he and his headquarters were ambushed by an American armoured column on 6September. The division's staff fled into a nearby village, where Meyer and his driver hid in a barn. A farmer discovered them, and informed the Belgian resistance. Meyer surrendered to local partisans, who handed him over to the Americans on 7September.\n\nParagraph 14: Born in Liverpool, he represented Everton at junior level before signing for Blackburn Rovers where he made his professional debut. He spent five seasons with the Lancashire club, playing for them in the Premier League, but was unable to hold a regular first team place. He was sold to Derby County in January 2007, became a regular starter for the team, but he struggled through injuries; In summer 2010 he was released. He subsequently spent two seasons each with Barnsley and Swindon Town before joining Sheffield United in 2014. During his career, McEveley also spent short spells on loan with a number of clubs; Burnley, Gillingham, Ipswich Town, Preston North End, Charlton Athletic and a brief spell at Swindon Town before his permanent switch.", "answers": ["Paragraph 1"], "length": 3490, "dataset": "passage_retrieval_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "721b6ef6b4641a7517d4228be3a141ddb2e698348da36083"}
{"input": "A bass reflex system is a type of loudspeaker design that has an opening called a port or vent, which allows air to move in and out of the enclosure. This opening resonates with the air inside the enclosure, similar to the way air in a bottle resonates when air flows across it.

In the past, speaker designers had to experiment to determine the ideal port diameter and length, but now there are computer programs available that can calculate these values. However, even with these programs, some experimentation with prototypes is still necessary to ensure good sound quality.", "context": "Paragraph 1: On a train bound for Bombay from Surat, a Police Inspector questions a young man named Farhaan, who has just obtained his law degree, for his reason to go to Bombay, and whether he has any alliance with Pakistanis. Farhaan answers that he is going to Bombay to live with his father, and he does not know anyone from Pakistan. Farhaan finds out that Bombay Police have been targeting the Muslim community, and in the name of fighting terrorism, have been killing innocent Muslim men, women and children. He discovers that Joint Commissioner of Police, Dev Pratap Singh, is involved in this witch-hunt, and he would like to kill him. Farhaan joins hands with the local Muslim political leader, Latif, and he is provided training in handling guns, and is subsequently made ready for this task. Unfortunately, Farhaan is unable to kill Dev, who escapes unhurt, albeit a little shaken. Chief Minister Bhandarkar views this incident seriously, and instructs the police to root out terrorist elements in the city, which they do so ruthlessly. Farhaan is told to deliver a package to a man near a Hindu temple, and he does so. While at a stop to buy some snacks, the package explodes, killing several people. Since this incident occurred near a Hindu temple, a right-wing political party member, Mangal Rao, organizes riots against the Muslim community. Riots take place, and the police are instructed to observe and not prevent the violence. As a result, hundreds are killed. Latif organizes his men to target and attack Hindus and Hindu establishments, rendering the region unsafe, with people being killed in the name of religion. When Hindus and Muslims have had enough, they publicly ask for peace, it is only then Latif and Mangal Rao agree on a truce, on the condition that no Muslim male, female or child will file a FIR (First Information Report) in any police station, to which Latif agrees. Latif then warns everyone in the Muslim community not to complain against anyone. Period. It is then Farhaan finds out that he has been treated as a pawn by Latif, and decides to trust Dev and become an informer.\n\nParagraph 2: Escape from Samsara - the name being a reference to the Hindu concept of Saṃsāra - held its first event at The Fridge on 15 September 1995. Formed from the club Megatripolis, they also held occasional events at the Brixton Academy & Bagleys in London; Spain, Morocco, Germany, Czech Republic, Egypt, Israel and Australia. The resident DJs at their events were Beamish and Oberon and there was usually a live performance by an electronic music artist or group, the most frequent appearances being by Cybernaut, Lab 4, The Secret and Audio Pancake. The upstairs balcony area was home to a market which sold fluoro clothing accessories, chai tea, etc. Also noteworthy is the admission and pricing policy where clubbers paid only £3 for entry (compared to the standard price of £10 or more) if they brought a \"drum or didge\", thus encouraging punters to contribute musically and supporting those who could not afford the full price.  Escape From Samsara then went on to run every Friday night for a number of years at The Fridge with DJs such at Rubec, Tim Samsara, Darren Shambhala, Chris Liberator, Mark EG, Blu Peter and Mark Sinclair all playing behind the decks.  Escape From Samsara became a world-renowned brand that was known for its extraordinary friendly ambience, non profit ethos, whacky performers, free bananas at the end of the night, stunning decorations, giant balloons, confetti drops and pyrotechnic shows. For many it was an introduction into an alternative lifestyle.\n\nParagraph 3: Unlike closed-box loudspeakers, which are nearly airtight, a bass reflex system has an opening called a port or vent cut into the cabinet, generally consisting of a pipe or duct (typically circular or rectangular cross section). The air mass in this opening resonates with the \"springiness\" of the air inside the enclosure in exactly the same fashion as the air in a bottle resonates when a current of air is directed across the opening. Another metaphor often used is to think of the air like a spring or rubber band. The frequency at which the box/port system resonates, known as the Helmholtz resonance, depends upon the effective length and cross sectional area of the duct, the internal volume of the enclosure, and the speed of sound in air. In the early years of ported speakers, speaker designers had to do extensive experimentation to determine the ideal diameter of the port and length of the port tube or pipe; however, more recently, there are numerous tables and computer programs that calculate, for a given size of cabinet, how large the port should be and how long the tube should be. Even with these programs, however, some experimentation with prototypes is still necessary to determine if the enclosure sounds good.\n\nParagraph 4: In 1946 Trans World Airlines (TWA) and Pennsylvania Central Airlines, the predecessor of Capital Airlines, served Williamsport; All American Aviation, the predecessor of Allegheny Airlines, joined them in 1949. In 1950 Capital Airlines was flying Douglas DC-3s to Baltimore, Buffalo, NY, Philadelphia, Rochester, NY and Washington D.C. National Airport. In 1961 Capital was merged into United Airlines which continued at Williamsport. In 1964 TWA Lockheed Constellations flew Boston - Albany, NY - Binghamton - Wilkes-Barre/Scranton - Williamsport - Pittsburgh - Columbus, OH - Indianapolis - St. Louis - Kansas City.  TWA left IPT in 1965. In early 1966 United Airlines Vickers Viscounts flew nonstop to Philadelphia, Harrisburg and Elmira and direct to New York Newark Airport, Washington National Airport and Buffalo.  United left the airport later in 1966; Allegheny continued nonstop flights to Erie, New York LaGuardia Airport, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Philipsburg, PA and Wilkes-Barre/Scranton and direct to Boston, Cleveland, Detroit, Dubois, PA, Hartford, CT, New York Newark Airport and Providence, RI operated with Convair 440s and Convair 580s. In the mid 1970s Allegheny BAC One-Elevens and McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30s flew nonstop to Binghamton, Ithaca and Pittsburgh and direct to Chicago O'Hare Airport, Cleveland, Dayton and Utica, NY Allegheny Commuter took over in 1979 with Beechcraft and Nord 262 flying nonstop from Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, New York Newark Airport, Harrisburg and Wilkes-Barre/Scranton, and was the only airline at the airport in fall 1979. Allegheny Commuter service continued for Allegheny successor USAir.  In early 1985 Allegheny Commuter had three weekday nonstops from Philadelphia and four weekday nonstops from Pittsburgh with Short 330s and Short 360s. In fall 1994 USAir Express, successor to Allegheny Commuter, flew Beechcraft 1900C and Short 360s to Philadelphia and BAe Jetstream 31s and Embraer EMB-120 Brasilias to Pittsburgh.  USAir changed its name to US Airways and in 2004 its affiliate US Airways Express ended flights to Pittsburgh International Airport. US Airways merged with American Airlines in 2015; in June 2016 American Eagle typically had three regional jet flights a day for American Airlines to its hub in Philadelphia. On August 18, 2020 American Eagle service was switched from Philadelphia to two daily flights to Charlotte, NC however all service ended on October 7, 2020. American Eagle resumed service on January 5, 2021 with one daily flight to Philadelphia however this flight ended on September 30, 2021.\n\nParagraph 5: William Irvine (November 3, 1741July 29, 1804) was an Irish-American physician, soldier, and statesman from Carlisle, Pennsylvania. He practiced medicine as a ship's surgeon for the Royal Navy before he sympathized with the American Revolution and fought against the British during the American Revolutionary War. As tensions escalated between the American colonies and the British government during the 1770s, Irvine sympathized and allied himself with the revolutionary cause. He subsequently served as a brigadier general in the American Revolutionary War and served in the western theater. After the war he served in the Continental Congress, and later played an active role in ending the Whiskey Rebellion in Pennsylvania. He also served one term in Congress representing Pennsylvania, and was also active in the state's other public affairs.\n\nParagraph 6: The concept of rationality in economics is essentially no different than the manner with which philosophers view practical rationality as it applies to other disciplines in which there exist models of sound judgment, inferencing, and decision-making. Rationality is thus understood as the process through which reasonable conclusions are reached on the basis of thoughtful consideration of demonstrable proof so that the optimal result may be achieved. The fundamental cost-benefit analysis is a typical manifestation of the rationalization process in that the calculated advantages or rewards received will demonstrably outweigh the incurred sacrifice required to obtain those gains. Where the term becomes complicated is the point at which rationality is presumed to label a decision as being successful or unsuccessful, when the reality is that rational decision-making refers to the actual process of making a choice and not the choice itself. When individuals decide what is the best course of action, they do so according to what they perceive is most beneficial and/or fulfilling to them, based on whatever data they have available for consideration. So long as the outcome is consistent with the reasons for electing to behave in that way, the decision is a rational one. The comic book collector who pays thousands of dollars for a collectible issue that completes a long-incomplete series in lieu of buying groceries for the family may not be making a wise choice or even a prudent decision. If this behavior is consistent with the collector's past choices and has been a stated long-term goal, however, then such behavior is nevertheless rational. Rationality is applicable to why a choice was made and what motivated that decision rather than being applied as an evaluative assessment of the choice itself.\n\nParagraph 7: The Wonders of the East is found in three manuscripts. It is in the Beowulf manuscript (also known as the Nowell Codex, London, British Library, Cotton Vitellius A. xv). It is written in Late West Saxon in a Mercian dialect. Other than Beowulf and The Wonders of the East, the other works in this codex include: The Passion of St. Christopher, The Letter of Alexander to Aristotle, and Judith. One scribe is believed to have copied The Passion of St. Christopher, The Letter of Alexander to Aristotle, The Wonders of the East, and first part of Beowulf, and another scribe wrote the remainder of Beowulf and Judith. While the first scribe, known as Scribe A used a more traditional square insular minuscule script, Scribe B uses a newer, round minuscule script. This has made it quite difficult to date the codex, as both scripts originate from slightly different periods of Anglo-Saxon society. The date of this manuscript is usually believed to be “within a couple of decades of A.D. 1000,” argued to be no earlier than AD 997 and no later than AD 1016, although other scholars have dated it to be from as early as the 8th century. The earliest known owner of the codex was antiquarian Laurence Nowell, who left his signature in the top margin of several pages from the manuscript. The manuscript is heavily damaged from the fire of Cotton Library in 1731 and so some parts of accompanying texts are missing. The codex may have been intentionally put together because four of the manuscripts discuss monsters. Furthermore, it is a “liber monstrorum, or book of marvels, designed for entertainment along with usual edification. Andy Orchard argues the monsters witnessed in The Wonders of the East are identifiable in other texts of the manuscript. The \"Donestre\", cannibal creatures who lure \"foreigners\" in with \"devious words\" before eating all but their heads. These monsters sit and \"weep over the head\", which scholars such as Orchard have used to show how the creature resembles Grendel's Mother from Beowulf. Orchard further argues that these monsters reflect those who do not conform to Anglo-Saxon norms, and are a construction of the \"other\". Christopher Monk discusses theories focused on the sexuality and femininity of the monsters found in The Wonders of the East. He claims these monsters are depictions of human sexuality, aided by the illuminations which accompany the prose. The Wonders of the East is the only text from the Nowell Codex to be illustrated or \"illuminated\" which some highlight as central to the monster studies applied to the manuscript. Orchard argues that the text is a \"liber monstorum\" or \"book of monsters\" and illustrations aid the reader in studying the creatures described in the prose. Other creatures encountered include the snakes, which may stand for dragon. These creatures are said to have \"horns as large as rams\" and anyone who \"strikes them or touches them\" will die and the area around them \"set ablaze\". Another creature called a \"conopenae\", said to have the head of a dog which some scholars have argued links with Saint Christopher from an earlier text, who may have had the head of a dog according to legend.\n\nParagraph 8: The second avenue of promotion from rating to commissioned officer was to the Special Duties (SD) List.  Petty officers and chief petty officers could, with the approval of their commanding officer, become a CW candidate (an 'SD candidate') and such supply branch senior ratings were similarly specially reported on with a view to promotion to officer, generally between the ages of 28 and 35, though most were in their early 30s when promoted to acting sub-lieutenant on the Special Duties List.  Unlike GL and SL (see below) officers, SD officers retained their former rating branch specialisation; for example the supply officer (cash) of a large warship or shore establishment would typically be a lieutenant (SD)(S)(W), the (W) indicating that he is a commissioned officer from the Writer branch of ratings.  SD officers were, of course, promoted from all supply branches – writer (W), stores assistant/accountant (S) or (V), cook (CK), officer's steward/steward or caterer (CA).  Once confirmed as a sub-lieutenant, an SD officer was promoted lieutenant after three years; promotion to lieutenant-commander (SD) was by selection and, from these, a very small number were promoted to commander from 1966 onwards.  Retirement was generally compulsory at age 50.  A few SD officers were further selected for transfer to the General List, seniority being adjusted on transfer, so as to level the promotion opportunities (generally these officers were earmarked as likely to reach the rank of commander).  In the 1970s, to make up for certain branch shortages, some chief petty officers, age over 35, from the supply branch were selected and promoted temporary acting sub-lieutenant (SD), a few of whom were later promoted to temporary lieutenant (SD).  By the 1980s, supply officers were no longer necessarily being appointed according to the List they were on (GL, SD or SL); it was not uncommon to find, in different ships in the same squadron or flotilla, a pusser in supply charge from each List.\n\nParagraph 9: PA 441 crosses the Conewago Creek into Londonderry Township in Dauphin County and continues north between farmland and some woods to the east and the Norfolk Southern Royalton Branch and the Susquehanna River to the west. The route passes to the east of Three Mile Island, which is the location of the former Three Mile Island Nuclear Generating Station, the site of a partial nuclear meltdown in 1979. Past the former nuclear power plant, the road curves northwest and then north as it runs through wooded areas of homes with the river and railroad tracks to the west of the road. PA 441 crosses the Royalton Branch at-grade and enters the borough of Royalton, heading northwest through residential areas along Canal Street. The route becomes parallel to Amtrak's Keystone Corridor railroad line to the east and crosses the Swatara Creek into the borough of Middletown. Here, PA 441 follows Ann Street northwest and intersects South Union Street, passing through residential areas. The road curves north and comes to a bridge over Norfolk Southern's Royalton Branch, Amtrak's Keystone Corridor, and the Middletown and Hummelstown Railroad at the Middletown station serving the Amtrak line before it reaches an intersection with PA 230. At this point, PA 441 turns east to form a concurrency with PA 230 along West Main Street, a three-lane road with a center left-turn lane, running along the border between Lower Swatara Township to the north and Middletown to the south. The road passes north of the Middletown station along Amtrak's Keystone Corridor before it heads northeast away from the railroad tracks and fully enters Middletown. PA 230/PA 441 passes businesses before running through residential areas as a two-lane road. PA 441 splits from PA 230 by turning north onto North Union Street. The route passes more homes and heads to the east of a cemetery, becoming the border between Lower Swatara Township to the west and the borough of Middletown to the east as it continues north and comes to a bridge over the Pennsylvania Turnpike (I-76).\n\nParagraph 10: If an external magnetic field is applied horizontally, so that it crosses the flow of electrons (in the wire conductor, or in the electron beam), the two magnetic fields will interact. Michael Faraday introduced a visual analogy for this, in the form of imaginary magnetic lines of force: those in the conductor form concentric circles round the conductor; those in the externally applied magnetic field run in parallel lines. If those on one side of the conductor are running (from the north to south magnetic pole) in the opposite direction to those surrounding the conductor, they will be deflected so that they pass on the other side the conductor (because magnetic lines of force cannot cross or run contrary to each other). Consequently, there will be a large number of magnetic field lines in a small space on that side of the conductor, and a dearth of them on the original side of the conductor. Since the magnetic field lines of force are no longer straight lines, but curved to run around the electrical conductor, they are under tension (like stretched elastic bands), with energy bound up in the magnetic field. Since this energetic field is now mostly unopposed, its build-up or expulsion in one direction creates — in a manner analogous to Newton's third law of motion — a force in the opposite direction. Since there is only one moveable object in this system (the electrical conductor) for this force to work upon, the net effect is a physical force working to expel the electrical conductor out of the externally applied magnetic field in the direction opposite to that which the magnetic flux is being redirected to — in this case (motors), if the conductor is carrying conventional current upwards, and the external magnetic field is moving away from the viewer, the physical force will work to push the conductor to the left. This is the reason for torque in an electric motor. (The electric motor is then constructed so that the expulsion of the conductor out of the magnetic field causes it be placed inside the next magnetic field, and for this switching to be continued indefinitely.)", "answers": ["Paragraph 3"], "length": 3315, "dataset": "passage_retrieval_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "871d9417ba06b98b501a20f626a0744f6ba0713376630258"}

In April 1905, for example, Seyfarth attended his first meeting as a member of the Chicago Architectural Club, which had been founded in 1885 as the Chicago Architectural Sketch Club by James H. Carpenter, a prominent Chicago draftsman, with the support of the magazine Inland Architect, whose first issue had been published in February 1883.  The club was formed in Chicago during a period when architecture there was in its ascendancy - after the Great Fire of 1871 a large population of some of the country's best architectural talent had come to rebuild a modern city using the most advanced and progressive techniques of the day.  Even so, the community was taxed trying to perform all of the work that was necessary to keep up with the task. Chicago was developing at a rate that astounded anyone who was paying attention to its growth, such that \"one unfamiliar with the city would find ... fresh subject for astonishment, daily, in [its] ever-changing and ever-extending boundary lines.\" As the Chicago architect John Wellborn Root recalled years later: \"The conditions attending the development of architecture in the West have been, in almost every respect, without precedent. At no time in the history of the world has a community covering such vast and yet homogeneous territory developed with such amazing rapidity, and under conditions of civilization so far advanced. Few times in history have ever presented so impressive a sight as this resistless wave of progress, its farthermost verge crushing down primeval obstacles in nature and desperate resistance from the inhabitants; its deeper and calmer waters teeming with life and full of promise more significant than has ever yet been known.\"The club was an effort to help develop the talents of the city's many draftsmen so that they could become qualified architects themselves, at a time when a formal education for architects was generally unavailable and not required.  (The first architectural school in the United States was founded by architect William Robert Ware at MIT in 1868 with nine students, and even by 1896, the year after Seyfarth's graduation, there were only nine schools in the country with a combined student body of 273.)  Seyfarth joined during the time he worked for Maher, who over the years was an active member of the club as a speaker, writer, exhibitor and judge in its annual competitions.  Seyfarth is known to have entered his work at two of these exhibitions  - the first time in 1903 (before he became a member), when his submission was listed as a \"Library\", and again in 1905, where the subject of the entry was his own house in Blue Island. The preface to the catalogue of the 1905 exhibition was devoted to what the noted architect Elmer Grey (1872–1963) called \"Inventive and Indigeonous Architecture\", a phrase which perfectly reflected Seyfarth's design for this particular house and may have been one of the reasons why images of it were included.\n\nParagraph 3: On the war god's interplanetary base on the planet Mars, the Duke of Deception operates the Lie Factory, which uses slaves, spirits from different planets such as Earth and Saturn that inhabit bodies, to craft deceptions for a variety of stratagems. Other slaves are used for gladiator conflicts. When Wonder Woman's astral form traveled to Mars to rescue Steve Trevor, the Duke of Deception recognized her and revealed her identity to Mars after she won in the arena. He gave advice to Mars to pretend not to know who she was to trap her. However, Wonder Woman was able to rescue Steve, overcome Mars and his soldiers, and escape to Earth. The Duke of Deception was the second of Mars' lieutenants sent to capture Wonder Woman, refusing at first as he said his servants were writing propaganda for the Nazis and Japanese and he could not capture Wonder Woman without their help. Wonder Woman was captured by an agent of his, Naha, with her magic lasso after being given a fake lasso. She was taken onto a ship, where she was left bound hand and foot, along with being gagged and blindfolded with plaster. Wonder Woman was able to escape with the help of Etta Candy, who she telepathically contacted. The Duke of Deception tried to convince Hirohito to cause more war in Hawaii by disguising himself as a General, but Wonder Woman foiled his plan to cause further war with the help of Etta Candy and sent his phantom form fleeing back to Mars in the form of a slave girl. He was then imprisoned by Mars, his imprisonment causing Hirohito to speak truthfully to the Italian Ambassador. The Duke of Deception was released when Wonder Woman was brought back in chains by the Count of Conquest. The Duke of Deception enlists the aid of the women-hating Doctor Psycho after finding women are being used in the War Effort, hoping to continue the practice of inequality. After repeated failures, Mars strips him of his mighty appearance, leaving him a weak, toothless man. He was imprisoned with the female slaves, but convinced them to rebel and briefly ruled Mars, imprisoning the god Mars. He took over the Moon and was able to drug the goddess Diana, but was defeated by Wonder Woman.\n\nParagraph 4: During the trip, d'Artagnan fights off repeated attacks by Febre's henchmen. He and Francesca become intimate, only to have Febre discover them and kidnap her and the queen. Febre forces the queen to write a letter to Buckingham asking him to meet her at a heavily fortified castle of his choosing, using the queen's ring to convince him of the authenticity of the message. Richelieu finally realizes just how far Febre is willing to go: he means to start a war between France, England and Spain, a war that will cripple France. Knowing that he has lost control of his chief henchman, Richelieu secretly visits d'Artagnan and tells him of Febre's plans and pleads for his help to stop Febre. D'Artagnan agrees, but only because Febre is holding Francesca. D'Artagnan returns to Paris and convinces the surviving musketeers that their responsibility to the crown remains their highest priority, and they join him at the castle where Francesca, the queen, and Lord Buckingham are being held. They charge the castle on horseback, losing several of their number in the process, but the diversion they create allows Planchet to drive his carriage in front of the castle gates below the field of cannon fire from the castle. This enables him to fire a mortar directly into the castle gates.\n\nParagraph 5: Most Rev. Joseph Osei-Bonsu was born on 8 February 1948 in Jamasi, Ashanti. He studied at the St. Teresa's Minor Seminary at Amisano from 1962 to 1969. In 1969 he entered the St. Peter's Regional Seminary, Pedu, Cape Coast, from where he proceeded in 1970 to Ushaw College, a Catholic Major Seminary in Durham, England, to continue his training for the priesthood. While at Ushaw College he obtained a B.A. (Hons) in Theology at the University of Durham in 1974. On completion of his studies at Ushaw College in 1975, he returned to Ghana and was ordained a priest at the St. Peter's Cathedral, Kumasi, on 3 August 1975 by the Most Rev. Peter Kwasi Sarpong. He worked at the St. Mary's Church, South Suntreso, Kumasi, for one year as an Assistant Parish Priest. During this time he looked after 49 outstations of the St. Mary's Parish. In September 1976 he went for further studies in the United Kingdom. He obtained a Ph.D in New Testament Exegesis at the University of Aberdeen, Scotland, in December 1980. In April 1981 he was appointed lecturer in the Department for the Study of Religions, University of Ghana, Legon, where he taught New Testament Studies, New Testament Greek and Early Church History. From October 1992 to January 1995 he was the Head of the Department for the Study of Religions, University of Ghana. He also taught New Testament at St. Paul's Seminary, Sowutuom, Accra, on a part-time basis. In 1992 he was appointed by the Pope to be a member of the International Theological Commission based in Rome. He held this post until October 1997. Pastorally he worked as Chaplain to the Catholic community at the University of Ghana and at Kwabenya from 1981 to 1995. For over ten years he was the National Chaplain of the International Movement of Catholic Students (Pax Romana), Ghana Federation. Apart from a year's sabbatical at St. John's University, Collegeville, Minnesota, U.S.A., in 1987-1988, he worked at the University of Ghana from April 1981 till January, 1995. Granted a year's sabbatical leave by the University of Ghana in January 1995, he went to Rome lecture in New Testament Exegesis at the Pontifical Beda College, a seminary for late vocation students. While he was at the Pontifical Beda College, he was appointed the first Bishop of the newly-erected Diocese of Konongo-Mampong on 17 March 1995. He was ordained bishop on 28 May 1995 along with four others in Accra. He was installed the first bishop of the Konongo-Mampong Diocese on 11 June 1995.

She was subsequently transferred from Long Island to Cabo Rojo per request of Ponce's Bishop. Upon arriving, she was received by a procession. As part of this mission, She and the nuns organized baseball teams and sewing schools. She continued working in this convent for 11 years, until she was promoted to abbess. As Mother Superior, Ferré remained in Cabo Rojo for six more years, which is the time limit that a Mother Superior can work within the a mission before receiving another assignment. She was then sent to Hato Rey, where she was assigned to a religious school. Here she replaced part of the institution's materials with new ones, using part of a savings account created by the previous directory. Shortly after she contracted Sepsis, and was removed from the position. Some time later Ferré traveled to the Bronx, where several of the nuns that studied with her in Philadelphia resided. This congregation focused their attention in discouraging street crime. One day, Ferré was forced to dress a gang member in nun's clothing, to confuse the members of a rival gang. Due to her actions, she was promoted to abbess of the convent. She led the other nuns in an effort to revitalize the city's landscape. New York's governor Nelson Rockefeller, awarded her the city's \"Republican Woman\" recognition. The community elected her as their official representative in New York's \"Committee Against Poverty\", but she declined the offer and granted the position to another Puerto Rican resident. She did this because Mayor John Lindsay had previously appointed her as his personal representative. Ferré focused her work in promoting education among street gangs. The convent, interested in promoting community acceptance regardless of religion, was originally called \"Dr. White Catholic Center\" was renamed \"Dr. White Center\". During this timeframe she continued her education, briefly attending Holly Family College and completing her bachelor's degree at St. Joseph's College for Women. After a stint as a teacher in Philadelphia, she was sent back to New York in order to complete and further her studies. Ferré completed a sociology master's degree at Fordham University, submitting a thesis based in the strengths and weaknesses of Puerto Rican families that faced conditions of discrimination and poverty after migrating to the city. Her final work in the United States took place in Chicago, where she coached a group of Puerto Rican community leaders.\n\nParagraph 7: De Witt was appointed in 1807 by the state legislature, at the request of the New York City Common Council, to a three-man commission which was to determine how the city's future streets would be laid out.  Frustrated by opposition from landowners, who wanted to determine for themselves where streets would go as they developed their properties, and interference from various political factions, the Council had called on the state for assistance.  The Commission was given \"exclusive power to lay out streets, roads, and public squares, of such width, extent, and direction, as to them shall seem most conducive to public good, and to shut up, or direct to be shut up, any streets or parts thereof which have been heretofore laid out... [but] not accepted by the Common Council.\"  The commissioners were authorized to be paid $4 a day for their work () – although De Witt was the only one who was actually compensated; the other two commissioners, Gouvernor Morris and John Rutherfurd, were rich men and waived their fees.  De Witt, however, also wanted additional compensation for the days he spent traveling from his home in Albany to New York City, and for Sundays he was required, because of Commission business, to stay in the city; he was reluctantly given travel payment, but was refused additional payment for his Sundays in New York City.\n\nParagraph 8: In the congressional elections of 1830 Jenifer was elected in the first constituency of Maryland in the US House of Representatives in Washington, DC, where he succeeded on 4 March 1831, the successor to Clement Dorsey. Since he was not re-elected in 1832, he was initially only able to complete only one term in Congress until March 3, 1833. This was marked by discussions about the policies of President Andrew Jackson. In these years, the Nullification Crisis reached its peak with the state of South Carolina. In 1834 Jenifer was re-elected to Congress in the seventh district of his state, where he was able to complete three more legislative periods between March 4, 1835, and March 3, 1841. There he experienced until 1837 the final phase of the term of President Jackson.\n\nParagraph 9: Creative Assembly was founded in 1987 by Tim Ansell. Ansell had begun professional computer programming in 1985, working on video games for the Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64, and Atari 8-bit family. Initially, Ansell kept the company small so he could personally work on computer programming. The company's early work, often produced personally by Ansell, involved porting games from the Amiga platform to DOS, such as the 1989 titles Geoff Crammond's Stunt Car Racer and Shadow of the Beast by Psygnosis. Creative Assembly began work with Electronic Arts in 1993, producing titles under the EA Sports label, starting with the DOS version of the early FIFA games. With EA Sports,  Creative Assembly was able to produce low development risk products bearing official league endorsements. The company's products included Rugby World Cup titles for 1995 and 2001, the game for the 1999 Cricket World Cup and the Australian Football League games for 1998 and 1999, of which the AFL 98 title was particularly successful in the Australian market. When it became clear that the company needed to expand further, Ansell employed Michael Simpson in 1996 as creative director. Simpson, a microchip designer turned video game designer, later became the driving force for the creative design of the Total War series. Ansell left Creative Assembly after Sega acquired the developer in 2005, later on, Tim Heaton took over as studio director.\n\nParagraph 10: Greg of PunkNews.org writes that \"Compared to the first Acoustic split, Vol. 2 is more slick sounding, but not in a bad way\", replacing the first album's synth strings with real stringed instruments and digital keyboards with an acoustic piano, making the album \"sound more lush, but never overdone.\" Cape's half of the album includes \"Resolve\" which \"translates pretty well to the acoustic and slower tempo, also including some tasteful tremolo electric [guitar] and something that may be an electric with an ebow. But you're really in for a treat after the tempo change, when it gets downright bluegrass, giving a whole new life to the song, perhaps signifying Joey coming to terms with his friend's death seven years later\"; \"I Must Be Hateful\" which involves \"beautiful fingerpicking and light padding keys, gelling well with Joey's voice\"; \"Know It All\" which \"sounds odd in particular coming from a 40-something instead of a 20-something\" but is \"still a fantastic melody and works well here outside of perhaps the lyrics\"; and \"Broken Record\", an original song to this album \"with simply guitar and Joey's voice\" which is \"very intimate and effective, only building to more aggressive strumming.\" While Greg prefers Cape's songwriting, he says that Sly's arrangements do \"a more thoughtful job of fleshing out his half.\" His half of the album includes \"Black Box\", by which Greg was \"won over by the chorus melody, and the cello, piano, guitar and accordion work[ing] together tastefully without being busy\"; \"Soulmate\", which Sly keeps \"peppy, thank goodness, preserving the bounce with the acoustic providing the backbeat and shaker giving the downbeat\" and which includes a bass that \"even has a punk tone, as chunky piano chords keep a spring in the song's step\"; \"Chasing Rainbows\" \"with its Johnny Cash train-chugging drums, more accordion, and a nice acoustic slide solo\"; \"Pre-Medicated Murder\" which \"doesn't do much for me as a song, but the arrangement is interesting with more accordion and organ chording\"; and \"Liver Let Die\", \"a drunken pub-singalong that works nicely to close out the album.\" The album was \"obviously ... crafted for die-hard fans\" of the two artists, \"though I could see it being used as an 'in' with people unfamiliar with them\", and is \"a big improvement in sonics over the first edition, but like the first, is a very enjoyable listen for old fans such as myself. It's a bit of a nostalgia trip, and surely it was for these two men as well.\"\n\nParagraph 11: In 1969, the same year Mo Siegel and friends collected the herbs in the Colorado Rocky Mountains that would be sold in health food stores and eventually become Celestial Seasonings, Siegel read The Urantia Book, which is a spiritual, philosophical, and religious book that originated in Chicago sometime between 1924 and 1955. The authorship is the subject of speculation, as it is written as if directly from one or more celestial beings. The text was published by the Urantia Foundation in 1955, which provides for the dissemination of The Urantia Book and aims to ensure the text remains unaltered. Mo Siegel currently serves as the President of the Urantia Foundation, and he has said that the morals of the Celestial Seasonings company and the quotes printed on the tea packaging were based on the beliefs and practices of The Urantia Book.", "answers": ["Paragraph 1"], "length": 3428, "dataset": "passage_retrieval_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "707ae2fed6a206720c3afb70facc02c376eeca4fd6859740"}
{"input": "The Cahora Bassa dam in Mozambique was constructed by the Portuguese colonial government in 1969 and filled in 1974. Native people protested against the dam as it required them to give up their land. During the Mozambican Civil War, the power transmission lines were sabotaged, causing disruptions. The lake created by the dam flooded a large area and is mostly owned by the Portuguese government. The dam was built to provide electricity to South Africa, causing hardships for the displaced natives. The region has also seen a decrease in rainfall, which may lead to the shutdown of some or all of the turbines, affecting energy supply to South Africa. During the shutdown, alternative methods like using accumulators or pumping water into a reservoir are employed to generate electricity.", "context": "Paragraph 1: The Eagles finished second in the Okanagan-Shushwap Division for the 2003-04 season, with a record of 31-12-4-3, losing in the Division finals to Osoyoos. They lost in the first round the following season to Revelstoke. But in 2005-06, the Eagles won the league title for a third time, defeating Beaver Valley in the final again. The Eagles have yet to win another league title. The 2006-07 Eagles suffered a considerable drop in form, finishing fourth in the Okanagan-Shushwap Division, and losing in the first round to the Kamloops Storm. The following year, the divisions of the KIJHL were re-organized, and the Eagles were moved to the Eddie Mountain Conference, East Division. They finished second in their division, but lost in the Division finals to the Revelstoke Grizzlies. In 2008-09, the league was again re-sorted, and the Eagles finished second in the new Okanagan Division. They would lose in the first round to Kamloops. The following season, they finished third in the Okanagan Division, before losing in the second round to the Princeton Posse. In 2010-11, the Eagles were sorted into the new Doug Birks Division, and finished third again, losing to Kamloops in the first round. The following season, the Eagles would finish fourth in their division, and lost in the second round to the Kelowna Chiefs. In 2012-13, the Eagles improved to second in the Doug Birks Division, losing to the North Okanagan Knights in the Division final. 2013-14 saw the Eagles drop to fourth in the Division again, losing 4-1 in the opening round to the Kamloops Storm. The next season would see an identical result, with the Eagles fourth and losing 4-1 to Kamloops, and this marked the first time in franchise history that the Eagles lost in the first round of the playoffs in two consecutive years. Another franchise low occurred in 2015-16, as the Eagles missed the playoffs for the first time in their history, compiling a 10-34-2-6 record, fifth in the Doug Birks Division.\n\nParagraph 2: The population of Lansingburgh is composed largely of persons whose business is located in Troy, but the village sustains several manufacturing concerns which contribute greatly to its wealth and prosperity. Even while Troy was yet a comparatively small village Lansingburgh enjoyed an immense trade with Vermont and Northern New York in grain, beef, pork, butter, cheese and other produce. There were many commission merchants or \"middle-men\" in the village. In the beginning of the 19th century there were at least a dozen warehouses on River street for storing grain. Lansingburgh was then the centre of a great grain trade, buying of the farmers for many miles around and selling at Albany, New York and other cities. About 1825, and even before that date, there were several leather tanneries in operation in the village. Frederick Forsyth, Keating Rawson, Cornelius Lansing, Asa Burt and William Guest owned the most important of these. There were also a number of slaughter and packing houses, among them being those of Ives & Wilson, Tobias Loring, Noel Atwood and Thomas Turner. Before the year 1800 there were four or five \"ship yards\" in town, where sailing vessels for navigation on the Hudson were made. Armington & Hawkins and John Stilson were prominent in this line. The oilcloth industry has been a prominent one for many years. Reference to the factory of D. Powers's Sons has been made in preceding pages. P. C. Davenport, Jonathan E. Whipple and Ferrin engaged in the business at an early day. Caswell's rifle factory began business about 1812 or 1813. Twentyfive men were employed for many years in the three shops. Brush manufacturing was also an early industry, David McMurray being the pioneer in the business. All of his five sons-William, John G., Robert, David and Moses-were engaged in the same business. Large numbers of persons were employed in the various works for many years.\n\nParagraph 3: Romani dishes are usually made hot and spicy with the use of spices, such as paprika, garlic and bell peppers. Potatoes are also a staple in their diet. A traditional Romani dessert is pirogo, which is similar to Jewish kugel. The recipe consists of eggs, raisins, walnuts, pineapple, sugar, butter, egg noodles and cottage cheese. Another traditional dish cooked by Romani people is sarma, salmaia or sodmay, which is made from cabbage stuffed with meat and rice. Romani people consume dishes consisting of stuffed peppers, especially on holidays and special occasions. Romani people also cook pufe (made from fried flour), xaritsa (fried cornbread), bogacha (baked bread) and xaimoko (a meal consisting of rabbit meat). They serve their meals with kafa (coffee) and chao (tea) with sugar and milk or fruits such as strawberries, peach slices, apple slices, or lemon. The Roma believe some foods are auspicious and give luck (baxt). American Roma believe red pepper, black pepper, salt, vinegar, garlic, onions and a sacrificed animal such a lamb to be lucky foods. In Maribor, Slovenia, there is a Romani restaurant called Romani Kafenava. Some itinerant European Romani people cook hedgehog stew. Game animals and birds such as rabbits, hares, quails and partridge are consumed by the Roma. Snails are also consumed. Snail soup and pig stomach are Romani delicacies. Bread form an essential part of any meal. Romani food is cooked outdoors in cauldrons atop a wooden flame. Romani cuisine is also, often of necessity, inexpensive and cheap to prepare and uses portable ingredients. Thus, beef and pork are rare inclusions, while chicken and lamb and goat or wild birds and game are the preferred proteins by the Roma. Potato, peppers, cabbage and rice are often the building blocks in Romani cuisine. Rabbit stew is made with rabbit meat, innards, bacon and onions. The Roma consume roasted apples, almond cakes, clay-baked hedgehog and trout, snails in broth, and fig cakes as a snack. Baked hedgehog is flavored with garlic. The hedgehog dish is called hotchi-witchi or niglo, in Romani.  The hedgehog is wrapped in clay and placed on white-hot stones. When the roasting is done, the prickles attached to the clay are pulled off and the hedgehog dish is served wrapped in leaves. Horse meat is forbidden. Cat meat and dog meat are also forbidden. Frog meat and snake meat are considered unlucky by the Roma and are associated with the Devil. Peacock meat is forbidden. The Roma associate peacocks with the evil eye. The Roma tend to not eat at restaurants and avoid food prepared by non-Roma.\n\nParagraph 4: Hardy's time in the legislature was brief.  He was absent from the province for much of 1970, and was hired as the assistant city manager for Terrance, British Columbia late in the year.  Some described his behaviour during this time as erratic.  He was quoted as saying, \"I have to earn a living, and in Manitoba -- it is totally impossible for a politician to do it solely in politics.\"  He left Manitoba in December 1970, and formally resigned his seat in the legislature on February 16, 1971.  In the 1973 provincial election, he endorsed Liberal candidate Dan Kennedy.\n\nParagraph 5: The dam began to fill in December 1974 after construction was commenced in 1969 by the Portuguese colonial government of Mozambique (Portugal), and is  high by  wide at the crest. Before the Cahora Bassa dam underwent construction, the native people protested the dam in order to keep their land. Built in the first half of the 1970s when Mozambique was still a Portuguese territory, long stretches of the power transmission lines were sabotaged during 16 years of Mozambican Civil War which ended in 1992. The lake has reached a maximum length and width of approximately  and  respectively, flooding an area of  with an average depth of .  Today, the Portuguese government owns eighty-two percent of the Cahora Bassa Lake and the Cahora Bassa dam while the Mozambique government owns the remaining 18 percent. When given the order to begin construction in 1969, the colonial government of Portugal forced the native people out of their homes and villages in order for the Portuguese and European workers to have a place to live during construction. The Cahora Bassa dam was built in order for more power to go to South Africa. The Portuguese government built a small town for all the contractors, electricians, and engineers on top of the native Mozambique homes. The evicted native people were not given compensation for their loss of property. The dam was built to produce electricity for South African farms, mines, and cities. Since the dam transfers the electricity that it creates to South Africa, it is taking electricity away from the natives that were able to keep some of their land. The natives now struggle for electricity and a regular supply of clean drinking water. Before 2010, the average annual rainfall was thirty-seven inches. This has been decreasing ever since and in 2016, the average annual rainfall was twenty-five inches.  If this average continues to fall, the dam operators may have to shut off the flow to some or even all the turbines. Doing so will conserve the water and energy until the reservoir is full enough to allow water to spin the turbines and create more electricity. Having some or all turbines will cause parts of South Africa to lose energy. During the plant shutdown, Songo and Apollo will have a fraction of the energy coming into the converter stations. These places will still be able to use electricity due to the energy that has been stored in a device called an accumulator or by using the pumping method. This method is done by pumping water into a reservoir and letting it go through a turbine when energy is needed..\n\nParagraph 6: Critical reaction to Phantom Phorce was generally positive with Uncut stating that the album features an \"inspired overhaul\" of tracks from Phantom Power, the Western Mail describing the record as a \"mind-bending collection that radically re-works each track from the original record to create something entirely different, but equally appealing\" and musicOMH calling it \"an innovative and thoroughly enjoyable set of remixes\". Some reviews pointed out that the album compares favourably with other remix albums with The Guardian calling Phantom Phorce \"stimulating and often rather beautiful, bucking the trend set by most other self-indulgent and pointless remix albums\" and the NME stating that \"hearing a rock band get the remix treatment is usually a mildly diverting experience rather than a life-changing one. So it's an extremely pleasant surprise to be faced with a whole album of the buggers ... and be thoroughly entertained.\" Q stated that the commentary by 'Kurt Stern' was one of the best features of the album and The Times expressed surprise that these \"'amusing interludes' between tracks are actually funny\", however Pitchfork Media found that 'Stern' \"gets in the way more than he helps\" and claimed that, by the time the listener had heard the full album he or she would \"likely consider redubbing it without ['Stern's'] contributions\". Reviewing Phantom Phorce for DiSCORDER magazine, Jordie Yow called it \"good, but not exceptional\" and claimed that the remixes simply made him want to listen to the original versions of the tracks while website Angry Ape was scathing, calling the album a \"bland & uninspiring package to put you off remixes for life\" and suggested that it was merely a \"cash-in\" by the band.\n\nParagraph 7: President Paul Deschanel's massive margin of victory in the presidential election of 17 January 1920 was almost without precedent.   Behind the scenes all was not well, however.   At 23.15 on 23 May 1920, travelling on the presidential train to Montbrison, where he was scheduled to unveil a statue to a war hero the next day, the president felt short of breath.   He got out of bed, went to the carriage window which he opened wide, leaned out and fell through it.   The train had reached a section of track that was being repaired, and was therefore travelling at only around 50 km/h (30 mph):  Deschanel was shaken by the fall, but his physical injuries were only superficial.   André Radeau, the railway worker responsible for the stretch of track beside which he had landed, viewed with scepticism the assertion of this elderly confused gentleman in pyjamas that he was the President of France.   Assuming that he had found a lost drunkard who had strayed from the usual path home, Radeau took the man to the home nearby of Gustave Dariot, the level-crossing keeper, who was impressed by Deschanel's dignified bearing and the coherence of his explanations:  the president was put lie down in order that he might, during what remained of the night, recover from his ordeal.   The wife of the level crossing keeper could see that their guest was no run-of-the-mill lost soul.   The pyjamas the old man wore were of good quality and, as she later explained to journalists, \"I could see that he was a proper gentleman:  he had clean feet!\"   Early next morning train staff noticed that the president was missing.   A presidential reception committee headed up by Interior Minister Théodore Steeg endured a long wait without news on the platform at Roanne station.   Eventually a message arrived from the local sub-prefect at Montargis, close to where the president's mishap had taken place, explaining in outline what had happened.   A few hours later it was the president himself who telephoned the Élysée Palace with the necessary reassurances.   Two days after that, Paul Deschanel presided in person at a cabinet meeting.   The government issued a statement seeking to play down the incident.   Nevertheless, the story proved irresistible: press coverage was extensive.  Printed cartoons and hastily adapted popular songs in the music halls were far from respectful.\n\nParagraph 8: The label established Riley as one of the major country female vocalists of the late 1960s and early 1970s with a string of hits for the label and also topping the Billboard country album chart with the Harper Valley PTA album. Grand Ole Opry star Ray Pillow had light success on the label with one top 40 country hit in 1969. David Allan Coe's first two albums were on the Plantation label; Penitentiary Blues and Requiem for a Harlequin, before moving on to a major recording career at Columbia Records. Linda Martell became the first African-American female vocalist to record specifically for the country market, enjoying two top 40 country hits on Plantation in 1969–70 including the second hit version of \"Before The Next Teardrop Falls\" which peaked at No. 33. Martell later left the label citing her belief that Singleton's choosing of the name Plantation Records was racist (although he denied this) and his decision to focus on Riley's career at the expense of hers. Additionally, she explained that, when she attempted to sign to other record labels, something that was permitted as she had fulfilled her one year contract with Plantation, Singleton threatened to sue the record companies, causing her to be blackballed from country music and forcing her into complete retirement from the music industry. Other artists on Plantation included Harlow Wilcox and Dee Mullins.\n\nParagraph 9: Champsosaurus was the first member of the Choristodera to be described. Champsosaurus was named by Edward Drinker Cope in 1876, from isolated vertebrae found in Late Cretaceous strata of the Judith River Formation on the banks of the Judith River in Fergus County, Montana. Cope designated C. annectens as the type species rather than the first named C. profundus due to the larger number of vertebrae he attributed to the species. C. annectens was based on 9 isolated vertebral centra (AMNH FR 5696) that were not figured in the paper of which two are now lost. Cope named several other species between 1876 and 1882, also based on isolated vertebrae. Barnum Brown in 1905 described the first complete remains of Champsosaurus, and noted that one of the species attributed to Champsosaurus by Cope in 1876, C. vaccinsulensis actually represented indeterminate plesiosaur remains, and that the vertebrae that Cope used to diagnose his species of Champsosaurus were heavily eroded and the diagnostic features varied substantially along the spinal column, and were not diagnostic to species level, including the remains that Cope attributed to the type species C. annectens. The conclusion that C. annectens was undiagnostic was supported by William Parks in 1933.\n\nParagraph 10: Many Arab-Jewish immigrants have settled in New York City and formed a Sephardi community. The community is centered in Brooklyn and is primarily composed of Syrian Jews. Other Arab Jews in New York City hail from Egypt, Israel, Lebanon, and Morocco. Arab Jews first began arriving in New York City in large numbers between 1880 and 1924. Most Arab immigrants during these years were Christian, while Arab Jews were a minority and Arab Muslims largely began migrating during the mid-1960s. When Syrian Jews first began to arrive in New York City during the late 1800s and early 1900s, Eastern European Ashkenazi Jews on the Lower East Side sometimes disdained their Syrian co-coreligionists as Arabische Yidden, Yiddish for \"Arab Jews\". Some Ashkenazim doubted whether Sephardi/Mizrahi Jews from the Middle East were Jewish at all. In response, some Syrian Jews who were deeply proud of their ancient Jewish heritage, derogatorily dubbed Ashkenazi Jews as \"J-Dubs\", a reference to the first and third letters of the English word \"Jew\". In the 1990 United States Census, there were 11,610 Arab Jews in New York City, comprising 23 percent of the total Arab population of the city. Arab Jews in the city sometimes still face anti-Arab racism. After the September 11 attacks, some Arab Jews in New York City were subjected to arrest and detention because they were suspected to be Islamist terrorists.\n\nParagraph 11: The award was first presented at the conclusion of the , and was named in honor of former Detroit Red Wings, Buffalo Sabres and Washington Capitals goaltender Roger Crozier, a Calder and Conn Smythe Trophy winner who played in the NHL from 1964 to 1977.  It was presented by the MBNA corporation in memory of Crozier, who worked for the MBNA America Bank after retiring as a player, and died on January 11, 1996.  The winner of the trophy received a commemorative crystal trophy and was given US$25,000 to donate to a youth hockey or other educational program of their choice.\n\nParagraph 12: He was appointed manager of Tyrone club Clonoe O'Rahilly's in January 2008. He successfully guided the club to success in the 2008 Tyrone Championship, the club's first title since 1991. They shocked the \"big two\"  of Tyrone club football – Errigal Ciarán and Carrickmore in the first round and quarter-final respectively. Clonoe then defeated Donaghmore to progress to their first Championship final in 17 years. They faced defending champions Dromore in the final, who went in as red-hot favourites. However, Clonoe beat Dromore by a point after extra time. The feat is all the more remarkable, considering Clonoe are a very young team and have no Tyrone county players on the team. They were however beaten by St Eunan's of Donegal in the quarter-final of the 2008 Ulster Club Championship. Cassidy was reappointed manager of Clonoe O'Rahilly's in 2011, where he guided them back into the Tyrone championship final against Dromore, a repeat of the 2008 final, this time Dromore got their revenge winning by a point. In 2012 he guided Clonoe to their first All County Senior League title, defeating Coalisland in the final. In 2013 he once more lead Clonoe O' Rahilly's to senior championship success, beating Carrickmore in the final. He quickly followed this up with winning the U21 county title and then the Ulster U21 championship with Clonoe, defeating Truagh Gaels of Monaghan. 2015 the O' Rahilly's recaptured the All County Senior League title for the second time in their history under Cassidy's stewardship. Cassidy became manager of Erin's Own Cargin in County Antrim in 2018. Winning the senior championship at his first attempt, beating St Galls in a pulsating high scoring semi-final and then beating parish neighbours Creggan, where the rivalry is intense, in a low scoring championship final. In the same season, Cassidy also lead Wolfe Tones, Bellaghy to their first minor championship win since 1994, by beating close rivals Lavey Gac in the Derry minor championship final at Derry GAA Centre of Excellence, Owenbeg. He followed this up by leading the 'Tones' to the Ulster minor club championship, hosted by Belfast club St Pauls on New Years Day, by heavily defeating Crossmaglen Rangers Gac in the final. Cassidy won his second senior club championship with Cargin in 2019 by beating Lamh Dhearg in a final replay and then extra time in a pulsating final. He also won the All County senior league title to do the double. In 2020 in the year of the Covid virus, he led Erin's Own Cargin to their first historic three in a row, by again defeating Creggan in extra time in a classic high scoring game.\n\nParagraph 13: Once the homologation models were produced, a second version named Turbo 2 was introduced using more stock Renault 5 parts replacing many of the light-alloy components in the original 5 Turbo version, and dropping the specific Bertone seats and dashboard for the interior of the R5 Alpine. Many parts also became dark grey rather than the iconic red or blue. The Turbo 2 was less expensive, but had nearly the same levels of performance, with a top speed of  and 0–100 km/h (62 mph) in 6.9 seconds. To differentiate it from the Turbo 2, the original 5 Turbo is often referred as \"Turbo 1\".", "answers": ["Paragraph 5"], "length": 3728, "dataset": "passage_retrieval_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "f188797ab3b6f303be0812325eba96240df0d516abfb1082"}
{"input": "The team tested and developed its own active suspension for the first time with the FW11B, after Mansell had a negative experience with a different version of the system. After testing, Piquet found the new suspension to be superior to the conventional suspension. The Williams engineered suspension was lighter, less complicated, and drew less power from the engine than the Lotus example. Piquet used the new suspension in a race simulation and achieved faster lap times than Mansell had previously. Piquet then used the new suspension in the Italian Grand Prix, where it proved to be much faster than the passive suspension, allowing him to win the race. Mansell only tried the reactive car during the Spanish Grand Prix. There were also plans to introduce a semi-automatic transmission in 1987, but it did not happen.", "context": "Paragraph 1: The game was originally titled Star Wars: Podracer, however the subtitle was changed to Episode I Racer when LucasArts learned that another company owned the trademark for games with the name \"Pod\" in the title. Actor Jake Lloyd, who portrayed Anakin Skywalker in Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace, promoted the game at E3 1999. Lloyd also provided voice-over for his character in the game. The theatrical score from Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace was reused for the game, and various sound effects from the film were also reused. The podracers were recreated using specifications from the film, and the Tatooine environment was also sourced from the film. Several of the game's other locales had never appeared in a Star Wars game prior. The varied environments, Tosti said, were \"to add more depth to the gameplay.\" During an IGN interview with LucasArts' Tom Byron at E3 1999 the question of online play was brought up. Byron was unsure, citing problems \"mostly because of latency issues.\" Some multiplayer code from Star Wars Jedi Knight: Dark Forces II was utilized for Episode I: Racer. Ultimately internet play was not included. The Windows version uses the deprecated IPX protocol to accomplish this, while the Macintosh version uses the TCP/IP stack. The multiplayer mode can support up to eight players. The game was supported by a 10 million marketing budget.Episode I: Racer was later ported and released for several other platforms: Nintendo 64 Dreamcast, and Game Boy Color. The announced PlayStation version of the game was never released. The Nintendo 64 version received a special edition Star Wars Episode I: Racer hardware bundle, including the standard gray and black console and a copy of the game. Though the Nintendo 64 cartridge could optionally take advantage of Nintendo's Expansion Pak memory unit to display additional textures, the limited capacity of the cartridge resulted in the removal of all pre-rendered cutscenes seen on the Windows and Macintosh versions. It was the first LucasArts game to be released on the Dreamcast. The Game Boy Color release features entirely different game play from its console and PC counterparts. The Game Boy Color hardware is technically incapable of rendering the 3D graphics used in the other versions, so the game instead features one-on-one racing duels on abbreviated, linear tracks using an overhead 2D view. The Game Boy Color version of the game has an additional \"rumble\" feature, in which a AAA battery may be inserted into the game card to activate vibration.\n\nParagraph 2: Route 2 begins as a continuation of State Street (just east of Columbus Blvd) near Interstate 91 in downtown Hartford. It starts out heading east toward East Hartford. Route 2 then crosses the Connecticut River on the Founders Bridge and has a partial interchange with I-91 at the crossing. Immediately after crossing into East Hartford, there is a complex interchange with Interstate 84. Immediately after this interchange, Route 2 heads southeast in the direction of Glastonbury. There is a partial interchange with Route 15 about  further. After East Hartford, Route 2 enters Glastonbury. At the East Hartford-Glastonbury town line, there is a full trumpet interchange with Route 3. About  after this interchange, there is a partial interchange with Route 17. From Glastonbury, Route 2 passes into Marlborough. It continues into Colchester. In Colchester, Route 2 has a partial interchange with Route 11. After this interchange, Route 2 curves and heads east toward Norwich. Once Route 2 leaves Colchester, it passes through the towns of Lebanon and Bozrah. After Bozrah, Route 2 enters Norwich. Just after entering Norwich, Route 32 joins Route 2. Then, about  down Route 2, there is a partial cloverleaf interchange with Interstate 395. About  further east from the I-395 interchange, the limited-access highway section of Route 2 ends at a four-way at-grade intersection with Town Street, Harland Road (Route 169), and Washington Street (Route 32/Route 2). Route 32 then separates in downtown Norwich after overlapping with Route 2 for , following the west bank of the Thames River. Route 2 continues southeast from Norwich into Preston, and then into Ledyard. Just after entering Ledyard, Route 2 passes by the Mashantucket Pequot Reservation and then the Foxwoods Resort Casino. After passing through Ledyard, Route 2 continues into North Stonington. There is a roundabout with Route 184 and a partial interchange with Interstate 95 here. After leaving North Stonington, Route 2 heads into Stonington. Here, Route 2 is reduced to a minor arterial road. It has an interchange with Route 78 (Westerly Bypass) and terminates about  later at the junction with US 1 in the Pawcatuck section of town just west of the Rhode Island state line.\n\nParagraph 3: Shafer was born in New Castle, Pennsylvania and spent his childhood in Meadville. He graduated from Allegheny College in 1938 and Yale Law School in 1941. Following brief stints practicing law in New York City and Meadville and United States Navy service as an intelligence officer and on PT boats during World War II, Shafer entered politics as a district attorney in 1948 and then as a state senator. He was elected lieutenant governor in 1962, under Governor Bill Scranton. Shafer was active in that role and succeeded the term-limited Scranton as governor in the 1966 election. Shafer became a prominent voice among moderate Republicans and oversaw constitutional reforms in Pennsylvania, the formation of the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, expenditures for health and education programs, and proposed a state income tax, which proved unpopular but was later enacted by his successor, Milton Shapp.\n\nParagraph 4: In Reward, when Johnny was angry at Tracy when he overheard that she couldn't think of anything good besides good at cleaning at an annual awards for kids in care. Him and Elektra decided to distract Tracy, and edit the certificates to everyone by telling everyone what Mike, Gina and Tracy really think of the kids by reading everyone's files. Carmen is described as needy, weedy and greedy for attention. Tracy then comes in to find Johnny and Elektra reading out their versions of certificates, she tells them to stop but Johnny decides to read out Tyler's \"award\" for wetting the bed all the time. Johnny and Elektra find this amusing, but Tyler gets upset, pushes Johnny and storms off to his room. Tracy and Rick try to convince Tyler that it's not a big deal, and that everyone at some point in their life has wet the bed. When Tyler comes back downstairs, Gus starts asking everyone if they have wet the bed. When he asks Rick, Rick says it's Tyler's fault. Because when Tyler and Rick first moved into the Dumping Ground, Rick found out Tyler wets the bed. So Tyler decided to make Rick wet the bed one night by putting his hand in a bucket of cold water in the night, that can cause you to wet the bed and would threaten to tell everyone Rick wets the bed, if Rick said anything to anyone about Tyler wetting the bed. Rick then goes on to say that he wouldn't of said anything in the first place. Before everyone set off to go to the awards, Tee apologised to Tyler about Johnny's behaviour towards Tyler. Tyler told Tee and Harry about the dream he always has before he wets the bed; and that he's with his mum, saying that she wishes a big wave would come and wash all the bad stuff away. Tyler thinks that she meant that a big wave would come and wash him away too, and then there's a big wave coming towards him really fast. Then he wakes up and he's wet the bed. Later after the awards ceremony, Johnny apologises to Tyler himself and Tyler forgives him. Harry then comes and suggests to Tyler that in his dream before the big wave comes that makes him wet the bed, that he should build a boat so he doesn't get wet. When he goes to bed and has the dream, he dreams he built a boat so he doesn't get washed away and then he wakes up and finds that he hasn't wet the bed. Tyler then decides to get his own back on Johnny for making fun of him for wetting the bed, by putting a bucket of cold water by his (Johnny's) bed and putting his hand in the water so he would wet the bed. The episode ended there so we didn't get to see Johnny's reaction to Tyler's prank.\n\nParagraph 5: Estrada began training for his professional wrestling career in the nearby town of Villahermosa, Tabasco training under Indio Azteca, Maciste, El Remington I and El Chacal for his professional wrestling career. While training for a professional wrestling career he also learned the basics of Olympic style wrestling and also competed in bodybuilding competitions. His in-ring debut came about earlier than expected as a local wrestling promoted asked Estrada to fill in for a wrestler who could not make that night's show. He made his debut that night working as the enmascarado (Masked wrestler) El Universitario (\"The Academic\" or College Student), a name that reflected that he was still in wrestling school. As Universitario he teamed up with Ángel Azul and fought against the team of El Profeta and El Chilango Garcia. Later when he was ready to make his full-time debut Estrada bought a spare mask, boots and tights from Ángel Azul and began working as Príncipe Azul (\"The Blue Prince\"). As Príncipe Azul he found a lot of initial success, combining his mat skills with his very muscular physique, something less common in those days and ended up unmasking Ultratumba after defeating him in a Luchas de Apuestas, or bet match and later on would also force Ultratumba to be shaved bald. Later on he also won the hair of El Noruego as well. His early success as Príncipe Azul led to him being named the Villahermosa rookie of the year in 1972. In early 1973 Estrada decided he needed a new image, a unique image not based on the mask of his former partner. Inspired by the Mayan Indian warrior leader Jacinto Canek came up with the name of \"El Canek\", complete with a redesigned mask and tights that incorporated mayana patterns and symbols. He worked his first match as \"El Canek\" (billed as \"Kanek\" for that one match only) in the Torero de Quatro Caminos (\"The Four Cornered Bullfighting Ring\") in Naucalpan, Mexican State, an arena he would sell out repeatedly later in his career.\n\nParagraph 6: Walcott was born on March 13, 1873, in British Guiana but migrated to Barbados at a young age. As a youngster he set out to see the world and got a job as a cabin boy on a ship sailing to Boston that arrived around 1887. He soon settled in Boston as a piano mover and porter and took other odd jobs as well. Later, he landed a job in a gym and became popular with even the best of the boxers as an able opponent before turning professional. His amateur boxing and wrestling years spanned roughly from 1887 to 1889.\n\nParagraph 7: Kyalami Grand Prix Circuit (from Khaya lami, My home in Zulu) is a  motor racing circuit located in Midrand, Gauteng, South Africa, just north of Johannesburg. The circuit has been used for Grand Prix and Formula One races and has hosted the South African Grand Prix twenty times. Among the Formula One races held at the track the 1977 South African Grand Prix stands out, as it is principally remembered for the fatal accident that claimed the lives of race marshal Frederick Jansen van Vuuren and driver Tom Pryce. In recent years, the area surrounding the circuit has developed into a residential and commercial suburb of Johannesburg. More recently, Kyalami has played host to five rounds of the Superbike World Championship from 1998 to 2002 and later in 2009 and 2010, the season finale of the Superstars Series in 2009 and 2010, and the South African round of the 2008–09 A1 Grand Prix season. International racing returned to the circuit in November 2019, when it hosted the 2019 Kyalami 9 Hours, serving as the season finale of the 2019 Intercontinental GT Challenge.\n\nParagraph 8: Meanwhile, Raj and Priya come to Goa, where they run into a drunkard loitering near the mansion. The drunkard runs away on seeing them. On seeing the state of the house, they realise that Sonia has been robbed, but are later horrified to see Sonia dead. The duo run, but find that the child is left inside the mansion. Raj enters the mansion again to take him. He sees two eyes and legs of the killer behind a cupboard. Terrified, he gets out of the mansion with the child. Raj and Priya then inform Goa police about the murder. They keep the child inside a police van and run away. But Priya finds that she has left her suitcase inside the mansion inside which her passport is kept. Meanwhile, audience watch that Sonia's body is kept inside Priya's suitcase by somebody and kept outside the mansion. KK reaches the mansion and finds the suitcase. Thinking that it is containing lot of money, he takes it and reaches his room in hotel where Ruby is waiting for him. Meanwhile, Raj and Priya go back to the mansion to take her suitcase. Raj enters the mansion, but is arrested by Inspector Karan, the investigating officer and Ravi. Raj refuses to name Priya and it warms her heart as she watches on. Meanwhile, KK and Ruby find out that the suitcase contains a dead body, not money. They decide to dispose of the suitcase. Meanwhile, Priya takes Vicky to a church to drop him off but is seen by Rocky with the kid. As it was on the news to inform cops about a young girl with a kid, Rocky calls the police. Priya, who had wanted to help Raj, instead gets arrested and sent to jail. Priya and Raj become the prime suspects of the murder. Inside the jail, both fall for each other.\n\nParagraph 9: David was the son of baronet John Hans Makeléer (1604-1666). His mother was Anna Gubbertz (c.1595-1653) sometimes referred to as Anna Quickelberg. Anna was the daughter of Hans Gubbertz (c1570-?) and Maichen Maria von Quickelberg (1582-1646). David Makeléer had the following siblings: Carl Leonard Makeléer (1633-1663); Catharina Makeléer (1637-1709); Anna Makeléer (1638-1646); Lunetta Makeléer (1639-1693) who married Joakim Cronman (c1630-1703), a soldier who died at Neumünde; Gustaf Adolf Makeléer (1641-1706) who was a Captain in the Swedish Army who married Sara Carlberg (1647-1701); and Elsa Beata Makeléer (1643-1730). He married Eleonora Elisabet von Ascheberg (1663-1737) in 1679, she was the daughter of Field Marshal Rutger von Ascheberg, Count of Söfdeborg. David then served as the first governor of Älvsborg County, Sweden from 1693 to 1708.\n\nParagraph 10: Jon Silkin was born in London, in a Litvak Jewish family, his parents were Joseph Silkin and Doris Rubenstein. His grandparents were all from the Lithuanian- part of the Russian Empire. His uncle was Lewis Silkin, 1st Baron Silkin. He was named Jon after Jon Forsyte in The Forsyte Saga, and attended Wycliffe College and Dulwich College During the Second World War he was one of the children evacuated from London (in his case, to Wales); he remembered that he \"roamed the countryside incessantly\" while in Wales, collecting \"fool's gold\" and exploring old Roman mines. For a period of about six years in the 1950s, after National Service, he supported himself by manual labour and other menial jobs. By 1956 he rented the top-floor flat at 10, Compayne Gardens, Hampstead, (), the house of Bernice Rubens, who later won the Booker Prize, and her husband Rudolf Nassauer, also a published novelist, later. Silkin, in turn, sublet rooms to, among others, David Mercer, later a prolific TV and West End dramatist, and Malcolm Ross-Macdonald, then a diploma student at the Slade and later a novelist; his first novel, The Big Waves (Cape, 1962) is a roman à clef of life in that flat, in which Silkin features as Somes Arenstein. All three men lived by teaching English as a foreign language at the St Giles School of English in Oxford Street.\n\nParagraph 11: Fairfax has a strong band program, including a marching band which has won numerous championships. Included in the Rebel Band is the Fairfax High School Drumline, which placed third in the Atlantic Indoor Association (AIA) championships in North Carolina in 2006, third in 2010, and second in 2011.  In 2009, they performed in Dayton, Ohio for Winter Guard International and received 4th place in their preliminary group and 18th in semifinals.  Overall, they placed 18th out of 60 groups. Other teams that accompany the Band program are the Fall Guard (competes with the marching band) and the Winterguard (competes separately). The Fairfax High School Band was under the direction of Ms. Meghan Benson, and won second place at a band competition at the Smoky Mountain Music Festival, in Gatlinburg, Tennessee in the spring of 2008.  The Marching Band won third place in the local Fourth of July Parade independence Day celebration, and was awarded $2000 in 2008.  At the end of the 2008 Marching Rebel season the band received a 1- Superior rating at the VBODA Championships.  The Fairfax High School Band Program received a superior rating at both Marching and Symphonic Band festivals making it eligible to receive the award of Virginia State Honor Band for the first time in the school's 75-year history. The band has repeated the feat every year since. Because of the work of the Marching Band and Symphonic Band along with the work of the orchestral and choral departments, Fairfax was able to earn the title of Blue Ribbon School for the performing arts, which is achieved by Superior ratings at VBODA state marching festival, and a Superior rating for each of the top performing groups at District Festival.  At the competition on their spring trip in the year 2009 to Orlando, Florida, the Rebel band placed second in its class by a margin of less than one point and received the Silver Award Overall in Festival Disney.\n\nParagraph 12: The team tested and developed its own active suspension for the first time with the FW11B, specifically through Piquet and chief designer Frank Dernie, after Mansell declared no confidence in the system having experienced a different version of it on the Lotus 92 in  which led him to being disillusioned with the system. After much testing Piquet found the car to be superior to the conventionally suspended FW11B. The new suspension was an active suspension system similar to the one Lotus had been using all season on the Lotus 99T, but was renamed as Williams Reactive Ride due to the Lotus team having copyright on the 'Active Suspension' name for the system. The Williams engineered suspension was also lighter, less complicated and drew much less power from the Honda engine than did the Lotus example. The first time a hydraulic variant of the system was tested Dernie fitted it to a 1984 FW09, and during testing Piquet noted that although the car rode very smoothly, it handled very badly. So Dernie redesigned the system and hired Paddy Lowe and Steve Wise to design an electronic computerized system. In a race simulation test at the Imola circuit, driving a reactive suspension FW11B, Piquet completed 59 laps some 3 minutes faster than Mansell had done to win the Grand Prix at the circuit earlier in the year, though it was noted that he was also the only car on the circuit for the simulation and thus wasn't slowed by having to lap other cars. Still, his confidence in the new suspension was absolute and he first used it in competition at the Italian Grand Prix at Monza where it proved much faster than the passive suspension FW11B, allowing him to run with less wing and record the highest speed of the 1987 season when he was speed trapped at 218.807 mph (352.135 km/h), some 5 mph faster than Mansell could manage in the conventional suspension car. Piquet would start from the pole and win the race from the Lotus of Ayrton Senna, with Mansell unable to keep pace finishing 3rd. It took until the next race in Portugal before Mansell would try the reactive car during a Grand Prix weekend, although he only raced it during the Spanish Grand Prix at Jerez. There were also plans in 1987 to introduce a semi automatic transmission, but this never came to pass.", "answers": ["Paragraph 12"], "length": 3580, "dataset": "passage_retrieval_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "fefcad13768b159709cc708cc673812231936f33aaf5da15"}

Stanisic then played for the Chicago Sting, Baltimore Blast, Hershey Impact, Illinois Thunder, Kansas City Attack, Harrisburg Heat, and Albany Alleycats. He experienced a career rejuvenation with the Heat and was named a second team All Star. He briefly played for the Detroit Rockers before retiring.

Stanisic also played outdoor soccer with the Albany Capitals, Washington Diplomats, Miami Freedom, and Baltimore Bays.", "context": "Paragraph 1: A typical forest tree breeding program starts with selection of superior phenotypes (plus trees) in a natural or planted forest, often based on growth rate, tree form and site adaptation traits. This application of mass selection improves the mean performance of the forest. Offspring is obtained from selected trees and grown in test plantations that act as genetic trials. Based on such tests the best genotypes among the parents can be selected. Selected trees are typically multiplied by either seeds or grafting and seed orchards are established when the preferred output is improved seed. Alternatively, the best genotypes can be directly propagated by cuttings or in-vitro methods and used directly in clonal plantations. The first system is frequently used in pines and other conifers, while the second is typical in some broadleaves (poplars, eucalypts and others). The objectives of a tree breeding program range from yield improvement and adaptation to particular conditions, to pest- and disease-resistance, wood properties, etc. Currently, tree breeding is starting to take advantage of the fast development in plant genetics and genomics.\n\nParagraph 2: James Berardinelli of ReelViews gave the film one out of four stars and wrote: \"This is a dreadful motion picture - a lowbrow example of period piece comedy with terrible production values and an exceptionally poor laughs-to-jokes ratio. There's a kind of desperation in the movie's approach to humor that reveals the film makers' uncertainty about how entertaining the material is; the manic style betrays itself as a last-ditch attempt to hide the flaws of a failed script.\"  Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly wrote: \"Almost Heroes [...] gives off the discomforting reek of desperation. ... How could director Christopher Guest [...] have reduced himself to staging gags such as Farley's slap-fest with hostile Injuns, Eugene Levy (as a nasty pirate) speaking in a zany French accent, or Farley stealing an egg from an eagle's nest, punching out the bird, and then falling to the ground with an epic thud? Almost Heroes goes thud too. Despite his compulsion to trash everything in his midst, including himself, Chris Farley deserved better.\"  John R. McEwen of Film Quips Online wrote: \"It's clear, his death notwithstanding, that Farley is the funniest thing about this... As expected, there is little here but sight gags and low humor, but if you're in the mood (and I must have been), it has its laugh-out-loud moments. ... Perry also has a few good bits, but he is obviously a distant second banana. Additional appearances by people like Eugene Levy and Kevin Dunn, and others, add to the hilarity, although many of the jokes fall flat...I doubt if anyone ever expected Chris Farley to win an Academy Award. But it is a fitting tribute to him that his last outing, while not a great work of American cinema, can provide a good dose of chuckles, and more than a few belly laughs.\"\n\nParagraph 3: Centers was born in Tyler, Texas and grew up in  Longview. He began playing little league football for the Bramlette Bears as a running back and quarterback during his elementary school years and went on to play in middle school for the Forest Park Eagles and high school for the Longview Lobos until his junior year. He played on both sides of the ball as a defensive back and runnningback and wide receiver. Centers did not play football at all his junior year of high school. After his family moved to nearby Tatum, where his mother was an administrator in education, Centers decided to play football again after being urged to do so by his elder brother. After a solid season in Tatum, he earned a scholarship to nearby Stephen F. Austin State University. He was also recruited by Baylor, Texas Tech, and several junior colleges. His brother, Donnie, played for the University of Arkansas and coach Lou Holtz as a wide receiver.\n\nParagraph 4: The new stadium took its name from the street which encloses the ground on three sides, the fourth boundary being the River Wensum. The name \"Carrow\" originally refers to the former Carrow Abbey that once stood on the riverside, its name in turn having possible Norse origins. In 1800, John Ridges, owner of the Carrow Abbey Estate and the land opposite on the banks of the Wensum in Thorpe Hamlet, \"granted permission for a proposed road access across his grounds to Carrow\". By 1811, Philip M. Martineau, a surgeon, owned the building, lands and manor of Carrow, including the adjacent Thorpe land. Carrow Hill Road was created on his Carrow Abbey Estate, to provide work for the poor in the community. The road linked Martineau's Bracondale Estate to Carrow Toll Bridge, installed in 1810. Norwich Railway Co. had acquired the land in Thorpe around Carrow Road by the 1840s, and by 1860 the Thorpe site of the future stadium belonged to the firm of J. & J. Colman. The stadium's Thorpe Corner acknowledges this historical link. In 1935, Colman's offered the 20-year leasehold to Norwich City and construction of the new stadium began swiftly on the site: tenders were issued on the day the site was purchased and ten days later, on 11 June, work began.\n\nParagraph 5: In 1972, Al-Farouk Sports Club held a ceremony in honor of Prince Khalid bin Faisal Al Saud on the occasion of his appointment as the governor of Asir. The ceremony was held at the club's headquarters and a number of matters which concern the club were discussed. One of the matters that were discussed was a name change proposed by the Prince to members of the club's board. It was unanimously agreed by members of the board and fans of the club to change the club's name to Al-Wadiea Sports Club. Al-Wadiea achieved promotion to the Saudi First Division for the first time in 1977. They spent two seasons in the First Division before being relegated to the regional leagues. In 1983, the club once again achieved promotion to the First Division and spent two seasons before being relegated at the end of the 1984–85 season. Al-Wadiea were once again promoted in 1994 before being relegated after a season. In 1999, the club changed their name from Al-Wadiea Sports Club to Abha Sports Club. That same year, the club was promoted to the Second Division under the guidance of Saad Saleh Al-Bishri as manager. A year later the club achieved promotion once again but this time to the First Division with the Algerian, Elias Bou Zaid, as manager. In 2005, Abha were promoted to the Pro League, the top tier of Saudi football, for the first time after finishing second in the 2004–05 season. The club were relegated after just a season in the top tier. Abha once again reached the Pro League after finishing second in the 2007–08 season. They were relegated after a season following their loss to Al-Raed in the relegation play-offs. Abha then spent six consecutive seasons in the Saudi First Division before getting relegated to the Second Division for the first time since 2000. On 4 May 2018, Abha defeated Al-Watani 2–1 on aggregate in the promotion play-offs to earn promotion to the second tier. On 30 April 2019, Abha were promoted to the top flight for the third time after a 2–2 draw away to Al-Nojoom. This was their second promotion in two seasons, becoming the sixth Saudi team to achieve this feat. On 11 May 2019, Abha won their first MS League title despite losing to Al-Qaisumah. The 2019–20 season was Abha's most successful season in the Pro League. They achieved their highest finish in the top flight after finishing ninth. The club also reached the semi-finals of the King Cup for the first time.\n\nParagraph 6: 99942 Apophis is a near-Earth asteroid and potentially hazardous asteroid with a diameter of  that caused a brief period of concern in December 2004 when initial observations indicated a probability up to 2.7% that it would hit Earth on April 13, 2029. Additional observations provided improved predictions that eliminated the possibility of an impact on Earth in 2029. Until 2006 a small probability nevertheless remained that, during its 2029 close encounter with Earth, Apophis would pass through a gravitational keyhole of no more than about  in diameter, which would have set up a future impact exactly seven years later on April 13, 2036. This possibility kept it at Level 1 on the Torino impact hazard scale until August 2006, when the probability that Apophis would pass through the keyhole was determined to be very small and Apophis' rating on the Torino scale was lowered to zero. By 2008, the keyhole had been determined to be less than 1 km wide. During the short time when it had been of greatest concern, Apophis set the record for highest rating ever on the Torino scale, reaching level 4 on December 27, 2004.\n\nParagraph 7: Stanisic, born in Belgrade, Serbia, Yugoslavia, began playing soccer with Partizan. Although he made no appearance in the Yugoslav First League, he played a total of 56 games for Partizan, two of which were in the Yugoslav Cup.  In 1984, Stanisic moved to the United States where he signed with the New York Cosmos. While the Cosmos had gained its reputation as a top outdoor team in the North American Soccer League, that league had folded and the Cosmos had moved to the Major Indoor Soccer League (MISL). Stanisic and the Cosmos began the 1984-1985 MISL season, but the team’s finances led to its leaving the league before the end of the season and folding a few weeks later. Stanisic then moved to the Chicago Sting, another ex-NASL team now playing in MISL. He spent two seasons in Chicago before moving to the Baltimore Blast in 1988. In 1988, Stanisic moved to the Hershey Impact of the American Indoor Soccer Association (AISA).  On November 8, 1990, the Blast released Stanisic.  The San Diego Sockers expressed an interest in signing Stanisic, but he chose to return to the Hershey Impact.  He then moved to the Illinois Thunder of the National Professional Soccer League (NPSL) for the 1991-1992 season.  He then moved to the Kansas City Attack (NPSL) for two seasons. However, Stanisic was plagued by injuries during the 1993-1994 season and was traded to the Harrisburg Heat during the 1994 off-season. In April 1995, he joined the Albany Alleycats for the summer outdoor season.  Stanisic experienced a rejuvenation with the Heat and was named a second team All Star for the 1995-1996 season.   Stanisic only played four games for the Heat during the 1997-1998 season when the Attack purchased his contract on December 1, 1997 with cash and a pick in the upcoming Amateur Draft.   He played out the rest of the 1997-1998 season in Kansas City, seeing time in twenty-eight games. In the 1998-1999 season, he played in only ten games and is not listed on any team’s roster for the 1999-2000 season.   In 2000, Stanisic joined the Detroit Rockers where he played only eight games before retiring at the end of the 2000-2001 season.  On March 31, 2005, the Chicago Storm of the Major Indoor Soccer League signed Stanisic to a fifteen-day contract after injuries had decimated the Storm’s goalkeeper corps.  However, he played no games during those fifteen days before retiring permanently.  Stanisic finished his NPSL career sixth on the all time goalkeeper wins list with 127.  While Stanisic made his reputation in indoor soccer, he also played several seasons of outdoor soccer in the U.S.  In 1989, he signed with the Albany Capitals of the American Soccer League (ASL).  In 1990, he was with the Washington Diplomats of the American Professional Soccer League (APSL).  The APSL was formed by the merger of the ASL and the Western Soccer League in 1989.  He was back with the Capitals in 1991, then spent the 1992 APSL season with the Miami Freedom.  In 1994, Stanisic returned to outdoor soccer with the Baltimore Bays of the USISL.\n\nParagraph 8: In 2004, a new controversy erupted at the end of the season when Auburn and Utah, who both finished the regular season , were left out of the BCS title game in favor of Oklahoma who also was  and had won decisively over Colorado in the Big 12 Championship game. USC went on to a win easily over Oklahoma in the Orange Bowl while Auburn and Utah both won their bowl games, leaving three undefeated teams at the end of the season.  Also, in that same year, Texas made up late ground on California (Cal) in the BCS standings and as a result grabbed a high-payout, at-large spot in the Rose Bowl.  Previous to that poll, Cal had been ranked ahead of Texas in both human polls and the BCS poll. Going into their final game, the Golden Bears were made aware that while margin of victory did not affect computer rankings, it did affect human polls and just eight voters changing their vote could affect the final standings.  Both teams won their game that week, but the Texas coach, Mack Brown, had made a public effort to lobby for his team to be moved higher in the ranking.  When the human polls were released, Texas remained behind Cal, but it had closed the gap enough so that the BCS poll (which determines placement) placed Texas above Cal, angering both Cal and its conference, the Pac-10. The final poll positions had been unchanged with Cal at No. 4 AP, No. 4 coaches, and No. 6 computers polls and Texas at No. 6 AP, No. 5 coaches, and No. 4 computer polls.  The AP Poll voters were caught in the middle because their vote changes were automatically publicized, while the votes of the Coaches poll were kept confidential.  Although there had been a more substantial shift in the votes of the Coaches Poll, the only clear targets for the ire of fanatical fans were the voters in the AP Poll.  While officials from both Cal and the Pac-10 called for the coaches' votes to be publicized, the overtures were turned down and did little to solve the problem of AP voters. Cal went on to lose to Texas Tech in the Holiday Bowl.  Texas defeated Michigan in the Rose Bowl.\n\nParagraph 9: In 1940, the Garrison had 4 officers and 101 Other Ranks. The detachments of 21 men each were on duty for 24 hours from 1300 hours on one day to 1300 hours the next. The troops were billeted at Prideaux Place, Padstow which had sleeping accommodation for 120 men & 4 officers, a cookhouse & dining hall and an officer's mess & kitchen. Prideaux Place served as the Battery Headquarters. Water at the site was a problem and to begin with, the battery had to transport water for drinking and washing from Prideaux Place in dustbins. Later, the old Victorian water tank was cleaned and that was then used. In August 1940, an ADS Advance Dressing Station was set up at Tregirls Farm. Sick Parade was held daily at 1000 hours at the Fisherman's Institute in the town. On the night of 7 September 1940, the battery was at the utmost readiness following the issue of Codeword Cromwell, meaning invasion imminent. The Resident Naval Officer in overall charge of the defence of Padstow, Rear Admiral Gordon Campbell, V.C., and the officer in charge of the land forces, Lt Dare Wilson of the 8th Battalion Royal Northumberland Fusiliers, kept watch from the control bunker of the underwater minefield laid across the estuary. No invasion arrived. On Saturday 5 October 1940, Padstow was bombed at 8pm but the battery was not hit. Three people – three generations from one family - were killed in New Street, Padstow. Six houses were extensively damaged and 61 other buildings suffered minor damage. The fin of one of the bombs is on display at Padstow Museum. On 8 October 1940, Major Kirby, I.G., from Plymouth, arrived with a towing launch. Two rafts 20 yards apart were attached to the launch. The targets were engaged as they came into view from Pentire Head to Newland Rock. The average range was 4400 yards and five hits were registered out of 13 shots. On 15 February 1941, both guns fired 10 rounds practice shells together in 3 series at a single Hans Kay target pulled behind a launch travelling at a speed of about 10 knots. Six hits were registered. By May 1941, two War Shelters had been built to accommodate the Watch on Duty whilst the Reserve Watch slept in two huts erected at the bottom of the field by St George's Cove. In May 1942, the two naval guns were returned to sea to help in the Battle of the Atlantic. They left Padstow from the town railway station. They were replaced by two French 138mm naval guns. These required new gun houses. No 1 was built south of the old barbette and magazine. Its platform can easily be found today with mounting bolts still in place. No 2 was built just north of the old northern gun house and its location can easily be found by the ready use lockers that are still extant. The Battery Observation Post was also extended at this time. On 11 May 1942, both 138mm guns had been proofed and were ready for action. On 17 March 1943, the examination service was discontinued as such and the majority of Officers, NCO's and men were released for service overseas and the guns put into care and preservation. In November 1943, the strength was reduced to one NCO and two men and the ammunition removed to Fort Picklecombe for storage. The guns were removed in July 1945.\n\nParagraph 10: Kanaan began to compete in the PPG/Firestone Indy Lights Championship Powered By Buick (now Indy Lights presented by Cooper Tires) in 1996 for Tasman Motorsports in the No. 37 Marlboro Lola T96/20-Buick V6. At the season-opening race at Homestead Motorsports Complex Kanaan started 9th and finished 10th. At the second race of the season on the Streets of Long Beach, Kanaan would start 3rd and finish 2nd. Kanaan moved from 10th to 3rd in points following the race. Kanaan's results in the next three races were 12th, 17th, and 7th at Nazareth Speedway, Michigan International Speedway and the Milwaukee Mile. In those races, Kanaan started 14th, 4th, and 11th. At Michigan Kanaan led for 8 laps before retiring due to a mechanical problem. At the race at Belle Isle State Park Kanaan started 5th and won his first race after leading for a race-high 29 of 36 laps. At the next race at Portland International Raceway Kanaan qualified on the pole position and finished 5th after leading for 3 laps. Kanaan would get a pair of 2nd-place finishes at the races at Circuit Trois-Rivières and Concord Pacific Place. In the latter, Kanaan led for a race-high 22 of 44 laps. At the next and season-ending race at Laguna Seca Raceway Kanaan qualified on the pole position and led for all 34 laps to get his second victory of the season. Kanaan would finish 2nd in points with 113 points.\n\nParagraph 11: Tenace became a coach after retiring as a player. He was touted as a possible managerial candidate during his later years. The Pittsburgh Pirates became strongly interested in the possibility of hiring Tenace as their manager to replace Chuck Tanner. When the year ended, however, Tanner was still the manager, so Tenace became a coach at the Major League level with the Houston Astros in 1986 and 1987, and later coached with the Toronto Blue Jays from 1990 to 1997. When manager Cito Gaston was sidelined with a herniated disc in 1991, Tenace served as the team's interim manager, going 19–14 and keeping Toronto competitive en route to an eventual American League Eastern Division title. He was part of Toronto's World Series-winning teams in 1992 and 1993, giving him six rings in six World Series appearances as a player and a coach. After he left the Jays, he joined the Boston Red Sox organization, serving as hitting coach for their Triple-A affiliate Pawtucket Red Sox in 1999, and Double-A affiliate Trenton Thunder in 2001. He then served as a hitting instructor for the St. Louis Cardinals organization. He was re-hired as the Blue Jays' hitting coach on June 20, 2008, when Cito Gaston replaced John Gibbons as the team's manager. Tenace replaced hitting coach Gary Denbo. He was one of two members of Gaston's old coaching staff from his last World Series championship team who were brought back to the team (third base coach Nick Leyva being the other). He announced his retirement following the 2009 season.\n\nParagraph 12: The Efflux chamber of the engine was made of nickel tubes brazed together through which flowed kerosene down one tube and back up the adjacent tube via a manifold at the mouth of the chamber. After static firings, these chambers were checked by climbing inside the engine from beneath. The mouth was  in diameter but that of the throat was smaller, which restricted access to the inspector. In addition, during firing, the inside of the chamber became coated with fine carbon, making inspection a filthy procedure. However, the chamber required careful inspection because firing would occasionally create small holes in the walls.\n\nParagraph 13: Rosenberg maintains that the efforts made by women's rights, pro-choice, and civil rights activists to use the courts to produce social change have not been very effective. To prove and support this claim, he examines a great deal of statistical information. In looking at the effects that Brown v. Board had on desegregation, for example, Rosenberg looks at the percentage of black schoolchildren attending mixed schools in the South in the years preceding this landmark decision, and the years following it. He finds that almost no measurable change had occurred in the ten years following this decision. Indeed, it is not until the Civil Rights Act of 1964 that the percentage begins to increase annually. Similarly, in looking at Roe v. Wade, he finds that the annual number of legal abortions did not seem to be greatly affected by the Court's decision.\n\nParagraph 14: Home computer games became popular following the video game crash of 1983, leading to the era of the \"bedroom coder\". In the 1990s, PC games lost mass market traction to console games on the fifth generation such as the Sega Saturn, Nintendo 64 and PlayStation, before enjoying a resurgence in the mid-2000s through digital distribution on online service providers such as Steam and GOG.com. PC gaming is considered synonymous with IBM PC compatible systems; while mobile devices – smartphones and tablets, such as those running on Android or iOS platforms –  are also PCs in the general sense as opposed to console or arcade machine. Microsoft Windows has become the dominant operating system for PC games.", "answers": ["Paragraph 7"], "length": 3941, "dataset": "passage_retrieval_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "af70b30ba43f632ce620eb63182db1425846d21beb586ae4"}
{"input": "In this text, it is revealed that the ruler of Hell is not Happy, but a demon named Bill who has been shapeshifting to look like her.

Bill has the bones delivered to her and Horribella resurrects Cloudia as a powerful undead being. Duncan and Larry realize that Gertrude is the only one who can defeat Cloudia and convince the Fairyland Council to resurrect her. Gertrude agrees to kill Cloudia again but later demands to return to Hell. The Council promises to send her back home if she succeeds and empowers her with their magic.

After failing to torment Gertrude with a twisted version of her home, he condemns her to an eternity of repeating her quest. Meanwhile, Horribella calls Bill and demands Queen Cloudia's bones, her payment for engineering Gertrude's death. Bill has the bones delivered to her by Duncan, who has become a postal courier. Horribella, planning to bring about the end of Fairyland, resurrects Cloudia as a powerful undead being who kills her and goes on a destructive rampage. Realising that Gertrude is the only one who can defeat \"Dark Cloudia\", Duncan and Larry confront the Fairyland Council and tell them that they must resurrect Gertrude to save Fairyland. The Council initially refuse, citing the rules of Fairyland, but Duncan retorts that the rules, and the council, are directly responsible for the crisis, and that by kidnapping children like him and Gertrude, they have abdicated any moral authority. One of the Council member concedes that Duncan is correct, and orders Bill to deliver the pocket dimension containing Gertrude's Hell to the council chamber. Duncan and Larry enter Hell and inform Gertrude about Dark Cloudia; subsequently, Gertrude agrees to kill Cloudia again. When returned to Fairyland she attempts to renege on the deal and demands to return to Hell when she realizes that her actions would serve the council's purpose. The Council nevertheless promises to return Gertrude home if she succeeds, and forcibly empowers her with their combined magic. Meanwhile, Dark Cloudia destroys the army of King Cone, the new Fairyland king, who tried to stop her wave of destruction in vain. Before the villain could slay the king, however, Gertrude appears and attacks her with her new magical powers, depowering Dark Cloudia and beating her up. Although Gertrude almost kills Cloudia again, Larry reminds her that the Council never specified that Cloudia has to die in their request, and Gertrude decides to follow his advice for once and gives the defeated villain to King Cone in order to be imprisoned for her crimes. The Council then appears, angry because Gertrude didn't kill Cloudia (despite the fact that she technically fulfilled their request) and threatening to exile her to a remote place in Fairyland, until Gertrude reminds them that she still has their combined magic inside her and would use it to kill them unless they honour their part of the deal, and the fearful Council quickly sends her back home, much to Larry's sorrow. Back on Earth, Gertrude, now an adult woman in her thirties, finds herself employed as a clerk in a television station, ironically frustrated by her mundane job and looking for a way to return. However, she abandons her search and ruefully curses Fairyland one last time before getting back to work, determined to face her lot in life.\n\nParagraph 2: For distinguished and conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty, while pilot of an airplane of Bombing Squadron 5, Lt. Powers participated, with his squadron, in 5 engagements with Japanese forces in the Coral Sea area and adjacent waters during the period 4 to 8 May 1942. Three attacks were made on enemy objectives at or near Tulagi on 4 May. In these attacks he scored a direct hit which instantly demolished a large enemy gunboat or destroyer and is credited with 2 close misses, 1 of which severely damaged a large aircraft tender, the other damaging a 20,000-ton transport. He fearlessly strafed a gunboat, firing all his ammunition into it amid intense antiaircraft fire. This gunboat was then observed to be leaving a heavy oil slick in its wake and later was seen beached on a nearby island. On 7 May, an attack was launched against an enemy airplane carrier and other units of the enemy's invasion force. He fearlessly led his attack section of 3 Douglas Dauntless dive bombers, to attack the carrier. On this occasion he dived in the face of heavy antiaircraft fire, to an altitude well below the safety altitude, at the risk of his life and almost certain damage to his own plane, in order that he might positively obtain a hit in a vital part of the ship, which would insure her complete destruction. This bomb hit was noted by many pilots and observers to cause a tremendous explosion engulfing the ship in a mass of flame, smoke, and debris. The ship sank soon after. That evening, in his capacity as Squadron Gunnery Officer, Lt. Powers gave a lecture to the squadron on point-of-aim and diving technique. During this discourse he advocated low release point in order to insure greater accuracy; yet he stressed the danger not only from enemy fire and the resultant low pull-out, but from own bomb blast and bomb fragments. Thus his low-dive bombing attacks were deliberate and premeditated, since he well knew and realized the dangers of such tactics, but went far beyond the call of duty in order to further the cause which he knew to be right. The next morning, 8 May, as the pilots of the attack group left the ready room to man planes, his indomitable spirit and leadership were well expressed in his own words, \"Remember the folks back home are counting on us. I am going to get a hit if I have to lay it on their flight deck.\" He led his section of dive bombers down to the target from an altitude of 18,000 feet, through a wall of bursting antiaircraft shells and into the face of enemy fighter planes. Again, completely disregarding the safety altitude and without fear or concern for his safety, Lt. Powers courageously pressed home his attack, almost to the very deck of an enemy carrier and did not release his bomb until he was sure of a direct hit. He was last seen attempting recovery from his dive at the extremely low altitude of 200 feet, and amid a terrific barrage of shell and bomb fragments, smoke, flame and debris from the stricken vessel.\n\nParagraph 3: The train left Washington, on April 21 at 12:30pm. It bore Lincoln's eldest son Robert Todd and the remains of Lincoln's younger son, William Wallace Lincoln (1850–1862), but not Lincoln's wife Mary Todd Lincoln, who was too distraught to make the trip. The train largely retraced the route Lincoln had traveled to Washington as the president-elect on his way to his first inauguration, more than four years earlier. The train arrived at Springfield on May 3. Lincoln was interred on May 4, at Oak Ridge Cemetery in Springfield. Every town the train passed or stopped in there was always a crowd to pay their respects to one of the greatest men in history.\n\nParagraph 4: Pooja Sahani, Raj Khanna and Tina Kapoor are childhood friends. While Raj has always been attracted to Tina, he is unaware that Pooja is secretly in love with him. Raj's father decides to move to London with his family because of his work. Before leaving, Raj makes Tina promise to keep in touch with him via e-mail. Tina, who is fun-loving and distracted, does not want the responsibility, so instead of her Pooja writes to Raj, signing the emails as \"Tina\" instead of her own name so that Tina can keep her promise to Raj. Over the years, they become close while exchanging e-mails to each other. \n\nParagraph 5: The supply chains that were disrupted during the COVID-19 pandemic faced huge challenges and struggled to recover. Industries around the world shutdown due to the rapid spread of the virus in 2020. There was reduced industrial activity and lower consumer demand. While consumer demand increased quickly when lockdowns were lifted, manufacturers and distributors of goods were stymied by worker shortages and a lack of key components and raw materials. Additional bottlenecks included containers, shipping, trucks, railroads and warehouses. Ports around the world were impacted with ports in the United States in particular experiencing blockages as they were overwhelmed with container ships and their cargo. The ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles together account for approximately 40% of the shipping containers entering the United States. More than three-quarters of the containers leaving Los Angeles were empty in July 2021 whereas about two-thirds of the containers leaving U.S. ports are typically filled with exports. Many of containers were going back empty due to the rush by shippers to bring in imports of back-to-school supplies and fall fashions from Asia. This impacted Midwestern farmers and California almond growers who ship to customers overseas. Shipping companies placed a lower priority on products that paid lower shipping rates resulting in various exports being delayed. In October, there were a record number of ships at the docks of these two Los Angeles area ports as well a record number of ships waiting for a slip. In early November, more than 100 ships were anchored in San Pedro Bay. It was unusual for even one vessel to be waiting offshore before the coronavirus pandemic. In late 2021 and the first month of 2022, container ships have remained at American ports unloading goods for seven days on average, 21 percent higher than at the start of the pandemic. The mayhem at ports and shipping yards was a key driver for rising prices together with the market dominance of major companies. In early 2022, politicians and central bankers worked to tame inflation as businesses continued to struggle to manufacture and distribute their products. By July the total value of trade stuck on the water off the east and west coast ports was estimated at roughly $30 billion. Another $1.5 billion in trade was waiting for rail service at the Ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles which was 60% of all containers waiting at these ports. By September 2022, the backlog at U.S. ports decreased partially due to slowing U.S. import volumes amid high inflation and rising interest rates.\n\nParagraph 6: Each summer, recently published alumni return to the conference with their recently published books. Alumni who have been part of this reading series include Anita Amirrezvani, Eddy Ancinas, Ramona Ausubel, David Bajo, Charmaine Craig, Eileen Cronin, Heather Donahue, Cai Emmons, Amy Franklin-Willis, Joshua Ferris, Jamie Ford, Vicki Forman, Alison Singh Gee, Tanya Egan Gibson, Alan Grostephan, Judith Hendricks, Susan Henderson, Sara J.

It also had trade routes between Kinsale and Tenby, which made the port stronger. In 1208 it was listed as having provided King John with ships and men to invade Ireland; in 1247 it supplied a ship to the fleet that was sent to conquer the Western Isles of Scotland; 6 ships, with 79 men were sent to support the siege of Calais. Ilfracombe was the last disembarkation point for two large forces sent to subdue the Irish. The building which sits on Lantern Hill by the harbour, known as St Nicholas's Chapel (built 1361) is reputed to be the oldest working lighthouse in the UK; a light/beacon has been there for over 650 years. The town was also home to the Bowen family. James Bowen was master of HMS Queen Charlotte, the flagship of Richard, Earl Howe at the 1794 \"Glorious First of June\" battle. James Bowen was commissioned by Howe for his leadership in the battle, he rose through the levels - commander of the Argot, the Dreadnought, and in Georgian England titled \"defender of Madeira\", led the fleet which rescued the British army at Corunna in the Peninsula war, and retired as a Rear Admiral, Commissioner of the Royal Navy. Captain Richard Bowen (1761–1797) James Bowen's younger brother, a British naval commander on the ship HMS Terpsichore, served under Lord Nelson, and was killed at the battle of Santa Cruz de Tenerife. John Bowen (1780–1827), son of James Bowen, a naval officer and colonial administrator founded the first settlement of Tasmania at Risdon Cove in 1803 - the settlement which later became known as Hobart. Lieutenant A E Down, was initially posted to Ilfracombe to lead a protection ship for the customs and excise, he married a local girl, rose through the levels to retire as vice Admiral, his son joined the navy aged 14 (his first navy kit is on display at National Maritime Museum Greenwich). In 1802 James Meek married Down's daughter and settled in the town, James Meek was appointed the Comptroller of Victuals to the Royal Navy in 1832, he was knighted, and died in Ilfracombe 1852. (gentlemen's gazette)\n\nParagraph 8: Upon their return to Tortall, Alanna is met by her old friend Raoul of Goldenlake, who informs her of three key events that have occurred in her absence: the Tortallan monarchs have died; Prince Jonathan has been named King but not yet been crowned; and Alanna's twin brother Thom, to prove himself the most powerful sorcerer in the realm, has resurrected Duke Roger (killed by Alanna in an earlier book). Alanna hurries to take Jonathan's side and give him the Dominion Jewel, and Jonathan names her as his King's Champion. Elsewhere in Corus, Thom is being rapidly poisoned by his own magic, by its interaction with that of Roger. On the eve of the Coronation, Tortall's Great Mother Goddess warns Alanna that the ceremony will be a \"crossroad in time\", decisive of the realm's future. During the coronation, Roger’s plan comes to fruition: he causes a series of magical earthquakes using his and Thom’s joined power to bring down the palace, while insurgents loyal to Roger and his allies Lady Delia of Eldorne, Alex of Tirragen (Alanna’s childhood friend), and Claw, aka Ralon of Malven (Alanna’s former bully) storm the palace. Jonathan uses his Gift and unleashes the Dominion Jewel’s power to keep the earthquakes at bay, while Alanna‘s friends battle to protect Jonathan from assassination and Alanna goes in search of Roger. In the prolonged battle, Thom dies, drained of his life by Roger's magic. Alanna duels Alex and defeats him. She then kills Josianne, after the princess has killed Si Cham and Faithful. Roger awaits her in the catacombs, presiding over a Gate of Idramm. He reveals how he survived his death due to Sorcerer's Sleep, as well as his hand in Lightning's origins. Weary and temporarily Giftless, Alanna remains ready for battle. Roger summons Lightning toward him, and after resisting, she realizes the benefit of having the sword fly toward him. In less than the blink of an eye, Roger is impaled by the force of the sword's movement. Alanna emerges from the battle to find in the aftermath that Jonathan and her friends survived, the insurgents are defeated and captured, but Liam Ironarm was killed defending Jonathan.\n\nParagraph 9: In the second season, Arthur's relationships with Merlin and Morgana's maidservant, Guinevere, deepen. In \"The Once and Future Queen\", Arthur spent a few days living with Gwen while he entered a jousting tournament under an assumed name. Called out on his rude and inconsiderate behaviour by Gwen, Arthur slowly began to develop feelings for her, and they even shared their first kiss on the last day of the tournament. Shortly thereafter in the episode, \"Lancelot and Guinevere\", Arthur and Merlin raced to rescue Gwen after she was kidnapped by a warlord, Hengist. He was devastated to see then that Gwen had discovered that she had feelings for Lancelot, who had also tried to rescue her at this time. Arthur's stance on the subject of magic was also explored in the second season. In the episode, \"The Sins of the Father\", Arthur voiced the thought that it was possible that not all magic users were evil when Merlin cautioned him not to trust the sorceress, Morgause, too quickly. When Morgause subsequently engineered the revelation of the truth of Arthur's magic-induced birth, which resulted in the death of Arthur's mother, Arthur returned to Camelot and nearly killed Uther in a blind rage. He was only stopped when Merlin intervened, who tearfully claimed that Morgause had been lying and faked the story. Arthur later claimed to believe that all magic was evil, which visibly devastated Merlin. Arthur's relationship with Morgana was also developed in the second season. He was greatly concerned when she was thought to have been kidnapped by the Druids, and set off to rescue her in \"The Nightmare Begins\". In the penultimate episode, \"The Fires of Idirsholas\", Arthur was visibly devastated when Morgana was seemingly kidnapped by Morgause, blaming himself for having failed to protect her. In the finale episode, \"The Last Dragonlord\", Arthur was yet again called upon to defend Camelot against overwhelming odds. With the Great Dragon freed and repeatedly attacking Camelot, Arthur and Merlin set off in the faint hope that they could secure the aid of the last living Dragonlord, Balinor, who was also, unbeknownst to Arthur, Merlin's father. Though they eventually gained Balinor's willingness to help, mainly because Balinor was saved in the past by Gaius, the older man was killed on the journey back to Camelot. After returning to Camelot, Arthur gathered together a group of knights to make a final assault in the hope of defeating the dragon, even over Uther's protests. He led them and Merlin, who insisted on accompanying him, out into a field beyond Camelot to engage the dragon. Arthur stabbed the dragon with a lance, but was subsequently knocked out. When he came to, Merlin told him that he had dealt the dragon a mortal blow, when in reality Merlin used his new status as a Dragonlord to command it to cease its attack.\n\nParagraph 10: Male, female.

Using mahogany frames and the new marine plywood laminated with resorcinol glues, Rayner marked his return to the sea by building a 20-foot hard chine bilge keel gunter-rigged sloop – the Westcoaster – designed initially for a customer wishing to navigate the difficult waters and scarce harbours of the Bristol Channel, where Rayner had been torpedoed in 1944. Rayner gave the Westcoaster \"sitting head room for tall men\" – rare in yachts so small – while ingeniously camouflaging the reverse sheer needed for such generous accommodation by carrying the decks out to the sides of the boat as he had with Robinetta 20 years earlier. Similarly all the Westcoaster's running rigging came back to the cockpit making her easy to handle single-handed. He sailed and demonstrated the first of such yachts, painted a rich royal international blue – often called Oxford Blue – enthusing about its good looks, its affordability, its practicality for weekend \"pottering\" and fitness for deeper waters despite a draft of no more than 2'3\" (70 cm). This design ensemble was topped by Rayner's preference for the gunter rig, its short mast, compared to a Bermudian, making it easier to tow on a trailer, to lower and raise, for the bridges of inland waterways, as well as allowing a swift reef – by lowering the boom – in a squall. Rayner also wrote that he valued the greater 'lifting' quality of a gaff or gunter mainsail as compared to the Bermudian main, prior to the wider use, with that rig, of masthead Genoas – headsails of greater area than the mainsail – which in Rayner's view, in 1962, was 'the herald of rigs to come' with 'great aerodynamic efficiency and with enormous lift!', and returning, in effect, \"to the lateen-shaped loose-footed sails of the Mediterranean but with a taut forestay replacing the heavy lateen yard...\" A small number of Westcoasters were later modified by the addition of a small bowsprit, with the cutter rig giving an even greater sail area.", "answers": ["Paragraph 1"], "length": 3995, "dataset": "passage_retrieval_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "1ffe6e79a2ddb2071ed1e89427b5a130ed9c86e6fd11165e"}
{"input": "Methley Hall, once the home of the Earl of Mexborough, was a grand and imposing castle-like building. The de Waterton family married into the de Methley family in the 14th century and moved into the hall. The hall had a magnificent great hall with a minstrels gallery, a grand staircase, and a beautifully decorated ceiling. Young Richard Plantagenet, also known as Richard of York, lived here from the ages of four to twelve. Robert Waterton, who was the custodian of Richard II and later a gaoler, was associated with the hall. The hall was demolished in 1964, but the Mexborough Estate still owns a significant amount of land in the area. Queen Mary, consort of King George V, visited the village and stayed at the hall in 1935, and Titus Salt leased the hall from the Earl of Mexborough between 1856 and 1865.", "context": "Paragraph 1: In 1992 the band signed to Taang! Records and released the eight-song mini-album What To Do About Them culled from a mix of previously available and unreleased home and studio recordings. Musician/cartoonist Ron Regé, Jr. contributed artwork to the album's cover as well as lo-fi recordings that were woven into the record's sequence. The band also set to work recording their first LP, around which time shifts in Swirlies' personnel began to occur. Ben Drucker only drummed on a third of the new album's studio tracks, and for the remaining songs his parts were handed over to a pair of session drummers. In January 1993, Andy Bernick departed to pursue ornithology for the remainder of the academic year and Damon's former roommate Morgan Andrews was brought in to fill in on bass guitar and assorted noises. It was this lineup that toured to support What To Do About Them and that appeared in the video for \"Bell\" from Blonder Tongue Audio Baton, which had already been completed but was not yet released. Named for an obscure piece of vintage musical equipment, Blonder Tongue Audio Baton made use of Mellotron, Moog, and other analog artifacts that the group had unearthed in the studio. During sequencing the band threw in numerous lo-fi compositions, soundbites, and rants, and collaged together an album jacket from arrays of found images and objects that matched the album's eclectic aesthetics. Hailed for melding \"the high waters of shoegaze creativity and the mounting currents of indie rock\", Blonder Tongue Audio Baton quickly rose to prominence in the American noise pop canon.\n\nParagraph 2: Methley Hall was the former seat of the Earl of Mexborough.  During the fourteenth century the de Waterton family married into the de Methley family and moved to Methley Hall, a large, imposing and solid castellated building, mostly spread over three storeys rising to four by the turreted entrance. An eighteenth century watercolour shows a great hall with a minstrels gallery and grand staircase, decorated and embossed ceiling with a full-length oriel window. Young Richard Plantagenet, Richard of York, lived here from the ages of four to twelve, with Waterton's family until 1423 when national events changed things. Robert Waterton was the custodian of Richard II whilst constable of Pontefract Castle from 1399 and later gaoler of James I of Scotland.  He was esquire to Henry Bolingbroke, the future Henry IV.  The seat at Methley Hall was conferred in 1410 to Robert's brother John Waterton. The Hall, which featured in a 1907 edition of Country Life, was demolished in 1964, although the Mexborough Estate are still significant landowners in the district. Queen Mary (Mary of Teck), consort of H. M. King George V, visited the village in 1935 and stayed at the Hall as a guest of the Earl. Titus Salt leased Methley Hall from the Earl of Mexborough between 1856 and 1865 according to Salt's biographer Balgarnie.\n\nParagraph 3: President Viktor Yanukovych stated on 5 March 2010 he would make a decision to repeal the decrees to honor the title as Heroes of Ukraine to Shukhevych and fellow nationalist Stepan Bandera before the next Victory Day (in August 2011 he stated \"if we look at our past history and build our future based on this history, which had numerous contradictions, we will rob our future, which is wrong\"). Although the Hero of Ukraine decrees do not stipulate the possibility that a decree on awarding this title can be annulled, on 21 April 2010, Donetsk Administrative Court of Appeals declared unlawful former Ukrainian President Viktor Yuschenko's decree of 12 October 2007 to award the Hero of Ukraine title to Roman Shukhevych. The court ruled that the former President had had no right to confer this title to Shukhevych, because Shukhevych had died in 1950 and therefore he had not lived on the territory of independent Ukraine (after 1991). Consequently, Shukhevych was not a Ukrainian citizen, and this title could not be awarded to him. On 12 August 2010 the High Administrative Court of Ukraine dismissed suits to declare four decrees by President Viktor Yanukovych on awarding the Hero of Ukraine title to Soviet soldiers illegal and cancel them. The filer of these suit stated they were based on the same arguments used by Donetsk Administrative Court of Appeals that on 21 April satisfied an appeal that deprived Roman Shukhevych the Hero of Ukraine title, as Shukhevych was not a citizen of Ukraine. The title however was not rescinded, pending an appeal to the Supreme Administrative Court of Ukraine which set aside all previous court decisions on 17 February 2011. The Supreme Administrative Court of Ukraine ruled Shukhevych's Hero of Ukraine title illegal in August 2011. On 1 September 2011 former President Yuschenko filed an appeal at the Supreme Court of Ukraine with a request that it cancel the ruling by the Supreme Administrative Court of Ukraine.\n\nParagraph 4: The Post Office archives record that the first box in mainland Britain was erected in Botchergate, Carlisle, in 1853. This fact is commemorated today with a replica Penfold box, located outside the Old Town Hall in Carlisle city centre. The first six in London were installed on 11 April 1855. The earliest surviving British designs are four Butt boxes made in Gloucester for the Western Area. These are at Barnes Cross, near Sherborne, Dorset, inside the former Royal Naval Hospital, Stonehouse, Plymouth, in the Haverfordwest town museum (formerly at Merlin's Bridge) and in the British Postal Museum & Archive store at Debden (formerly at Ventnor railway station, Isle of Wight). All date from 1853 to 1859, with Barnes Cross being one of the later batch. The oldest pillar boxes still in use by the Royal Mail are at Framlingham in Suffolk; this pair were founded by Andrew Handyside and Company of Derby in 1856 and are at Double Street and College Road. A third octagonal pillar of this type was at Gosberton in Lincolnshire and is now in the Museum of Lincolnshire Life in Lincoln. 1856 also saw various designs introduced in Scotland and the Midlands. The postbox believed to be the oldest in Scotland, is a wall box which sits on the front of the Golspie Inn (formerly the Sutherland Arms Hotel); it carries the royal cypher of Queen Victoria and dates back to 1861.\n\nParagraph 5: To place multiferroic materials in their appropriate historical context, one also needs to consider magnetoelectric materials, in which an electric field modifies the magnetic properties and vice versa. While magnetoelectric materials are not necessarily multiferroic, all ferromagnetic ferroelectric multiferroics are linear magnetoelectrics, with an applied electric field inducing a change in magnetization linearly proportional to its magnitude. Magnetoelectric materials and the corresponding magnetoelectric effect have a longer history than multiferroics, shown in blue in the graph to the right. The first known mention of magnetoelectricity is in the 1959 Edition of Landau & Lifshitz' Electrodynamics of Continuous Media which has the following comment at the end of the section on piezoelectricity: \"Let us point out two more phenomena, which, in principle, could exist. One is piezomagnetism, which consists of linear coupling between a magnetic field in a solid and a deformation (analogous to piezoelectricity). The other is a linear coupling between magnetic and electric fields in a media, which would cause, for example, a magnetization proportional to an electric field. Both these phenomena could exist for certain classes of magnetocrystalline symmetry. We will not however discuss these phenomena in more detail because it seems that till present, presumably, they have not been observed in any substance.\" One year later, I. E. Dzyaloshinskii showed using symmetry arguments that the material Cr2O3 should have linear magnetoelectric behavior, and his prediction was rapidly verified by D. Astrov. Over the next decades, research on magnetoelectric materials continued steadily in a number of groups in Europe, in particular in the former Soviet Union and in the group of H. Schmid at U. Geneva. A series of East-West conferences entitled Magnetoelectric Interaction Phenomena in Crystals (MEIPIC) was held between 1973 (in Seattle) and 2009 (in Santa Barbara), and indeed the term \"multi-ferroic magnetoelectric\" was first used by H. Schmid in the proceedings of the 1993 MEIPIC conference (in Ascona).\n\nParagraph 6: Moved to Ripley, Ohio, December 25, then to Paducah, Ky., February 17, 1862.

About every third county and every third place in California had per capita incomes above the state average. Though somewhat counterintuitive, this implies that counties and places with per capita incomes even slightly exceeding that of the state can be classified as \"high income\" given the natural division of places into a top third (high), middle third (medium), and lower third (low) when ranked by per capita income. Hence, the upper third of all places in this ranking have a per capita income with a lower bound roughly equal to that of the state, about $30,000. The median place and county in California had a per capita income of roughly $25,000, and the lower third of both types of geographies had per capita incomes with an upper bound of about $20,000. Places and counties with the highest per capita income were concentrated in the San Francisco Bay Area, which has a relatively high cost of living. Those with the lowest per capita incomes were concentrated in the Central Valley, an economy in which agriculture assumes a primary role.\n\nParagraph 8: Linghu Chu stood for the imperial examinations in his youth, and in 781, during the reign of Emperor Daizong's son Emperor Dezong, when Linghu was 15, he passed the imperial examinations.  (Also among those passing the imperial examinations that year were Huangfu Bo and Xiao Mian, with whom he became friendly.)  It was said that the governor of Gui District (桂管, headquartered in modern Guilin, Guangxi) Wang Gong () favored his talent and wanted to invite him to serve on staff.  Concerned that Linghu would decline, he made the request to Emperor Dezong directly.  As Linghu's father Linghu Chengjian was then still serving in Taiyuan, he wanted to stay in Taiyuan, but was thankful for Wang's high regard of him, so after he passed the imperial examinations he headed for Gui District's capital Guilin to thank Wang, but did not accept Wang's feasts and tours before he requested to return to Taiyuan to support his parents.  As a result of his actions, he gained a good reputation.  Later, as Li Shuo (), Yan Shou (), and Zheng Dan () successively served as the military governor (Jiedushi) of Hedong Circuit (), headquartered at Taiyuan, they had high opinions of Linghu Chu and thus invited him to serve on staff, and he eventually rose to be the military governor's assistant.  It was said that Linghu was highly intelligent, and whenever Emperor Dezong received reports from the military governor of Hedong and could tell that it was Linghu who drafted them, he had much praise for Linghu's writing.  In 801, when Zheng died suddenly without leaving instructions, the soldiers were disturbed and went into a near-mutiny state.  In the middle of the night, a number of soldiers gathered and forced Linghu, under the threats by swords, to head to the headquarters.  With the officers surrounding him, they ordered him to draft a final report for Zheng.  Despite the duress of swords, Linghu had little trouble drafting such a report, and when the report was read to the soldiers, all were touched by his words, thus calming a serious situation.  After his father died, he was known for his filial piety during the period of mourning.  He thereafter was summoned to the capital Chang'an to serve as You Shiyi (), a low-level consultant at the legislative bureau of government (中書省, Zhongshu Sheng), and thereafter served as Taichang Boshi (), a consultant at the ministry of worship (太常寺, Taichang Si) and Libu Yuanwailang (), a low-level official at the ministry of rites (禮部, Libu).  At some point, Linghu left governmental service to observe a period of mourning for his mother when she died.  After the mourning period was over, he was recalled to governmental service to serve as Xingbu Yuanwailang (), a low-level official at the ministry of justice (刑部, Xingbu).\n\nParagraph 9: For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty while serving with the Third Battalion, Twenty-Third Marines, Fourth Marine Division, in combat against enemy Japanese forces during the seizure of Iwo Jima in the Volcano Islands, February 26, 1945. Promptly destroying a stubborn 20-mm. antiaircraft gun and its crew after assuming the duties of a bazooka man who had been killed, Private First Class Jacobson waged a relentless battle as his unit fought desperately toward the summit of Hill 382 in an effort to penetrate the heart of Japanese cross-island defenses. Employing his weapon with ready accuracy when his platoon was halted by overwhelming enemy fire on February 26, he first destroyed two hostile machine-gun positions, then attacked a large blockhouse, completely neutralizing the fortification before dispatching the five-man crew of a pillbox and exploding the installation with a terrific demolitions blast. Moving steadily forward, he wiped out an earth-covered rifle emplacement and, confronted by a cluster of similar emplacements which constituted the perimeter of enemy defenses in his assigned sector, fearlessly advanced, quickly reduced all six positions to a shambles, killed ten of the enemy and enabled our forces to occupy the strong point. Determined to widen the breach thus forced, he volunteered his services to an adjacent assault company, neutralized a pillbox holding up its advance, opened fire on a Japanese tank pouring a steady stream of bullets on one of our supporting tanks and smashed the enemy tank's gun turret in a brief but furious action culminating in a single-handed assault against still another blockhouse and the subsequent neutralization of its firepower. By his dauntless skill and valor, Private First Class Jacobson destroyed a total of sixteen enemy positions and annihilated approximately seventy-five Japanese, thereby contributing essentially to the success of his division's operations against the fanatically defended outpost of the Japanese Empire. His gallant conduct in the face of tremendous odds enhanced and sustained the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.\n\nParagraph 10: Like other Land Rover vehicles, most of the Range Rover's bodywork skin is constructed from lightweight aluminium, except for the two-section rear upper and lower tailgates, the rear corners adjacent to the tailgate and the bonnet on all but the earliest models. Apart from minor cosmetic changes, the body design changed very little in its first decade. However, while utility Land Rovers had body panels rolled from a single sheet of aluminium, the Range Rover used aluminium panels hung on a steel 'safety frame' (a method pioneered with great success on the Rover P6 saloon). This allowed the bodywork of the Range Rover to carry much greater structural strength with the steel frame while retaining the corrosion-resistant and easily repaired aluminium outer panels. While the steel frame was designed by the engineering team, it was expected that Rover's stylist David Bache would provide a design for the outer panels for use on the production vehicles. For the prototypes the engineers designed their own functional body panels simply to protect the occupants and to allow the vehicles to be driven legally on the road. However the clean, square-cut and functional design of the prototype was deemed so good that Bache only altered the detailing, such as providing a different front grille and headlamp design.  The Range Rover also marked the first appearance of Bache's trademark \"symmetric\" dashboard, where a common moulding was used for the fascia superstructure on both RHD and LHD versions, onto which the pod-style instrument binnacle was simply mounted on the appropriate side – Bache would use this concept again on both the Rover SD1 and the Austin Metro in later years.  The original fascia would later be nicknamed the \"Airfix Dashboard\" by Range Rover enthusiasts owing to its hard, low quality plastics which, as the vehicle moved upmarket over the years, betrayed its humble beginnings as a utility vehicle, It remained with the Range Rover up until the very last years of production when it was replaced by the \"soft dash\" (see below)\n\nParagraph 11: Moved to Lexington, Kentucky, September 1861, and duty there until October 1.

Her edited collection, Culture in Mind: Toward a Sociology of Culture and Cognition, as well as several review pieces  suggest viable links between these disciplines' approach to conceptualization and schematization, habituation and attention, nurturance and attachment, cognitive styles, and memory storage. Cerulo's book Never Saw It Coming: Cultural Challenges to Envisioning the Worst  also forwarded this agenda.  In it, she builds on two cognitive scientific ideas, prototyping and graded membership, to explain a sociocultural phenomenon she calls \"positive asymmetry\"—i.e. a blind optimism associated with a disregard for worst-case scenarios.  Cerulo's work documents the widespread nature of positive asymmetry, tracking its influence in key events in the life cycle, the sites of work and play, and in the organizations and bureaucracies that structure social life.  She shows that while definitions of best and worst change over time and place, the tendency to prioritize the best is rather constant.  Most communities maintain cultural practices (what she calls \"eclipsing\", \"clouding\" and \"recasting\") that background materials dealing with worst-cases or negative concepts.  Her work also identifies certain structural conditions under which these cultural practices are more or less likely to be used.  \"In a daring extrapolation, Cerulo argues that this individual grading is recapitulated in cultural cognition.\" She suggests that the cultural practices associated with positive asymmetry harness the brain's propensity toward asymmetrical thinking.  The practices take the mechanic of human brain operations and encode that process into a much more targeted and specialized experiential bias. Cerulo's work concludes by reviewing both the helpful and debilitating consequences of positive asymmetry.  She also questions whether this highly entrenched phenomenon can ever (or should ever) be corrected. Organizations expert Karl Weick says of the book, \"This book is a welcome addition to an already growing literature on worst cases … What Cerulo adds to this mix is a mechanism, a catalog of cultural practices that make it difficult for people to envision the worst, a broader range of settings in which this imbalance plays out, initial efforts to characterize settings where negative symmetry is acceptable and encouraged, insistence that the unique details of worst cases are what is important, and a solid grounding at the individual level of analysis with the cognitive principle of ‘graded membership’.\" Journalist Barbara Ehrenreich called the book \"remarkable\" as it \"recounts a number of ways that the habit of positive thinking … undermined preparedness and invited disaster.\" The book was the topic of an \"Author Meets Critics\" session at the 2008 Annual Meeting of the American Sociological Association. In an effort to spotlight Cerulo's critiques of the optimism agendas forwarded in books such as Rhonda Byrne's The Secret, writer John Gravois initiated a campaign in Slate magazine to have Cerulo interviewed on The Oprah Winfrey Show.  \"The Secret tells us to visualize best-case scenarios and banish negative ones from our minds,\" wrote Gravois. \"Never Saw It Coming says that's what we've been doing all along—and we get blindsided by even the most foreseeable disasters because of it.\"\n\nParagraph 2: Pieter van der Aa began his career at Leiden in 1683 as a Latin trade publisher, publishing classical texts pertaining to medicine and science. As he progressed, he began to publish atlases and maps, compiling numerous multi-volume collections of works. His ambition to become Leiden's most famous printer was fulfilled in 1715 with his appointment to head printer for the city and its university. One of Pieter van der Aa's largest compilations relates to the history of Italy and Sicily, an area of immense personal interest. Though he took credit for many of his compilations, several, such as the Dutch collection of travels to the East and West Indies, were admittedly simple improvements to others' works.\n\nParagraph 3: The seat has a substantial Muslim population in the town of Dewsbury (particularly the Savile Town district), combined a few suburban and rural affluent parts such as Denby Dale, Mirfield, and Kirkburton.  The town of Dewsbury itself is strongly Labour, and the remaining wards mostly Conservative. Overall the seat has close to national average income and several developments have desirable views as the upland town cuts into the Pennines. Relatively few people rely upon social housing, however the Dewsbury East ward contains a high proportion of social housing in the Chickenley estate, while Dewsbury South contains the Thornhill area, where the local school was the subject of the acclaimed Educating Yorkshire series. In the light of increasing concern over Muslim extremism, the Labour Party candidate Shahid Malik enjoyed a fairly large public media profile after his victory in 2005, with various TV appearances and interviews, strongly denouncing believers in and adherents of such views; however, this has also been a strong area for the British National Party, who obtained their highest vote in Britain (13.1%) in the 2005 general election, much of it taken at the Labour Party's expense. They have also had a substantial vote at local level, when in 2006 for the first time in the UK the BNP polled more votes than any other party standing. However, at the 2010 general election, the BNP's popularity in Dewsbury fell (despite a substantial nationwide rise in support for the party compared to five years previously) and they gained a mere 6% of the vote.\n\nParagraph 4: In 1997, Twain followed with Come On Over, which topped Top Country Albums for a record 50 non-consecutive weeks and had tremendous pop crossover success. It peaked at number two on the Billboard 200 and remained in the top 10 for a total of 53 weeks, making it the longest-running top 10 album by a country artist at the time. Certified 20 times platinum (double diamond) by the RIAA and with 15.5 million copies sold, Come On Over established itself as one of the best-selling albums of all time in the US and was once the best-selling album of the Nielsen SoundScan era; it now ranks second behind Metallica's 1991 eponymous album. In Canada, it reached similar success and was certified double diamond by Music Canada. In 1998, Come On Over was released internationally, duplicating the commercial success it encountered in North America. It became one of the best-selling albums in several countries, including Australia and the United Kingdom. With a total of 40 million copies sold worldwide, Come On Over also became one of the best-selling albums worldwide. Furthermore, the album is the best-selling album by a female artist in any genre and the best-selling country album of all time. A total of 12 singles were released from the album. Three (\"Love Gets Me Every Time\", \"You're Still the One\" and \"Honey, I'm Home\") topped Hot Country Singles & Tracks. A total of 10 songs charted within the top 10 of the chart, marking the most top 10 appearances from one album on Hot Country Singles & Tracks. Several performed well internationally, namely \"You're Still the One\", \"From This Moment On\", \"That Don't Impress Me Much\", \"Man! I Feel Like a Woman!\", and \"Don't Be Stupid (You Know I Love You)\", all of which received platinum certifications by the ARIA (ARIA).\n\nParagraph 5: Fox began to develop a TV series centered on James Gordon's early days as a police detective and the origin stories of various Batman villains in September 2013. McKenzie was cast as the lead character. When describing his character in an interview, McKenzie stated that Gordon \"is a truly honest man. The last honest man in a city full of crooked people. He's not an anti-hero, he's a true hero – but he will have to compromise\". McKenzie did not audition for the role. Heller, with whom he had worked before, wrote the role for McKenzie, who described the character as \"an old-fashioned hero in an age of anti-heroes. A throwback. Jim's a lawman, that restricts him in some ways. But also means he can become powerful within the system and change things for the better\". In the show, Gordon is assigned to investigate the murder of Thomas and Martha Wayne, with Bruce being the surviving witness. During the first season, he is assigned with a new partner, Harvey Bullock, serving also to police captain Sarah Essen. In addition to the Wayne's murder case, Gordon solves various cases in Gotham, some of them which are connected to the powerful mob figures, like Fish Mooney, Carmine Falcone and Sal Maroni. Jim also fights against corruption in the GCPD, like the police commissioner Gillian B. Loeb and Narcotics Officer Arnold Flass. To better fight against criminals and corrupt cops, Gordon gets allies such as police detectives Renee Montoya and Crispus Allen and District Attorney Harvey Dent. Gordon soon becomes reluctant ally to a criminal named Oswald Cobblepot, often calling him for the favor in some cases. He also meets a small street thief Selina Kyle, who reluctantly helps him regarding the Wayne murders. At one point when is assigned to Arkham Asylum, he meets physician Leslie Thompkins who works in female ward, later working as a medical examiner in GCPD. Gordon later falls in love with her; he was previously in relationship with Barbara Kean, but due to his police duty and her life put in danger by crime families, he advised her to temporarily leave him until they meet again. When Barbara sees Gordon and Leslie together, she becomes heartbroken and later psychotic. When the gang war reaches climax, Gordon and Bullock attempt to save Carmine Falcone. He, Falcone, Oswald and Butch Gilzean are captured by Fish Mooney and her gang. When Sal Maroni advises her to join, calling her \"babe\", she shoots him. Gordon manages to end gang war, but Cobblepot kills Fish Mooney in her apparent death when she falls in the river, becoming a new king of Gotham.\n\nParagraph 6: I know this man from Afghanistan when he visited me in my own home begging me for some help.  I did not have anything to offer [him].  But when I looked at his overall look and his dirty clothing he had on, he looked so miserable.  So I went to another friend of mine and asked him for money.  That person gave me about $3 and I gave it to ISN 758.  I have invited him to stay at my house for that particular night, but he refused.  This person came back to me again (meaning ISN 758) asking me for more money that I didn't have to give him.  I also learned from other people that this person was addicted to Hash, he smokes grass.  This was a reason that made me decide not to help him because every time I would help him he would spend it on Hash.  To me he was not a political person, a religious person, or a military person.  I have never heard once that he hated America or  allies.  I never heard that he really served with the Taliban.  He received some help from the Taliban like other Iraqi refugees, and I am one of them.  I am one of them and I have received help from the Taliban.  They only gave me food for my family and me.  They gave me a house to stay with my family.  In regards to 758, they did not give him a house because he was not married.  They only gave [one] to me.  He is a peaceful man and he does not pose a threat on nobody and he has parents that need him.  Anything that happened between him and me, like some kind of animosity was a result of the investigators here on this facility.  So they can create animosity between the two of use .  I was exposed to a lot of abuse, psychological abuse from the investigators and God only knows what happened.  This person ISN 758 is innocent from any allegations and God knows everything.  This is what I have and peace be upon [you].\n\nParagraph 7: Over the real or complex numbers, the blowup has a topological description as the connected sum .  Assume that P is the origin in A2 ⊆ P2, and write L for the line at infinity.  A2 \\ {0} has an inversion map t which sends (x, y) to (x/(|x|2 + |y|2), y/(|x|2 + |y|2)).  t is the circle inversion with respect to the unit sphere S: It fixes S, preserves each line through the origin, and exchanges the inside of the sphere with the outside. t extends to a continuous map P2 \\ {0} → A2 by sending the line at infinity to the origin.  This extension, which we also denote t, can be used to construct the blowup.  Let C denote the complement of the unit ball. The blowup X is the manifold obtained by attaching two copies of C along S.  X comes with a map π to P2 which is the identity on the first copy of C and t on the second copy of C.  This map is an isomorphism away from P, and the fiber over P is the line at infinity in the second copy of C. Each point in this line corresponds to a unique line through the origin, so the fiber over π corresponds to the possible normal directions through the origin.\n\nParagraph 8: Semple has sent \"Happy Clouds\" up into the sky over London initially in direct response to the recession and also in a bid to highlight and spread happiness worldwide, being invited to repeat the artwork in Dublin, Moscow, Australia and Milan.\"Happy Clouds By Stuart Semple\" , \"[Wallpaper Magazine]\", 23 April 2009. Retrieved 26 May 2009. \"I know at times like this it's easy to make creativity a low priority, but I want to show on a very human level that an artistic idea might be able to do something important, even for a fleeting moment.\" \"I don't see why we couldn't spread the happy clouds around the world a bit.\"First Fortnight \"Stuart Semple Happy Clouds\" Retrieved 1 June 2014.\n\nParagraph 9: Sonnet 54 by William Shakespeare is divided into three quatrains and one heroic couplet. The first two quatrains work together, illustrating both the scentless canker bloom  and the scented rose. In the first two lines of the first quatrain he says that beauty seems more beauteous as a result of truth. In the next two he gives the example of a rose. He says that beyond its looks, we prize the rose for its scent. This scent is its \"truth\" or essence. In the second quatrain Shakespeare compares the rose to the canker bloom. They have similar in ways other than scent. Shakespeare's use of the words \"play\" and \"wantonly\" together implies that \"play\" has a sexual connotation. In the third quatrain the author compares the death of the two flowers. The canker bloom dies alone and \"unrespected\", while roses do not die alone, for \"of their sweet deaths are sweetest odours made\". The final couplet indicates that the young man, or perhaps that which is beauteous and lovely, will enjoy a second life in verse, while that which is meaningless and shallow will be forgotten. This distillation metaphor can be compared to sonnet 5, where marriage was the distiller and beauty was distilled. In either sonnet one gets the same result from the distillation process, which is beauty. However, in sonnet 5 the distillation process is through marriage, and in sonnet 54 it is through verse. \"Vade\" in the final line is often used in a sense similar to \"fade\", but \"vade\" has stronger connotations of decay.  In 1768, Edward Capell altered the final line by replacing the quarto's \"by\" with \"my\". This alteration was generally followed through the 19th Century. More recent editors do not favor this alteration, as it narrows the meaning from the larger principles of the sonnet.\n\nParagraph 10: Shakib Khan was born on 28 March 1979 as Masud Rana in Ragadhi, Muksudpur, Gopalganj, Bangladesh. Khan's original residence is Maksudpur Upazila of Gopalganj district. His father Abdur Rab was a government officer and his mother Nurjahan is a housewife. The other members of his family are a sister and a brother. He grew up as a teenager in Narayanganj district due to his father's job. His father's job required the family to relocate frequently from one city to another during his school years. In many interviews he said that he did not mind travelling and changing schools. During his ninth grade, when he was residing with his family in Narayanganj, he became interested in Martial arts. After that he has done a course in Martial arts. In his childhood he dreamt to become a doctor or engineer. He was a bright student and did brilliant results in Secondary School Certificate (SSC) and Higher Secondary School Certificate (HSC) exams but discontinued his study after getting chance to act in films. Besides education, he also had an interest in dancing. Khan met film choreographer and actor Aziz Reza in 1995, and then completed a dancing course under Aziz Reza. In 1998, one day he went to Bangladesh Film Development Corporation (BFDC), the only major studio of Bangladesh on a random visit with Aziz Reza, where he met a photographer who asked him to take part in a photoshoot. During the photoshoot, film director Abul Khair Bulbul noticed Khan and offered him to play lead role in his film and he accept the offered. Although eventually the production of the film did not began. Later he get an offer for Rafiqul Islam's 1998 romantic project Sobai to Shukhi Hote Chay directed by Aftab Khan Tulu. Khan accepted the offer and first time stand on camera. The film was delayed being release, which was later released in the following year. At that time, director Sohanur Rahman Sohan was looking for a new hero due to a dispute with actor Shakil Khan. In two deferent interviews with Kaler Kantho and Chiti Aziz Reza said that he very much requested Sohanur Rahman Sohan to give a chance Shakib Khan in his film. Sohan agreed to his request and asked to bring Shakib Khan to their office. Sohan then gave him a chance as a lead actor for his upcoming project and later made his debut with Ananta Bhalobasha (1999) directed by Sohanur Rahman Sohan. He was paid only 5,000 for those initial films.\n\nParagraph 11: Antoine Albeau holds the windsurfing speed record (on the 500-metre course) with a speed of 53.27 knots (  2015, Lüderitz speed canal, Namibia, beating his own previous record of 49.09 knots (90,91 km/h) from 2008, on the purpose built Saintes Marie de la Mer canal in Southern France.  The previous record of 48.7 knots (90,19 km/h) was held by Finian Maynard, an Irish born windsurfer who sails for the British Virgin Islands who achieved this speed on 10 April 2005 on the same purpose built canal. Between 1988 and 2009, A total of 8 Outright Sailing Speed Records were set on  The Canal  in Saintes Marie De la Mer Starting with the first Outright record above 40 Knots by British speed windsurfer  Erik Beale at 40.48 Knots, 1988 and subsequent records by Pascal Maka , 42.91 Knots, 1990, Thierry Bielak , 45.34, 1993 Finian Maynard , 48.70 ,2008 and finally Antoine Albeau  49.09 , 2009. Windsurfers are not as efficient as the larger boats used in record attempts.  Albeau's 49.09 knot record was set in winds of 45 to 50 knots, while the Yellow Pages Endeavour, which held a record of 46.52 knots from 1993 to 2004, was optimized to sail in a 19 knot wind.  Venue has much to do with the windsurfer's success, as all windsurfing 500m records since 1988 have been made at the same canal. Zara Davis holds the outright nautical mile record for a woman. Set in Walvis Bay Namibia an open water venue in November 2006 previous record was held by Valerie Ghibaudo of France", "answers": ["Paragraph 6"], "length": 3477, "dataset": "passage_retrieval_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "cb4941250aa5d9ff63e5df845c241daee60510ebb252a28e"}
{"input": "Bailey, originally from Florissant, Missouri, spent seven years of his childhood in Europe, which led him to become fluent in German, Spanish, and sign language. He has an elder sister named Lisa and his mother worked as an Army nurse. Bailey obtained a degree in mechanical engineering from New Mexico State University and was involved in the Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity and the ASNMSU senator committee. He also had experience working for the U.S. Department of Energy. Although acting was initially just a hobby, Bailey made the decision to pursue it as a career while working on his doctoral degree at UCLA.", "context": "Paragraph 1: The history of Rare Bird began when Graham Field placed an advertisement for a pianist in a musical periodical. He got thirty replies and formed a group called \"Lunch\". He met Dave Kaffinetti in November 1968, and together they formulated the basic ideas for Rare Bird. In August 1969, they finally found the ideal rhythm section in Steve Gould, Chris Randall and Mark Ashton. Field and Kaffinetti had originally envisaged that the band would be a four-piece and were looking for a singer/bass player. Steve and Chris, who had both previously been members of the Pop-Psych band \"Fruit Machine\", applied to the ad as vocals/guitar and bass respectively and were taken on. Lunch played a few gigs, one notable one was at the Tilbury Working Mens Club for the princely sum of five pounds. The band had no van and they managed to get amps, drums, guitars and Hammond organ into their cars. The gig was marred by Chris receiving a bad electric shock whilst on stage. It later turned out that the founders of the band were more interested in Steve and convinced him to play bass. Chris was now high and dry and was kicked out of the band. Two weeks later, they had signed management and agency contracts, and three weeks later, were in the studio recording their debut album. Before joining Lunch, Randall and Gould had previously written a song called \"To the Memory of Two Brave Dogs\". Rare Bird included this song in their debut album renaming it \"Iceberg\" but Randall received no credit on the L.P.\n\nParagraph 2: Matsudaira Teru was born as the third daughter of Hoshina Masamoto, daimyō of the Iino han in Kazusa.  Her name, written in authentic kanji is 熈 (Teru).  In 1843, she was adopted by Matsudaira Katataka, daimyō of the Aizu han.  The adoption took place because Katataka had no children; he had two sons and four daughters at that time, but all had died very young.  Katataka took a liking to Teruhime during his frequent visits to the Iino family mansion in Edo.  The two hans were closely related to each other, because the first daimyō of the Aizu han and the Iino han were adoptive brothers.\n\nParagraph 3: The Santals are known as one of the oldest and largest indigenous communities in the northwestern belt of Bangladesh. They have been living in the pristine natural surroundings of the area for thousands of years. They might be described as children of nature who are nurtured and reared by its bounty. Santals are largely seen in the northern districts of Dinajpur, Naogaon, Thakurgaon, Panchagarh, etc. They have actively participated in the Tebhaga movement led by Ila Mitra in 1950, the Santal revolt, Birsa Munda Uprising, Kol revolt, Jitu Samur Rebellion, Pandu Raja Insurgency, Swadeshi Movement and the War of Liberation in 1971. Santal women, especially young girls, are by nature very beauty-conscious. Santal women wear ornaments on their hands, feet, nose, ears and neck and also wear peculiarly shaped ornaments on their ankles. They fix flowers on their heads and hair-buns, and make themselves graceful with simple ornaments. Like their simple, plain and carefree way of life, their dress is also very simple. Santal dresses are called panchi, panchatat and matha. The Santal women wear coarse homespun cotton sarees of bright colours that barely reach their knees, while the upper end is flung over the shoulders. Santal men and women wear tattoos on their bodies. Most of their houses are usually neat and clean even though built of mud. Their homestead often includes a garden. The peculiarity of the houses is that they have small and low doors and almost no window. There is practically no furniture except a wooden bedstead and bamboo machang on which the people of the comparatively well-to-do class spread their beds. The Nabanna ceremony is undoubtedly of great importance to the rural people, and is observed during the harvest time when delicious preparations from newly harvested food grains are made and friends and relatives are entertained. Santals have their own language, culture and social patterns, which are clearly distinct from those of other tribes. They speak Bangla fluently and have adopted many Bangla words for their own language. Most Santals are Christians now but they still observe their old tribal rites. Although the Santals used to lead a prosperous and peaceful life in the past, their economic and social conditions are now very backward. Agriculture is their main source of livelihood. Principal food items of Santals are rice, fish and vegetables. They also eat crabs, pork, chicken, beef and the meat of squirrels. Jute spinach (nalita) is one of their favourite food items. Eggs of ducks, chickens, birds and turtles are delicacies in their menu. Liquor distilled from putrefied rice called hadia or (pachai) is their favourite drink. Santal women are skilled in making different kinds of cakes. Most of the Santals are animists. The main weapon used for hunting and self-protection is the bow and arrow made of locally available materials. They are fond of flowers and music. Hunting and collecting food from the forest were their primitive economic activity. Santals are divided into twelve clans and all these clans are fond of festivities. They are very proficient in music and dance. Like Bengalis, they also have 'thirteen festivals in twelve months' and many other festive occasions around the year. Their year starts with the month of Falgun (roughly, 15 February – 15 March). Almost each month or season has a festival celebrated with dances, songs and music. In the spring, Santals celebrate holi when they drench each other with colours. To express gratitude to the god of crops is also a part of this festival. It turns into a carnival with dances, songs, music and food and drinks. Probably its greatest attraction is the choral dance of Santal girls. Another important ceremony of Santals is called Baha or the festival of blossoms. The purpose of this festival at the beginning of spring is to welcome and offer greetings to the freshly blossoming flowers. It is also characterised by dancing, singing and music. The Santals cremate their dead bodies. But nowadays, many of them bury the dead. When an inhabitant of a village dies, the village headman's duty is to present himself at the place of the departed and arrange for the last rites with due respect.\n\nParagraph 4: The blessing or wedding of same-sex marriages and same-sex unions is an issue about which leaders of Christian churches are in ongoing disagreement. Traditionally, Christianity teaches that homosexual acts are sinful and that holy matrimony can only exist between two persons of the opposite sex. These disagreements are primarily centered on the interpretation of various scripture passages related to homosexuality, sacred tradition, and in some churches on varying understandings of homosexuality in terms of psychology, genetics and other scientific data. While various church bodies have widely varying practices and teachings, individual Christians of every major tradition are involved in practical (orthopraxy) discussions about how to respond to the issue.\n\nParagraph 5: The Battle of Savage's Station took place on June 29, 1862, in Henrico County, Virginia, as the fourth of the Seven Days Battles (Peninsula Campaign) of the American Civil War. The main body of the Union Army of the Potomac began a general withdrawal toward the James River. Confederate Brig. Gen. John B. Magruder pursued along the railroad and the Williamsburg Road and struck Maj. Gen. Edwin Vose Sumner's II Corps (the Union rearguard) with three brigades near Savage's Station, while Maj. Gen. Thomas J. \"Stonewall\" Jackson's divisions were stalled north of the Chickahominy River. Union forces continued to withdraw across White Oak Swamp, abandoning supplies and more than 2,500 wounded soldiers in a field hospital.\n\nParagraph 6: Tracy arrived in Port Charles in 1978 as the scheming daughter of Edward and Lila Quartermaine for Alan and Monica's wedding. A divorcee with a young son, Ned (off in boarding school), Tracy felt Monica was beneath them although she did grow to respect Monica as a physician. Determined to always be the center of attention at social functions, Tracy flirted with many of the men she met, although most of them were already involved in other relationships. Edward and Lila shed light on their daughter's character to Monica at a Thanksgiving gathering, warning her that Tracy would be ruthless in her attempts to hold onto her grandfather's trust fund for her son. Despite often friendly encounters with Monica, Tracy was determined to prevent any male children of Monica's from getting their hands on the trust fund. This was fueled by her discovery that Monica was having an affair with Monica's first love, Rick Webber. Her mission was to determine that Monica's unborn child was indeed not a Quartermaine heir, but rather a Webber heir. This was a problem as both Monica and Rick were married to other people at the time, Monica to Alan, and Rick to Lesley Williams. When Monica was injured falling down the stairs in the Quartermaine mansion and had to spend the remainder of her pregnancy in bed, Tracy visited her with a peace offering, and told her that she was praying for Monica's unborn child, which she hoped was a girl. But when tests proved otherwise, Tracy's schemes went into high gear, although she was concerned about Monica and the soon to be born baby when Monica was trapped at the mansion during a snowstorm with only Lesley Webber, Gail Baldwin and the Quartermaine housekeeper, Stella Fields, to aide her during labor. But once this crisis was over and Monica returned home, Tracy's schemes to prove that Rick was the father became more aggressive, causing the rivalry between the two women to explode into war.\n\nParagraph 7: In 1923, Lascorz issued a manifesto to the Greek people, proclaiming himself \"Prince Eugene Lascaris Comnenus, heir to the Emperors of Byzantium and Pretender to the Throne of Greece\". Lascorz believed that his supposed Byzantine ancestry went well with Greek dreams of past glories such as the Megali Idea. The Greek monarchy was abolished in 1924 in favour of the Second Hellenic Republic. The abdication of George II of Greece saw the momentary end of the rule of the House of Glücksburg over Greece. Lascorz took advantage of this interregnum to try to push his claim to the Greek throne, writing to various influential Greek figures. According to Lascorz, he had already received the blessing of the Patriarch of Constantinople, Meletius IV, in 1922, and in 1927 Lascorz and his oldest son Teodoro were supposedly granted some honours by the Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem, Damian I. The Láscaris family archives contain documents which they claim were sent in the early 1920s by Eleftherios Venizelos, the former prime minister of Greece, during his self-exile in Paris, supposedly seriously considering Lascorz as a candidate for the Greek throne. According to contemporary newspapers and radio broadcasts in Spain, several Greek deputies had expressed interest in offering the Greek crown to Lascorz. That nothing came of Lascorz's candidacy for the Greek throne, even after Venizelos became prime minister again in 1928, is explained away by Lascorz' modern descendants as being due to economic crisis and political instability plaguing the country and any potential plans for making Lascorz king being forgotten.\n\nParagraph 8: Modern historians have also re-examined the role of the States Department and Lord Mountbatten during the accession process. Ian Copland argues that the Congress leaders did not intend the settlement contained in the Instruments of Accession to be permanent even when they were signed, and at all times privately contemplated a complete integration of the sort that ensued between 1948 and 1950. He points out that the mergers and cession of powers to the Government of India between 1948 and 1950 contravened the terms of the Instruments of Accession, and were incompatible with the express assurances of internal autonomy and preservation of the princely states which Mountbatten had given the princes. Menon in his memoirs stated that the changes to the initial terms of accession were in every instance freely consented to by the princes with no element of coercion. Copland disagrees, on the basis that foreign diplomats at the time believed that the princes had been given no choice but to sign, and that a few princes expressed their unhappiness with the arrangements. He also criticises Mountbatten's role, saying that while he stayed within the letter of the law, he was at least under a moral obligation to do something for the princes when it became apparent that the Government of India was going to alter the terms on which accession took place, and that he should never have lent his support to the bargain given that it could not be guaranteed after independence. Both Copland and Ramusack argue that, in the ultimate analysis, one of the reasons why the princes consented to the demise of their states was that they felt abandoned by the British, and saw themselves as having little other option. Older historians such as Lumby, in contrast, take the view that the princely states could not have survived as independent entities after the transfer of power, and that their demise was inevitable. They therefore view successful integration of all princely states into India as a triumph for the Government of India and Lord Mountbatten, and as a tribute to the sagacity of the majority of princes, who jointly achieved in a few months what the Empire had attempted, unsuccessfully, to do for over a century—unite all of India under one rule.\n\nParagraph 9: Okuda also served as a technical consultant on the various TNG-era Star Trek series along with Rick Sternbach, advising the scriptwriters on the technology used throughout the Star Trek universe such as the transporters and the warp drive, for example Okuda created the Heisenberg compensator as a way to explain how Star Treks fictional transporter might work, despite the limitation of the uncertainty principle. Okuda famously answered the question \"How does the Heisenberg compensator work?\" with \"It works very well, thank you.\" This work resulted in a technical manual which was distributed to prospective scriptwriters along with the series bible. The manual was later published in revised and updated form as the Star Trek: The Next Generation Technical Manual by Pocket Books. Okuda then went on to write a number of Star Trek books with his wife, Denise. He continued working at Paramount Studios on multiple Star Trek series that followed The Next Generation, including as an art supervisor on Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, Star Trek: Voyager and through to the cancellation of Star Trek: Enterprise in 2005. He also worked on the Star Trek movies that were produced while the various television series were in production. He also served as one of the producers when CBS digitally remastered and updated special visual effects for the original series.\n\nParagraph 10: Three days after the events of the first film and a day after the events of the third film, the Creeper abducts a young Billy Taggart in front of his father Jack Sr., his older brother Jack Jr. and their dog Mac in its 22nd day of feeding. The next day, a school bus carrying a high school basketball team and cheerleaders suffers a blowout, after one of the tires is hit by a hand-crafted shuriken made of bone fragments. Later a cheerleader named Minxie Hayes has a vision of Billy Taggart and Darry Jenner who attempt to warn her about the Creeper before it blows out another tire and disables the bus. With the team stranded, the Creeper abducts bus driver Betty Borman and coaches Charlie Hanna and Dwayne Barnes. When the Creeper returns, he singles out six of the students: Dante Belasco, Jake Spencer, Minxie Hayes, Scotty Braddock, Andy \"Bucky\" Buck, and Deaundre \"Double D\" Davis. Minxie has another vision in which Darry says the Creeper emerges every 23rd spring for 23 days to eat humans and she tells the other students.\n\nParagraph 11: Bailey was born in Florissant, Missouri. He spent seven years of his childhood residing in Europe. Due to having lived in Europe, Bailey is fluent in German, Spanish (and sign language). He has an elder sister, Lisa and his mother worked as an Army nurse for the Government. He earned a degree in mechanical engineering from New Mexico State University where he was a member of the Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity and was an ASNMSU (Associated Students of New Mexico State university) senator. Bailey has also worked for the U.S. Department of Energy. Acting was not Scott Bailey's first choice of occupation; it was merely just a hobby. He eventually decided to pursue a career in acting while working on his doctoral degree at UCLA.\n\nParagraph 12: Davis possessed a strong throwing arm and finished second among National League catchers in caught stealing percentage in 1981.  In 1982, he finished second among National League catchers, behind Gold Glove winner Gary Carter, in Total Zone Runs, and he finished eighth among all National League players in Defensive Wins Above Replacement (Defensive WAR).  However, Davis slumped defensively in 1983, leading the league in passed balls with 21 and finishing second in errors with 13.  In 1984, with the help of bullpen coach and former catcher Johnny Oates, Davis began to regain his form as a defensive asset.  In 1985, his 1.6 Defensive WAR once again placed him among the top 10 defensive players in the league.  In 1986, Davis turned in a stellar defensive campaign.  He led National League catchers in putouts, assists, and baserunners caught stealing, and he finished second to Bob Brenly in fielding percentage.  His 21 Total Zone Runs and 3.3 Defensive WAR led not only National League catchers but indeed all National League players.  When Davis broke the 100 assists barrier in , he joined Johnny Bench, Jim Sundberg, Gary Carter and Tony Peña as the only catchers to have more than 100 assists in a season since the end of the Second World War. His defensive excellence helped earn him his second All-Star Game appearance and garnered the Gold Glove Award.\n\nParagraph 13: By 1966 she had also met Lorenz Betzing and recruited him for espionage work.   Their professional partnership was subsequently complemented by a personal one.   (In 1985 the New York Times described Richter as \"Mr. Betzing's close friend\".)   In 1972 it seems that the Stasi had lost any interest they might once have had in the Catholic News Agency and Ursula Richter was prompted to find a new employer.   In October 1972 she started a new job with the Bonn office of the  \"Association of the expelled\" \"Bund der Vertriebenen\" (BdV).   Frontier changes agreed in 1945 between the Soviets, the Americans and the British, and implemented during 1944/45, had left approximately the eastern third of what had been Germany shared out between Poland and the Soviet Union.   It was far from the first time that Germany's eastern frontier had moved.   What was unprecedented was the thoroughness of the ethnic cleansing which forced more than ten million Germans to move to the west of the \"Oder–Neisse line\".   Many of these were still living in West Germany in 1972 and the BdV was a political lobbying organisation established in 1957 to promote their interests.   Significantly, it was particularly \"close to the Christian Democratic Party\", which had led the West German government till 1969 and would do so again after 1982.   She was employed as a clerk in the accounts office, but her handlers evidently anticipated that she would work her way up into a position of trust within the organisation and this she did, becoming a senior secretary and enjoying the confidence of the BdV leadership.   Till 1972 \"Agent IM-Kern\"'s espionage activities had been handled from the Ministry's regional office in Gera which was where she had been recruited, but after 1972 she was handled by a division of the Ministry's national Intelligence headquarters (Hauptabteiling Aufklaerung, Abteilung II) in East Berlin.   Intelligence services in East Berlin and partner agencies in Moscow were particularly interested in the BdV at this time.   The organisation had broken with West Germany's ruling Social Democratic Party a couple of years earlier over Chancellor Brandt's newly flexible Eastern Policy (Ostpolitik) which led to a series of treaties in the early 1970s whereby the west recognised the frontiers imposed in 1945 and formally renounced any right of return to their former homes by the millions of Germans who had been ethnically cleansed a quarter century earlier.   By sharing the documents that crossed her desk with her handlers \"Ursula Richter\" (as she boasted while facing criminal investigation after 1990) was able to give the East German authorities ringside access to the endless heated discussions taking place over the issues arising from inside the principal lobbying organisation involved, together with advance notice of its political plans and details over the identities of those funding it.\n\nParagraph 14: In 1872 a Lutheran congregation formed in the area as the nearest Lutheran church was in Beenleigh. The congregation held its first service  in the open air under a fig tree on Mr Heineman's land and later in his barn.  of land were purchased on the corner of the south-western corner of Mount Cotton Road and Wuduru Roads (now within the neighbouring suburb of Cornubia to the south, ). Three acres were cleared to build a church and establish a cemetery. In December 1875, Pastor Haussman dedicated the church to St Paul. The church was built in a traditional north German style with hand-made brick nogging within a timber frame. By 1941, the church building was showing signs of age and the congregation decided to have a new church, but there was some debate about the location. On Palm Sunday 19 March 1951, the last service was held in the old church, which was demolished.  On Sunday 11 November 1951, Pastor M. Lohe (President of the Lutheran Church of Queensland) dedicated the second (and current) St Paul's Lutheran Church on the site where the 1872 first service was held. The cemetery beside the old church continued to be used and is now heritage-listed.", "answers": ["Paragraph 11"], "length": 3803, "dataset": "passage_retrieval_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "46a23c4e0aac896a129ec04f2958247d5110ed8f6f40fa57"}

Chaudhary (Jeetendra), a disciple of justice, prosecutes Shankar Singh (Shakti Kapoor) for murder case, who is the twin brother of a dangerous gangster Jai Singh (also Shakti Kapoor) and the case is defended by Chaudhary's opponent Kailash (Kader Khan). Chaudhary wins the case and Shankar Singh is sentenced to death. Jai Singh swore to take revenge from Chaudhary when Kailash also joins him and they hang to repay. Chaudhary leads a happy family life with his ideal wife Janki (Moushumi Chatterjee), son Inspector Ramesh (Arun Govil), daughter-in-law Lata, and daughter Laxmi (Debashree Roy), a dumb girl. Parallelly, Ramu (also Jeetendra) a young & energetic guy, resembles Chaudhary, is a motor mechanic & a racer and he loves Kailash's daughter Rekha (Sridevi). Recognizing Ramu's caliber, Jai Singh & Kailash misuse him for their criminal activities which he too accepts to fulfill his life ambition of constructing a house for his mother Radha (Hema Malini), who is under prison for the crime he committed. Meanwhile, Chaudhary becomes High Court Chief Justice which evildoers couldn't abide, so they get Laxmi married to their acolyte Gopal (Raj Kiran) to exploit Chaudhary but he stands strong even Gopal necks out Laxmi. At the same time, Kailash discovers Ramu is Justice Chaudhary's son, so they again incite him by creating Chaudhary as a deceiver of his mother and provokes Ramu against Chaudhary to take revenge. Now Ramu indicts Ramesh in a crime by changing his attire as Chaudhary and in the court, Chaudhary compelled to sentence life imprisonment to him. Thereafter, Chaudhary starts digging the matter when he finds out Radha is alive & Ramu is his son. Then he recalls the past, Chaudhary & Radha were love birds in college and just before their marriage, Radha goes missing. Later he ascertains herself as dead. Hence on the advice of his Diwanji, he reconciles with life and marries Janki. At present, Chaudhary decides to affirm the truth but due to Janki's health condition, he holds back. In the meantime, Radha is released from prison. Chaudhary meets her, learns that she has intentionally left his life being aware of Janki's love when Chaudhary understands her virtue and also divulges Ramu's credulity. At that point of time, evil-minded Jai Singh seizes Chaudhary's family even Kailash also double-crossed by him. Here Chaudhary gamely breaks out his play. Simultaneously, knowing the truth, Ramu realizes his mistake and goes for his father's aid. At last, both of them see the end of Papa Rao when Radha sacrifices her life to save Chaudhary.

She grew up in San Antonio, Texas and was a baby sitter for several DJ's at KTSA Radio where she was given boxloads of 45 records of all the current hits in the 1960s including Motown artists which helped inspire her to write poetry.  Her first radio commercial was on bicycle safety airing on the Ricki Ware show on KTSA at age 9 or 10 years old. At the age of 15 her family moved back to Little Rock, Arkansas, where she graduated from Little Rock Central High School. While in high school she worked for Governor Winthrop Rockefeller and Graphic Communications touring the tiny towns of Arkansas with the Rockefeller campaign where she met Skeeter Davis (she would later reconnect with Skeeter at the Grand Ole Opry). Completing a production art course at MacArthur Park she became a paste up artist for the Air Scoop at Little Rock Air Force Base in Jacksonville, Arkansas. In 1970 she worked at Heritage Publishing Company as a type setter for the American Fishfarmer magazine and met Ringo Jukes who became her mentor and offered to publish her first book of Poetry called \"All in Time\". Another mentor who worked at the publishing company, John Beegle began writing her biography. Some time during the process of printing the poetry book, Heritage Publishing Company burned to the ground and none of the books were retrieved. Ringo Jukes and John Beegle gave their draft copy to Jimmy Dean and Bill Holland (who later also offered to publish the book) at Holland and Associates. She was hired as a national Time Buyer for the Jimmy Dean Sausage account where she worked from age 19–25. During that time she also appeared in TV commercials for Brut aftershave and a local Ford dealership. She began playing music in 1972 with Mary Gwin in the Little Rock area as \"Me and My Friend\" performing original music in local clubs and listening rooms. She met Rick Harrington while performing at the Leather Bottle and the Island X in Little Rock. Rick was managing a group called \"Wildwood\". They soon married and went out on the road with the group. Linda chose to lay down her guitar to work the sound for the popular group, but her marriage only lasted 9 months. Wildwood continues to work with Linda in her Writers in the round Concert Series and the Women in the round on the road touring group.\n\nParagraph 3: The Cuban government has blamed \"a Twitter campaign orchestrated by the United States\", stating that the SOSCuba campaign \"launched in early July to highlight Cuba's healthcare crisis, the spike in Covid-19 cases, and to plead for foreign humanitarian aid\"; however, experts spoken to by the AFP said that this view was an exaggeration. Spanish social media and disinformation expert Julian Macias Tovar told the AFP that \"there is something strange in the figures around the hashtag\" and \"something does not add up\", stating that between 5–8 July there were just 5,000 tweets, then it suddenly went up to 100,000 tweets on 9 July, 1.5 million on 10 July, and 2 million on 12 July. According to Macias Tovar, the accounts tweeting the hashtag \"came from many different places, and I believe there's an international network of accounts linked ideologically\", the same bots that pushed misinformation about president of Mexico Andrés Manuel López Obrador and other leftist governments, such as in Argentina and Spain, and that this was \"a case of fake accounts or automated accounts programmed to produce a large number of tweets.\" He posited that the campaign was in part the work of members from the Atlas Network and have also been involved in misinformation campaigns in the 2019 Bolivian political crisis, the 2021 Ecuadorian general election, and the 2021 Peruvian general election. Doug Madory, an Internet analysis director at Kentik, was more skeptical about it, stating: \"Someone sends a tweet in the United States that puts people on the streets in Cuba? I find it hard to believe. I don't know if one could sit and try to create a Twitter campaign that holds such sway over the average Cuban that out of the air they convince them to do things they wouldn't otherwise have done.\" While acknowledging that there were automated tweets, Madory stated that it is \"probably true also of the government themselves\", and mentioned that the government can cut off internet access, as it partially did. Venezuelan fact-checking platform Cazadores de Fake News () analyzed the SOSCuba hashtag trend, saying that although anomalous accounts participated, including bots, bot networks, and cyborgs, and that there was spam generation, the trend was promoted naturally, starting with Cubans in the island that since 11 July were supported by users from several countries across America and Europe. After the report was published, the Cuban government blocked Cazadores de Fake News in the country.\n\nParagraph 4: The Directorate-General for External Policies (DG EXPO) deals with assisting the work of Parliament's delegations, committees and their chairmen as well as coordinating relations and cooperation with the other institutions, national parliaments and foreign bodies. It also forms half of the co-secretariat of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly, the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly, the Eurolat and the European Eastern neighbours parliamentary assembly secretariat. The DG organises both delegation visits to non EU states and visits to the parliament by external state delegations. The DG also supplies expert information and research to the members and committees on topics relating to external countries. This is the task of the Policy Department who produce studies, upon request, on topics for the members. These studies, being produced by or for the European Parliament, are published on the Europarl website.\n\nParagraph 5: The black slug is mainly nocturnal and avoids exposure to sunlight, although in introduced areas, it has been observed to be active all parts of the day and night. It is omnivorous, eating carrion, fungi, animal feces, algae, lichen, and vegetation (living or decaying). These slugs prefer to eat on cloudy days or at night when temperatures are above 10 degrees Celsius. Mucus-production necessitates moist habitats, such as among leaf-litter, mosses, or fallen trees. Consequently, the black slug becomes most active after rainfall. A 1976 study compared black slug assimilation rates to that of similar slugs in the UK. The study determined the black slug feeds at similar rates to other European slugs (in terms of biomass), suggesting the black slug is an equally important decomposer/consumer in forest systems. The study theorized these high assimilation rates might result from abundant enzymes in slug digestive systems: amylase, invertase, cellulase, xylanase, and chitinase. The last might be especially indicative of how these slugs can consume large quantities of fungi such as Armillaria mellea. Microbiota within black slug digestive systems produce these enzymes—such as the bacteria that produce cellulose—enabling the slugs to break down lignocellulose. A recent study further explored Arion ater’s gut microbiome and discovered the black slug to have far more bacteria within its gut than did neighboring, northern European insects, including members of the orders Coleoptera, Isoptera, Orthoptera, and Diptera. This study learned the black slug’s gut microbiome to be functional at a wide range of temperatures and pH levels, and its results suggest that the mycobacterial culture may be uniform throughout the black slug’s gut and that Gammaproteobacteria composes most of this culture. This study contrasted its results to studies of North American black slugs that presented higher levels of cellulolytic activity at a narrower pH range. In summary, Arion ater can digest diverse food material such as cellulose because gut bacteria produce digestive enzymes.\n\nParagraph 6: Babysitter Jeannie (voiced by Julie Bennett) is instructed to look after the baby while his mother (also voiced by Julie Bennett) goes out. However, Jeannie begins talking on the telephone with someone, ignoring the baby and its carriage. In the midst of Tom and Jerry's usual fighting, they see the baby crawling out of its pram. Any attempt to return the baby to where it came from simply results in the baby escaping from the pram again. During one escape, the baby crawls into Spike's dog house. Tom accidentally grabs Spike instead of the baby, and is promptly pummeled. This time, Tom angrily brings the baby back to Jeannie herself, who hits Tom over the head with a broom, thinking that Tom has taken the baby away from her. Realizing that the baby is no longer worth the trouble, Tom does nothing the next time that it crawls from its pram. However, he and Jerry are forced to react after the baby crawls down to the street and into a 100-story mixed-use skyscraper construction site. The baby crawls from one steel beam to another while the two look on. Jerry manages to catch up, and saves the baby from crawling off a wooden plank lying on the 50th floor by grabbing his diaper. The diaper comes loose, and the baby falls, but he is then caught by Tom. Tom attempts to put the baby's diaper back on, but in the impending confusion, ends up putting the diaper on himself while the baby crawls off, nonchalantly. Tom and Jerry catch up with the baby, only to lose it again. Fearing that it has crawled into a cement mixer on the 30th floor, the two dive straight in, only to find that the baby never entered the mixer but is instead playing with a hammer. Later on, Jeannie is in a panic and tells a police officer that she lost the baby she was babysitting. Tom and Jerry would arrive tired with the baby. Jeannie grabs the baby while the two try to escape, but the police officer (voiced by Bill Thompson) arrests Tom and Jerry, assuming that they were \"baby nappers\". In the police car, Tom and Jerry explain what really happened, but the police officer doesn't believe them. Just then, to their surprise, the baby crawls past the police car and away into the distance (apparently having been neglected by Jeannie once again), making the police officer realize in shock that Tom and Jerry were telling the truth.\n\nParagraph 7: In 1985, she began work at the Museum of Television & Radio where she became a curator specializing in arts, drama and children's programming. In 1991, a grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities launched her on a career as a producer and director of the award-winning documentaries The Power of Conscience: The Danish Resistance and Rescue of the Jews (1995); Scandalize My Name: Stories from the Blacklist (1999); Porraimos: Europe's Gypsies in the Holocaust (2002); The Healing Gardens of New York (2006); and Hidden Treasures: Stories from a Great Museum (2011). Her films have been seen at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum (Washington, DC), Museum of Modern Art (NY), and numerous film festivals including the Human Rights Watch and Margaret Mead Film Festivals, and all have aired on PBS.\n\nParagraph 8: Candido debuted in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) in January 2005, when Candido faced AJ Styles in a losing effort. On the January 14 episode of Impact!, Candido lost to Dustin Rhodes. On the Final Resolution preshow, Candido defeated Cassidy Riley. On the January 28 episode of Impact!, Candido defeated Sonny Siaki. On the February 11 episode of Impact, Candido lost to Diamond Dallas Page. On the February 18 episode of Impact!, Candido defeated Shark Boy and Chris Sabin in a Triple Threat match. On the February 25 episode of Impact!, Candido lost to Elix Skipper. On the March 4 episode of Impact!, Candido and The Naturals (Andy Douglas and Chase Stevens) defeated Elix Skipper, Petey Williams, and Mikey Batts in a six-man tag team match. At the Destination X preshow, Candido and Andy Douglas defeated Lex Lovett and Buck Quartermain. On the March 18 episode of Impact!, Candido and The Naturals lost to Dustin Rhodes and America's Most Wanted. Candido competed in his final match at Lockdown when he and Lance Hoyt faced Apolo and Sonny Siaki in a losing effort. During the match, Candido broke his leg when Siaki landed on it after a flying dropkick early in the match. The injury would lead to Candido dying of acute pneumonia on April 28, 2005. His last performance was taped to air later in the week, as he was featured on an episode of TNA Impact! after his death, using a wheelchair, where he helped The Naturals win the NWA World Tag Team Championships.\n\nParagraph 9: Eyriès chose a selection of eight German ghost stories to translate for a French audience. The first story (\"\") was from Johann Karl August Musäus' satirical retellings of traditional folk tales  (1786). The next (\"\") was by Johann August Apel, first published in Johann Friedrich Kind's  (1805), but reprinted in Apel's anthology  (1810). Of the remaining six tales, five were from the first two volumes of Apel and Laun's  (1810–1811), and one (\"\") was by the highly popular author Heinrich Clauren, which had been parodied by Apel in one of his  stories (\"\", translated as \"\"). Fantasmagoriana was partly translated into English in 1813, by Sarah Elizabeth Utterson as Tales of the Dead containing the first five stories (see list, below); thus three of the five stories from . Three editions in three countries and languages over a period of three years shows that these ghost stories were very popular.\n\nParagraph 10: In 2008 there was speculation that Ó Sé, at the age of thirty-three, would retire from inter-county football. In the end he decided to line out with Kerry once again and help his team in their pursuit of a third All-Ireland title in-a-row. All did not go to plan as Ó Sé's side lost team captain Paul Galvin to suspension after an incident with referee Paddy Russell in the Munster semi-final against Clare. The subsequent Munster final saw Kerry take an eight-point lead over Cork at half-time. 'The Rebels' fought back and, in a massive downpour, Kerry could only muster three points in the second period of play as Cork secured a remarkable 1–16 to 1–11 victory. Furthermore, Ó Sé picked up a red card after an altercation with Pearse O'Neill. Kerry worked their way through to the All-Ireland semi-final where they faced Cork once again. 'The Kingdom' were much better in this encounter; however, Ó Sé received a straight red card for an incident with Pearse O'Neill once again.  At this stage of the game Kerry were cruising and it looked as if Ó Sé would miss the All-Ireland final. Two very late goals by Cork secured a draw. The replay was also an exciting affair; however, Kerry overcame Cork in their third championship meeting that year. An All-Ireland final appearance against Tyrone was the reward for this victory, with Ó Sé lining out at midfield again. An exciting game developed, one that was more competitive than the routs that had taken place at the same stage of the championship over the previous two years. The sides were level seven times before Colm Cooper nudged Kerry 0–8 to 0–7 ahead before the interval. Tyrone simply wore Kerry into the ground in the second half as a priceless goal from Tommy McGuigan and a string of late points inspired Tyrone to their third All-Ireland title of the decade.\n\nParagraph 11: For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty while serving as a Rocket Gunner attached to Company F, Second Battalion, First Marines, First Marine Division (Reinforced), in action against enemy aggressor forces near Sosa-ri, Korea, on 17 and September 20, 1950. Dug in a hill overlooking the main Seoul highway when six enemy tanks threatened to break through the Battalion position during a pre-dawn attack on September 17, Private First Class MONEGAN promptly moved forward with his bazooka under heavy hostile automatic weapons fire and engaged the lead tank at a range of less than 50 yards. After scoring a direct hit and killing the sole surviving tankman with his carbine as he came through the escape hatch, he boldly fired two more rounds of ammunition at the oncoming tanks, disorganizing the attack and enabling our tank crews to continue blasting with their 90-mm guns. With his own and an adjacent company's position threatened by annihilation when an overwhelming enemy tank-infantry force by-passed the area and proceeded toward the battalion Command Post during the early morning of September 20, he seized his rocket launcher and, in total darkness, charged down the slope of the hill where the tanks had broken through. Quick to act when illuminating shell hit the area, he scored a direct hit on one of the tanks as hostile rifle and automatic weapons fire raked the area at close range. Again exposing himself he fired another round to destroy a second tank and, as the rear tank turned to retreat, stood upright to fire and was fatally struck down by hostile machine-gun fire when another illuminating shell silhouetted him against the sky. Private First Class MONEGAN's daring initiative, gallant fighting spirit and courageous devotion to duty were contributing factors in the success of his company in repelling the enemy and his self-sacrificing efforts throughout sustain and enhance the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service. He gallantly gave his life for his country.\n\nParagraph 12: Mariano Paredes y Arrillaga was born in Mexico in the year 1797 and began his military career as a cadet on January 6, 1812, during the Mexican War of Independence, initially fighting on the side of the Spanish loyalists. He was promoted to second lieutenant standard bearer in 1816 and in 1818 joined a company of grenadiers. He saw action twenty times when in March, 1821 his regiment switched sides and joined Agustín de Iturbide's Plan of Iguala. He joined in the battles that occurred prior to the Trigarantine Army's entrance into Mexico City. At Acámbaro Iturbide promoted him to captain of chasseurs. In the action at Arroyo Hondo, he formed part of the reconnoitering party made up thirty men and a few horses under the command of Epitacio Sanchez and they were able to hold off a superior Spanish force until Iturbide arrived with reinforcements and the Spaniards were repulsed. For his services at this battle Iturbide granted Paredes a coat of arms. He was present at San Luis de la Paz where seven hundred prisoners of war were taken and he took part in the siege and capture of Querétaro and Mexico City for which he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel.\n\nParagraph 13: During the French and Indian War (the North American front of the Seven Years' War), France was defeated by Great Britain and in 1763 ceded control over their lands east of the River Mississippi to the British Crown. The French Crown made a separate deal with Spain, which took nominal control of much of the Illinois Country west of the great river. By the late 18th century, the Osage did extensive business with the French Creole fur trader René Auguste Chouteau, who was based in St. Louis; the city was part of territory under nominal Spanish control after the Seven Years' War but was dominated by French colonists. They were the de facto European power in St. Louis and other settlements along the Mississippi, building their wealth on the fur trade. In return for the Chouteau brothers' building a fort in the village of the Great Osage  southwest of St. Louis, the Spanish regional government gave the Chouteaus a six-year monopoly on trade (1794–1802). The Chouteaus named the post Fort Carondelet after the Spanish governor. The Osage were pleased to have a fur trading post nearby, as it gave them access to manufactured goods and increased their prestige among the tribes. Lewis and Clark reported in 1804 that the peoples were the Great Osage on the Osage River, the Little Osage upstream, and the Arkansas band on the Verdigris River, a tributary of the Arkansas River. The Osage then numbered some 5,500. The Osage and Quapaw suffered extensive losses from smallpox in 1801–1802. Historians estimate up to 2,000 Osage died in the epidemic.", "answers": ["Paragraph 4"], "length": 3934, "dataset": "passage_retrieval_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "914f104aa00de19ab09e6fa1214ed7eeb0c50e7f0078fddf"}
{"input": "On April 20, 2022, the United States Army announced the adoption of the new Next Generation Squad Weapon called the XM5. This weapon will use a .278 inch bullet with a 6.8 × 51 Common cartridge, which is also known as the .277 Fury in the commercial market. The 6.8 × 51 cartridge has a bullet size similar to the 7mm-08 Remington, with a difference of less than 1/128 of an inch in diameter. Both cartridges are based on the 7.62x51mm NATO case, but the 6.8 × 51 has a new manufacturing technique using a stainless-steel cartridge head. This allows it to withstand higher case pressures and achieve greater muzzle velocity and downrange energy compared to the 7mm-08 Remington. The non-combat version of the 6.8 × 51 cartridge uses a traditional all-brass case and is similar to the 7mm-08 Remington, with a slightly smaller bullet diameter. Overall, the 6.8 × 51 cartridge is closer to the true designation of \"7mm-08\" due to its bullet diameter.", "context": "Paragraph 1: Although dance-punk faded with the rise of New wave music in the early 1980s, it made a comeback in the late 1990s and early 2000s as part of the post-punk revival.

In Britain the combination of indie with dance-punk was dubbed new rave in publicity for Klaxons and the term was picked up and applied by the NME to bands including Trash Fashion, New Young Pony Club, Hadouken!, Late of the Pier, Test Icicles, and Shitdisco forming a scene with a similar visual aesthetic to earlier raves.\n\nParagraph 2: On December 3, 2017, longtime NFL coach and ESPN analyst Herm Edwards was announced as the next head coach of the Sun Devils. Edwards kicked off the 2018 season with a 2–0 record, including a marquee win over then #15 Michigan State. Despite the promising start, the Devils dropped four of their next five games, sitting with a 1–3 conference record. Arizona State surged, winning their next three, but fell just short to Oregon and a Pac-12 South title. The Territorial Cup was played at Arizona Stadium on Saturday, November 24. Arizona led the Sun Devils by 19 points entering the fourth quarter, but a wild comeback by ASU, capped off by what would've been a game winning field goal by Arizona, resulted in the cup staying in Tempe. The Sun Devils then faced Fresno State In the Las Vegas Bowl, losing 31–20 and completing the season with a 7–6(5–4) record. Herm Edwards started his second season off 3–0, once again beating #18 Michigan State, this time on the road. ASU dropped their conference opener against Colorado, but bounced back with two straight wins, including a victory over #15 Cal to improve to 2–1 in conference play before dropping four consecutive games, officially disqualifying them from the Pac-12 South title. Arizona State shocked #6 Oregon at home, winning 31–28 in front of a packed stadium. The Sun Devils capped off the season with a win over rival Arizona, 24–14, and a Sun Bowl victory over Florida State, 20–14, finishing with a record of 8–5(4–5). Due to the COVID-19 pandemic Pac-12 teams had only six games scheduled. Arizona State dropped their first game to #20 USC 28–27 in heartbreaking fashion, and their following two contests were cancelled due to COVID complications within the Arizona State program. The Sun Devils returned from their nearly month long hiatus with a game versus UCLA, which they lost at home 25–18. ASU traveled to take on Arizona in Tucson for the 94th installment of the Territorial Cup. The Sun Devils slaughtered the Wildcats, 70–7, retaining the Cup for the third straight year. In their fourth and final game of the season, Arizona State capped off the season with a 46–33 win over Oregon State to finish the season 2–2 (2–2). In June 2021, rumors began circulating of several NCAA violations committed by Herm Edwards and the Arizona State staff, which were confirmed by several articles, including one published on June 23 by Pete Thamel of Yahoo! Sports. As a result of the allegations, tight ends coach Adam Breneman, defensive backs coach Christian Hawkins, and wide receivers coach Prentice Gill were placed and remain on administrative leave. Despite the numerous allegations of violations and rumors that the entire staff may be fired after the season, Herm Edwards and his Sun Devils finished 8-5 overall and (6-3) in Pac-12 play. The season concluded with a 20-13 loss to Wisconsin in the SRS Distribution Las Vegas Bowl. During the 2021-2022 offseason, multiple coaches including Zak Hill and Antonio Pierce resigned.  17 players including the starting quarterback Jayden Daniels and All-American linebacker Eric Gentry, entered the transfer portal as a result of the investigation and NIL. On September 18th, 2022, Arizona State fired Edwards the day following a 30-21 loss to Eastern Michigan.\n\nParagraph 3: Born in Korgi, Kundapura taluk, Udupi district, Jayaprakash Hegde is a practising advocate and entered politics very early in his life. He has been elected thrice to the Karnataka Legislative Assembly as an independent candidate from the Brahmavara constituency and served as Minister holding the portfolio of Ports and Fisheries. He is married to Veena Hegde and has two children, a son, Nishanth and a daughter, Divya. He was Minister in charge for undivided Mangalore and Udupi District. It is due to his fight and determination that Udupi was finally declared an independent district in 1997. When his Brahmavar constituency was divided by the central government and no longer existed, he was forced to join the Congress party for political survival. In 2009 he contested unsuccessfully from the Udupi Chikmagalur for the 2009 Indian general election on an Indian National Congress ticket. Hegde has been elected to Lok Sabha from the same constituency following a by-election in 2012.  He was the most popular MP the constituency has had and had a tremendous track record of work in only 1.5 years. However, in 2014, because of the unprecedented Modi wave, Shobha Karandlaje, who is a close associate of BJP heavyweight B.S. Yediyurappa defeated Congress candidate, Jayaprakash Hegde, by a margin of nearly one lac votes. The Congress on Monday, December 14, 2015, expelled Jayaprakash Hegde, from the party for six years due to his popularity causing insecurities in Rajya Sabha MP Sri Oscar Fernandes. Jayaprakash Hegde being a worker's candidate and not a top leader's follower, faced several issues in Congress and due to his inability to obey the orders of Oscar Fernandes, he was removed from the party without notice. Standing as an independent candidate in the Dakshina Kannada constituency, he gave the Congress party a run for its money, when more than half of the party workers voted for him instead of the official Congress candidate. The Indian National Congress has not seen victory in coastal Karnataka ever since the ejection of Jayaprakash Hegde. His exit has left a big gap in leadership and team building in Coastal Karnataka Congress. He is said to be one of the cleanest politicians in the state, well respected by the general public, media and other politicians. He had successfully completed his MP term by undertaking many good things in a few months of the term, that couldn't be continued in the next terms by the other MP. Despite being out of power, he continues to do public service and brings in important projects for the constituency. He had refused to return to the Congress party recently, despite repeated requests.\n\nParagraph 4: The final major development of the Kub missile system was achieved during the development of its successor, the 9K37 \"Buk\" in 1974. Although the Buk is the successor to Kub it was decided that both systems could share some interoperability, the result of this decision was the \"Kub-M4\" system. The Kub-M4 used Kub-M3 components which could receive fire control information from the 9А310 transporter erector launcher and radar (TELAR) of the 9K37 Buk. The advantage of interoperability was an increase in the number of fire control channels and available missiles for each system as well as a faster service entry for Buk system components. The Kub-M4 was adopted into service in 1978 following completion of trials.\n\nParagraph 5: In 1946, a plebiscite was held which authorized the city of Kelowna to purchase the 320-acre Dickson Ranch for $20,000. The airport was opened in 1947 with a 3,000 foot long grass airstrip and a small terminal. Commercial service first began in 1958 by Canadian Pacific Airlines to Vancouver. In 1960, the runway was paved and extended to 5,350 feet. Through the 1960s and 1970s the airport continued to be expanded with a new terminal building, an air traffic control tower, and an onsite weather office. From the late 1960s to the mid 1980s, Pacific Western Airlines was the primary passenger air carrier serving the airport with Boeing 737-200 jetliners on nonstop and direct flights between Kelowna and Calgary, Edmonton, Vancouver and other small cities in British Columbia with the airline also operating Convair 640 and de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter turboprops as well as Douglas DC-3 and Piper Navajo prop aircraft on regional flights. By 1985, Pacific Western had become an all-jet airline and was operating up to sixteen departures a day with the Boeing 737-200 from Kelowna including direct, no change of plane service to Toronto. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s commercial and cargo traffic increased, necessitating more than $10 million of investment in upgrades to the terminal building, runway and airline operating facilities.\n\nParagraph 6: Several times during its history, the society has been faced with doctrinal controversy. In the 1970s, members became polarized over the precise definition of \"inerrancy\" (including questions about literal vs. non-literal language and the possibility of scribal errors). In 1983 the society expelled Robert Gundry for his views on the historicity of some of the events in the Gospel of Matthew. In 2003, the society narrowly decided against expelling Clark Pinnock and John E. Sanders for their beliefs about open theism. In 2007, Francis Beckwith resigned as president after he decided to be received into full communion in the Catholic Church. In 2008, Ray Van Neste and Dennis Burk introduced a proposal to further expand the doctrinal statement to include 11 points, but the motion ultimately failed.\n\nParagraph 7: The weak form alternatives to evidence-based anything include hearsay, opinion, rhetoric, discourse, advice (opinion), self deception, bias, belief, fallacy, or advocacy. The stronger forms include concerns about what counts as evidence, types of evidence, what evidence is available, sought or possible, who decides and pays for what evidence to be collected, and that evidence needs to be interpreted. Also there are the limitations to empiricism as well argued in the historical debate between empiricism and rationalism which is usually assumed to be resolved by Immanuel Kant by saying the two are inextricably interwoven. We reason what evidence is fair and what the evidence means (Critique of Practical Reason).  Critical theorists have raised objections to the claims made by those promoting evidence-based management.  From this perspective, what counts as \"evidence\" is considered as intrinsically problematic and contested because there are different ways of looking at social problems.  Furthermore, in line with perspectives from critical management studies, \"management\" is not necessarily an automatic good thing—it often involves the exercise of power and the exploitation of others. One response is to include a balanced treatment of such issues in reviewing and interpreting the research literature for practice.  Another response is to reconsider EBMgt in terms of cybernetic theory, whereby the \"requisite variety\" of evidence compiled across decision-makers is critical because \"compiling more evidence does not necessarily imply compiling a wider range of knowledge types\"  To that end, a promising alternative to the \"evidence-based\" approach would be the use of dialectic, argument, or public debate (argument is not to be confused with advocacy or quarreling). Aristotle, in works like Rhetoric, reasons that the way to test knowledge claims is to set up an inquiry method where a sceptical audience is encouraged to question evidence and its assumptions. To win an argument, convincing evidence is required. Calls for argumentative inquiry, or the argumentative turn may be fairer, safer and more creative than calls for evidence-based approaches.\n\nParagraph 8: For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at risk of life above and beyond the call of duty, in action on the western ridge of Mount Altuzzo, Italy. After bitter fighting his company had advanced to within 50 yards of the objective, where it was held up due to intense enemy sniper, automatic, small arms, and mortar fire. The enemy launched 3 desperate counterattacks in an effort to regain their former positions, but all 3 were repulsed with heavy casualties on both sides. All officers and noncommissioned officers of the 2d and 3d platoons of Company B had become casualties, and S/Sgt. Keathley, guide of the 1st platoon, moved up and assumed command of both the 2d and 3d platoons, reduced to 20 men. The remnants of the 2 platoons were dangerously low on ammunition, so S/Sgt. Keathley, under deadly small arms and mortar fire, crawled from 1 casualty to another, collecting their ammunition and administering first aid. He then visited each man of his 2 platoons, issuing the precious ammunition he had collected from the dead and wounded, and giving them words of encouragement. The enemy now delivered their fourth counterattack, which was approximately 2 companies in strength. In a furious charge they attacked from the front and both flanks, throwing hand grenades, firing automatic weapons, and assisted by a terrific mortar barrage. So strong was the enemy counterattack that the company was given up for lost. The remnants of the 2d and 3d platoons of Company B were now looking to S/Sgt. Keathley for leadership. He shouted his orders precisely and with determination and the men responded with all that was in them. Time after time the enemy tried to drive a wedge into S/Sgt. Keathley's position and each time they were driven back, suffering huge casualties. Suddenly an enemy hand grenade hit and exploded near S/Sgt. Keathley, inflicting a mortal wound in his left side. However, hurling defiance at the enemy, he rose to his feet. Taking his left hand away from his wound and using it to steady his rifle, he fired and killed an attacking enemy soldier, and continued shouting orders to his men. His heroic and intrepid action so inspired his men that they fought with incomparable determination and viciousness. For 15 minutes S/Sgt. Keathley continued leading his men and effectively firing his rifle. He could have sought a sheltered spot and perhaps saved his life, but instead he elected to set an example for his men and make every possible effort to hold his position. Finally, friendly artillery fire helped to force the enemy to withdraw, leaving behind many of their number either dead or seriously wounded. S/Sgt. Keathley died a few moments later. Had it not been for his indomitable courage and incomparable heroism, the remnants of 3 rifle platoons of Company B might well have been annihilated by the overwhelming enemy attacking force. His actions were in keeping with the highest traditions of the military service.\n\nParagraph 9: On April 20, 2022, the United States Army adopted the new Next Generation Squad Weapon, designated as the XM5 which will use a .278 inch bullet in a necked down 7.62×51mm NATO (colloquially .308 Winchester) case, the new cartridge is designated as 6.8 × 51 Common or alternatively known in the commercial market as the .277 Fury. The bullet size of the 6.8 × 51 cartridge is virtually identical to the bullet of the 7mm-08 Remington, the difference in diameter is less than 1/128 of an inch (0.2 mm) or approximately the thickness of two human hairs.  In addition as noted, both the 6.8 × 51 cartridge and the 7mm-08 Remington share the same parent case of the 7.62x51mm NATO (colloquially .308 Winchester), necked down to accept the respective bullet of each cartridge.  The most dramatic departure between these two cartridges concerns a new manufacturing technique used in relation to the 6.8 × 51 combat cartridge (designated as the 135 gr (9 g) Hybrid Match), which employs a stainless-steel cartridge head.   The 6.8 × 51 combat cartridge, with its new hybrid brass and stainless-steel case head can withstand case pressures up to 80,000 psi, which is significantly in excess of the pressures generated in a standard 7mm-08 Remington case and permits greater muzzle velocity and downrange energy when compared to the 7mm-08 Remington. As stated, the non-combat 6.8 × 51 cartridge (currently designated as the 135 gr (9 g) ELITE BALL FMJ) uses a conventional all-brass case and this non-combat cartridge is virtually the same as the 7mm-08 Remington except that the 6.8 × 51 cartridge 's bullet diameter is approximately 1/128 of an inch (0.2 mm) less in diameter.  In some ways, the 6.8 × 51 cartridge is actually closer to a true designation of \"7mm-08\" than the Remmington cartridge as the actual bullet diameter of the 6.8 × 51 common cartridge is 7.04 mm whereas the 7mm-08 Remington bullet diameter is a slightly larger 7.21 mm.\n\nParagraph 10: Pequeño Universo 2000 started working for the Mexican professional wrestling promotion Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) in the summer of 2008, which was after Universo 2000 stopped working regularly for that same company, as a rudo (Spanish term for a person portraying a bad guy character in wrestling). The first recorded match of his CMLL career took place on April 27, 2008 where he teamed up with Pierrothito to defeat Atomo and Shockercito in a Tag Team match. In September 2008 CMLL decided to add another championship to their Mini-Estrellas division when they made the Mexican National Lightweight Championship Mini-Estrellas exclusive. Pequeño Universo 2000 was placed in the first group of wrestlers hoping to qualify for the tournament final, but was eliminated in the Torneo cibernetico elimination match that took place on September 9, 2009. The Mini-Estrella division was featured in its first pay-per-view main event at CMLL's La Hora Cero (\"Zero Hour\") as 14 Mini-Estrellas all put their masks on the line in a steel cage match where the last two people in the ring would have to wrestle under Lucha de Apuesta (bet match) rules inside the steel cage. Whoever lost the match would be forced to unmask per Lucha Libre traditions. Pequeño Universo 2000 managed to climb out of the cage as the eight overall escapee, ensuring that he did not have to risk his mask at the end of the match. On August 14, 2009, Pequeño Universo 2000 was once again part of a multi-man steel cage match, this time the Mini-Estrellas competed with regular sized competitors in the match. Pequeño Universito 2000 escape the cage early on, keeping his mask safe once again. On March 7, 2010, Pequeño Universo 2000 competed in the 2010 Pequeños Reyes del Aire (\"Little Kings of the Air\") tournament alongside Bam Bam, Electrico, Pequeño Damián 666, Pequeño Olímpico, Pequeño Nitro, Pequeño Violencia, Pequeño Black Warrior, Shockercito, and Último Dragóncito in a Torneo cibernetico , a multi man elimination tournament. CMLL decided not to book Pequeño Universo 2000  as the tournament winner, instead he was eliminated early in the match. As part of CMLL's bicentennial celebrations, celebrating the 200th anniversary of Mexico's independence CMLL held a Torneo Bicentenario where the winner of the tournament would be \"promoted\" to compete in the regular division going forward. The second of the  cibernetico matches took place on August 17 and saw Pierrothito outlast Pequeño Universo 2000, as well as Aéreo, Astral, Bam Bam, Pequeño Halcón, Pequeño Black Warrior, and Último Dragóncito. On August 21, 2011, CMLL held a  Ruleta de la Muerte (Spanish for \"Roulette of Death\") tournament for the Mini-Estrellas division and include Pequeño Nitro as one of the participants. The Ruleta de la Muerte tournament format is based on the Lucha Libre Parejas Increibles match type where two wrestlers of opposite allegiance, have to team up. In a Ruleta de la Muerte tournament tag teams face off in a single elimination tournament, but unlike traditional tournaments it is the losing team that advances in this case. The team that loses the tag team match final must immediately wrestle against each other in a Lucha de Apuestas match, where either their mask or their hair is on the line. Pequeño Universo 2000 teamed up with Último Dragóncito to defeat the team of  Fantasy and Pequeño Black Warrior and thus did not have to risk their masks later in the tournament. On May 1, 2012, Pequeño Universo 2000 was one of 16 Mini-Estrellas to participate in the 2012 version of the Pequeños Reyes del Aire tournament as one of 16 competitors but CMLL decided not to have him win the tournament.", "answers": ["Paragraph 9"], "length": 3578, "dataset": "passage_retrieval_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "df98d0ca8b3caa0df1decac9bc11da941ff31b72bd677e8b"}
{"input": "This text describes the physical appearance of a male and female insect with a forewing length of 3.7 mm. The insect has various body parts in different colors, such as a greyish white frons, dark bronze brown vertex and neck tufts, and shining bronze brown thorax and tegulae. The legs are dark greyish brown with some white markings, and the wings are dark bronze brown with a reddish gloss. The forewings have several white lines in the basal area, a yellow transverse fascia, and various golden metallic spots. The hindwings are brownish grey. The undersides of the wings are greyish brown, with the white costal streak on the forewing being distinctly visible. The abdomen is bronze brown dorsally with a reddish gloss and has shining dark grey ventral side with yellowish white in the middle. The abdomen's segments are banded with shining white posteriorly and the anal tuft is white with a pale grey base.", "context": "Paragraph 1: A tall and physically strong forward, with a slender build, Zalayeta usually played as a centre-forward, and was primarily known for his technical skills and touch on the ball, as well as his eye for goal, heading, and ability in the air, which enabled him both to score and assist goals with his head; however, despite being a quick player in his youth, he was also known for his lack of pace as his career progressed. A team player, he was also known for his work-rate, ability to link-up with teammates, and hold up the ball with his back to goal, and was often involved in the build-up of attacking plays; he also possessed good movement, which enabled him to find spaces and get on the end of his teammates passes. Regarded as a promising but undisciplined player in his youth, he later developed into a more mature and reserved player as his career progressed, and was known for his tendency to score decisive goals for his teams, especially after coming off the bench, in particular during his time with Juventus, despite his lack of playing time with the club. He also had a strong personality, and was known for his exuberant goal celebrations with his arms lowered. He was nicknamed il panterone (\"the big panther,\" in Italian) in the media throughout his career, due to his movements and agility.\n\nParagraph 2: Stanley E. Hubbard, founder of KSTP radio, was one of broadcasting's foremost pioneers. In June 1939, he purchased one of the first television cameras available from RCA and began experimenting with television, but the television blackout brought on by World War II prevented any transmissions from being made. The first telecast by KSTP-TV reportedly occurred on December 7, 1947, when Jack Horner hosted a 25-minute program. On April 27, 1948, KSTP-TV signed on as the first commercial television station in Minnesota, although an experimental mechanical television station had been set up by WDGY station engineers more than a decade earlier. That station's license expired in 1938 as the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) was not interested in continuing mechanical TV broadcasts.\n\nParagraph 3: The label rose to prominence in the early 1990s by releasing albums by many of the ska genre's biggest acts, such as The Toasters, The Slackers, Hepcat, The Scofflaws, Mephiskapheles, The Pietasters and the debut album of Dance Hall Crashers — as well as many up and coming bands such as Spring Heeled Jack and Mustard Plug. The label also promoted non-Moon Ska bands, such as The Allstonians, Gals Panic, Less Than Jake, through various compilation albums. Some of these compilations featured the earliest recordings by No Doubt. In 1997, the label branched out to form Ska Satellite Records, in order to produce albums from smaller acts at a lower budget. Moon Ska also produced patches and T-shirts that were sold at ska concerts around the world.\n\nParagraph 4: A thrust fault is a type of reverse fault, in which the rock above the fault is displaced upwards relative to the rock below the fault. This distinguishes reverse faults from normal faults, where the rock above the fault is displaced downwards, or strike-slip faults, where the rock on one side of the fault is displaced horizontally with respect to the other side. Thrust faults are distinguished from other reverse faults because they dip at a relatively shallow angle, typically less than 45°, and show large displacements. In effect, the rocks above the fault have been thrust over the rocks below the fault. Thrust faults are characteristic of areas where the Earth's crust is being compressed by tectonic forces.\n\nParagraph 5: Outside North America, the film secured a release in 78 countries. It made $20.5 million from 2,407 screens in just 18 markets, placing behind The Force Awakens at the international box office chart and first among newly released films. The following weekend, it added $32.3 million from 25 markets on 4,849 screens. The film topped the international box office in its third weekend—the same weekend when it topped the US box office—overtaking The Force Awakens with $33.7 million from 48 markets. In the United Kingdom and Ireland, it took the No. 1 spot with $7.87 million or £5.2 million ($7.4 million) from 589 theaters and remained there for a second weekend declining by 24% with £3.86 million ($5.5 million), as well as for a third weekend. Similarly, in Russia, it passed The Force Awakens to take the top spot with $7.5 million from 1,063 screens. In France, it has the biggest opening day in Paris and the third-biggest opening weekend of 2016 with $8.2 million. It also opened at No. 1 in Mexico ($5.1 million), Spain ($4 million), the Netherlands ($1.3 million), Belgium ($1.1 million), Argentina ($955,000), Sweden ($914,000), South Korea, Denmark, Norway, Israel, Egypt and Portugal among other markets. In Germany ($4.6 million) and Australia ($2.9 million), it debuted at No. 2 both behind The Force Awakens and in Brazil ($2.17 million) behind The Ten Commandments. It had one of the top ten openings of all time for a Fox film, not accounting for inflation in South Korea with $5.7 million and went on to top the box office there for a second weekend with $3.22 million despite cold weather affecting theater attendance resulting in low box office performance. In Russia, despite not opening at No. 1, it topped the box office in its second weekend with $4.4 million—more than The Force Awakens—and went on to the top for a third weekend with $3.6 million. In China, it had an opening day of around $11 million from more than 11,000 screens, including $250,000 in midnight previews, and $23 million in two days. In its opening weekend, it grossed $31 million, coming in second place behind the animated Zootopia. IMAX comprised $2.3 million on 278 screens. In terms of total earnings, its largest markets outside of the US and Canada are China ($58.6 million), the United Kingdom ($32.8 million), Germany ($28.7 million) and France ($28.2 million). The film opened in Japan on March 23.\n\nParagraph 6: The most common vehicle uses of master cylinders are in brake and clutch systems. In brake systems, the operated devices are cylinders inside brake calipers and/or drum brakes; these cylinders may be called wheel cylinders or slave cylinders, and they push the brake pads towards a surface that rotates with the wheel (this surface is typically either a drum or a disc, a.k.a. a rotor) until the stationary brake pad(s) create friction against that rotating surface (typically the rotating surface is metal or ceramic/carbon, for their ability to withstand heat and friction without wearing-down rapidly). In the clutch system, the device which the master cylinder operates is called the slave cylinder; it moves the throw out bearing until the high-friction material on the transmission's clutch disengages from the engine's metal (or ceramic/carbon) flywheel. For hydraulic brakes or clutches alike, flexible high-pressure hoses or inflexible hard-walled metal tubing may be used; but the flexible variety of tubing is needed for at least a short length adjacent to each wheel, whenever the wheel can move relative to the car's chassis (this is the case on any car with steering and other suspension movements; some drag racers and go-karts have no rear suspension, as the rear axle is welded to the chassis, and some antique cars also have no rear suspension movement).\n\nParagraph 7: The first written record of Naumburg dates from 1012, when it was mentioned as the new castle of the Ekkehardinger, the Margrave of Meissen. It was founded at the crossing of two trade-routes, Via Regia and the Regensburg Road. The successful foundation not long beforehand of a Propstei Church on the site of the later Naumburg Cathedral was mentioned in the Merseburg Bishops' Chronicles in 1021. In 1028 Pope John XIX gave his approval for the transfer of the bishopric from Zeitz to Naumburg. Until 1568, during the Reformation, Naumburg was the seat of the bishops. The last Catholic bishop was Julius von Pflug. The foundation of the cathedral school is dated to 1030. Naumburg has been known as a town since 1144.\n\nParagraph 8: Male, female. Forewing length 3.7 mm. Head: frons shining greyish white, vertex and neck tufts shining dark bronze brown with reddish reflection, laterally and medially lined white, collar shining bronze brown; labial palpus first segment very short, white, second segment three-quarters of the length of third, dark brown with white longitudinal lines laterally and ventrally, third segment white, lined dark brown laterally, extreme apex white; scape dorsally shining dark bronze brown with a white anterior line, ventrally shining white, antenna shining dark brown with a white line from base to one-third, followed by an interrupted white line to one-half, followed towards apex by six dark brown segments, two white, two dark brown, two white, ten dark brown and seven white segments at apex. Thorax and tegulae shining bronze brown with reddish gloss, thorax with a white median line, tegulae lined white inwardly. Legs: shining dark greyish brown, femora ochreous-grey, foreleg with a white longitudinal line on tibia and tarsal segments one to three and five, tibia of midleg leg with white oblique basal and medial lines and a white apical ring, tarsal segments one to three and five with white apical rings, tibia of hindleg as midleg, tarsal segment one with white basal and apical rings, segments two and three with white apical rings, segments four and five dorsally white, spurs white dorsally, dark greyish brown ventrally. Forewing shining dark bronze brown with reddish gloss, five narrow white lines in the basal area, a costal from one-third to the transverse fascia, a subcostal from base to one-third, slightly bending from costa, a short medial just above fold, from one-fifth to just beyond the end of the subcostal, a subdorsal as long as the medial but slightly further from base, a dorsal from beyond base to one-quarter, a bright yellow transverse fascia beyond the middle, slightly narrowed towards dorsum on the inner edge and with an apical protrusion, bordered at the inner edge by two tubercular golden metallic subcostal and a subdorsal spots the subdorsal spot slightly further from base as the subdorsal, the subcostal spot with a small patch of blackish scales on the outside, bordered on the outer edge by a tubercular golden metallic costal and dorsal spot, the dorsal spot about three times as large as the costal, both spots with some dark bronze brown inward lining, the transverse fascia narrowly edged grey at costa, a white costal streak from the outer costal spot, a white apical line from the apical protrusion to apex, cilia dark bronze brown, paler towards dorsum. Hindwing shining brownish grey, cilia bronze brown. Underside: forewing shining greyish brown, the white costal streak distinctly visible, hindwing shining greyish brown in the costal half, shining grey in the dorsal half. Abdomen dorsally bronze brown with reddish gloss, ventrally shining dark grey, in the middle yellowish white, segments banded shining white posteriorly, anal tuft white, pale grey basally.\n\nParagraph 9: The Hanchey, associated Pate and Bradford families, and Cooper family came to northern Vernon from Holmes County, Florida (along the Florida and Alabama boundary), at the same time in 1860 (1850 Fl. Census records and 1860 La. Census records). The 1860 Census records these families living in neighboring houses northeast of Leesville near the intersection of two trails (one from Natchitoches to Lake Charles and another extending from Cotile Landing (present-day Boyce), a steamboat landing on the Red River, to East Texas. Census records and Turner genealogy also show that Edith Crumpler Cooper, mother of Lucy, had family members living in the same northern Vernon area since 1852 (three sisters married to the Turners who later moved to present-day Allen Parish and a brother). The Turners and Crumpler sisters and brother lived in Holmes County, Florida, before they took a long journey by wagon to Louisiana in 1852. Also, there is mention in genealogy of the Hanchey family that ancestors traveled by boat from Mobile to Louisiana. It is likely that all four of these families may have been traveling together and may have continued to travel southward by wagon through Dry Creek in the summer of 1860 (July or August) on their way to Marsh Bayou, northeast of Lake Charles. Several old Hanchey obituaries (over 100 years old) indicate the family first settled a few miles northeast of Lake Charles near the Calcasieu River in 1860.  Although this is only speculation, one Hanchey family member believes that there is some connection to the girl buried under the cedar tree. The grave by the cedar is in the center of the original Cooper family plot with marked graves dating back to the 1880s on three sides, and appears to be the grave of an 11 to 12-year-old girl described in the legend and identified in 1860 Census records of the Cooper family as Lucy Ann Cooper, approximately 12 years of age.  It is not known if the Cooper family remained long at Marsh Bayou or returned to northern Vernon, as tax and property records for these areas were destroyed by the burning of Alexandria during the Civil War and the Lake Charles Fire in the early 1900s, but Property Tax Records of Angelina County, Texas, show that the family lived in Angelina County, Texas (Lufkin area) after the Civil War (1866-1873),then returning to Dry Creek. All four families returned to Dry Creek, and many were buried within the shade or sight of the now ancient cedar tree, estimated to be 162–178 years old, a witness tree to the long history of Dry Creek.\n\nParagraph 10: Impulse response coefficients taken at intervals of M form a subsequence, and there are M such subsequences (phases) multiplexed together. The dot product is the sum of the dot products of each subsequence with the corresponding samples of the x[•] sequence. Furthermore, because of downsampling by M, the stream of x[•] samples involved in any one of the M dot products is never involved in the other dot products. Thus M low-order FIR filters are each filtering one of M multiplexed phases of the input stream, and the M outputs are being summed. This viewpoint offers a different implementation that might be advantageous in a multi-processor architecture. In other words, the input stream is demultiplexed and sent through a bank of M filters whose outputs are summed. When implemented that way, it is called a polyphase filter.\n\nParagraph 11: In 1347 he returned to the Italian peninsula and entered the service of Louis I the Great, king of Hungary and Poland, whom he assisted to obtain possession of Naples. Werner of Urslingen's troops defeated  Louis, Prince of Taranto (Joan's husband) near Naples, and King Louis was able to enter the city; the following year, however, Werner was accused of collaboration with Joan, and arrested. After having been freed, he entered the service of the Caetani of Fondi with 3,000 men, to attack the Orsini at Supino. In 1348 he sacked  and destroyed Anagni: this spurred Perugia and other communes to muster an army against him, and Werner, whose troops had also been struck by the plague, was forced to retreat. He then joined the service of the Papal States, for which he conquered several territories, and then that of Joan of Naples, whom he helped to return in Naples. In 1349, after a period of fighting in Apulia (of which he was named viceroy), he was ambushed by the Hungarian Voivoda of Transylvania, Stephen Lackfi, and defeated. Werner then mustered an army of 3,000 Hungarian, German, and Neapolitan knights and 2,000 Lombard foot soldiers to counter-attack Stephen, defeating him before Naples.\n\nParagraph 12: The devotional outpourings of the Alvars, composed during the early medieval period of Tamil history, were the catalysts behind the Bhakti Movement through their hymns of worship to Vishnu and his avatars. They praised the Divya Desams, the 108 divine realms of deities affiliated to Vaishnavism. The poetry of the Alvars echoes bhakti to God through love, and in the ecstasy of such devotions they sang hundreds of songs which embodied both depth of feeling and the felicity of expressions. The collection of their hymns is known as the Naalayira Divya Prabandham. The bhakti literature that sprang from Alvars has contributed to the establishment and sustenance of a culture that deviated from the Vedic religion and rooted itself in devotion as the only path for salvation. In addition, they contributed to Tamil devotional verses independent of a knowledge of Sanskrit. As a part of the legacy of the Alvars, five Vaishnavite philosophical traditions (sampradayas) developed over a period of time.\n\nParagraph 13: Craig arrives and meets Raina's family, which includes her two adopted siblings, Ben and Laura, her older biological sister Julie, and her parents, who are undergoing a divorce. Raina feels responsible for taking care of Ben and Laura, who are mentally disabled, as well as Julie's newborn daughter. Despite growing closer during the visit, the two return to their separate lives, but Raina eventually decides to break off the relationship. They maintain a friendship for a time, talking on the phone with diminishing frequency (and increasing inanity). Ultimately, Craig tells Raina that their friendship, too, is over. Craig then destroys everything Raina had ever given to him, and every memento of their relationship, except for the quilt she made. He stores it in the attic of his childhood home, and moves out to start his own life elsewhere. Craig comes to terms with religion and his spiritual identity while away from his family, and confides in his brother that he is no longer a Christian, but still believes in God and the teachings of Jesus. He returns to his childhood home after several years, seemingly a different person.\n\nParagraph 14: Hurricane Four was first monitored as an area of low pressure over French West Africa on September 2, 1947. Steadily tracking westward, the system was quickly classified as a depression before moving into the Atlantic Ocean near Dakar, Senegal, on September 4. Shortly thereafter, weather agencies lost track of the system over water due to a lack of ships in the region. However, later analysis determined that the cyclone obtained tropical storm status, with maximum sustained winds of , during the morning of September 5. The storm gradually intensified as it tracked nearly due west, but then maintained an intensity of  for nearly five days, taking a west-southwest turn on September 7 before turning to the northwest two days later, when the steamship Arakaka provided confirmation of its existence. Another few days later, the cyclone began to intensify more rapidly as its forward speed increased; between September 10 and 15, reconnaissance missions by the United States Navy began monitoring the hurricane. At 1500 UTC on September 11, a navy aircraft first penetrated the storm; in less than 24 hours, the storm rapidly strengthened into the equivalence of a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale, and shortly afterward attained peak winds of , roughly 18 hours after being classified a tropical storm, as another aircraft registered a barometric pressure of 977 mb (28.84 inHg), a drop of 22 mb in 24 hours. On September 13, another airplane at 1930 UTC confirmed that the storm had deepened further to 952 mb (28.11 inHg) and its eye shrunk to ; by that time the hurricane had reached high-end Category 3 intensity, and intensified into a Category 4 hurricane six hours later. The same mission reported a double eyewall, a feature replaced by a large eye by the time the storm hit the Bahamas and Florida. The next day, the storm attained the minimum pressure, 938 mb (27.70 inHg), recorded by aircraft reconnaissance during its life span, peaking in intensity as a strong Category 4 hurricane. On September 15, however, the storm lost this intensity. Early on September 16, as its movement slowed greatly and turned westward near the northern Bahamas, the cyclone weakened into a Category 3 hurricane with winds of . Following the phonetic alphabet from World War II, the U.S. Weather Bureau office in Miami, Florida, which then worked in conjunction with the military, named the storm George, though such names were apparently informal and did not appear in public advisories until 1950, when the first Atlantic storm to be so designated was Hurricane Fox.", "answers": ["Paragraph 8"], "length": 3555, "dataset": "passage_retrieval_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "7a554a7c3661c5c14da1314246d92a7de88725f7c1550958"}

In 1709, a great flood overflowed Fort Louis de la Mobile: because of this and the outbreaks of disease, Bienville ordered the settlement to move downriver to the present site of Mobile, Alabama in 1711 where another wooden Fort Louis was built. By 1712, when Antoine Crozat took over administration of Louisiana by royal appointment, the colony boasted a population of 400 persons. In 1713, a new governor arrived from France, and Bienville moved west where, in 1716, he established Fort Rosalie on the present site of Natchez, Mississippi. The new governor, Antoine Laumet de La Mothe, sieur de Cadillac, did not last long due to mismanagement and a lack of growth in the colony. He was recalled to France in 1716, and Bienville again took the helm as governor, serving the office for less than a year until the new governor, Jean-Michel de Lepinay, arrived from France. Lepinay's tenure was short lived, however, as Crozat had relinquished control of the colony and its administration to John Law and his Company of the Indies. In 1718, Bienville found himself once again governor of Louisiana, and it was during this term that Bienville established the city of New Orleans, Louisiana.\n\nParagraph 2: Based in the old Pacific Bell building on Rose Street at Shattuck Avenue in Berkeley, California, Berkeley Systems grew to 120 employees and US$30 million annual revenue before it was acquired by the Sierra On-Line division of CUC International in 1997 for $13.8 million. Vivendi Universal’s subsequent acquisition of Sierra, and a host of similar enterprises, enjoined diverse competing sales and marketing departments with one sole directive: sell Web banner advertisements. As a result, Berkeley Systems became the U.S. headquarters of French-owned Flipside.com. In early 2000, Berkeley Systems was folded into the fledgling Los Angeles-based gambling site iWin.com, per the terms of that site's acquisition by Vivendi.\n\nParagraph 3: Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong attended the day's meetings. The Program of Seminars ends on this day and delegates discussed about the future of global economy, poverty and the future of Asia. Ministers of the members of the International Monetary Fund approved a plan to give more powers and voting rights to People's Republic of China, Mexico, South Korea and Turkey. This vote had 90.6% of the members supporting the move. However, the IMF remains dominated by Europe, the United States and Japan. China has less power in the IMF, although its economy is larger than Belgium and Netherlands combined. The IMF and World Bank have been criticised by Brazil, Argentina, Asian and African nations for prescribing severe belt-tightening measures during their economic crisis. The American government sees the reform of the IMF to redress global economic imbalances, which were cited as one of the biggest menaces to world growth. The IMF is stepping up in its financial surveillance through multilateral consultations to make it more effective and relevant. The World Bank president Paul Wolfowitz said that the poor should not be abandoned because their governments are weak, otherwise the people would be penalised twice. The IMF and World Bank see the need to combat corruption in developing countries. The World Bank will work with developing countries by working with countries or offered through projects on the countries itself. Wolfowitz said that the issue of governance is being addressed, and the most important thing is to take the principles in the paper, applying it in terms of budget allocation. Matters may be complicated due to lack of political will. He added that working with developing countries is a starting point and must work with banks, global organisations and other governments to stop corruption in their nations. African nations also called for more voting rights in the IMF for countries in their continent, at forums held in Africa itself.\n\nParagraph 4: In 2000, Harcourt recorded his debut mini-album Maplewood EP straight to a 4-track recorder at Wootton Manor. After signing with Heavenly Records and releasing Maplewood in November 2000, Harcourt recorded his debut studio album Here Be Monsters with producers Gil Norton and Tim Holmes. The album was released in June 2001, and charted on the UK Albums Chart at No. 84. One month after its release, the album was nominated for the 2001 Mercury Prize. He later described the period as \"very strange for me, I was naive, I knew nothing. I was used to making music in my room, so it felt very odd being on stage\". In the US he signed with Capitol Records.\n\nParagraph 5: Rodion Cămătaru was born on 22 June 1958 in Strehaia and debuted in Divizia A with Universitatea Craiova on 10 November 1974 in a 1–1 against CFR Cluj. He spent twelve seasons with Universitatea, scoring 122 goals in 288 Divizia A matches, being part of the \"Craiova Maxima\" generation that won two consecutive league titles in 1980 and 1981, in the first he contributed with 26 appearances in which he scored 17 goals and in the second he scored 23 goals in 33 matches, also winning four cups in the years 1977, 1978 in which he scored a goal in the 3–1 victory from the final against Olimpia Satu Mare, 1981 and 1983 in which he scored a double in the 2–1 final against Politehnica Timișoara and managed to reach the 1982–83 UEFA Cup semi-finals, making 9 appearances in the campaign. In 1986, he was transferred to Dinamo București, where he became the Divizia A top goalscorer and European Golden Boot winner in the first season spent at the club with 44 goals scored in 33 games, but as he scored 26 goals in the last 9 matches of the season, his European Golden Boot was retired because FIFA's investigations claimed the goals were scored unfairly and the trophy was awarded to Anton Polster, however Cămătaru was allowed to keep his copy of the trophy. In 1987 he was nominated for the Ballon d'Or. In 1989 he went to play in Belgium at Charleroi, after two seasons he moved in Netherlands at Heerenveen where he spent three seasons, scoring his last goal as a professional in the 1992–93 KNVB Cup final, which was lost with 6–2 in front of Ajax Amsterdam. He has a total of 378 Divizia A appearances in which he scored 198 goals and 47 matches played with 7 goals scored in European competitions. In 2020 with the occasion of Heerenveen's 100th anniversary, Cămătaru was selected the best striker in the club's history in front of Ruud van Nistelrooy and Klaas-Jan Huntelaar.\n\nParagraph 6: The phrase \"It's all gone Pete Tong\", where the name is used as rhyming slang for \"a bit wrong\", was reputedly coined by Paul Oakenfold in late 1987 in an article about acid house called \"Bermondsey Goes Balearic\" for Terry Farley and Pete Heller's Boys Own fanzine. It's All Gone Pete Tong is also the title of a 2004 film which portrays a fictional DJ's experiences as he realizes he is becoming deaf. Tong appears briefly in the film. It is also the name Tong has adopted for his club night at the nightclub Pacha in Ibiza and his nightly radio programme in the United States on iHeartRadio's \"Evolution\" EDM format platform.\n\nParagraph 7: Shuja-ud-Daula's Turkic and Iranian Persian Twelver Shia Muslim royal family ruling the Oudh (Awadh) state in India obtained their eunuchs (khwajasarais) through subduing Hindu kings rebellions. Jawahir Ali was a eunuch of Oudh state who was born a Hindu. The Rajas of Khairabad rebelled since they refused to pay taxes to the Twelver Shia district administrator Nawab Muhammad Ali Khan so Nawab Muhammad Ali defeated the Hindus in battle  The castrated Hindu boys were converted to Twelver Shia Islam and given Muslim names after being enslaved and then educated. The Twelver Shia Turkic Nawab of Oudh Shuja-ud-Daula (a descendant of the Turkic Twelver Shia Qara Qoyunlu dynasty through his father Safdar Jang) made Nawab Muhammad Ali Khan give his eunuchs including Jawahir Ali to him. Jawahir Ali (Joahir Ali) served as nazir eunuch to Bahu Begum (Bahu Begam, Bahoo Begum or Buhoo Begum) (Begum Amanat-uz Zahra Bano), the Iranian Persian wife of the Turkic Twelver Shia ruler of Oudh, Shuja-ud-Daula. Bahu Begum owned multiple eunuchs, all of them of Indian Hindu background. One of them was born a eunuch with defective genital and sold to the Nawab by his family, Darab Ali Khan and he was a general agent of Bahu Begam after Jawahir Ali. Jawahir Ali was the first general agent of Bahu Begam.\n\nParagraph 8: In organisms that use this method of dosage compensation, the presence of one or more X chromosomes must be detected early on in development, as failure to initiate the appropriate dosage compensation mechanisms is lethal. Male specific lethal proteins (MSLs) are a family of four proteins that bind to the X chromosome exclusively in males. The name “MSL” is used because mutations in these genes cause inability to effectively upregulate X-linked genes appropriately, and are thus lethal to males only and not their female counterparts. SXL regulates pre-messenger RNA in males to differentially splice MSLs and result in the appropriate increase in X chromosome transcription observed in male Drosophila. The immediate target of SXL is male specific lethal-2 (MSL-2). Current dogma suggests that the binding of MSL-2 at multiple sites along the SXL gene in females prevents proper MSL-2 translation, and thus, as previously stated, represses the possibility for X-linked genetic upregulation in females. However, all other transcription factors in the MSL family—maleless, MSL-1, and MSL-3—are able to act when SXL is not expressed, as in the case in males. These factors act to increase male X chromosome transcriptional activity. Histone acetylation and the consequent upregulation of X-linked genes in males is dictated by the MSL complex. Specifically, special roX non-coding RNAs on the MSL complexes facilitate binding to the single male X chromosome, and dictate acetylation of specific loci along the X chromosome as well as the formation of euchromatin. Though these RNAs bind at specific sites along the male X chromosome, their effects spread along the length of the chromosome and have the ability to influence large-scale chromatin modifications. The implications of this spreading epigenetic regulation along the male X chromosome is thought to have implications for understanding the transfer of epigenetic activity along long genomic stretches.\n\nParagraph 9: The 1930 United States Senate elections occurred in the middle of Republican President Herbert Hoover's term. The 32 seats of Class 2 were contested in regular elections, and special elections were held to fill vacancies. With the Great Depression beginning to take hold, Republican incumbents became unpopular, and Democrats picked up a net of eight seats, erasing the Republican gains from the previous election cycle. Republicans retained control of the U.S. Senate since Vice President Charles Curtis cast the tie-breaking vote. This was the first of four consecutive Senate elections during the Depression in which Democrats made enormous gains, achieving a cumulative pick-up of 34 seats.\n\nParagraph 10: It is made by stirring chickpea flour into a mixture of water and olive oil to form a loose batter, pouring it into a pan to make a pancake typically 4mm thick, and baking it for a few minutes, traditionally in an open oven in a tin-plated copper baking-pan. Farinata may be seasoned with fresh rosemary, pepper and sea salt. Traditionally farinata is cut into irregularly shaped triangular slices, and eaten (with no toppings) on small plates with optional black pepper. Elsewhere in Italy - traditionally in Tuscany, where it is called cecina (from the Italian word for chickpea, ceci) - it is served stuffed into small focaccia (mainly in Pisa) or between two slices of bread, as it is traditional in Livorno. It is sold in pizzerias and bakeries.\n\nParagraph 11: Anderson's aptitude for journalism appeared at the early age of 12 when he began writing the Boy Scouts Column for The Deseret News. He published his first articles in his local newspaper, The Murray Eagle. He edited his high school newspaper, The Granitian. He joined The Salt Lake Tribune in 1940, where his muckraking exploits included infiltrating polygamous Mormon fundamentalist sects. In 1944, he joined the United States Merchant Marine and served on cargo ships that went to New Guinea and India. In the spring of 1945, he resigned from the Merchant Marine, and became a war correspondent stationed in Chungking, China. Shortly after World War II ended, he was drafted into the United States Army, and served until the fall of 1946 as an armed forces newsman and radio broadcaster. While in the Army, Anderson worked on the Shanghai edition of Stars and Stripes, produced by troops and XMHA, the Armed Forces' radio station. After his stint in the Army, Anderson was hired by Drew Pearson for the staff of his column, the \"Merry-Go-Round\". When Pearson died in 1969, Anderson inherited responsibility for this column and gave his own name to it – Washington Merry-go-Round. In its heyday, Anderson's column was the most influential and widely read in the U.S.; published in nearly a thousand newspapers, he reached an audience of 40 million people. He co-founded Citizens Against Government Waste with J. Peter Grace in 1984.\n\nParagraph 12: The Packers received the opening kickoff and stormed 81 yards needing only 7 plays with James Starks running in a 3-yard touchdown. The drive was so efficient they didn't even face a third down. As a sign of things to come, the Falcons struck right back with a 4-yard Steven Jackson touchdown run to end a 72-yard drive. The Packers, as they did often, answered the Falcons with another touchdown of their own. Showing off their ability to kill the clock with long drives, the Packers used 13 plays and over 7 minutes to go 80 yards with Lacy running in his second touchdown of the game on the first play of the second quarter. After a Falcons three-and-out the Packers again worked the clock, driving 80 yards in just under six minutes, but the Falcons defense made a rare stand and Crosby kicked a field goal. Morgan Burnett intercepted Matt Ryan on their next possession and returned it 32 yards to the Falcons 15. Four plays later Rodgers threw a 1-yard touchdown pass to Lacy. The Falcons offense continued to sputter as they punted. The Packers stayed hot with Rodgers hitting Nelson for a 10-yard touchdown with twenty-four seconds left in the half. The Falcons managed to reach field goal range with the big play being a Ryan 30-yard bomb to Julio Jones. However, Brad Jones blocked Matt Bryant's 53-yard field goal attempt, leaving the score 31–7 at halftime. The Falcons busted out in the third quarter. On the first play from scrimmage Ryan launched a pass to Jones for 79 yards the Packers 3-yard line. However, they lost two yards on their next three plays, but on fourth-and-goal from the 5-yard line Ryan threw a 5-yard touchdown pass to Eric Weems, trimming the score to 31–14. After a Packers punt the Falcons reached the Packers 31, but were forced to settle for a 50-yard field goal. The Packers added a field goal on their next drive, the Falcons mimicked the Packers clock-killing strategy (possibly, ultimately to their detriment) taking six-and-a-half minutes off the clock as they traveled 72 yards with Ryan dropping a 22-yard touchdown pass into the hands of Jones who had the best game of his career. However, Rodgers and the Packers offense regrouped and stormed 74 yards in four plays with Rodgers hitting his number one guy Nelson for a 60-yard touchdown pass. The Falcons' Rashede Hageman blocked Crosby's PAT keeping the deficit two scores at 40–24. The shootout continued as the Falcons answered right back with Ryan lobbing a 1-yard touchdown pass to Roddy White, but the two-point conversion failed which would prove critical as the score remained 40–30. The Falcons onside kick attempt failed, but they didn't allow a first down, keeping them in the game as Crosby nailed a 53-yard field goal, increasing the lead to 43–30. Ryan continued to shred the Packers' defense, darting a 2-yard touchdown pass to Harry Douglas, making the score 43–37 and giving the Falcons a chance to pull off the improbable comeback. However, a 41-yard run by James Starks enabled the Packers to run out the clock and hold on for the win.", "answers": ["Paragraph 2"], "length": 2844, "dataset": "passage_retrieval_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "6736067383c905ddb7655f4830a0675cb524527792b92e9e"}
{"input": "The text discusses the historical development of factor analysis in the field of psychometrics. It begins with Charles Spearman's 1904 paper, which introduced a crude form of factor analysis that examined the appropriateness of a single factor model. Limited work on factor analysis followed until Thurstone published his paper in 1931, in which he expanded on Spearman's work to include multiple factors. In 1932, Hotelling presented a more accurate method of extracting factors called principal components analysis, but Thurstone rejected it due to distortions caused by setting commonalities to 1.0. Thurstone later presented the centroid method, which allowed for the analysis of a larger number of variables. He used tetrachoric correlation coefficients to estimate continuous variable correlations from dichotomous variables, and with his colleagues, published computing diagrams that reduced the calculations necessary for these coefficients. Thurstone's contributions were recognized at a 2004 conference, and his approach to factor analysis remains an important method in psychological research and other fields. It is now considered part of a family of methods for analyzing the covariance structure of variables.", "context": "Paragraph 1: In 1864 the South Australian government, desiring to open up the Northern Territory, organised a survey party under Finniss, appointing him as the Government Resident of the Northern Territory and giving him instructions to examine the Adelaide River and the coastline to the west and east of it. Finniss chose a site, Escape Cliffs, near the mouth of the Adelaide River for the settlement, but his choice was much criticised. He had problems with insubordination of his officers, who were jealous of the attention he paid to some of the lesser ranks (notably W. P. Auld and J. W. O. Bennett); nor was he popular with the men, who had expected to spend time exploring and not as much on tedious duties such as keeping guard on the stores; he had not secured adequate supplies for the expedition; and did not enjoy good relations with the local Aboriginal people. \n\nParagraph 2: The little mythography that belongs to the Lares seems inventive and poetic. With no traditional, systematic theology to limit their development, Lares became a single but usefully nebulous type, with many functions. In Cicero's day, one's possession of domestic Lares laid moral claim of ownership and belonging to one's domicile. Festus identifies them as \"gods of the underworld\" (di inferi). To Flaccus, they are ancestral genii (s. genius). Apuleius considers them benevolent ancestral spirits; they belong both to the underworld and to particular places of the human world. To him, this distinguishes them from the divine and eternal genius which inhabits, protects and inspires living men: and having specific physical domains, they cannot be connected with the malicious, vagrant lemures. In the 4th century AD the Christian polemicist Arnobius, claiming among others Varro (116–27 BC) as his source, describes them as once-human spirits of the underworld, therefore ancestral manes-ghosts; but also as \"gods of the air\", or the upper world. He also – perhaps uniquely in the literature but still claiming Varro's authority – categorises them with the frightful larvae. The ubiquity of Lares seems to have offered considerable restraints on Christian participation in Roman public life. In the 3rd century AD, Tertullian remarks the inevitable presence of Lares in pagan households as good reason to forbid marriage between pagan men and Christian women: the latter would be \"tormented by the vapor of incense each time the demons are honored, each solemn festivity in honor of the emperors, each beginning of the year, each beginning of the month.\" Yet their type proved remarkably persistent. In the early 5th century AD, after the official suppression of non-Christian cults, Rutilius Namatianus could write of a famine-stricken district whose inhabitants had no choice but to \"abandon their Lares\" (thus, to desert their rat-infested houses).\n\nParagraph 3: Halcyon Renard (voiced by Robert Culp) was an elderly businessman who is the CEO of Cyberbiotics, father of Fox, ex-husband to Anastasia, and rival and later father-in-law to David Xanatos. He is confined to a powered reclining version of a wheelchair for unknown reasons; the chair is weaponized for his self-defense needs, along with other devices. After confronting Goliath about his role in destroying his first airship, he formed a friendship with the Manhattan Clan's leader after the pair worked together to save the second airship. It's suggested in \"The Cage\", that Halcyon lent a lab to Goliath so Dr. Sevarius could create a cure for the Labyrinth Clan. Halcyon's family name, Renard, is the French word for fox. Like Xanatos, he briefly flirted with immortality — with Renard's method being different, as he intended to transfer his own consciousness into a Golem, the legendary protector of the Ashkenazim living in Prague during Renaissance times, and still in existence in the late 20th century within the Gargoyles storyline. This form of what turned out to be a selfishly-acquired form of \"immortality\" did not go well for Renard, until Goliath managed to change Halcyon's mind for the better, convincing him to leave the Golem's lithic body behind. Unlike Xanatos, Halcyon was more conscientious of his actions, adhering strongly to his own well-developed ideals of personal integrity and near-complete sincerity for both himself, his firm's employees and others he had contact with. Indeed, one of the things that help the elderly man and the Manhattan Clan's leader bond and become friends is that Renard challenged Goliath to accept responsibility for his part in destroying the first airship. Goliath apparently grew to respect the older man because of his strong adherence to his own morals. It is worth noting that Renard and his assistant, Preston Vogel participated in a desperate attempt to stop Oberon from abducting his grandson, Alexander and taking the child to Avalon. When Vogel gently challenged his employer as to his reasons; noting that Renard hated his son-in-law and didn't trust his own daughter due to her lack of morals; Renard answered frankly, that he was doing it for his grandson and no one else. He was far less Machiavellian and malevolent than Xanatos.\n\nParagraph 4: In 1904 Charles Spearman published a paper that largely founded the field of psychometrics and included a crude form of factor analysis that attempted to determine if a single factor model was appropriate. There was limited subsequent work on factor analysis until Thurstone published a paper in 1931 called Multiple Factor Analysis, which expanded Spearman's single-factor analysis to include more than one factor. In 1932, Hotelling presented a more accurate method of extracting factors, which he called principal components analysis. Thurstone rejected Hotelling's approach because it set the commonalities to 1.0, and Thurstone realized that will introduce distortions to the factor loadings when variables include unique components. Hotelling's method was also limited by the fact that it required too much calculation to be usable with more than about ten variables. A year after Hotelling's paper, Thurstone presented a more efficient way of extracting factors, called the centroid method, which allowed the factor analysis of a far larger number of variables. Later that year he gave his presidential address to the American Psychological Association wherein he presented the results of several factor analyses, including a factor analysis of 60 adjectives describing personality traits, showing how they could be reduced to five personality traits. He also presented analyses of 37 mental health symptoms, of attitudes towards 12 controversial social issues, and of 9 IQ tests. In those analyses, Thurstone had made use of tetrachoric correlation coefficients, a method for estimating continuous variable correlations from dichotomous variables. Tetrachorics require extensive calculations but in early 1933, he and two colleagues at the University of Chicago published a set of computing diagrams that greatly reduce the calculations needed for  those coefficients, another aspect of making his method of factor analysis practical with more than just a few variables. His 1933 presidential address was published in early 1934 with the title Vectors of the Mind. It lacked methodological and mathematical details of his technique, which is then the subject of this book. A 2004 conference called Factor Analysis at 100 produced a book with two chapters that document the historical importance Thurstone's contributions to factor analysis. Thurstone's approach to factor analysis remains an important method in psychological research and it has since been used in numerous other fields of study. It is now considered part of a family of methods for analyzing the covariance structure of variables, which includes principal components analysis, exploratory factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, and structural equation modeling.\n\nParagraph 5: Some basic conventions, such as (1) that animal/human homolog (ortholog) pairs differ in letter case (title case and all caps, respectively) and (2) that the symbol is italicized when referring to the gene but nonitalic when referring to the protein, are often not followed by contributors to medical journals. Many journals have the copyeditors restyle the casing and formatting to the extent feasible, although in complex genetics discussions only subject-matter experts (SMEs) can effortlessly parse them all. One example that illustrates the potential for ambiguity among non-SMEs is that some official gene names have the word \"protein\" within them, so the phrase \"brain protein I3 (BRI3)\" (referring to the gene) and \"brain protein I3 (BRI3)\" (referring to the protein) are both valid. The AMA Manual gives another example: both \"the TH gene\" and \"the TH gene\" can validly be parsed as correct (\"the gene for tyrosine hydroxylase\"), because the first mentions the alias (description) and the latter mentions the symbol. This seems confusing on the surface, although it is easier to understand when explained as follows: in this gene's case, as in many others, the alias (description) \"happens to use the same letter string\" that the symbol uses. (The matching of the letters is of course acronymic in origin and thus the phrase \"happens to\" implies more coincidence than is actually present; but phrasing it that way helps to make the explanation clearer.) There is no way for a non-SME to know this is the case for any particular letter string without looking up every gene from the manuscript in a database such as NCBI Gene, reviewing its symbol, name, and alias list, and doing some mental cross-referencing and double-checking (plus it helps to have biochemical knowledge). Most medical journals do not (in some cases cannot) pay for that level of fact-checking as part of their copyediting service level; therefore, it remains the author's responsibility. However, as pointed out earlier, many authors make little attempt to follow the letter case or italic guidelines; and regarding protein symbols, they often won't use the official symbol at all. For example, although the guidelines would call p53 protein \"TP53\" in humans or \"Trp53\" in mice, most authors call it \"p53\" in both (and even refuse to call it \"TP53\" if edits or queries try to), not least because of the biologic principle that many proteins are essentially or exactly the same molecules regardless of mammalian species. Regarding the gene, authors are usually willing to call it by its human-specific symbol and capitalization, TP53, and may even do so without being prompted by a query. But the end result of all these factors is that the published literature often does not follow the nomenclature guidelines completely.\n\nParagraph 6: In 1440 the town joined the anti-Teutonic Prussian Confederation, and upon its request in 1454 Polish King Casimir IV Jagiellon signed the act of incorporation of the region along with Reszel to Poland, an event that sparked the Thirteen Years' War. In 1455 the Teutonic Knights captured the town and later on, in 1462, ceded their power to the Warmian bishop, who once more in 1464 recognized the Polish King as the rightful ruler of Warmia with Reszel. The incorporation of Reszel to the Kingdom of Poland was confirmed in a peace treaty signed in Toruń in 1466. In the 17th century, the Jesuits came to Reszel and established a college in 1632 and the Polish King John II Casimir Vasa created a scholarship fund for its students.\n\nParagraph 7: During the first half of the 18th century, a free-reed mouth organ  called a sheng was brought to Russia. That instrument received attention due to its use by Johann Wilde. The instrument's free-reed was unknown in Europe at the time, and the concept quickly spread from Russia across Europe. Christian Gottlieb Kratzenstein (1723–1795), professor of physiology at Copenhagen, was credited with the first free-reed instrument made in the Western world, after winning the annual prize in 1780 from the Imperial Academy of St. Petersburg. According to Curt Sachs, Kratzenstein suggested that the instrument be made, but that the first organ with free reeds was made by Abbé Georg Joseph Vogler in Darmstadt. The harmonium's design incorporates free reeds and derives from the earlier regal. A harmonium-like instrument was exhibited by Gabriel-Joseph Grenié (1756–1837) in 1810.  He called it an orgue expressif (expressive organ), because his instrument was capable of greater expression, as well as of producing a crescendo and diminuendo. Alexandre Debain improved Grenié's instrument and gave it the name harmonium when he patented his version in 1840. There was concurrent development of similar instruments. Jacob Alexandre and his son Édouard introduced the orgue mélodium in 1844. Hector Berlioz included it in his Grand traité d'instrumentation et d'orchestration modernes, published in Paris by Schoenberger, [1843?] or [1844?], in an « Instruments nouveaux » section on pp. 290-92, and in the 1856 reprint, found on pp. 472-77 in Peter Bloom's critical edition published by Bärenreiter, Vol.24, in Kassel and New York, 2003. Berlioz also wrote about it in several subsequent journals (Bloom, p. 472, nn. 1 & 2). He used it in 1 work: L'enfance du Christ, Part 1, scene vi, where it is off stage. When he conducted it in Weimar on 21 February 1855, it was played by Franz Liszt (Bloom, p. 474, n. 3).A mechanic who had worked in the factory of Alexandre in Paris emigrated to the United States and conceived the idea of a suction bellows, instead of the ordinary bellows that forced the air outward through the reeds. Beginning in 1885, the firm of Mason & Hamlin, of Boston made their instruments with the suction bellows, and this method of construction soon superseded all others in America.\n\nParagraph 8: At some stage she passed her level I national law exams, but she never progressed to level II.     In 1970 she found an administrative job in the lawyer's office run by Horst Mahler, at that time the ideological head of the newly formed RAF.   She soon joined up and undertook administrative work on behalf of the terrorist group:  Berberich rented houses and apartments for use in RAF operations.   With others she was involved in preparations for the release from prison of Andreas Baader which took place on 14 May 1970.   The plot succeeded in that Andreas Baader was indeed freed from the Research Institute for Social Questions in Berlin-Dahlem where he had been sent on a rehabilitation-secondment from prison.   The plan failed, however, to the extent that in the confusion involved in freeing Baader, Georg Linke, a 62 year old institute librarian, was shot by the accomplice with the guns and his liver badly injured.  (Fortunately Linke would survive the injury.)   Unbeknown to the research institute, Baader had an accomplice working \"on the inside\" in the form of the radical journalist Ulrike Meinhof:  she had been expected by the group to remain at the institute following Baader's \"liberation\", and then provide media reports supportive of her escaped RAF comrades.   After the near-fatal shooting Meinhof seems to have had a sudden change of plan, and she herself escaped by leaping through a window and joining the others in the getaway car.   She now \"disappeared underground\".   Directly after Meinhof's disappearance it was Monika Berberich who collected her friend's seven year old twin daughters from the zoo (a meeting point pre-arranged with the comrade who had collected the girls from the Bremen apartment where they had been sent before the operation to free Baader reached it denouement), and drove with the children through France and Italy to the \"barracks camp\" on the side of Mount Etna which had originally been constructed as emergency accommodation for people made homeless by a volcanic eruption, and where now Andreas Baader and other comrades were hiding.\n\nParagraph 9: In the theory of complex functions, it is known that the modulus (absolute value) of a holomorphic (complex differentiable) function in the interior of a bounded region is bounded by its modulus on the boundary of the region.  More precisely, if a non-constant function  is holomorphic in a bounded region  and continuous on its closure , then  for all . This is known as the maximum modulus principle. (In fact, since  is compact and  is continuous, there actually exists some  such that .)  The maximum modulus principle is generally used to conclude that a holomorphic function is bounded in a region after showing that it is bounded on its boundary.\n\nParagraph 10: \"The pastoral Somali have few large ceremonies and little ritual. For its interest, therefore I reproduce here a summary of a very full account of the traditional Gadabuursi installation ceremony given me by Sheikh 'Abdarahmaan Sheikh Nuur, the present Government Kadi of Borama. Clansmen gather for the ceremony in a well-wooded and watered place. There is singing and dancing, then stock are slaughtered for feasting and sacrifice. The stars are carefully watched to determine a propitious time, and then future  Ugaas is chosen by divination. Candidates must be sons or brothers of the former Ugaas and the issue of a woman who has been only married once. She should not be a woman who has been divorced or a widow. Early on a Monday morning a man of the Reer Nuur (the laandeer of the Gadabuursi) plucks a flower or leaf and throws it upon the Ugaas. Everyone else then follows his example. The man who starts the `aleemasaar acclamation must be a man rich in livestock, with four wives, and many sons. Men of the Mahad Muuse lineage then brings four vessels of milk. One contains camels' milk, one cows' milk, one sheeps' milk, and the last goats' milk. These are offered to the Ugaas who selects one and drinks a little from it. If he drinks the camels' milk, camels will be blessed and prosper, if he drinks, the goats' milk, goats will prosper, and so on. After this, a large four-year-old ram is slaughtered in front of him. His hair is cut by a man of the Gadabuursi and he casts off his old clothes and dons new clothes as Ugaas. A man of Reer Yuunis puts a white turban round his head, and his old clothes are carried off by men of the Jibra'iin... The Ugaas then mounts his best horse and rides to a well called Bugay, near Geris, towards the coast. The well contains deliciously fresh water. Above the well are white pebbles and on these he sits. He is washed by a brother or other close kinsman as he sits on top of the stones. Then he returns to the assembled people and is again acclaimed and crowned with leaves. Dancing and feasting recommence. The Ugaas makes a speech in which he blesses his people and asks God to grant peace, abundant milk, and rain--all symbols of peace and prosperity (nabad iyo 'aano). If rain falls after this, people will know that his reign will be prosperous. That the ceremony is customarily performed during the karan rainy season makes this all the more likely. The Ugaas is given a new house with entirely new effects and furnishings and a bride is sought for him. She must be of good family, and the child of a woman who has had only one husband. Her bride-wealth is paid by all the Gadabuursi collectively, as they thus ensure for themselves successors to the title. Rifles or other fire-arms are not included in the bride-wealth. Everything connected with the accession must be peaceful and propitious.\"", "answers": ["Paragraph 4"], "length": 3337, "dataset": "passage_retrieval_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "3608f565a4136a4dd8104c179c720511472115c346c3b236"}
{"input": "The 1927 New York Yankees were known as \"Murderers Row\" due to their formidable line-up. Led by Babe Ruth, who hit 60 home runs and 164 RBI, the team featured a number of future Hall of Famers including Lou Gehrig, Tony Lazzeri, and Earle Combs. Bob Meusel also contributed with over 100 RBI. Overall, the team had one of the most feared line-ups in the history of baseball.", "context": "Paragraph 1: Dan Castellaneta, Julie Kavner, Nancy Cartwright, and Yeardley Smith all began voicing their characters on The Tracey Ullman Show. Nancy Cartwright was the only one of the group who had been trained to be a voice actor while Castellaneta had done some voice over work in Chicago. Castellaneta and Kavner had been part of the regular cast of The Tracey Ullman Show and voices were needed for the shorts, so the producers decided to ask them to voice Homer and Marge rather than hire more actors. The producers decided to hold casting for the roles of Bart and Lisa. Yeardley Smith had initially been asked to audition for the role of Bart, but casting director Bonita Pietila believed her voice was too high. Smith later recalled, \"I always sounded too much like a girl. I read two lines as Bart and they said, 'Thanks for coming!'\" Smith was given the role of Lisa instead. On March 13, 1987, Nancy Cartwright went in to audition for the role of Lisa. After arriving at the audition, she found that Lisa was simply described as the \"middle child\" and at the time did not have much personality. Cartwright became more interested in the role of Bart who she found more fascinating because he was described as \"devious, underachieving, school-hating, irreverent, [and] clever.\" Matt Groening let her try out for the part instead, and upon hearing her read, gave her the job on the spot.\n\nParagraph 2: \"What You Waiting For?\" received positive reviews from critics. Nick Sylvester of Pitchfork gave the song a strong review, rating it four and a half stars, and labeled it \"fucking great\". The website went on to rank the song 16th on its list of the Top 50 Singles of 2004. RJ Smith of Blender noted the song's new wave influence by stating that it could start a revival of Missing Persons, and Amy Linden of The Village Voice compared the \"giddy, yodeling vocals\" to those of Lene Lovich's 1981 song \"New Toy\". Jason Damas from PopMatters was mixed on the song, calling the opening \"awkward\" and the refrain \"ridiculously dumb\", but arguing that the song \"is so frivolous and stupid that it winds up being brilliant; it pretends to be nothing more than party bubblegum and achieves its artistic criteria beautifully.\" Slant Magazines Sal Cinquemani agreed, stating that \"it's this impishness that helps make 'What You Waiting For' one of the hottest 'arrival' songs of all time\". Richard Smirke of Playlouder found the track's production \"crisp\" and \"edgy\", and Jennifer Nine of Dotmusic called the song \"itchily irresistible\". Jemma Volp-Fletcher, writing for Contactmusic.com, rated the song nine out of 10, commenting that it has \"irresistible commercial pull and a melody to die for\" and that the track \"makes the most of her unmistakable vocal and reflects that off-the-wall Stefani personality perfectly.\" Natasha Tripney from musicOMH gave the song a negative review, stating that \"it'll become one of those tracks that's irritatingly catchy—but on this initial listening, Ms Stefani's debut solo effort is just plain irritating.\"\n\nParagraph 3: The 1927 New York Yankees had perhaps the most feared line-up in the history of baseball. Nicknamed \"Murderers Row,\" with Babe Ruth at the peak of his considerable powers, hitting .356 with a then-record 60 home runs and 164 RBI that year. He was complemented by future Hall of Famers Lou Gehrig at first base, who hit .373 with 47 home runs and a league-leading 175 RBI, Tony Lazzeri at second base who drove in 102 runs with a .309 average, and center fielder Earle Combs, who hit .356 and scored 137 runs as the team's leadoff hitter. Left fielder Bob Meusel also drove in over 100 runs, with a .337 average.\n\nParagraph 4: Nasty Suicide (born Jan-Markus Stenfors on 27 February 1963) is a Finnish musician. He is most famous for being one of the founding members of Hanoi Rocks, the group's rhythm guitarist between 1979 and 1985. Hanoi Rocks was a Finnish rock band that combined elements of punk, glam rock, rock and roll, and blues. Before his tenure in Hanoi Rocks, Suicide played guitar in a Finnish punk band called Briard in the late 1970s. Suicide replaced Andy McCoy in Briard after McCoy joined Pelle Miljoona Oy. After the breakup of Hanoi Rocks in 1985, he and his former bandmate Andy McCoy recorded an acoustic album under the name The Suicide Twins which was released in 1986 and was titled Silver Missiles and Nightingales. At the same time McCoy and Suicide started The Cherry Bombz, which included Timo Caltio on bass (later replaced by Dave Tregunna), Terry Chimes on drums and singer Anita Chellemah. The Cherry Bombz released two EPs: The Cherry Bombz (1985) and House Of Ecstasy (1986) as well as a live album, Coming Down Slow (1986). After The Cherry Bombz Nasty went on to form his own band Cheap and Nasty, which was active from 1990 to 1994.\n\nParagraph 5: In 1981 Lockton moved from Los Angeles to Silicon Valley to apply his experience at California Business with subscription based financial information and at the Ontario Motor Speedway with the wireless technology behind the real-time timing and scoring system, to stock market trading information.  He purchased a controlling interest in Data Broadcasting (originally Dataspeed, a company that had developed a pc version of the Ontario wireless real time scoring system) where he invented the hand held wireless QuoTrek, the first product to utilize “push” technology  and wireless data, to deliver real time stock and commodity trading information to paying subscribers in a mobile environment. He successfully petitioned United States Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to deregulate and permit the use of the analog sub-carrier (FCC Docket 82-536) for the real time broadcast of digital data. He successfully negotiated with the Boards of Governors of the New York Stock Exchange, the NASDAQ, and Amex exchanges as well as the Chicago Board of Trade and Commodities Exchange Center to create a low cost “non professional” fee structure for their real time trading information, thereby pioneering a consumer market for real time stock and futures trading. The first nationwide real time wireless data network he created supported the QuoTrek and Signal services which won numerous awards. With the QuoTrek's companion invention, Signal, a wireless modem linked to a PC and Lotus 1-2-3 software to manage multiple investment accounts, the services generated over $1.3 billion in revenues over their product lives. George Guilder credited the QuoTrek in Life After Television (Norton 1992, pp 66–67) as the invention which created the communications paradigm known as “push” or “always on” data. Guilder predicted a revolution in the way time sensitive data would be delivered which is now pervasive on the Web and Cellular 3G networks. In 1984 Lockton designed and developed the prototype of a multi-purpose hand held device, the Informa, with a backlit LCD screen and alpha/numeric keyboard, designed to use the nationwide real time wireless data network of FM radio stations Lockton had assembled. In addition to user specified stocks and commodities quotes, news, weather and sports information in real time, the user could send wireless email and messages via a built in phone modem instantly received by the addressee wherever they were. The Informa concept preceded the Web by nine years, real-time wireless messaging by several years and the data capabilities of the 2G cellular networks by 10 years. In 1985 Data Broadcasting was sold to Lotus Development Corporation which never introduced the Informa.\n\nParagraph 6: Chenery's life changed when her mother died suddenly and her father became ill in late 1967. He entered New Rochelle Hospital in April 1968 and remained there until his death in January 1973. Due to Mr. Chenery's advancing senility, Meadow Stable, the Chenery thoroughbred breeding and racing operation in Virginia, had been neglected in the mid-1960s and was no longer profitable.  Chenery's siblings wanted to sell the operation since their father could no longer manage it. Chenery, however, hoped to fulfill her father's dream of winning the Kentucky Derby. The board of Meadow Stud elected her president and in 1968, she began the long process of cutting costs, repairing facilities and returning the stable to profitability.  In 1969, she fired long-time trainer Casey Hayes. On the advice of longtime family friend and business associate Bull Hancock of Claiborne Farm, Chenery hired Roger Laurin to train and manage the Meadow Stable horses. With Laurin's help, the stable began to produce a few stakes winning horses in 1969 and 1970. However, in May 1971, Roger Laurin left the Meadow to train for the much vaunted Phipps family stables, so Chenery turned to his father, Lucien Laurin, as a temporary substitute. However, Laurin Sr. decided to stay on when the Meadow's homebred Riva Ridge brought in over $500,000 in purses in the fall of 1971.  In May, 1972 Riva Ridge won the Kentucky Derby and in June Belmont Stakes, thus fulfilling Mr. Chenery's lifelong dream of producing a great horse. That same year, another Meadow colt, the two-year-old Secretariat had such a dominant fall season that he became  American Horse of the Year which was a rare honor for a two-year-old.  The following year, Secretariat captured the imagination of racing fans worldwide when he became the first Triple Crown winner in 25 years, setting records that still stand in all three races and winning the Belmont by an unheard-of 31 lengths. Both horses were inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame. When Chenery's father died in January 1973, his estate owed such a large tax bill that it could only be satisfied by syndicating the breeding rights to Secretariat and Riva Ridge to a consortium of breeders. Chenery made headlines by successfully syndicating Secretariat for $6.08 million and Riva Ridge for $5 million. Eventually the Meadow  in Doswell, Virginia, also was sold to settle the estate. Chenery moved many of the remaining horses to Long Island, N.Y. and continued racing.\n\nParagraph 7: The girls were sent to California State University, Fullerton, to learn how to debate. They were split into two teams of five, Team 1 consisted of  Brooke, Courtney, Larrisa, Leilene, and Schatar and Team 2 consisted of Becky, Cristal, Darra, Saaphyri, and Shay. After learning the basics of debate each team had to choose the four girls who would participate in the debate and one who would be 'benched'. The benched girls would not be safe from expulsion whether or not their respective team won the debate. During the debate Brooke and Becky opened with Becky and Team 2 arguing that the girls on Courtney's team should be expelled and Brooke's team arguing the opposite. In the second round Larissa was to ask the questions and Shay is to rebut. Larissa stumbled over her part and Mo'Nique was impressed with Shay's debating skills. The third part put Schatar and Saaphyri against each other. Saaphyri kept interrupting Schatar's answering of the questions. Darra and Courtney were set up to close the arguments. Dr. Jon Bruschke made the decision that the negative team 'focused on the task' and awarded them the trophy and the victory. Mo'Nique did not believe they deserved to win so she tells them how she, Mikki, and Keith really felt. Mo'Nique did not believe that the negative team did their job. Larissa calls her a hater. She said that it is not fair because whenever she loses, she gets an attitude and now that she didn't have an attitude, Mo'Nique still did not like her. Mo'Nique told Larissa that she needs to grow up and walked off camera claiming that 'now you done pissed me off.' Afterwards, the girls went to a bar and got very drunk. They posed and took pictures with the guys as well as danced and made out with them. Leilene asked if the whole world talks about Larissa if she will fight the whole world. Larissa then insulted Leilene by saying she is not a good mother. When they arrived home, Larissa continued to insult her, gleefully stating in an interview that Leilene \"is her child today.\" At the elimination ceremony Mo'Nique called Cristal, Saaphyri and Leilene on the carpet. Leilene was at risk for elimination due to her being emotionally weak, while Saaphyri was at risk for continually interrupting her opponent during the debate and Cristal for her lack of improvement. Leilene was sent back to the group by Mo'Nique, and Cristal was expelled for a perceived failure to change.\n\nParagraph 8: In the 1990s, Robinson wrote novelisations of episodes of The Tomorrow People, The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles and Baywatch and the film Free Willy. Between 1994 and 1995, he wrote a series of children's horror novels Remember Me..., All Shook Up, Dream Lover, Rave On, Bad Moon Rising, Symphony of Terror and Demon Brood. In 1996 he continued to write the Luke Cannon Show Jumping Mysteries series, containing four books, namely The Piebald Princess, The Chestnut Chase, The Black Mare of Devils Hill and the last in the series, Decision Day for the Dapple Grey.  By 1997 he had also penned a trilogy  science fiction novels First Contact, Second Nature and Third Degree.\n\nParagraph 9: Petronilla, whose name means \"little rock\", is popularly believed to have been the daughter of Saint Peter, whose Greek name, Petros, means \"rock\".  Her relics had rested in the catacombs of Domitilla in Rome until 757 when Pope Paul I translated her body to St Peter’s in the circular mausoleum called thereafter of St Petronilla. The saint was named by the same Pope protector and patron of the French Kings to reward Pepin the Short of his service to the Papacy in front of the Lombard invasion. When the Rotunda of St Petronilla was demolished during the construction of the new St Peter, her body was translated to a new altar within the new church (1606). Guercino was instructed then to paint an altarpiece for the altar above her tomb.\n\nParagraph 10: From the Early Middle Ages, Schneppenbach belonged to a major landhold of Saint Maximin's Imperial Abbey at Trier. The 2,742-hectare landhold comprised, besides the centres of Blickersau and Kaffeld, which later vanished, the villages of Woppenroth, Bundenbach, Schneppenbach, Bruschied and the main centre and parish seat of Hausen bei Rhaunen. Until the 18th century, Schneppenbach was administratively tightly bound with the Schmidtburg (castle), which nowadays stands within the village's municipal limits. The castle, whose beginnings go back at least as far as 929, and possibly as far as 926, is one of the oldest in the Nahe-Hunsrück region and is believed to have been the family seat of the Counts in the Nahegau, the Emichones. Their coheirs and rightful successors, the Waldgraves, owned the castle in the 12th and 13th centuries. Internal Waldgravial family disputes, however, resulted in ownership being transferred about 1330 to Archbishop and Elector of Trier Baldwin of Luxembourg. Under Baldwin, the castle was expanded, and in the time that followed, it became the seat of the Electoral-Trier Amt of Schmidtburg. While Bundenbach was the only village in the Amt that stood wholly under Electoral-Trier sovereignty, Bruschied and Schneppenbach formed a condominium and belonged jointly to the Electorate of Trier and the Knights of Wildberg. When the Amt of Schmidtburg was pledged to the Electoral-Trier Amtmann Nikolaus von Schmidtburg sometime before 1554, he temporarily introduced Calvinism. By 1626, though, the villages had reverted to Catholicism. In 1563, there were nine households in Schneppenbach, five in 1684 and eleven in 1715 that belonged to the Electoral-Trier Amt of Schmidtburg. About 1650, records show that the local lord was the knight Sir Cratz von Scharffenstein. Schneppenbach formed together with Bruschied an Ingericht (local court district). The two villages' inhabitants only owned one chapel, and attended the main services in Bundenbach. In 1794, during the War of the First Coalition, the German lands on the Rhine's left bank were occupied by the French, and in 1798, the region was reorganized on the French administrative model by the French Directory. With this French administrative reform, the Amt of Schmidtburg was dissolved. Schneppenbach passed to the then newly founded Mairie (\"Mayoralty\") of Kirn in the Arrondissement of Simmern and the Department of Rhin-et-Moselle, remaining there for the rest of French Revolutionary and Napoleonic times. Then, in 1817, it passed to the Bürgermeisterei (\"Mayoralty\") of Gemünden in the Prussian Simmern district. In the course of administrative restructuring in Rhineland-Palatinate after the Second World War, Schneppenbach was assigned to the Verbandsgemeinde of Kirn-Land.", "answers": ["Paragraph 3"], "length": 2819, "dataset": "passage_retrieval_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "86724a5db38528dd5331f3dafb4aac4ff68001d0224fbe9f"}
{"input": "The Boston Female Anti-Slavery Society engaged in various abolitionist activities including writing letters, holding conventions, and circulating petitions. They wrote a letter to famous abolitionist George Thompson to express their appreciation for his work and their disappointment in the backlash he faced. They also sent a letter to the Ladies New York City Anti-Slavery Society to join forces with other female anti-slave societies. The society collected funds for themselves and the American Anti-Slavery Society, with a smaller group called the Ladies Anti-Slavery Sewing Society working to raise funds by sewing the society's slogan on various items to gain support and attention. They also distributed anti-slavery pamphlets, sent petitions to Congress, and held lectures. The society hosted a national convention in 1837 and although they were more conservative, they did not lead the convention.", "context": "Paragraph 1: It was presumably out of personal regard for a former Free France comrade that Hettier de Boislambert merely abstained in the investiture vote for Prime Minister René Pleven on 24 July 1951.   He was nevertheless open in his hostility to attempts to govern with a so-called Third Force coalition government, voting against the composition of the government on 11 August 1951.   The next month he backed what became known as the \"Marie and Barangé laws\", which provided for financial support for children educated in private schools and was bitterly opposed by left wingers and by secularists.   (Most of the private schools affected were church schools.)   On 13 December 1952 he voted against parliamentary endorsement of the treaty which confirmed French membership of the  CECA (\"European Coal and Steel Community\").   As the RPF party began to break apart under the pressure of its own internal contradictions,  Hettier de Boislambert did not join the 27 party members in the assembly who voted on 6 March 1952 to support the appointment as Prime Minister of Antoine Pinay.   He chose to abstain in the vote to approve the composition of the Pinay government.   Shortly after this Charles de Gaulle, who continued to direct the RPF from his lofty position above and beyond the political fray from his home in Colombey-les-Deux-Églises, effectively released the party's members in the assembly from their residual bonds of party loyalty and Hettier de Boislambert threw in his lot with the short-lived URAS party which was in some respects a successor to the RPF.   As the URAS dissolved he joined the Social Republicans (CNRS).   The fact that he was a member successively of three parties during his time as a member of the  Assemblée Nationale masks an essential continuity in  Hettier de Boislambert's six year parliamentary career, since each of the three parties was, in is different way, the de facto Gaulliste party of the moment, albeit operating within a parliamentary constitutional structure which the Gaullistes repudiated.   On 6 January 1953 Hettier de Boislambert voted in support of the appointment as Prime Minister of René Mayer, and on 27 May 1953 he took part in the investiture debate for Paul Reynaud.   He never concealed the fact that his voting actions were driven by his continuing and absolute backing for constitutional reform, and on this point he had been encouraged by undertakings that Reynaud was understood to have provided.   However, Reynaud was a committed proponent of European Union, and his advocacy of a European army quickly irritated Hettier de Boislambert.   He insisted that Reynaud's presentation of a choice between a European army and a German army offered a false dilemma.   Drawing on his experiences as Governor of Rheinland-Pfalz he pointed out that the West German \"without us\" reaction to the idea of a European army was not a cry of cowardice but a cry of prudence.   In respect of the treaty establishing the European Defence Community, Hettier de Boislambert called for certain additional safeguards:  to be sure, \"stability and government continuity [were] indispensable\", but it could not be possible to impose them at too high a price.   He decided to abstain in the vote following the debate.   He also abstained on 4 June 1953 in the vote to back the prime ministerial appointment of Pierre Mendès France.     By way of contrast, he voted in support of Joseph Laniel's appointment, but the deteriorating situation in Indochina later led him to withdraw his support from the Laniel government.\n\nParagraph 2: \"The hospitals have been recruiting teenage girls as nurses. They get 120 crowns a month and free meals. They are, with very few exceptions, utterly useless. Their main job is to satisfy the lust of the gentlemen officers and, rather shamefully, of a number of doctors, too [-] New officers are coming in almost daily with cases of syphilis, gonorrhea and soft chancre. The poor girls and women feel so flattered when they get chatted up by one of these pestilent pigs in their spotless uniforms, with their shiny boots and buttons.\"  Other accounts reveal the pervasive presence of starvation and disease, including cholera, and the diary of  Helena Jablonska, a middle-aged, quite wealthy Polish woman, reveals class and anti-semitic and  racial tensions in the town; \" The Jewish women in basements rip you off the worst\", and on March 18, 1915 –  \"The Jews are taking their shop signs down in a hurry, so that no one can tell who owns what. [-] They've all got so rich off the backs of those poor soldiers, and now of course they all want to run away!\" When the Imperial Russian Army finally took the city in March, the Tsarist soldiers unleashed a violent pogrom against the Jewish population of the city. Jablonska noted: \"The Cossacks waited until the Jews set off to the synagogue for their prayers before setting upon them with whips. There is such lamenting and despair. Some Jews are hiding in cellars, but they'll get to them there too.\"\n\nParagraph 3: In 1608, following a peace agreement with King Sigismund, Tsar Vasilii agreed to release Tsar Dmitrii's father-in-law, Jerzy Mniszech, and widow, Marina Mniszech. They soon joined the second false Dmitrii's camp in Tushino, where she \"recognized\" her late husband in this second Dmitry. According to Dunning, \"On the Tushino impostor's boyar council sat such powerful men as Mikhail G. Saltykov and Dmitrii Trubetskoi. They were soon joined by several of Tsar Dmitrii's former courtiers, including Grigorii Shakhovskoi and Mikhail Molchanov. The Saltykov and Romanov families were by far the most influential Russians in Tushino. The arrival in Tushino of Jan Piotr Sapieha with seven thousand cavalrymen  in August speeded up rebel military activity.\"\n\nParagraph 4: Root races are stages in human evolution in the esoteric cosmology of theosophist Helena Petrovna Blavatsky, as described in her book The Secret Doctrine (1888). These races existed mainly on now-lost continents. Blavatsky's model was developed by later theosophists, most notably William Scott-Elliot in The Story of Atlantis (1896) and The Lost Lemuria (1904). Annie Besant further developed the model in Man: Whence, How and Whither (1913). Both Besant and Scott-Elliot relied on information from Charles Webster Leadbeater obtained by \"astral clairvoyance\". Further elaboration was provided by Rudolf Steiner in Atlantis and Lemuria (1904). Rudolf Steiner, and subsequent theosophist authors, have called the time periods associated with these races Epochs (Steiner felt that the term \"race\" was not adequate anymore for modern humanity).\n\nParagraph 5: The concept of a frequency versus sensitivity (amplitude) audiogram plot of human hearing sensitivity was conceived by German physicist Max Wien in 1903. The first vacuum tube implementations, November 1919, two groups of researchers — K.L. Schaefer and G. Gruschke, B. Griessmann and H. Schwarzkopf — demonstrated before the Berlin Oto-logical Society two instruments designed to test hearing acuity. Both were built with vacuum tubes. Their designs were characteristic of the two basic types of electronic circuits used in most electronic audio devices for the next two decades. Neither of the two devices was developed commercially for some time, although the second was to be manufactured under the name \"Otaudion.\"\n\nParagraph 6: Stoecker was born in Halberstadt, Province of Saxony, in the Kingdom of Prussia. Stoecker's father was a blacksmith turned prison guard, and despite his poverty, Stoecker was able to attend university, which was unusual for a working-class man in the 19th century. An energetic and hardworking Protestant pastor who wrote widely on various social and political issues, Stoecker had a charismatic personality which made him one of Germany's best loved and most respected Lutheran clergyman. As a theology student at the University of Halberstadt, Stoecker was already known as the \"second Luther\" as his writings and speeches defending the Lutheran faith were considered outstanding. \n\nParagraph 7: Robert Crowley (Robertus Croleus, Roberto Croleo, Robart Crowleye, Robarte Crole or Crule, c. 1517 – 18 June 1588), was a stationer, poet, polemicist and Protestant clergyman among Marian exiles at Frankfurt. He seems to have been a Henrician Evangelical in favour of a more reformed Protestantism than the king and the Church of England sanctioned. Under Edward VI, he joined a London network of evangelical stationers to argue for reforms, sharing a vision of his contemporaries Hugh Latimer, Thomas Lever, Thomas Beccon and others of England as a reformed Christian commonwealth. He attacked as inhibiting reform what he saw as corruption and uncharitable self-interest among the clergy and wealthy. Meanwhile, Crowley took part in making the first printed editions of Piers Plowman, the first translation of the Gospels into Welsh, and the first complete metrical psalter in English, which was also the first to include harmonised music. Towards the end of Edward's reign and later, Crowley criticised the Edwardian Reformation as compromised and saw the dissolution of the monasteries as replacing one form of corruption by another. On his return to England after the reign of Mary I, Crowley revised his chronicle to represent the Edwardian Reformation as a failure, due to figures like Thomas Seymour, 1st Baron Seymour of Sudeley, Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset and John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland. Crowley's account of the Marian martyrs represented them as a cost mostly paid by commoners. The work became a source for John Foxe's account of the period in his Actes and Monuments. Crowley held church positions in the early to mid-1560s and sought change from the pulpit and within the church hierarchy. Against the Elizabethan Religious Settlement, Crowley was a leader in the renewed vestments controversy, which eventually lost him his clerical posts. During the dispute he and other London clergy produced a \"first Puritan manifesto\". Late in life Crowley was restored to several church posts and appears to have charted a more moderate course in defending it from Roman Catholicism and from nonconformist factions that espoused a Presbyterian church polity.\n\nParagraph 8: In 1282 the situation of the Papacy with regard to southern Italy changed dramatically.  On 7 May, the famous Sicilian Vespers began in Palermo, resulting in the loss of the island, a papal fief, by King Charles I.  The King of Aragon, Pedro I, took advantage of the revolt by invading and occupying the island of Sicily. He began to style himself \"King\", which infuriated both King Charles and Pope Martin IV.  King Charles and King Pedro challenged each other to trial by single combat (duel), which greatly annoyed the Pope, who believed that the decision as to legitimacy was his.  On 5 June the Pope appointed a Legate in the Kingdom of Sicily, Cardinal Gerardo Bianchi, and ordered him to get King Charles to abandon the plan of trial by combat.  Bianchi was unsuccessful.    On 18 November 1282, therefore, Pope Martin IV opened proceedings against King Pedro of Aragon, because he had invaded the territory of Sicily and was usurping the crown.  The proceedings were concluded by 21 March 1283, when Pope Martin publicly deposed King Pedro and released all of his subjects from allegiance to him.  The duel was still in prospect, however, and the Pope also tried to get the King of France and the King of England to intervene.  In his letter to King Edward I, Pope Martin recommended to him the services of Cardinal Joannes of S. Cecilia (Jean Cholet), a statement which is often interpreted as the appointment of Cardinal Cholet to an Embassy to England.  The details of the letter itself, however, make it obvious that the Pope expects King Edward and Cholet to work through intermediaries (suos nuntios vel litteras) and the King's agents (vicarios et officiales tuos).  In 1283 Cholet already had an all-consuming task—organizing a crusade for the conquest of Aragon.  In 1282 and 1283 King Edward, too, was fully engaged in the full-scale conquest and subjugation of Wales; it was not until 11 December 1282 that  Llywelyn was killed at the Battle of Orewin Bridge.  Edward did have time, however, to order his agents in Aquitaine not to permit the two combatants to engage in their duel in Bordeaux (which had been the proposed site), or anywhere else in his realm.  His decision not to intervene in the dynastic problems of France and Aragon was probably sufficient for the Pope's purposes.\n\nParagraph 9: As a society, they completed a plethora of different abolitionist activities, including writing letters, holding conventions, and circulating petitions. One of the first things they completed after founding was writing a letter to George Thompson because he inspired them to create the organization. George Thompson was a famous abolitionist who faced a lot of backlash for the progress he made in the anti-slavery movement. In the letter they wrote about how embarrassed they were that he was receiving such treatment, and let him know that they appreciated him and his work. However, in the First Annual reviews it explains that though the letter was sent, he never did write back. The Boston Female Anti-Slavery Society also sent a letter to the Ladies New York City Anti-Slavery Society accepting them as friends and hoping to join forces with other female anti-slave societies in New England. The groups would have more influence together to raise funds for the American Anti-Slave Society and could convince more southern women to support the movement. They collected funds for their society and the American Anti-Slavery Society. The funds allocated for the society also supported the Ladies Anti-Slavery Sewing Society, which was a smaller group under their original organization. This auxiliary sewed the society's slogan onto different items to gain support and bring attention to their group. They sold their sewed items to gain funds for the society. This included needlework and book covers with the slogan, “May the use of our needles prick the conscience of slaveholders.” Along with this they distributed Anti-slavery pamphlets and other publications. They sent and circulated petitions to Congress, pushing for abolition in the District of Columbia, and the group created and spread the Ladies petition to the general assembly that they had in 1836.  They also gave petitions to the Presbyterian church general assembly and they circulated Anti-Slavery Tracts.  In 1836, the society held lectures to gain support for their cause and had the Grimké Sisters speak in their event, which they hoped would create a bigger audience for their society. This was originally a series of parlor lectures, but there were too many people interested and they needed to find a bigger space. The event moved to the succession room of Reverend Duncan Dunbar's Beriah Baptist Church. They wanted this meeting to just include women so they would escort men out when they entered. While they were in operation, they also hosted a national convention that lasted 4 days in 1937. They sent 18 delegates and 80 members. They did not lead the convention, they hosted it, but they were one of the more conservative groups that participated.\n\nParagraph 10: This win snapped a nine-game away losing streak for Tampa Bay dating back to last season. The Buccaneers last road win was against the Vikings in Minnesota in week 2 when the Bucs came back and won 24–20 after trailing 17–0 in the third quarter. Doug Martin held the spotlight on this night. Martin ran the ball 29 times for 135 rushing yards and a rushing touchdown. Martin scored two touchdowns on this night and he had 100 rushing yards before halftime. Adding to that, he caught three passes for 79 yards, in which he scored a 64-yard passing touchdown on a screen play. Martin's 214 total offensive yards is the 5th best single game total in Buccaneer history. Buccaneer QB Josh Freeman had his third consecutive game with three touchdown passes, in which is a new franchise record. Freeman threw for 262 yards and has a streak of consecutive games with a touchdown pass with 10. There were three takeaways in the game, all of them belonging to the Tampa Bay defense.  Ronde Barber and Michael Bennett forced fumbles, with the Bucs recovering both of them in the second quarter.  Those turnovers were converted into points. This provided the difference in the Bucs 20–10 halftime lead over the Vikings.  Leonard Johnson also ended Minnesota's last drive with an interception. Negative plays tackles behind the line of scrimmage have become the Buccaneers’ strength this season. They entered Week 8 leading the NFL in that category.  The hits kept coming Thursday night as Tampa Bay had seven more tackles for loss, including three sacks. The Tampa Bay defense allowed Adrian Peterson and the Minnesota offense to rush for 141 total rushing yards. The Vikings were the second team this season to rush over 100 yards as the Redskins were the first team to do so with Robert Griffen III. The Buc's offensive line only allowed 1 sack to Jared Allen and the defense. Doug Martin carried the load, becoming the first player in Buccaneers history with 135 rushing yards and 75 receiving yards in the same game. The Bucs finished with 416 yards of total offense. They had 513 yards against New Orleans last Sunday and 463 yards against Kansas City the previous week before playing the Saints. That marks the first time in franchise history that the Bucs have had three straight games with over 400 yards of total offense. The Buccaneers won their sixth straight meeting against the Minnesota Vikings.\n\nParagraph 11: On Friday March 28, 2014 at approximately 11 a.m. the A. Grenville and William G. Davis courthouse erupted in pandemonium when an armed individual by the name of Charnjit Bassi who went by the nickname of \"Sonny\", according to Ontario's Special Investigation Unit of Brampton was dressed in a long camel trenchcoat, a fedora and sunglasses and proceeded to walk into the front entrance of the A. Grenville & William G. Davis Courthouse at 7755 Hurontario Street in Brampton, Ontario attempting to enter the courthouse and bypassing the metal detectors by walking through the designated lawyers and staff entrance resulting in an altercation with 53-year-old Mike Klaranbeek who is a 30-year Peel Regional police veteran. After being told to follow instructions and to walk through the metal detectors, the alleged shooter, Charanjit Bassi pulled a handgun out of his holster and shortly opened fire letting off six shots and wounding the officer in the abdomen who was doing security checks at the time. Two police officers who were present on the scene responded immediately to the situation and returned fire fatally killing the 45-year-old suspected shooter on the corridor floors in the front lobby. Constable Mike Klaranbeek was rushed to Sunnybrook Hospital where he remained in stable condition. Peel Police believe that the motive for the crime was that Charnjit Bassi was targeting someone he believed to be present in the courthouse at the time. According to court records, Bassi had no outstanding charges and was not scheduled to appear at the A Grenville and William G. Davis courthouse on March 28, 2014 when the incident had occurred. Charnjit Bassi was well known to Peel Regional Police and was believed to be associated in the drug trade despite being not being convicted of any drug convictions although had past allegations which involved weapons. The courthouse was placed under lockdown for several hours after the incident occurred and all legal proceedings that were to take place that day were cancelled following the shooting. According to neighbours and friends of Bassi, he was a \"gentle soul\" and they couldn't understand what would drive him to such ends and claimed that the incident was astongishly out of character.. Neighbours reported that he had a trucking business but sources reported that he was officially unemployed for the last five years. Neighbours described him as a quiet and decent man and neighbours often witnessed seeing Bassi on his front driveway playing with his children.\n\nParagraph 12: Haan is an actress and singer who specializes in music of the 1920s and 30s, particularly the music of the Weimar period and the music of Kurt Weill.

{"input": "The Undredal Stave Church, believed to be built around 1147, is a historic church that underwent various modifications and additions throughout the centuries. Originally consisting of a nave and chancel, the church was later extended in the 1600s, adding a rebuilt and enlarged choir. In 1850, the building was further expanded to the west, including a new belltower and church porch. There were plans to move the church to a museum in 1913, but this never materialized due to insufficient funds. Instead, the church was reconstructed in 1984 and underwent maintenance work. Notably, the interior of the church features decorative biblical figures and angels on the ceiling.", "context": "Paragraph 1: The song has received critical acclaim from music critics. Digital Spy's Lewis Corner awarded \"Trouble\" four out of five stars, commenting, \"'Trouble' packs a punch hard enough to make you stand up and take notice.\" Corner further noted that the song has \"a hook that draws you in and fiercely defies you to let go,\" concluding, \"as far as first singles go it's little less than a triumphant piece of pop.\" Jim Carroll from The Irish Times praised the song, describing it as \"a wham-bam, day-glo blast of pop sass, energetic high jinks and sticky-as-chewing-gum hooks.\" Music website Record of the Day honed \"Trouble\" as well executed modern pop that should have no trouble finding a young audience. Loud Magazine's Emma Austin positively reviewed the track, writing \"Punchy, poppy and guaranteed to get stuck in your head.\" Austin also echoed other critics comparisons by likening the track to the sound of the Spice Girls' 1996 album Spice. Idolator's Sam Lansky wrote, \"Not only is that chorus lyric one of my favorite pop lines of the year, it's proof perfect that Neon Jungle have as much of a future in the clurb as they do on pop radio.\" Lansky went on to opine that the song has a freshness to it which he described as \"invigorating\" and a \"gleaming shot of electrogrit built around the most marvelously nasty hook.\" He concluded his review, commenting, \"['Trouble' is] a summer smash, a dancefloor filler, and the kind of enormous, we're-here-deal-with-it introduction that all the best UK girl groups have had. The Hits Radio called \"Trouble\" an attitude-packed pop anthem. Bradley Stern from music website MuuMuse positively reviewed the track, writing, \"'Trouble' is an absolutely unruly pop stormer, busting out with all the pounding EDM energy of a NERVO banger and riotous energy of Icona Pop's shout-y summer anthem, 'I Love It.'\" In his review, Stern added, \"The song's full of big, bold brags along the way, but it’s really all about the chorus, which is repeated endlessly — but at least it’s a damn good one.\" He concluded, saying, \"Like the Aloud's 'Sound of the Underground,' or even the Spice Girls' 'Wannabe,' 'Trouble' is a pretty ballsy, in-your-face way to say hello to the world.\" Jon O'Brein of Yahoo! Celebrity complimented the track's combination of \"in-your-face feistiness of the Spice Girls with the turbo-charged EDM pop of Icona Pop,\" naming it an unashamedly brash debut single which suggests the girlband are not kidding when they claim that 'trouble is our middle name'.\" A writer for music website Popjustice deemed the song \"one of the smartest and most unusual debut singles in recent girlband history\". The writer likened the song to Icona Pop's \"I Love It\", arguing, \"But rather than being a cupcakes-and-rainbows version of 'I Love It' softened up for a major label girlband, the lyrics, production and overall hysteria of the tune feel even harder.\" The website's writer honed the track as \"basically mental\", adding, \"It's fresh and fiercely electronic without being 'EDM'.\" Popjustice placed \"Trouble\" at number 43 in their 'Top 45 Singles of 2013' list.\n\nParagraph 2: The school's crest is a shield divided into three sections. The top left section depicts an acorn cradled in the leaves of an oak tree. The bottom section consists of horizontal wavy lines, suggesting a flowing river, while the right section depicts a group of three trees which represents a park or forest (thus incorporating the town names \"oak park and river forest\"). The top left section is separated from the other two sections by a wide divider inscribed with the school's motto ΤΑ Γ'ΑΡΙΣΤΑ (Those things that are best). The crest has been a symbol of the school since 1908.\n\nParagraph 3: Time magazine felt that \"Instead of portraying the death of one culture and the birth of another, he [George Roy Hill] has restricted himself to the story of one man and his ministry. The spectator is rather too frequently allowed to feel that he is watching a rather small film on a very large screen and to wonder, with a mounting sense of lumbar crisis, why he must pay advanced prices $2.25 to $4.25) for the privilege of sitting through a -hour story that could have been told just as well in two.\" Richard L. Coe of The Washington Post found the romance between Abner and Jerusha \"more trite than credible\" and wrote that Max von Sydow \"seems to have based his concept of the leading role on a quick course in Roots of Modern America.\" Brendan Gill of The New Yorker called it \"perhaps the biggest empty movie, or the emptiest big movie, ever made. Despite its length and its look of being extremely ambitious, it contains scarcely a single action worth dramatizing.\" The Monthly Film Bulletin praised the \"intelligent and literate\" script and \"deeply felt performances from the whole cast,\" but felt \"a distinct slackening of interest\" after the intermission, as once Malama dies \"there is little left except for Jerusha to join her. The real drama is over, and a colorful local wedding hardly compensates for the lack of tension.\"\n\nParagraph 4: Undredal Stave Church was built in the middle of the 12th century, possibly from the year 1147, but very likely from the mid- to late-1100s. There is some evidence that the church was taken apart and moved during the Middle Ages, but this is not known for sure. The original part of the church includes roughly the eastern 2/3rds of the present building. The original church had a  nave and a  chancel. Around the year 1600, the choir was rebuilt and enlarged, measuring about  after its completion. Originally, the church had a covered corridor that ran around the exterior of the church (as seen in many stave churches). This corridor was removed around 1685 and windows were installed in the walls of the nave. Around 1850, the building was extended to the west by lengthening the nave by about  and adding a new belltower and church porch on the west end of the newly enlarged nave. In 1862, the wall between the nave and chancel was removed and the ceiling was arched. The small 2nd floor seating gallery was also removed during this time. In 1913, there were plans to dismantle the church and move it to a museum in the village of Kaupanger (in Sogndal), but this never happened because money was never raised to replace the old church. Instead it was reconstructed in 1984 and underwent extensive maintenance work. Inside the church, the ceiling is decorated with biblical figures and angels.\n\nParagraph 5: Vera Figner was born July 7 (June 25 O.S.), 1852, the oldest of six children of Nikolai Alexandrovich Figner, a retired army staff captain and his wife, the former Ekaterina Khristoforovna Kuprianova, both members of the hereditary Russian nobility. Her maternal grandfather owned more than 17,000 acres of land, worked by serfs existing in a state of semi-slavery and the family retained two maids, who were also serfs,  until the Emancipation of 1861. Her father served in the state forestry service, resigning that post to become a local administrative functionary called a \"peace mediator\" in the years after emancipation. She was the sister of Lidija Figner and of the famous Russian tenor Nikolai Figner.\n\nParagraph 6: In 1926, Bert Miller ignited the 1926 Passaic textile strike, as related by Benjamin Gitlow in his 1939 memoir:  The man who started the ball rolling was Bert Miller, industrial organizer of District Two of the Party, which then included most of industrial New Jersey and Connecticut as well as New York City. Comrade Miller called to my attention the fact that the Botany Mills of Passaic had announced a wage cut of ten percent, beginning with October, 1925. I immediately instructed Miller to get in touch with our New Jersey comrades and explore the matter further, agreeing with him that on its face the situation seemed favorable enough for initiating agitation for a strike in retaliation for the wage cut. Miller was a veteran of the Party since its underground days and carried out his assignment expeditiously. His report convinced me that there was ample ground for developing a successful strike.   Albert Weisbord, main leader of the Passaic strike, recalled later and critically of both Miller (\"the innocent\") and the Communist Party:   In New York I contacted Bert Miller, a teacher made suddenly \"industrial\" organizer of the Party, who, as a newcomer in the office, tried to live up to a job he knew very little about...  I was just now, in 1924, that ignorant, unsuspicious me had to enter into that nest of intrigue, without the lightest inkling of the kind of leadership under which I was enlisting...  I soon found the approximately 400 strikers in meeting in a small hall near the mill... We built up a picket line, drew up our demands and created a semblance of organization. They no longer felt lost or abandoned... They wanted to see membership applications and membership dues books...  Back in New York I reported all this to Miller. This innocent agreed that I should get application and membership cards printed. He was not aware that on this matter he would be bitterly assailed by the Foster-Cannon leadership for dual unionism and would open up a major struggle with the Party...  The worthlessness of the C.P. leaders did not in the least make me undervalue the great worth of the tens of thousands of devoted foreign-born workers and militant American-born youth who were the members and followers of that party... At the moment for me the important link in the chain was the innocent Bert Miller, acting on this own while the \"bigs\" were tied up with other matters, especially the N.Y. District Organizer Weinstone who was very busy intriguing with Cannon on how to form a new faction to end factions!  Weinstone’s sloth and Miller’s ignorance were to help me much.      In 1926, Bert Miller also became business manager of the Daily Worker communist newspaper.  His name first appears on the masthead in the November 26, 1926 issue, and appeared throughout 1926 and 1927 – the publication of \"business manager\" dropped from the masthead in 1928. Whittaker Chambers recalled:    In those days, Bert Miller was a harassed soul.  As business manager of the Daily Worker, the future research director of the House Committee on Un-American Activities had to meet a weekly payroll and find money to pay the paper, print, and other bills.  Money was very hard to find, and his life was a weekly crisis.  Thus, my chief recollection of Bert Miller from the past is less than a face than as a weary plaint:  money.  Bert suffered other grievances, too.  In his business office, he presided over a number of young women Communists, one of whom was a remarkably pretty Hungarian girl.  He often protested that his girls were terrified towalk through the Daily Worker office (as they sometimes had to) because, while they wriggled their way past he crowded chairs, each of the editors in turn reached back and pinched them.    In 1927, Mandel was elected to the Party's Central Committee at its fifth congress in 1927.  In 1929, he was re-elected as a \"candidate member\" at its sixth convention in March 1929. Later that year, he was expelled with followers of Jay Lovestone (known at the Lovestoneites) as an \"incurable right-wing deviationist\".\n\nParagraph 7: At St. Hugh's hospital, Sergeant June Ackland attends to a female victim of domestic assault, trying her utmost to assist a nurse deal with the chaos of Halloween admissions to the hospital. As she exits the waiting room, PC Jim Carver is revealed to be there after hiding behind a newspaper to not be seen by June. The nurse takes him to room and he claims he was putting up a shelf that collapsed onto him. As the nurse leaves him to attend to another issue, June enters his cubicle after hearing him talk to the nurse. She is skeptical about his claim about the shelf, suspecting he is being abused by his wife Marie (Melanie Hill). While he fails to open up about the abuse, they end up reminiscing on their 20 years together at Sun Hill. Back at the station, the ambulance finally arrives for Juliet. Elsewhere at the station, DCs Rob Thatcher and Eva Sharpe interview a boy who was found in possession of Alan Best's phone and wallet. His son Gary continues to spiral as he awaits the news of his father, expecting he won't be found alive. After snapping at PC Honey Harman and Sergeant Dale Smith earlier in the evening, he then demands Rob gives him two minutes with the boy, unaware his horrified mother is standing right next to him. Back at the hospital, June begins getting emotional about why Jim needs to leave Marie for his own sake, the nurse interrupts and reveals that Juliet has been brought in. Finding Inspector Gold and Sergeant Murphy, they watch on in horror as the crash team fail to revive Juliet. As she succumbs to her injuries, June follows a distraught Sheelagh outside and tries to comfort her, however she snaps and runs off. June is later told the victim of domestic assault has left, unaware that she is the wife of the man arrested for Juliet's murder, and she shows up at Sun Hill to discover her husband has committed murder. As Jim comforts June at the hospital, Marie arrives and begins to cause a scene, unaware that they are only emotional because Juliet died. After changing her tone, she goes to leave with Jim, making a point of saying that Jim walked into a cupboard door, confirming June's suspicions that Marie has been abusing him. Back at the station, Sheelagh hears a voice call her name in the yard, but she doesn't see her ex-lover Des Taviner appear from behind a car, revealing to the viewers that he survived the Area Car crash and explosion several episodes earlier. In custody, a team swarm around Juliet's killer Mark Nevett, but while Superintendent Okaro orders them to get off him, PC Gabriel Kent reveals he has swallowed his tongue. As Rob and Eva find Alan Best's body, news reaches Gary at the station, who storms into custody and attacks Ellis as he heads back to his cell under guard. Ellis runs off out of the open door and into the yard, chased onto the roof by Gary and Smithy. Ellis knocks Smithy over on the roof, then proceeds to swing a metal bar at Gary; as he drops his guard, Gary flies at him, causing them both to fall off the roof and land on a passing van. Fireworks begin exploding in the sky above the station.\n\nParagraph 8: He picked up the Player of the Season award for 1999–2000, and played for Birmingham in the 2001 Football League Cup Final loss to Liverpool, missing one of the spot kicks in the shootout. As Birmingham continued to improve in the First Division, and eventually earned promotion into the Premiership, Grainger's playing time became limited. He failed to appear for Birmingham due to injury during the first half of the 2003–04 season, and in February he was loaned to Coventry City, for whom he made seven league appearances. On 18 March 2004, he was recalled to Birmingham's team due to an injury crisis, and got on the scoresheet in a 2–1 defeat to Manchester United, but was himself injured and failed to appear in any matches for the rest of the season.\n\nParagraph 9: After her performance of \"Chasing Pavements\" in the first live show of the series, Prenger was the joint favourite to win. Panelist John Barrowman said, \"I love you to death, you connected with everyone and told the story – that's making a good Nancy!\" while Denise Van Outen, another panellist, commented that \"Nancy needs to have a lot of life experience and I see that coming through in your performance. It was absolutely brilliant\". Barry Humphries, another panellist, who had played Mr Sowerberry, the undertaker, in the original Lionel Bart West End stage production, said \"You've got that toughness and also a tenderness. A beautiful performance and a fine actress.\" Head judge Andrew Lloyd Webber said that Jodie could \"absolutely play this role.\" In week five Humphries said that Prenger was \"destined for the West End\", and in week eight Barrowman labelled Prenger his \"perfect Nancy\". In the week leading up to the final in week ten, the Nancy finalists posed for publicity pictures recreating some of Madonna's iconic images. Prenger posed in a wedding dress to recreate the cover of the album Like a Virgin. On 30 May, Webber revealed that theatrical producer Cameron Mackintosh, who produced the show in the West End, and joined the panel in week nine, was concerned about her curvaceous figure saying, \"Cameron thinks she is a bit too big and has more or less said so\". However, Webber defended Prenger, saying that she had both the vocal talents and personality for the role, saying \"Jodie could be anybody's idea of Nancy – I can see it absolutely. She has got a lovely voice and a super personality. She has experience as well.\" In the final, on 31 May, Prenger performed a total number of seven songs including her performance of \"As Long as He Needs Me\" after she was announced as winner. She also performed \"I'd Do Anything\" with all the Nancy and Oliver finalists; \"Son of a Preacher Man\"; \"Getting to Know You\" from the musical The King and I with Laurence ; \"Maybe This Time\" from the film Cabaret with Jessie Buckley and Samantha Barks as well as also singing \"As Long as he Needs Me\" and \"I Have Nothing\" from A Star Is Born before the final vote. Of her performance of \"Son of a Preacher Man\", Mackintosh said: \"Jodie has convinced me that she could make a Nancy. You absolutely deserve to be in the final.\" Barrowman said, \"every song she sings, you believe the words. I look forward to the day I can guest star with you on the West End stage!\" and Webber said, \"that was a very, very, very good performance. You have an outsize talent, and a very strong voice. I just don't know if it's going to be quite enough tonight, but it might be.\" In the second part of the live final, Prenger performed her favourite song from the series, \"I Have Nothing\", and Nancy's tragic love ballad, \"As Long As He Needs Me\". After she was announced as the winner, Prenger said, \"You have genuinely given me my dream, I can't actually put into words how I feel. I'm so grateful and so chuffed. I'm just Jodie from Blackpool and to be here is my dream.\" Andrew Lloyd Webber said, \"The people's Nancy. Jodie was always going to be the people's choice,\" adding \" I think people love her, they love her open personality. I think they relate to that personality and I think that's what makes her Nancy for the public. Her strengths are her personality and her very, very strong voice.\"  Mackintosh said, \"I'm thrilled for Jodie, congratulations!\" adding, \"She is obviously the public's view of what they want to see as Nancy. She'll give a terrific performance and I really look forward to putting her into training and getting her into rehearsals.\"\n\nParagraph 10: She also wrote a work entitled What I Would Do if I Were in Her Place, in which she envisions being queen and immolating herself on a great pyre. One of Lucile’s short stories, La Volière, tells of a young girl named Cloé who collected nests of baby birds she found in the woods and raised them in an aviary. One day, she returned home to find the aviary had been opened and the birds had escaped and flown away. The story concludes with an interaction between Cloé and her elderly neighbor: “These ingrates! what had they to desire? I shared with them the bread that was given to me for myself alone. I had them eat out of my hand. How faithfully I went to the garden to gather fruits fallen from the tree for them! I spent whole hours looking for the fresh worms they loved so much for them! [...] During the winter, when the snow covers the fields, where will they seek refuge? They will die of cold and hunger.... If the birdcatcher has not already trapped them to give them to cruel children, or else the inhuman hunter.... O my poor little birds, I pity you! Alas! you will miss me. Cruel parents, it is you who cause us all these evils.”", "answers": ["Paragraph 4"], "length": 3576, "dataset": "passage_retrieval_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "25a2b2062ac25f6c99611b2c28ca9ff3eec251ec176c1fb0"}
{"input": "Between 1976 and 1982, Albert Rovers, later known as Cork Albert and Cork United, played in the League of Ireland.

They later adopted the name Cork United and won the Munster Senior Cup for a third and fourth time in 1979-80 and 1981-82. However, the club faced financial difficulties and was expelled from the League of Ireland in 1982 after failing to pay Manchester City their appearance fee.", "context": "Paragraph 1: Between 1976–77 and 1981–82 Albert Rovers played in the League of Ireland.  In September 1976 Albert Rovers were elected to the league as replacements for Cork Hibernians. The team was managed by Noel O'Mahony and they made their League of Ireland debut against Shamrock Rovers at Flower Lodge on 3 October 1976. Albert Rovers had requested the game be moved to avoid a clash with the Cork Senior Hurling Championship final but Shamrock Rovers refused. The visitors won 2–1 with Larry Wyse and Mick Leech scoring their goals. The 1977–78 season saw the League of Ireland team adopt the name Cork Albert and for 1978–79 they became Cork Alberts. As Cork Albert the club won the Munster Senior Cup for a second time in 1977–78, defeating Limerick in the final. They were finalists in the 1977–78 League of Ireland Cup but lost out to Dundalk on penalties. England international Bobby Tambling finished his playing career with Cork Alberts while John Meyler also played for the club during this era. Following the demise of Cork Celtic in 1979, the club was Cork city's sole representative in the League of Ireland and the team adopted the name Cork United for the 1979–80 season. The club retained the Cork United name for the 1980–81 and 1981–82 seasons. Cork United managed to sign some notable players including Miah Dennehy, Ian Callaghan and Ian Hutchinson but they never managed to make the move beyond mid-table. As Cork United the club won the Munster Senior Cup for a third and fourth time in 1979–80 and 1981–82. In the finals they defeated Crosshaven and Waterford respectively. In December 1981 the club invested heavily in bringing Manchester City to Turners Cross for a friendly. Hampered by postponements and cancellations, the club slipped into debt and they were unable to pay Manchester City their £8,000 appearance fee. As a result, they were subsequently expelled from the League of Ireland.\n\nParagraph 2: In 1897, Annie received a grant from Girton College to acquire a short-focus camera with a 1.5-inch lens which she took on expeditions. The lens used was made by T.R. Dallmeyer, a famous London optician. She used this camera to photograph the outer solar corona from India in 1898. With this camera she captured the longest ray, coronal streamer, seen at the time with her own equipment that she operated and designed herself. Her camera was designed with a large field-of-view for photographing the Milky Way, which made it possible to look for faint and distant corona. To take photos of the eclipse, Annie took a series of photographs with her camera and ranging exposures during the couple minutes of the totality of the eclipse. Her photographs recorded a stream from the sun that extended over 10 million kilometres. The Irish science writer Agnes Clerke observed, \"Mrs. Maunder with her tiny lens has beaten all the big instruments.\" Annie's description of the direction and motion of the particles in the corona which she observed, describes the now accepted Parker Spiral structure of the solar wind. In 1900 Annie, along with other members of the BAA, travelled to Algiers to observe the total eclipse of the sun on 28 May of that year. The members of the association that accompanied her were Mary Acworth Evershed, Lilian Martin-Leake, and C. O. Stevens. She photographed the corona and observed \"plume\" like rays, coining the term which is still used today. In May 1901, the Maunders went on a solar expedition in Mauritius in which Annie was not included as an official observer (though her husband Walter was) and had to pay her own way. Since Annie was not an official observer, she decided to go to a separate location to photograph the eclipse. Of the two Mauritius corona photographs that were published, one was Walter's and one was Annie's. The only expedition in which Annie's expenses were paid for was the expedition to Canada where the Maunders were invited and sponsored by the Canadian Government.\n\nParagraph 3: In the early 1990s the UWA's popularity began to dwindle as less and less fans attended their shows. To try and combat the fan departure the UWA began working with long time rival promotion Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL), co-promoting shows and allowing UWA workers to also compete on CMLL shows. On April 2, 1993 the collaboration between the two companies led to Dr. Wagner Jr. defeating Pierroth Jr. to win the CMLL World Light Heavyweight Championship. Later that year the two promotions worked together to host a tournament for the newly created CMLL World Tag Team Championship with teams from the UWA and CMLL competing against each other. Dr. Wagner Jr. was teamed up with UWA's top name El Canek for the tournament, defeating the team of Vampiro and Pierroth Jr. in the finals to become the first CMLL World Tag Team Champions. Dr. Wagner Jr.'s first reign as CMLL World Light Heavyweight Champion ended on March 2, 1994 as he was defeated by Atlantis. By early 1994 Dr. Wagner Jr. began teaming with Gran Markus Jr. and El Hijo del Gladiador on a regular basis, forming a team known as La Nueva Ola Blanca (\"The New White Wave\"), adopting the name of his father's tag team. La Nueva Ola Blanca won the CMLL World Trios Championship on April 22, 1994 when they defeated Los Brazos (El Brazo, Brazo de Oro and Brazo de Plata). In November of that year El Canek stopped working for CMLL, forcing Dr. Wagner Jr. to give up his half of the world tag team championship. In early 1997 Dr. Wagner Jr. and Silver King won the CMLL World Tag Team Championship, but once again Dr. Wagner Jr. was forced to give up his half, this time because Silver King left CMLL to work for the US based World Championship Wrestling (WCW). He later won the championship for a third time, this time with Emilio Charles Jr. as his tag team partner. He later won the CMLL World Trips Championship on three additional occasions, with Black Warrior and Blue Panther, then with Blue Panther and Fuerza Guerrera, and finally with Black Tiger (his brother under a new ring identity) and Universo 2000.\n\nParagraph 4: Saudi Arabia and Australia uphold peaceful bilateral relations that have maintained a steady increase of Saudi Immigration to Australia. The economic relationship between the two nations also cannot be overlooked. The goods and service trade between Saudi Arabia and Australia reached $1.79 billion in 2019, making it Australia’s 27th largest trade partner. This relationship is strengthened through their shared membership within the G20, chaired by Saudi Arabian King Salman Bin Abdul-Aziz Al Saud, along with their mutual economic and trade dependence. A series of changes to Australia’s immigration policy in the latter period of the 20th Century, notably the conclusion of the White Australia policy in 1973, saw a drastic increase in overseas migration to Australia. Australia’s high number of overseas born residents (26%) is second only to Saudi Arabia itself whose overseas born population makes up 32%. Saudi Arabia, however, does not provide citizenship to these people; only working visas. The number of Saudi Arabians who currently reside in Australia is estimated at 14,214: 10,519 by birth and 3,696 by ancestry. Despite Australia’s immigration law changes that took place in the 1970s, Saudi Arabian immigration to Australia did not see a spike until the early 21st Century. According data from the Australian census, 70% of Saudi Arabian immigration to Australia took place between 2006 and 2015. Of these migrants, a majority of them stay for a temporary period of time, usually for study or work purposes, and return to Saudi Arabia with a qualification or work experience. In 2018, there was an estimated 4,500 Saudi Arabian students that attended an education facility in Australia. The increasing number of Saudi students studying in Australia can be attributed to the King Abdullah Scholarship Program, which provides economic stimulus packages to allow and encourage Saudi students to study overseas. Due to the inclusionary nature of this program, the students often come from varying backgrounds, cultures, religions and geographical regions within Saudi Arabia, contributing to the differing experiences of students in Australia. Of these students, over three quarters of them are male and as for a woman wishing to take part in the program must have a male relative accompanying her overseas. This is representative of the overall demographics of Saudi Arabians in Australia, with the majority of immigrants being men. The male majority can be accredited to the laws and legislations surrounding travelling in and out of Saudi Arabia. Women are not permitted to travel around Saudi Arabia (or leave the Kingdom) without the supervision of a male guardian; being a husband, relative or sponsor.\n\nParagraph 5: Under head coach Bernie Moore, LSU won their first Southeastern Conference (SEC) Championship finishing with a 5–0 conference record and 9–2–0 overall in 1935. LSU played in their first Sugar Bowl game, falling to No. 4 TCU 3–2 at Tulane Stadium. The Tigers  and Horned Frogs both took home the Williamson Poll national championship, which is not claimed by LSU. End Gaynell Tinsley was named a consensus All-American in 1935 and 1936, becoming the first All-America selection for LSU. Coach Moore once said, \"Tinsley could have made All-American at any position. He was so tough, he made blockers quit. He's the greatest lineman I ever saw.\" Along with Tinsley in the line were Marvin Stewart, Justin Rukas, and Jeff Barrett. In the backfield were Mickal, Jesse Fatherree, and Pinky Rohm – all members of LSU's \"Early Days\" team of the century. The team's quarterback was Bill May, awarded the Jacobs Blocking Trophy in 1936. The 1936 team won the school's second SEC Championship finishing with a 6–0 conference record and 9–1–1 overall. The Tigers finished runner-up to Minnesota in the AP Poll. LSU won the Williamson Poll and Sagarin Ratings national championships, which are not claimed by the school.  LSU's largest margin of victory, and most points scored in a football game came on November 21, in a game at Tiger Stadium against USL (University of Southwestern Louisiana, now University of Louisiana Lafayette).  The final score was LSU 93, USL 0. The 1937 team featured Ken Kavanaugh and was upset by Vanderbilt using a hidden ball trick, the school's first-ever victory over a ranked opponent. This season also featured the first game in the Florida–LSU football rivalry, which was won 19–0 by LSU. In 1939, in a game against Holy Cross, Kavanaugh caught four touchdown passes in the 26–7 win. According to Kavanaugh and teammate Young Bussey, Kavanaugh found four rusty nails on the sideline during the game. The next week against Rice, he found another nail and scored another touchdown to give LSU a 7–0 win. The pattern continued against Loyola and Vanderbilt, as Kavanaugh found two nails before each game and in each scored two touchdowns. A sportswriter for the Baton Rouge Advocate claimed he saw coach Moore at a local store stocking up on nails before LSU's game against No. 1 Tennessee. Kavanaugh failed to score in the game, however, and the Tigers lost 20–0. The Nashville Banner named Kavanaugh co-MVP of the Southeastern Conference along with Bob Foxx of Tennessee. Kavanaugh was a consensus All-America selection for the 1939 All-America Team. The 1943 team was led by Steve Van Buren, moved to running back because of a lack of players due to World War II conscription, and won the Orange Bowl. Van Buren led the NCAA in scoring that season, with 98 points (110 including the bowl game). The 1946 team played in one of the most notable instances of the Cotton Bowl Classic – \"Ice Bowl.\" LSU, led by head coach Moore and quarterback Y. A. Tittle, entered the game against Arkansas with a 9–1 record. Ice, sleet and snow pelted the stadium as LSU players filled oil drums with charcoal and started fires for makeshift heaters while fans built fires in the stands. LSU dominated the game with a 271–54 advantage in total yards and 15–1 advantage in first downs, but that did not equate to the numbers on the scoreboard; the game ended in a 0–0 tie and LSU finished the season 9–1–1.\n\nParagraph 6: Millbrook School was founded in 1931 by Edward Pulling. Pulling was a graduate of both Princeton University and Cambridge University, and he taught at Groton School and Avon Old Farms as well as private schools in the United Kingdom. While at Avon, Pulling began to think of creating his own school. His philosophy for a school was heavily influenced by the traditional setting he experienced at Groton and in the UK, as well as the progressive ideology that Avon possessed. After searching for suitable grounds to house the school — including an offer from then Governor Franklin D. Roosevelt to build in Hyde Park, New York — Pulling and his wife decided on the Stephenson farm just five miles (8 km) outside Millbrook in nearby Stanford, New York.\n\nParagraph 7: The close loss to the Dragons wouldn't last long in the memories of Titans fans as a week later the Gold Coast franchise recorded their first official victory in another tight match, winning 18–16 against the Cronulla Sharks at home. The start of the season saw the Titans only manage four wins in the first ten rounds but a mid-season five-week-long winning streak of four wins and a bye saw the Titans sitting in the top four at the conclusion of Round 15. The streak was ended in a poor 22–6 loss against the New Zealand Warriors at home, then they slumped to a 5-match losing streak which included a golden point loss to the Brisbane Broncos in Round 17 and a 56–10 loss at the hands of the Canberra Raiders in Round 18. The Titans wouldn't register another win until Round 21, but by then they had already slipped to 11th position and needed to obtain maximum points from the final four rounds to confirm a spot in the finals in their maiden season. The side only managed one win from the final four matches, however, missing out on the finals. In the final round, a 50–6 thrashing at the hands of [Melbourne Storm] ended the Titans' debut season on somewhat of a sour note, with the young Gold Coast franchise finishing the season in 12th position with 10 wins, 14 losses and a bye for 22 competition points.\n\nParagraph 8: The problem originally arose in algebraic invariant theory. Here the ring R is given as a (suitably defined) ring of polynomial invariants of a linear algebraic group over a field k acting algebraically on a polynomial ring k[x1, ..., xn] (or more generally, on a finitely generated algebra defined over a field). In this situation the field K is the field of rational functions (quotients of polynomials) in the variables xi which are invariant under the given action of the algebraic group, the ring R is the ring of polynomials which are invariant under the action. A classical example in nineteenth century was the extensive study (in particular by Cayley, Sylvester, Clebsch, Paul Gordan and also Hilbert) of invariants of binary forms in two variables with the natural action of the special linear group SL2(k) on it. Hilbert himself proved the finite generation of invariant rings in the case of the field of complex numbers for some classical semi-simple Lie groups (in particular the general linear group over the complex numbers) and specific linear actions on polynomial rings, i.e. actions coming  from finite-dimensional representations of the Lie-group. This finiteness result was later extended by Hermann Weyl to the class of all semi-simple Lie-groups. A major ingredient in Hilbert's proof is the Hilbert basis theorem applied to the ideal inside the polynomial ring generated by the invariants.\n\nParagraph 9: Returning to the United States, Lowell opened his own practice in Boston in 1899 and was successful immediately. By 1906, he had opened a branch office in New York  and later split each week between New York and Boston. His commissions included large public, academic, and commercial buildings, as well as many distinctive residences, country estates, and formal gardens. He was the architect and landscape architect for the first Charles River dam, completed in 1910, which transformed the tidal river into the Charles River Basin. He designed five structures on the dam: the Upper and Lower Lock Gate Houses, the Stable, the Boat House, and an open pavilion. As part of the dam's construction, Frederick Law Olmsted's Charlesbank was extended from Charles Circle to the Harvard Bridge, and Lowell was responsible for the landscape design of the Boston Embankment, now universally known as the Esplanade. Lowell is perhaps most recognized for his design of two public buildings: the Boston Museum of Fine Arts (1906–09 and later additions) and the New York State Supreme Court building in New York City (1912–1914 and 1919–1927). Some of his other commissions included Lowell Lecture Hall at Harvard and academic buildings at Phillips Academy Andover, Simmons College, and Brown University.\n\nParagraph 10: In early 1777 the British planned to cut New England off from the rest of the colonies by sending a force under John Burgoyne southward from Montreal through the Lake Champlain area and the Hudson Valley to Albany. This was intended to be supported by a force under Howe advancing northward from New York City. However, George Germain, a British civilian official managing the war in London, also gave approval for Howe to capture Philadelphia. Howe proceeded with the Philadelphia plan and failed to support Burgoyne's campaign. The Philadelphia campaign was time-consuming but successful; the British took a lengthy water route through Chesapeake Bay, marched overland to defeat Washington at the Battle of Brandywine on 11 September, and entered Philadelphia unopposed on 26 September. However, by that time the initial success of Burgoyne's campaign had come to a defeat in the first of the Battles of Saratoga, at Freeman's Farm on 19 September. Shortly after this, Henry Clinton, having returned from the Rhode Island expedition, moved north from New York City and on 6 October successfully attacked Forts Clinton and Montgomery, just north of Bear Mountain on the Hudson. Clinton's expedition also raided as far north as Kingston. However, all three dispatch riders sent to inform Burgoyne of their success were captured, so Burgoyne was unaware of this. Following defeat at Bemis Heights on 7 October and a subsequent siege, Burgoyne surrendered his army on 17 October. This victory persuaded France to enter the war on the Patriot side. Word of it reached Commissioner Benjamin Franklin in Paris on 4 December, and negotiations resulted in France declaring war on Britain in March 1778. Howe resigned his command and Henry Clinton took charge of the British force in Philadelphia. Due to the French naval threat, Clinton was ordered to abandon Philadelphia and bring his army to New York City. The British left Philadelphia on 18 June. Washington's army shadowed Clinton's, and Washington successfully forced a battle at Monmouth Courthouse on 28 June, the last major battle in the North. By July, Clinton was in New York City, and Washington was again at White Plains, New York. Both armies were back where they had been two years earlier. The military focus of the war shifted to the southern colonies. Eventually, the American victory in the Yorktown campaign on 19 October 1781 proved to be the key to independence; the British received word of it on 25 November. This precipitated a collapse of Lord North's Tory government in March 1782. The new Whig government suspended offensive operations in the Thirteen Colonies and commenced lengthy peace negotiations, culminating in the Treaty of Paris that ended the war on 3 September 1783. On 25 November the British forces departed New York City; this is remembered as Evacuation Day.\n\nParagraph 11: Port Blair serves as the entry point for visiting the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Port Blair is connected with mainland India by both air and sea. It is a two to three-hour flight from mainland India to Port Blair's Veer Savarkar International Airport, and three to four days by sea to reach Kolkata, Chennai, or Visakhapatnam from Haddo Wharf in Port Blair. It is home to several museums and a major naval base INS Jarawa of the Indian Navy, along with sea and air bases of the Indian Coast Guard, Andaman and Nicobar Police, Andaman and Nicobar Command, the first integrated tri-command of the Indian Armed Forces and the Indian Air Force.", "answers": ["Paragraph 1"], "length": 3590, "dataset": "passage_retrieval_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "0eafb6689a5f8285604cf0da2cb84bfba1be73a552c744a4"}
{"input": "Frances emigrated to Australia in the 1960s and had a successful acting career. She appeared in various theater productions and toured regional Western Australia. She also hosted a television show called Tom's TV Bingo. Frances gained fame for her roles in the film adaptation of The Box and the TV show The Lost Islands. However, she became well-known across Australia for her portrayal of Sister Grace Scott in the soap opera The Young Doctors. She later moved to Melbourne with her husband and worked as a television reporter on a current affairs program.", "context": "Paragraph 1: The gas also contained a mutagenic compound called \"quantum juice\" (or \"Q-juice\"). Most of those exposed to it - police included - died on the spot. The rest mutated, some being deformed, some gaining unusual abilities in the process. Others not personally involved in the conflict also became mutated as well. The survivors were dubbed \"bang babies\". The mayor disavowed any involvement. The survivors went on to become superheroes and supervillains that continued to roam the city of Dakota for years to come. The survivors of two gangs - the Paris Bloods and Force Syndicate - formed the core of the Blood Syndicate, a gang of bang babies which claimed Paris Island as their turf. The citizens of Dakota demanded the mayor to solve the Bang Babies problem and wanted to know where gas came from, but the mayor didn't give them a straight answer due to her involvement.\n\nParagraph 2: Frances' acting career flourished after she had emigrated to Australia in the 1960s. She worked at the Playhouse Theatre in Perth appearing in Henry IV Parts I and 2, (1967) directed by Edgar Metcalfe; and Mary Mary which toured regional Western Australia and played a season at the Playhouse. She appeared nightly on television as the host of Channel 9's Tom's TV Bingo; Tom's was a supermarket in Perth. After taking a lead role in The Box, the 1975 film adaptation of the sex-comedy soap opera of the same name, and the role of Mrs Quinn in The Lost Islands in 1976, she became known across Australia for her long-running role of the strict and acidic Sister Grace Scott in daily soap opera The Young Doctors. After leaving that series to move to Melbourne with her husband who had been transferred there, she worked as a television reporter on \"light\" stories for Peter Couchman's Melbourne, a current affairs program hosted by Peter Couchman.\n\nParagraph 3: Named for Monsignor Pace the first native-born Floridian to become a diocesan priest, the first all-male, freshmen and sophomore classes commenced in September 1961 in the old parish hall of Our Lady of Perpetual Help on NW 28th Avenue in Opa-Locka under the direction of Marist Brothers from Cuba and New York. Classes moved to buildings at the school's present site in October 1961. All-female classes were added the next year under the direction of the women of the Teresian Association. The original mascot was the Lion, and the colors were green and white, but students voted in the third school year to change the mascot to the Spartan, and the colors to scarlet and gold. The first class of 32 graduated in 1964 at the present day Jackie Gleason Auditorium. Pace's first graduating class created the first newspaper, called the Kerygma (\"The Proclamation\") as well as the first Torch yearbook, which acquired its name from president John F. Kennedy's inauguration speech, in which he referred to passing the \"torch\" to the next generation. Pace's school seal was also designed that year to be engraved on the class rings, and the school's motto was chosen as well. It was in the 1964–1965 school year that the tradition of \"Freshmen Orientation,\" began in which seniors welcome freshmen, in a tradition that continues to this day, but in a milder form. The first co-institutional class graduated in 1966, the same year in which the school's alma mater, Gratia et Veritas, was composed. Just one year later, the first football team was formed and the school celebrated its first football Homecoming Week, after having had several Spirit Weeks for the basketball team. By 1969, the school already had seven buildings, including five academic buildings, a field house, and an on-campus residence for the Teresian Association, which switch homes with the Marist brothers just three years later for a home they felt better suited their lifestyle. The first state championship was won in 1971 by the Cross Country team, in time for a banner to be hung in the new gymnasium, constructed in that school year, along with the adjoining cafeteria. By the 1974-1975 year, after several years of gender-mixing in classes such as math and science, the school became officially co-educational. The first senior trip to Canada took place four years later in February 1979, becoming a tradition for every senior class after it. In Homecoming of 1979, the first King was chosen by the student body, and the Powderpuff game in which boys cheered and girls played flag football, was introduced five years later. Pace celebrated its 25th anniversary in the 1985–1986 school year, and the 25th senior class graduated in 1988. Tons of Love, an annual fall food drive, began in 1987, the first year of the L.I.F.E. (Living In Faith Experience) youth group, a key component of the Campus Ministry Program. In the early 1990s, Pace underwent several facility improvements, such as outdoor lockers, school-wide air conditioning, and renovated science labs. The gym was renovated in 1997 and renamed for Brother Felix Anthony, a Marist brother who served as a teacher and basketball coach from 1965 to 1988. Pace's cafetorium, the Spartan Center, was completed in that same year after three years of construction, and the newest classroom building (500) was finished in 1999. In 2002, the school was named a Blue Ribbon School of Excellence at the end of its 40th Anniversary year, and the 40th class graduated just a year later in 2003. The school was a named one of the Top 50 Catholic High Schools in this period as well and received an award for Catholic Identity in 2004. After far outgrowing the \"old chapel\" found in the school's first building, a new building, the Dantee Navarro Religious Education Center, was completed in 2008 and can hold 500 people, although masses are still held in the gymnasium. It was in that same year that Pace was named the first official \"green school\" in South Florida by instituting a recycling program and initiating changes across campus, from lighting to landscaping. Pace celebrated its 50th anniversary in the 2011–2012 school year, and its 50th class graduated in 2013.\n\nParagraph 4: The album's most famous song is the title track, which has since become a country classic. In 1969, while staying at the Fort Worther Motel in Fort Worth, Texas, Jennings was inspired to start writing the song when he saw advertising on a newspaper promoting Tina Turner as a \"good hearted woman loving a two-timing man\", a reference to Ike Turner. Jennings went to talk to Willie Nelson, who was in a middle of a poker game, and told Nelson about his idea.  While they kept playing, they expanded the lyrics as Nelson's wife Connie Koepke was writing them down. The extent of Nelson's contribution remains open to question, however.  In the authorized Jennings video biography Renegade Outlaw Legend, Nelson admits, \"I think he had most of that song written.  We were in a poker game and he said, 'Hey, I'm writin' a song,' so we laid out of the poker game for a few hands.  I think I gave him a line or two and wound up with half the song.\"  In Michael Striessguth's book Outlaw: Waylon, Willie, Kris, and the Renegades of Nashville, Jennings guitarist Billy Ray Reynolds insists that Waylon approached him to work on the song around the same time but Reynolds refused, feeling that the song was finished:  \"The next day or so, he got into a poker game and he did the same thing to Willie.  And Waylon even suggested the line that Willie is supposed to have written.  It was Waylon's line and Willie said, 'Hey, I like that.'  So Willie wound up with half the song and half the publishing.  I don't want to make Willie mad at me, but Waylon already had that song written.\"  It soared to #3 on the country singles chart, followed by \"Sweet Dream Woman,\" which reached #7.  Jennings also recorded the Nelson composition \"It Should Be Easier Now\" and the metaphorical Kristofferson's tune \"To Beat the Devil.\"  In 2013, author Michael Striessguth wrote that Jennings \"painted the song with authenticity that could only come from a childhood in poverty and ten years of hard living on the road; indeed, it was one of the first times anybody could sit back and say, 'Waylon nailed that one.'\"  Jennings also contributed \"Do No Good Woman\" to the album.\n\nParagraph 5: Many of the characters have deep psychological traumas in relation to their parents. Shinji's introversion and social anxiety stem from the death of his mother at an early age and his abandonment by his father. Asuka was the target of her mother's insanity, and discovered her mother's body after she hanged herself; her tough, bullying personality is a means of distracting herself from her pain, and she has made piloting Unit 02 her only source of pride and satisfaction. Misato's father neglected her when she was a child; after he was killed in the Second Impact, she stopped talking for a couple of years. In episode 25, Misato states that she was both attracted to and afraid of Ryoji Kaji because he reminded her of her father. Similarly, many scenes overlap images of Shinji's mother with images of his potential lovers, both lining up with Freudian theories. Ritsuko saw her mother having an affair with Gendo Ikari; after her mother's suicide she felt both attraction and hate towards Gendo. Indeed, the last two episodes are \"stripped of the high-tech gadgetry and the colorful visuals that characterize the earlier episodes in the series, these last two episodes take place largely in muted tones… a form of interrogation proceeds to be carried out as he [Shinji] asks himself—or is asked by an unseen voice—probing psychological questions.\" The questions elicit unexpected answers, particularly the ones dealing with Shinji's motivation for piloting the Eva—he feels worthless and afraid of others (especially his father) if he is not piloting the Eva. Asuka and Rei are also depicted in deep introspection and consideration of their psyches. Asuka comes to the realization that her entire being is caught up in being a competent Eva pilot and that without it, she has no personal identity: \"I'm the junk… I'm worthless. Nobody needs a pilot who can't control her own Eva.\" Rei, who throughout the series has displayed minimal emotion, reveals that she does have one impulse; it is Thanatos, an inclination to death: \"I am Happy. Because I want to die, I want to despair, I want to return to nothing.\" In episode 25 Shinji and Asuka both show that they in fact suffered similar pasts and found different ways of dealing with it. This is further established in Shinji when he claims he has no life without Eva and this is disproven by the world shown in episode 26 followed by the famous \"Congratulations\" scene.\n\nParagraph 6: Perinatal asphyxia (also known as neonatal asphyxia or birth asphyxia) is the medical condition resulting from deprivation of oxygen to a newborn infant that lasts long enough during the birth process to cause physical harm, usually to the brain. It is also the inability to establish and sustain adequate or spontaneous respiration upon delivery of the newborn. It remains a serious condition which causes significant mortality and morbidity. It is an emergency condition and requires adequate and quick resuscitation measures. Perinatal asphyxia is also an oxygen deficit from the 28th week of gestation to the first seven days following delivery. It is also an insult to the fetus or newborn due to lack of oxygen or lack of perfusion to various organs and may be associated with a lack of ventilation. In accordance with WHO, perinatal asphyxia is characterised by: profound metabolic acidosis, with a pH less than 7.20 on umbilical cord arterial blood sample, persistence of an APGAR score of 3 at the 5th minute,                                                           clinical neurologic sequelae in the immediate neonatal period, or evidence of multiorgan system dysfunction in the immediate neonatal period. Hypoxic damage can occur to most of the infant's organs (heart, lungs, liver, gut, kidneys), but brain damage is of most concern and perhaps the least likely to quickly or completely heal. In more pronounced cases, an infant will survive, but with damage to the brain manifested as either mental, such as developmental delay or intellectual disability, or physical, such as spasticity.\n\nParagraph 7: The social and political order of medieval Europe was relatively stable until the development of the mobile cannon in the 15th century. Up until that time a noble with a small force could hold their castle or walled town for years even against large armies - and so they were rarely disposed. Once effective cannons were available, walls were of far less defensive value and rulers needed expensive field armies to keep control of a territory. This encouraged the formation of princely and kingly states, which needed to tax the common people much more heavily to pay for the expensive weapons and armies required to provide security in the new age. Up until the late 15th century, surviving medieval treaties on government were concerned with advising rulers on how to serve the common good: Assize of Bread is an example of medieval law specifically drawn up in the interests of the common people.   But then works by Philippe de Commines, Niccolò Machiavelli and later Cardinal Richelieu began advising rulers to consider their own interests and that of the state ahead of what was \"good\", with Richelieu explicitly saying the state is above morality in doctrines such as Raison d'Etat.  This change of orientation among the nobles left the common people less content with their place in society. A similar trend occurred regarding the clergy, where many priests began to abuse the great power they had due to the sacrament of contrition. The Reformation was a movement that aimed to correct this, but even afterwards the common people's trust in the clergy continued to decline – priests were often seen as greedy and lacking in true faith. An early major social upheaval driven in part by the common people's mistrust of both the nobility and clergy occurred in Great Britain with the English Revolution of 1642. After the forces of Oliver Cromwell triumphed, movements like the Levellers rose to prominence demanding equality for all. When the general council of Cromwell's army met to decide on a new order at the Putney Debates of 1647, one of the commanders, Colonel Thomas Rainsborough, requested that political power be given to the common people. According to historian Roger Osbourne, the Colonel's speech was the first time a prominent person spoke in favour of universal male suffrage, but it was not to be granted until 1918. After much debate it was decided that only those with considerable property would be allowed to vote, and so after the revolution political power in England remained largely controlled by the nobles, with at first only a few of the most wealthy or well-connected common people sitting in Parliament.\n\nParagraph 8: Cope and Wylie briefly teamed up in The Nova Mob (along with future Banshees drummer Budgie) which lasted for one gig before Cope reunited with McCulloch in the similarly short-lived Uh! (which also featured drummer Dave Pickett). Cope and McCulloch went on to form a fourth group, A Shallow Madness, retaining Pickett as drummer but recruiting organ player Paul Simpson and part-time guitarist Michael \"Mick\" Finkler. Cope and McCulloch's ongoing ego clashes led to the latter leaving the band during rehearsals, ultimately to form Echo and the Bunnymen. Cope, meanwhile, had befriended Liverpool scenester Gary \"Rocky\" Dwyer and had suggested a new band name to him – The Teardrop Explodes, taken from a panel caption in the Marvel comic strip Daredevil (No. 77). Dwyer's initial response was a laconic \"that’s a weird one you’ve got there, Jules.\"\n\nParagraph 9: In 1747 the Hurons insisted on his returning to restore tranquillity to their nation. The father had almost completely recovered from his palsy, and willingly consented. He set out from Montreal on 10 September, and reached Detroit on 20 October. From this date until 1751, leaving the loyal Hurons in the keeping of Father Potier at the Detroit village, he directed all his energies to reclaiming Nicolas Orontondi's band of insurgent Hurons. These had already in 1740, owing to a bloody feud with the Detroit Ottawas and to the reluctance, if not refusal, of Governor Beauharnais to let the Hurons remove to Montreal, sullenly left Detroit and settled at \"Little Lake\" (now Rondeau Harbour) near Sandusky. There they had been won over to the English cause, had openly revolted in 1747, and had murdered a party of Frenchmen. Early in the spring of 1748 Orontondi set fire to the fort and cabins at Sandusky, and withdrew to the White River, not far from the junction of the Ohio and Wabash Rivers. Until his death, which occurred some time after September 1749, Orontondi continued to intrigue with the English emissaries, the Iroquois, and the disaffected Miamis. When there was no longer doubt of the renegade leader's demise, de La Richardie resolved on a final attempt at conciliation. He had already at intervals spent months at a time among the fugitives, and now in September 1750, at the peril of his life he started, with only three canoe men for the country of the \"Nicolites\" as they were then termed. The greater number remained obdurate. It is the descendants of the latter who in July 1843, removed from their lands at Upper Sandusky, Ohio, to beyond the Mississippi, to occupy the Wyandot reserve in the extreme north-eastern part of Oklahoma. The father's failing strength obliged his superiors to recall him to Quebec in 1751, and on 30 June he bade a final farewell to the Mission of Our Lady of the Assumption among the Hurons in Detroit. From the autumn of 1751 until his death he filled various offices in Quebec College. His Huron name was Ondechaouasti. He died at Quebec.\n\nParagraph 10: Grayson was born as Frances Wilson in Cherokee Village, Arkansas, to Andrew Jackson \"A.J.\" Wilson and Minnie M. Lewis. She had two brothers: Walter M. Wilson later became a grocer in Muncie, Indiana. The other, Roscoe Jesse \"Jack\" Wilson died young (before 1924). In 1896, the family moved from Arkansas to Indiana, where she graduated from Muncie High School in Muncie. She next attended the Chicago Musical College in Chicago, Illinois. Her plan was to accompany her brother \"Jack\", who planned to be a professional singer. When her brother died she stopped studying music. She then attended Swarthmore College in Swarthmore, Pennsylvania, for recitation and dramatic arts.\n\nParagraph 11: Lakhan Kotri is a big locality in Rajasthan. Before the arrival of Hazrat Khwaja Moinuddin Chishty in Ajmer, the local King Prithvi Raj Chouhan had a very beautiful woman here. This woman belonged to Bhil caste. Prithvi Raj Chouhan had twenty-one sons through this woman, which is supported by the statement adduced by Farzand Ali, who was son of Wazeer Ali Khadim Khwaja Saheb on 15th February 1929 min the Court of First-Class Magistrate Ajmer, Jenab Mangilal Dosi and the same is also certified by the national history of Magare-Merwara. Out of them, four sons had died, among the remaining fifteen sons, Lakha Bhil, the son of this very Bhil woman used to reside in this locality along with his other brothers, Teka Bhil, Shakka Bhil, Bheekas Bhil, Jodha Bhil and Bardha Bhil at the time of Prithvi Raj rule, at the time of arrival of Khwaja saheb in Ajmer. By the name of this Lakha Bhil, this locality was called Lakhan Kotri and even today the same is called as such and is popular by the same. This statement is supported by the same name. This statement is supported by Col. James Tode’s historical book Tode of Rajasthan also and page no. 43 of the book” Moin-Ul-Arwah” and page no. 71 and 72 of the books “Ahsanul Sair” also support this statement. The same is proved by page no. 71 of the book by name History of Khwaja Ajmeri. More ever, in the very same locality there was silver mine, but when silver stopped to emerge, the same was closed due to the same not being profit rendering. At the time of arrival of British and in the last period of Mughals also this locality was a solitude Jungle but at the ending of the year 1817, when this city came under the capture of Britishers, the well to do persons got constructed houses after obtaining permission from British officials, which assumed the shapes of Kothies later on. The grave (Tomb) of the very same Lakha Bhil is existing in the locality Salawtan Upar wali Hathai Lane, Lakhan Kotri even now. This statement is supported by page no. 410 of book Kitab Moinul Arwah written by Nawab Khadim Hussain also and pages number 71 & 72 of the book “Ahsanul Sair” also prove that these so called khadims have continued to go there till the year 1947 AD. And continued to celebrate the Annual Urs of Lakha Bhil. Today Haji Iftekhar Ali son of Sarfraz alone is a Khadim, who pays visit to the tomb of his fore father, Lakha Bhil, regularly and resorts to phool, agarbatti etc But when these Khadims notices that there is none to know about their reality, they took advantage of this and started telling that tombs of both the wives of Khwaja in the Tosha Khana of the tomb of Khwaja Saheb and the tomb of others, is the tomb of the so called Fakhruddin Gardezi and here also they have started extracting amount from the innocent people. After gathering the historical informations of Lakahn Kotri in whose name the locality was inherited and the same is still as such, i.e. on a Bhil by name Lakha they were liventy one brother who were the so-called children of Prithvi Raj Chouhan, out of these brothers, Lakha, Tekka, Shakha, Bheeka, Jodha and Birdha approached Khwaja Saheb and in this manner, they started to visit Khwaja Saheb regularly. At the time when Khwaja Saheb was spreading Islam, Lakha Bhil, Teeka Bhil embraced Islam and accepted Khwaja Saheb as their Murshad (Religious Master) and this incident is of the year 1178 (Chander Bhai) and in the meanwhile there was Bikram Year 1265. Thus, after Lakha Bhil and Teka Bhil embraced Islam, the Islmic names were again given to them by Khwaja Saheb, i.e.the name of Lakha was kept as Fakharuddin and the name of Teka as Moahmmed Yadgar. Thus, Lakha Bhil, on account of being the child of Mohammed Yadgar is Sheikhzada Khadim. In this way, those who are associated with Anjuman Moinia Fakhriya Chishtia Syed Zadgan Khuddam Khwaja Saheb, are from the off springs of Lakha Bhil and those who are associated with Anjuman Yadgar Chishtia Sheikh Zadgan Khuddam. Khwaja Saheb are the off springs of Teka Bhil.", "answers": ["Paragraph 2"], "length": 3919, "dataset": "passage_retrieval_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "5492d5792ccb7a5559cb09e430da6e887d990355510e94ac"}
{"input": "The text discusses a book called \"The Hidden Dangers of the Rainbow: The New Age Movement and Our Coming Age of Barbarism\" written by Constance Cumbey in 1983. The book offers a Christian perspective that criticizes the New Age movement. However, Cumbey's promotion of conspiracy theories linking the movement to Benjamin Creme, theosophy, and Nazism caused her to lose academic credibility. She is accused of lumping together anything that deviates from strict Christian interpretation and making irresponsible accusations. Cumbey's accusations include claiming that the New Age movement has infiltrated Christianity and Judaism, and is behind various organizations and movements such as ecumenism, holistic health centers, and secular humanism. She also alleges that Unitarian churches and health food stores serve as recruitment centers for the New Age movement, and that it has connections to Hitler and a plan to overthrow the United States and establish a Nazi-like regime.", "context": "Paragraph 1: In March 1950, the Blue Barron Orchestra released \"Are You Lonesome Tonight?\" with \"Penny Wise and Love Foolish\" on the B-side, and it peaked at number nineteen on Billboard's Top Pop Singles chart. In April Don Cornell released a version without the narrative bridge as the B-side of his RCA Victor single, \"Stay With the Happy People\". Billboard called it a: \"dreamy waltz ... (that) gets effective treatment (on the recording)\". Based on votes sent to Billboard, the song received 78 points from disc jockeys, 78 from record dealers, 79 from jukebox operators and 78 points overall; on the magazine's 100-point scale, it was rated \"Good\". Al Jolson recorded a version with the spoken bridge on April 28, 1950, in Los Angeles; Gordon Jenkins conducted the orchestra. With \"No Sad Songs For Me\" on the B-side, it was released by Decca Records in June. According to Billboard, although the version was \"revived\" by Jolson's \"schmaltz style\" his recitation of the bridge was \"hamboned\". Based on votes sent to the magazine, the song received 71 points from disc jockeys, 71 from record dealers and 71 from jukebox operators; with an overall score of 71, it was rated \"Good\". In 1958 Jim Flaherty's Western Caravan recorded the song on the www.frankierecords.com/ label, with B-side My Foolish Heart sung by Maury Dubois. This version with vocals by Howie Stange gained quite a following in New England, mainly due to Jim Flaherty's tireless promoting. At the November 1959 DJ Convention held in Nashville, Jim Flaherty handed Chet Atkins a copy of song with the encouragement of getting \"that kid down south (Elvis Presley) who is shaking things up\" to record it. In 1959, Jaye P. Morgan released the song on MGM Records, with \"Miss You\" on the B-side, and her version peaked at number 65 on Billboard's Pop Singles chart.\n\nParagraph 2: In 1952, Kuroya and his colleagues attempted to identify an infectious agent in human tissue samples at Tohoku University Hospital, Sendai, Japan. The samples were taken from the lung of a newborn child that was affected by fatal pneumonia. The primary isolate from the samples was passaged in mice and subsequently in embryonated eggs.  The isolated infectious agent was later called Sendai virus, which was used interchangeably with the name “Hemagglutinating Virus of Japan”. Kuroya and his colleagues were convinced that they isolated the virus, which is a new etiological agent for human respiratory infections. Later in 1954, Fukumi and his colleagues at the Japan National Institute of Health put forward an alternative explanation for the origin of the virus. It was suggested that the mice used to passage the virus were infected with the mouse virus. Thus, mouse virus was later transferred to embryonated eggs, isolated and finally named the Sendai virus. This explanation of Fukumi, pointing to the mouse rather than the human origin of the virus, has been supported by numerous scientific data later. The historical aspects of the Sendai virus isolation and controversy behind it are well described in the review. Thus, for some time, it was erroneously assumed that Sendai virus is human disease causing pathogen. The incorrect assumption that the virus was isolated from human infectious material is still reported by Encyclopædia Britannica and by ATCC in the description of the history of the viral isolate Sendai/52. It was also believed that the virus could cause disease not only in humans but also in pigs, because antibodies to the virus were often found in their organisms during the swine epidemic in Japan in 1953–1956. High incidence of seropositivity to the virus was observed in pigs in 15 districts of Japan.  An explanation was later found for this widespread detection of antibodies (see the section below). Yet, despite overwhelming evidence that indicate that SeV is host restrictive rodent pathogen, in some veterinary manuals. and safety leaflets, SeV is still listed as a virus that can cause disease in pigs. Similar information is provided by Encyclopædia Britannica. In reality, the multiple isolates of paramyxoviruses in pigs, using modern nucleic acid sequencing methods, have never been identified as SeV.\n\nParagraph 3: In the meantime and under the bishop's instruction, the veteran pioneering parish priest Dean John Thomas Lynch and first administrator of the Armidale Diocese was responsible for the construction of the diocese' first cathedral. After receiving the Abstinence Pledge from many & laying foundation stones at places such as Maitland, Grafton & Tenterfield to name a few, Dean Lynch officiated at the laying of the foundation stone in Armidale on 8 December 1870. The Armidale Express reported the occasion and provided a photographer. 1870 was the centenary of the discovery of Australia by Captain Cook and the same year that Thunderbolt was apprehended at Kentucky Creek. Built on the same site as the present cathedral at the corner of Dangar St and Barney St, the brick, stone and shingle cathedral was opened and dedicated in 1872 as the principal church of the Catholic Diocese of Armidale. Growth was quick due to mission donations from Europe and the opportunities of this region. There is a later 1912 historic photo of the new and old cathedrals standing side by side – illustrating the wisdom of the buildings project managers. Parts of the first cathedral were recycled to the Bundarra Catholic church & to the nearby St Marys primary school. Dean Lynch was well known in Maitland and Taree parishes prior to his duties in Armidale. Dean Lynch was one of the original \"Men of '38\". In Maitland and in Armidale, \"the Dean\" collaborated with The Patriarch of Armidale, \"Joseph Daly\" and his wife Mary. The couple were married in Ireland prior to migrating to New South Wales. In Armidale they were initially based as overseer at Tilbuster station & they raised an Armidale-based family. The Daly family donated the land the cathedral is presently built upon. Mary Daly died in the same year the foundation stone was laid, namely 1870. Their last resting place is in the Old Catholic cemetery at Armidale about 50 meters south of Lynches Rd Armidale, named after their good friend Dean Lynch. Dean Lynch, Monsignor Lynch by then, later worked from St Bedes Parish Church Pyrmont and a chapter was dedicated to \"The Dean\" in the 2017 publication for the sesquicentenary of that historic Pyrmont parish. As a passing note, the sandstone pointed arches at the entrance and the internal sandstone pillars of the cathedral are known as Pyrmont Sandstone. The last resting places of all of the \"Men of '38\" are side by side at Rookwood Cemetery Sydney. This continues a long established Sydney – Armidale interdependent link between the first convict built great northern road to Maitland, the later steamship access via Taree and Grafton and the later Great Northern Railway line. The Armidale Diocese is described as a suffragan diocese of the Sydney Archdiocese.\n\nParagraph 4: In 1890, the house and a limited area of land, but not the larger part of the surrounding farmland, was acquired by the antiquarian Alfred de Lafontaine. In the preceding three hundred years, with the split and often absent ownership, the house had been used as a farmhouse and was in partial disrepair, with farm buildings close to it. However, this meant that it had not seen the modernisation applied to many other country houses in the eighteenth and nineteenth century, and it thus retained many original Tudor characteristics including an almost unaltered facade (though the gatehouse was near collapse and had been demolished by the Woods). Lafontaine was an early member of the Society for Protection of Ancient Buildings and an acquaintance of Thomas Hardy, a frequent visitor to the house who following his early career as an architect had become a passionate advocate of sympathetic restoration of older buildings. Lafontaine followed this approach, cleaning and repairing rather than altering, and where he installed modern amenities he did so sensitively, with trench heating under elegant iron grilles in the historic rooms. Hardy's association with the house had begun as a teenager when his father was a stonemason who worked on the house. , at which time he painted a watercolour of the south front including the gatehouse. His description of Bathsheba's farmhouse in Far From the Madding Crowd fits Athelhampton closely (though he was also clearly inspired by nearby Waterston house); he set the poem \"The Dame of Athelhall\" at the house, and his \"The Children and Sir Nameless\" refers to the Martyn tombs in the Athelhampton Aisle at St Mary's in neighbouring Puddletown.\n\nParagraph 5: Joshua Andre designated the album a four and a half star rating at 365 Days of Inspiring Media, calling Starlight \"a brilliant album for a well-respected church and group!\" At CCM Magazine, Matt Conner rated the album four-point-five stars out of five, he cautions that \"the entire album warrants repeated listens.\" Rating the album four and a half stars in a review at The Christian Beat, Madeleine Dittmer believes that \"Starlight conveys a message of hope that God is near in our joy and in our darkness. The songs provide a way for listeners to worship in all seasons of life by proclaiming truth and providing words for moments when they may be hard to find. Bethel Music has yet again released a powerful collection that will have a lasting impact on listeners.\" Bestowing the album a perfect five stars in a ChurchMag review, Phil Schneider says \"One thing I've learned is that there are two main camps of worship music: the anthemic and the contemplative. However, Bethel Music is forcing me to unlearn this with their new album Starlight, which boasts contemplative melodies and anthemic lyrics. The combination of this pairing produces a worship experience that brings peace to the soul while fueling the dissatisfaction that points the soul to the eternal, Almighty God, who created, sustains, and passionately pursues us.\" Timothy Yap of Hallels gave Starlight a four star rating in his review, concluding that \"On the whole, \"Starlight\" does glow with some very powerful worship moments, though not all the \"stars\" shine with the same intensity. Nevertheless, this is an important album.  It doesn't take a prophet to predict that just as ubiquitous as the stars are, these songs are going to find their places in tomorrow's worship of the church.\" Jesus Freak Hideout's Josh Balogh says in his four star review: \"Musically, the use of strings and synthesizer-flourishes really stand out, and created a paradox of intimacy and vastness in the majority of the songs. Lyrically, there was a deep focus on the name and worthiness of Jesus, which is right where the focus should be. All told, we have a more-than-worthy addition to the Bethel Music canon and a few new songs with which to praise our very Holy God.\" Awarding the album four and a half stars from NewReleaseToday, Kevin Davis states, \"Starlight is best described as a stellar worship offering with an empowering theme of the Lord's Kingship reigning in our hearts in song after song.\" Laura Chambers, indicating in a four-and-two-fifths star review at Today's Christian Entertainment, says \"Starlight's thoughtful lyrics will inspire gratitude long after the music ends. Bethel Music's stirring melodies draw listeners into the marvelous strength of God and invite them to consider Him as both powerful and personal, loyal and loving.\"\n\nParagraph 6: Cumbey offered the first major criticism of the New Age movement from a Christian perspective in The Hidden Dangers of the Rainbow: The New Age Movement and Our Coming Age of Barbarism (1983), but quickly lost academic credibility due to her promotion of conspiracy theories linking the New Age movement to Benjamin Creme, theosophy and Nazism. Scholar of New Age religion James R. Lewis describes this book as containing \"a few few insightful criticisms with many accusations of the least responsible sort\", and that she is \"simply lumping together anything that departs from a rather strict interpretation of Christianity.\" Cumbey's accusations include that the New Age movement has \"infiltrated all of Christianity, as well as Judaism\", and that it is the motivating force behind ecumenism, holistic health centers, New Thought, humanistic psychology, Montessori schools, modernism, secular humanism, and zero population growth. She states that Unitarian churches and health food stores become \"New Age recruiting centers\", that the Guardian Angels become one of the New Age movement's paramilitary organizations and that \"the New Age Movement has complete identity with the programs of Hitler\". Her contention is that the New Age movement is not simply expressing a naive or unscriptural interest in metaphysics, but that it is an organized conspiracy to overthrow the United States and replace it with a Nazi-like regime.\n\nParagraph 7: Garric, Liane, and Tenoctris stay in Valles to deal with the problem of the bridge. Garric also faces possible rebellion from several lords and bickering among others. Hoping to kill two birds with one stone, Garric assigns Lord Tadai to be ambassador to Sandrakkan. Garric has several dreams about Klestis, a city destroyed at the same time Yole was, and the wizard, Ansalem. Ansalem possessed many objects of power, including a mummy of a reptilian creature, a foot-wide fossilized ammonite, and a powerful amphisbaena. King Carus reveals that he once sought Ansalem’s help in unifying the isles, but Ansalem refused. Ansalem had seven acolytes (the most dangerous of which was Purlio) who used the ammonite to imprison him while he was weak after rescuing Klestis from the destruction of Yole. Anselm reveals that he has nothing to do with the bridge, but if he can get his amphisbaena back, he can repair it. Tenoctris determines that she needs to visit a wizard named Alman and borrow his viewing crystal. Katchin the Miller, who raised Cashel, appears begging Garric for a job, but Garric turns him away (and he is later captured by Colva). Tenoctris takes them to the end of time. They find Alman in a ruined city and he discovers that his viewing crystal has been stolen from him. The group returns to their own time, leaving Alman in his solitude. After spending a few days tending to matters of state in Valles, Garric receives news that his uncle has helped someone to kidnap Tenoctris. Garric and some of the Blood Eagles cross through a portal to ancient Klestris, to retrieve her but are thwarted. Before returning to Valles, they rescue a woman who claims that she is Colva, wife of Landure, the Guardian, and warns them that seven necromancers intend to do battle with them. She opines that they have kidnapped Tenoctris in order to sacrifice her and increase their own magical powers. At midnight they cross the bridge which showed up at the beginning of the story, to attack the seven necromancers on Klestis. They are confronted with an army of undead under the control of three necromancers, whom they slay. They find Tenoctris unconscious in Ansalem's chambers. Purlio and another of the acolytes are casting spells on her. Purlio takes the fossil ammonite and merges it with himself, replacing his head with it. Armies of undead begin entering Klestis, coming across bridges similar to the one that first set these events in motion.\n\nParagraph 8: The Main Track starts (from south to north) at the boardwalk beginning at the northern end of the bridge over Fairy Creek, part of Squire's Way and following a route hugging the northwest side of the lagoon for a hundred metres or so. At this section there are several wooden seats and fishing is a not uncommon practice from the boardwalk. From the boardwalk one can see the southern part of the reserve, the lagoon entrance and North Wollongong. From here it crosses the creek at a wooden bridge and turns into a track on the other side. In high tide and flood conditions this small portion may flood. From here it goes left (north), following the east side of the creek through she-oak woodland and other common coastal plants before going towards the coast through coastal banksia and acacia growth. Then it returns to the creek until it reaches the split to two paths heading to Fairy Meadow Beach picnic area. The left hand one goes along the creek and to a bridge that reaches a small island with a picnic area in the creek, the second up a five or so metre high hill and along through coastal bush. Benches for bird watching and enjoying nature may be found along the path at several intervals. The right hand track to the picnic ground has excellent 360 degree views of the plain, sea and the escarpment.\n\nParagraph 9: Hesleden is believed to be derived from the local word Dene(den) meaning a deep forested Valley, and Hesle a corruption of Hazel, so the original meaning may have been, \"Forested Valley of the Hazel trees\", which are common in the, Nesbit, Crimdon and Hesleden Denes, that border the village.  As for the \"Monk\", that may either refer to the Church which, once existed, or perhaps some earlier monastic foundation. Or that more likely, the lands around it may have once belonged to the Bishopric of Durham. This had been a common feature, throughout the Palatine of Durham, before the Reformation. The Prince Bishops, later Bishops, had an Archdeaconry in nearby Easington, and it is recorded that a great deal of land in the area lay under their ownership.\n\nParagraph 10: James Baker swore under oath that he had received the briefing book from William Casey, Reagan's campaign manager, but Casey, then campaign manager, later CIA director, vehemently denied this. David Stockman, the head of the Office of Management and Budget, admitted using the Carter material while helping Reagan prepare for the debate.  Stockman said the documents obtained were just position papers, not in question-and-answer format. Frank Hodsoll, also a member of the debate team, said that they were in Q&A form. The investigation turned up hundreds of pages of documents from the Carter campaign in Stockman's files as well as in Reagan's campaign archives at Stanford University's Hoover Institute. One document, an itinerary for Carter during the week prior to Election Day, had \"report from White House mole\" written on it.  This seemed to confirm author Laurence Barrett's conclusion in his book that the material had been stolen.  But U.S. News & World Report indicated that the document in question had been volunteered by someone working for Carter. Other papers were turned in to The Washington Post by a collector of political memorabilia who, in October 1980, had exhumed them from a dumpster behind Reagan headquarters in Arlington, Virginia. The press speculated that the Reagan campaign had been concerned that Carter would pull an October surprise during the campaign—cutting a deal with the Ayatollah Khomeini for the release of the 52 hostages held for over a year by Iran, a bombshell that some believed might have sent Carter back to the White House for four more years. Newsweek wondered whether a clandestine operation involving ex-CIA agents had been undertaken by the Reagan team to keep close tabs on the Carter campaign. This was supported by Time in its July 25, 1983, issue. According to that report, William Casey brought in former agents of both the CIA and the FBI to gather information from colleagues who were still with that agency. Jimmy Carter complained that the pilfered documents revealed the \"essence\" of his campaign, implying that his reelection bid had been done great harm when they fell into Republican hands.\n\nParagraph 11: Huang Chien-Liang has been teaching and promoting Tien Shan Pai consistently for the past thirty five years.  He currently resides in Maryland, and still teaches at his school in Owings Mills, Maryland: The US Kuoshu Academy. Additionally, Huang teaches seminars around the world on Tien Shan Pai and other martial arts styles, and has produced instructional videos on martial arts subjects. Huang is the founder and current President of the Tien Shan Pai Association.  The Tien Shan Pai Association \"sponsors seminars, produces instructional materials, and publishes a newsletter containing articles and information about the Tien Shan Pai style...\" with the intention of making \"information about the Tien Shan Pai style more accessible to the public.\"  The Association organizes demonstrations benefiting various charities, and supports and organizes martial arts tournaments.  Individual and school memberships are offered in the Tien Shan Pai Association. Huang Chien-Liang has displayed images of a sword crafted by Wang and given to Huang by Wang, where an inscription by Wang on the scabbard states that Huang is a 64th Generation disciple.  Additionally, these inscriptions affirm Wang's position as 63rd Generation Grandmaster.  Although there are classmates who started training under Wang prior to Huang, Huang claims that he is the only full heir to Wang's Tien Shan Pai style.  As evidence of his full, formal discipleship, Huang has said that none of his classmates learned as much of the actual Tien Shan Pai curriculum as he did, that only Huang received the initiatory Taoist disciple name from Wang Chueh-Jen, and that Huang has produced written materials from Wang documenting that the lineage was being passed on through him. Huang has asserted that Tien Shan Pai is its own style in Chinese martial arts, distinct from other styles included in Wang's curriculum.  In support of Huang's assertions, he has made available private correspondence from Master Wang where Wang reiterated that Tien Shan Pai is an ancient style.  In these letters, Wang also recognized Huang's tremendous contributions to Tien Shan Pai but expressed regrets about the lack of cooperation and personal attacks perpetuated by Huang's classmates in the U.S.\n\nParagraph 12: The aim of the majority of soil erosion models is to predict average rates (often an annual average rate) of soil loss from an area such as a plot, a field or a catchment/watershed under various land management techniques. Some erosion models are purely statistical, others more mechanistic (or physically based). Two of the more widely used soil erosion models in North America are the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) and the Water Erosion Prediction Project erosion model (WEPP). Much of the mineland erosion literature is solely focused on fitting or improving RUSLE parameters. Few soil erosion models consider gully erosion, mostly due to difficulties in modelling these large erosional features.", "answers": ["Paragraph 6"], "length": 3861, "dataset": "passage_retrieval_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "f7283c7ed455b72043cc6e010a544b9ad03d11bd317966a6"}
{"input": "In this text, a couple and their daughter encounter a disturbed farmer named Lamont who tells them about strange happenings in the valley since a meteor landed. Lamont explains that he is unable to leave his property because the plants and rocks have become possessed. The couple spends the night at Lamont's house, experiencing terrifying encounters with tumbleweeds and frogs. They discover Lamont's diary, which reveals his awareness of an alien presence. When they try to return to their car, they are attacked by living rocks, and Lamont is seemingly killed. Back at the farmhouse, Lamont returns in a trance-like state, possessed by the unknown entity. The husband decides that the only way to escape is to try to communicate with the possessor. Through self-hypnosis, he makes contact and briefly becomes possessed by the alien mind, which expresses frustration at its unsuccessful attempts to communicate with humans. The alien eventually departs, and everything returns to normal. The couple is able to leave and on their way home, the husband reflects on the vast distance between humans and the alien intelligence.", "context": "Paragraph 1: The Normal School Act of 1857 was passed on the last day of session on May 20, 1857. Its passage created 12 normal school districts in the state in which to establish private corporations answerable to the State Superintendent of Common Schools. Afterward, the School Code of 1911 mandated that the Commonwealth purchase all the normal schools. The normal schools evolved from state normal schools, to state teacher's colleges, to state colleges. Act 188, which was signed into law on November 12, 1982, and came into effect on July 1, 1983, established the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education, and converted those state colleges into universities.\n\nParagraph 2: Latin American women have been a force of innovation in poetry in Spanish since the sonnets and romances by Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz in the 17th century.  Sor Juana's poems spanned a range of forms and themes of the Spanish Golden Age, and her writings display inventiveness, wit, and a vast range of secular and theological knowledge. The first Latin American poet to receive the Nobel Prize in Literature is Gabriela Mistral. Mistral's lyrics used a regular meter and rhyme to describe impassioned female subjects, such as the abandoned, the jealous lover, the mother in fear for her vulnerable child, and the teacher who lifts her students with a love for knowledge and compassion. Though revered by Octavio Paz and Roberto Bolano, Alejandra Pizarnik's prose poetry is not well known outside of her native Argentina. With themes of solitude, childhood, madness, and death, Pizarnik explored the borders between speech and silence. She was heavily influenced by French modernism and drawn to \"the suffering of Baudelaire, the suicide of Nerval, the premature silence of Rimbaud, the mysteries of Lautréamont,” and “unparalleled intensity” of Artaud's suffering.\" Delmira Agustini's poems focused on themes of female sexuality, love and fantasy, often featuring characters from Greek antiquity including Eros, the Greek God of love. Her work entitled Empty Chalices (1913) solidifies her a place in La Vanguardia, alongside Norah Lange (The Street in the Evening).  Julia de Burgos's poetry weaved romance and political activism for women and African/Afro-Caribbean writers, and is considered a precursor to contemporary U.S. Latina/o and Latinx literature.  Giannina Braschi is one of the rare female poets in Latin America to write epic poetry; her cross-genre epics tackle geopolitical subjects such as debt crisis, national building, decolonization, and revolution. In the genre of children's poetry, Afro-Cuban poet Excilia Saldaña's works such as \"Noche\" (Night) relies of female figures of the grandmother to transmit wisdom to children; her experimental writing contained elements of Afro-Latino mythology and folklore. Saldaña also wrote of domestic violence, motherhood, feeling anonymous, and the power of female friendships.\n\nParagraph 3: At this point they are saved by a severely disturbed (possibly schizophrenic) farmer named Lamont, who explains that things have been awkward in the valley ever since a \"meteor\" landed two weeks before, causing his farm to be destroyed.  Lamont tells them he stayed merely out of curiosity, but now the possessed weeds, trees and rocks won't allow him to leave either. The three make their way to Lamont's house where they spend a frightening night surrounded by tumbleweeds first, and then thousands of frogs. The wife discovers Lamont's diary containing eloquent and intelligent passages regarding his awareness of an apparent alien presence.  In the morning, they walk back to the car without trouble, only to be attacked by living rocks once they get there. One rock apparently kills Lamont. The couple run back to the farmhouse, where Lamont eventually returns and sits down in a chair, remaining motionless, speechless and in a trance-like state, with the couple trying to rouse him, and then realizing that he has been possessed by an unknown entity. The husband then decides that the only way they are ever to escape is to attempt to communicate with whatever is behind the possessions. The husband manages to make contact through self-hypnosis, and is briefly possessed by what appears to be a non-corporeal alien mind that came to Earth out of mere curiosity, but failed to establish communication. The extraterrestrial presence bemoans its vain attempt at communicating with humans and eventually departs after transmitting the idea that mankind perhaps needs more time to evolve in order to communicate with it. After its departure, everything returns to normal, allowing the couple to return to their car. On their way home, the husband compassionately philosophises that, while both of them are only a few miles away from their home, the alien intelligence must be far further from its own.\n\nParagraph 4: Damage to the area postrema, caused primarily by lesioning or ablation, prevents the normal functions of the area postrema from taking place. This ablation is usually done surgically and for the purpose of discovering the exact effect of the area postrema on the rest of the body. Since the area postrema acts as an entry point to the brain for information from the sensory neurons of the stomach, intestines, liver, kidneys, heart, and other internal organs, a variety of physiological reflexes rely on the area postrema to transfer information. The area postrema acts to directly monitor the chemical status of the organism. Lesions of the area postrema are sometimes referred to as 'central vagotomy' because they eliminate the brain’s ability to monitor the physiological status of the body through its vagus nerve. These lesions thus serve to prevent the detection of poisons and consequently prevent the body’s natural defenses from kicking in. In one example, experiments done by Bernstein et al. on rats indicated that the area postrema lesions prevented the detection of lithium chloride, which can become toxic at high concentrations. Since the rats could not detect the chemical, they were not able to employ a psychological procedure known as taste aversion conditioning, causing the rat to continuously ingest the lithium-paired saccharin solution. These findings indicate that rats with area postrema lesions do not acquire the normal conditioned taste aversions when lithium chloride is used as the unconditioned stimulus. In addition to simple taste aversions, rats with the area postrema lesions failed to perform other behavioral and physiological responses associated with the introduction of the toxin and present in the control group, such as lying down on their bellies, delayed stomach emptying, and hypothermia. Such experimentation emphasizes the significance of the area postrema not only in the identification of toxic substances in the body but also in the many physical responses to the toxin.\n\nParagraph 5: He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1892. The citation on his candidacy form read: \"District Surveyor of the Geological Survey of Scotland. Past President of the Physical Society of Edinburgh. Recipient of the Wollaston Donation Fund of the Geological Society in 1887. For thirty years actively engaged on the Geological survey, during which time he has mapped many of the most complicated districts of Scotland. Has charge of the surveying of the NW Highlands, and has taken the leading part in unravelling the remarkable structural complications of that region.

It produces, to some degree, almost all the crops grown in the Yemeni highlands. Dhamar town itself is notable as the only town in the former Yemen Arab Republic not to be walled: rather it is merely a town on open plains. The governorate is an important seat for the Zaydi branch of Shia Islam, which has long had a major influence in Yemen. The ancient kingdoms of Saba', Qataban and Himyar had their capitals within the present area of Dhamar, and the Himyarite kingdom with its capital at Yarim set up numerous terraces that allow for highly intensive agriculture throughout the region. Archeological studies attest to agricultural activity in Dhamar governorate starting some 7,000 years ago, through analysis of soil deposits at the Adra'ah dam east of Dhamar city. Dhamar's inhabitants have farmed and herded animals since that time. Taking advantage of the governorate's topographic diversity – plains, high plateaus, mountain slope valleys – farmers have introduced a diversity of crops, and agriculture became the governorate's principal economic activity. The governorate contains about  of arable land, of which  is currently devoted to cash crops such as corn, wheat and horticultural crops. The governorate also holds about  devoted to growing vegetables and fruits that are marketed to other governorates of Yemen and to neighboring countries. The governorate is also well-known for its coffee; its western districts such as Anis, Maghrab 'Ans and 'Utamah have a suitable climate for commercial coffee production. The coffee of Dhamar is distinguished by its high quality, and the variety known as Al-Faḍlī () is considered one of the best Yemeni coffees. Sheep herding, goat herding, and Arabian horse breeding are also important economic activities.\n\nParagraph 7: His lectures on natural law, in which he developed with great acuteness and skill the formal principles of the Kantian theory of legislation, attracted a large audience, and contributed to raise to its height the fame of the University of Jena, then unusually rich in able teachers. In 1803, after the departure of many of his colleagues from Jena, Hufeland accepted a call to Würzburg, from which, after but a brief tenure of a professorial chair, he proceeded to Landshut. From 1806 to 1812 he acted as burgomaster in his native town of Danzig. Returning to Landshut, he lived there until 1816, when he was invited to the University of Halle.\n\nParagraph 8: The first theme is a descending scale marked sotto voce; full of ominous undertow. It reappears at crucial points in the work's structure. This leads immediately to a jagged, forceful motif in octaves. This is quickly followed by a hammering marcato motif in the left hand. A dialogue ensues, with mounting energy, until reaching the noble Grandioso material in D major. Liszt transforms the \"marcato\" motif into a lyrical melody later. The slow movement, an Andante sostenuto, is the centerpiece of the Sonata. This fully-fledged movement, in compound ternary form, features, in quick succession, a number of themes heard earlier in the Sonata in a tour de force of thematic economy. The final recapitulatory section is launched by a driving fugato of contrapuntal skill which leads to the compressed return of the opening material. Calling upon every intellectual resource and fully exploiting the pianist's technical arsenal, it is at this point where a performer's concentration might wane. Each of the sections are examples of Classical forms, which means that this piece is one of the first instances of Double-function form, a musical piece which has two classical forms happening at the same time; one containing others. Already in 1851 Liszt experimented with a non-programmatic \"four-movements-in-one\" form in an extended work for piano solo called Grosses Concert-Solo. This piece, which in 1865 was published as a two-piano version under the title Concerto pathétique, shows a thematic relationship to both the Sonata and the later Faust Symphony.\n\nParagraph 9: It was established in 1499 in the Bitlis region by Huseyin Ali Bey, a Kurdish Pazooka tribe. The Pazooka Emirate was governed by Xalid Bey and was an ally to the Safavid Ismail I. As Xalid Bey lost a hand in the war, he was called “the only Xalid”. Due to his heroism in the wars, a hand made from gold was made by Ismail I. Xalid Bey, who had a sermon and coined  money on his behalf in the Pazuki region (today Nakhichevan), had to present his loyalty to the Ottomans after a he separated his ways with his Safavid dynasty. Although he supported the Ottoman Sultan Selim I against Shah Ismail I in the Battle of Chaldiran and fought against him, his killing upon order of the sultan after the war, turned the loyalty of the principality back to the Safavids. After Xalid Beys death, his was succeeded by his son Uveys Bey, pledged his loyalty to the opponents of the Ottomans, namely the Safavids, in order to take revenge. After the oath of loyalty, Erciş, Adilcevaz and Beyazid regions, who remained at the Ottoman border, were given the status of principality and asked to protect the border region. However, the attempt to take control of the Kurds in the region and efforts to expand the area of sovereignty disturbed the governor of Tabriz and thus the Safavid administration, so the Shah wanted to prevent the strengthening of the Kurds in the region by sending the governor of Tabriz Musa Sultan to the Pazuki Emirate. Uveys Bey, who realized that he could not fight against the army that came upon him, had to take refuge in the Ottoman Empire again. The fact that the Pazooka Beys constantly changed their ranks and brought the Kurds together, while ruling independently     created problems in the region and also worried the Ottoman Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent. So Kanuni sent news to Durzi Davud and asked the Pazooka Emirate to sword his men. Durzi Davud raided the orders and swept Pazooka Bey and his men. However, two children of Uveys Bey managed to get rid of this massacre and took refuge in Zırıkanlı Ahmed Bey. Kılıç Bey and Zülfikar Bey, who survived the massacre of Uveys Bey, grew up in the tribe and took refuge in Safavid ruler Tahmasp I. The Shah returned the old lands of the Pazooka principality, who took refuge in them. His son Kılıç Bey became the district's lord and his brother Zülfikar Bey replaced him when he died. However, the period of Zülfikar Bey was short. When he died, he was replaced by Kılıç Bey's son. When he was prevented from being a principal by his mother, Yadigar Bey, one of the tribal leaders, passed the principality. Yadigar Bey developed the Pazooka region in terms of zoning and enabled the people to live in peace and prosperity. The peace and prosperity developed in the region caused immigration. When he died, his son, Niyazi Bey, passed away. Niyazi Bey could not maintain the peaceful environment provided by his father, events occurred during his time, he was arrested by Shah Tahmasp and imprisoned in Alamut Castle when he abused his power possibilities. Second Kılıç Bey was appointed instead of Ziya Bey. With the death of Shah Tahmasp and the replacement of his son Sultan Muhammed, the Pazuki Principality came to an end and in 1587, the Safavids ended the existence of this principality.\n\nParagraph 10: In the early morning hours of 26 February, a force of approximately 400 men from the VC 275th Regiment, 5th Division, had infiltrated into the tiny village of Thai Hiep on the outskirts of Bien Hoa. About 85 per cent of the force was estimated to be PAVN soldiers. At about 03:00, as reconnaissance elements of the unit were observed and engaged by US Air Force security forces at the perimeter of Bien Hoa Air Base, the villagers began to flee their homes, running down streets and creek beds. The villagers met elements of the South Vietnamese 5th Marine Battalion, the 3rd Battalion, 48th Infantry Regiment, 18th Division and the 3rd Squadron, 5th Armored Cavalry moving on the road less than a half mile from Thai Hiep in response to the contact at the air base. The villagers told the ARVN forces how they were driven out of their homes and confined to an area near a creek running alongside the village. At that time, the air base security forces reported that they had lost contact with the enemy reconnaissance element which withdrew east toward Thai Hiep. The ARVN units swiftly moved into blocking positions, and by daybreak, the PAVN/VC were surrounded. Additional South Vietnamese Regional Force elements moved in and the ARVN troops continued to contain the PAVN/VC forces until 11:00 when assault forces, in the form of the ARVN 36th Ranger Battalion, reinforced the contact. By 15:00 the 36th Ranger Battalion moved into the village attacking the PAVN/VC force. The series of assaults met heavy resistance by the battalion of PAVN who had turned the villagers sandbagged shelters into a series of well-fortified defensive positions. ARVN psychological operations units broadcast repeated loud-speaker appeals and warnings, and all of the remaining villagers and several wounded PAVN/VC evacuated out of Thai Riep. Just after 16:00 US Air Force F-100s and F-4s along with Republic of Vietnam Air Force A-1 Skyraiders were directed against the PAVN/VC positions in the village. Following the employment of the supporting fires, the 36th Ranger Battalion moved back into the village. The Rangers met only slight, disorganized resistance. By 01:00 the next morning, the bodies of 264 PAVN/VC soldiers lay in the village, and 87 had been captured or surrendered. More than 100 individual and crew-served weapons were captured. ARVN casualties were 10 killed and 100 wounded and one US Army photographer was killed. The prisoners revealed that their mission had been to attack Bien Hoa city and the Bien Hoa Air Base.\n\nParagraph 11: The sales success was influential to the introduction of the Pontiac Grand Prix in 1962, as a custom trim package coupe using the Catalina platform, while the Star Chief became the entry-level trim package of the Bonneville. The listed retail price for the Sports Coupe was $2,971 ($ in  dollars ) before an extensive list of optional equipment, that included several choices of radios, including the \"Sportable\" battery operated dashboard removable portable unit, electric extendable radio antenna, air conditioning, \"E-Z-Eye\" tinted glass, bucket seats, \"Safeguard\" speedometer, \"Magi-Cruise\" cruise control, windshield washer, underhood utility light, remote adjustable driver-side side view mirror, power windows, power steering, power brakes, and two choices of heater and windshield defroster selections.\n\nParagraph 12: The local trade union, the Rhondda Steam Coal Miners' Association, laid claim to the candidacy as early as 1883, on the basis that the franchise had been extended to many working men within the county constituencies and that in Mabon, their agent for six years they had the ideal candidate. The local Liberal Association, however, formed in early 1885,was dominated by middle-class business and professional men, and included a disproportionate number of colliery officials. . Lewis Davis of Ferndale, brother of David Davis, Maesyffynnon, one of the leading coalowners in the valley, was selected as president of the association. Ministers, including William Morris of Noddfa, Treorchy were also prominent. At a meeting in April 1885 six names were put forward as possible candidates for the nomination, including Lewis Davis, Mabon and Alfred Thomas, a leading figure in the municipal life of Cardiff. Shortly afterwards, Lewis Davis was invited by the Association to be its parliamentary candidate and defeated Mabon in a ballot by 143 votes to 51. In spite of his selection, however, he declined and proposed that his son, the 22-year-old Frederick Lewis Davis, be the candidate. In a further ballot, F.L. Davis again defeated Mabon by 125 votes to 56.\n\nParagraph 13: Often cited is the 2007 report to the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation which defined OER as \"teaching, learning, and research resources that reside in the public domain or have been released under an intellectual property license that permits their free use or re-purposing by others. Open educational resources include full courses, course materials, modules, textbooks, streaming videos, tests, software, and any other tools, materials, or techniques used to support access to knowledge.\" The Foundation later updated its definition to describe OER as \"teaching, learning and research materials in any medium digital or otherwise that reside in the public domain or have been released under an open license that permits no-cost access, use, adaptation and redistribution by others with no or limited restrictions.\" Of note in that definition is the explicit statement that OER can include both digital and non-digital resources, as well as the inclusion of several types of use that OER permit, inspired by 5R activities of OER. In a 2022 overview of the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation's activities supporting open education since 2002, the Foundation describes OER as \"freely licensed, remixable learning resources\", further including the Creative Commons definition of OER as \"teaching, learning, and research materials that are either (a) in the public domain or (b) licensed in a manner that provides everyone with free and perpetual permission to engage in the 5R activities retaining, remixing, revising, reusing and redistributing the resources.\"", "answers": ["Paragraph 3"], "length": 3797, "dataset": "passage_retrieval_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "92e2b4456d9d03b10b4cdc1d676ac1a811dcccc6210d5503"}
{"input": "Sucker Punch Productions was founded in 1997 by a group of former Microsoft employees who were dissatisfied with their careers and wanted to start a video game company. The name \"Sucker Punch\" was chosen despite initial objections from one of the team members' wives, as it was believed to appeal to the target audience of young men. The team initially planned to develop a game for Nintendo 64, but later abandoned this idea. Two of the founders left the company in 1998.", "context": "Paragraph 1: Sucker Punch Productions was founded in October 1997 by Brian Fleming, Chris Zimmerman, Bruce Oberg, Darrell Plank, Tom Saxton, and Cathy Saxton, who first met while they worked at Microsoft. Zimmerman was \"disenchanted\" with his career in Microsoft and wanted to do something different. He approached co-workers Fleming and Oberg and shared his idea about starting a video game company. The brand name was created from one of several names the team had unsuccessfully proposed as project codenames at Microsoft. Zimmerman shared the name options with his wife to get her opinion, and she advised the team not to use Sucker Punch as the studio's name. The team went against her advice since the target audience for video games at that time was mostly young men, a group which the name Sucker Punch would resonate with. After the establishment of the studio, the team began working on their first game. Seeing the release of games like Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee on PlayStation, the team felt they lacked the necessary skills and experience to compete with them. Instead, the team decided to develop their new game for Nintendo 64, codenamed Puzzle Factory. This first game was inspired by a computer game named The Incredible Machine and was to feature 3D visuals, but the plan was scrapped. Two of the founders, Tom and Cathy Saxton, left Sucker Punch Productions in 1998.\n\nParagraph 2: After Efuru’s first publication, it received mixed reviews. For instance, Kenyan author Grace Ogot spoke positively of the novel in a review which appeared in the East Africa Journal in 1966, stating that “of the many novels that are coming out of Nigeria, Efuru is one of the few that portrays vividly the woman's world, giving only peripheral treatment to the affairs of men.” Nwapa's male counterparts, however, were not as fond of the book. Literary critic Eldred Jones and author Eustace Palmer both represent the opinion of some Nigerian male writers at the time, most of whom criticize Nwapa for focusing on the affairs of women. Later critics of Efuru, however, commend Nwapa for creating an image of female protagonists unlike that created by Nigerian male writers. Author Rose Acholonu describes Nwapa and certain other African female writers as \"pathfinders\", who were able to \"break the seals of silence and invisibility on the female protagonist by the early traditionalist male writers.\" Christine N. Ohale, a professor at the department of English, Communications, Media Arts and Theater in Chicago State University, mentions that Nwapa's \"efforts to present brand-new, assertive and individualistic females have helped to salvage the lop-sided image that male writers have created\", which is mainly one of passiveness.\n\nParagraph 3: Major Israel McCreight of Du Bois, Pennsylvania, was author and steward of Cook Forest State Park, the first Pennsylvania State Park acquired to preserve a natural landmark, and a founder of the Pennsylvania Conservation Association. Cook Forest is the most important tract of virgin timberland to be found in Pennsylvania, and is without rival for size East of the Rockies.  Once called the \"Black Forest\", the area is famous for its towering white pines and hemlocks. The idea to make Cook Forest a public park originated on McCreight's first visit to the \"Forest Cathedral\" near the Clarion River in northwest central Pennsylvania.  \"It was a beautiful day, August 21, 1910, that the writer with a few others were invited to a weekend house party at the A.W. Cook home. Cook would comment, as he led the way into the silent ‘temple of the gods’, and then listen to the exclamations of astonishment that were sure to come from those who followed along the fern-bound path in this fairyland. Often there was heard no comment, for in this silent cathedral of the Almighty, it was unuttered.  Frequently it was observed that sturdy men could not restrain their tears, at the solemnity of their environment.  It was during this walk that A.W. Cook and the writer sat down on a log to talk about the future fate of the magnificent panorama they saw and felt all about them, The writer said to him: ‘Cook, no greater crime could be committed than to destroy this; it shall not be destroyed; it must be saved for humanity’s sake.\" McCreight was determined to save the forest and began a campaign to conserve the natural landmark. In 1910, McCreight and others formed the Pennsylvania Conservation Association and successfully lobbied the legislature to consider Cook Forest for state park purposes. For sixteen years a series of unsuccessful legislative bills were introduced for the state to acquire Cook Forest. In 1923, the Cook Forest Association was formed for the purpose of acquiring the Cook Forest tract of virgin white pine and hemlock. Early pioneers with the Cook Forest Association were Major Israel McCreight, Theo Wilson and John Nicholson. The Association, endorsed by national natural resource groups and Governor Gifford Pinchot, raised $200,000. \n\nParagraph 4: Based on the 1905 short story \"The Gift of the Magi\" by O. Henry. Mickey wants to get Minnie a gold chain for her one heirloom, her watch, so he works at Crazy Pete's Tree Lot. Minnie wants to give Mickey something special for Christmas as well, so she works hard at her job in a department store to get a bonus to buy a present with. When Mickey offers a small tree to a poor family who cannot afford to buy a special 10-footer tree, his greedy supervisor Pete steals Mickey's money and dismisses him. Pete inadvertently puts his lit cigar into his pocket with Mickey's money without noticing, which triggers a sequence that ends up setting himself, the money and his trees – including the 10-footers – on fire, much to Pete's dismay. Meanwhile, Minnie's bonus from her stingy boss Mortimer Mouse proves to be nothing but a fruit cake. After playing music for a toy drive with the Firehouse Five, Mickey has the idea that he can trade his harmonica for the gold chain. The shop is closing when he gets there and the owner who is just leaving isn't interested in the harmonica, but changes his mind after hearing Mickey play it. Back at Minnie's house, Mickey gives her the chain for her watch, which she no longer has and Minnie gives him a case for his harmonica, which he also no longer has. However, Mickey and Minnie get emotional seeing how far they went to profess their love and they are still able to celebrate a happy Christmas. As in The Gift of the Magi original story, the thought behind each gift is what counts.\n\nParagraph 5: Moscow Aviation Institute (National Research University) was established on 20 March 1930 as Higher Aero-mechanical college (VAMU) by the order of Supreme Soviet of the National Economy in order to ensure training of qualified personnel for the aviation industry. The Aero-mechanical faculty of Bauman Moscow State Technical University formed the basis of the new university. On 29 August 1930, the university was renamed as Moscow Aviation Institute. In the beginning it had 3 departments, Aeronautical, Aircraft engines and Aerodynamics. On its tenth anniversary in 1940, the university had established itself as a premier aeronautical university with 38 departments, 22 laboratories and a Student design office and production facility.\n\nParagraph 6: In 1929 he began employment at Yale University, where he would serve as a Sterling Professor until his death. In addition to his other teachings, he was able to teach a psychological test and measurement course. Because he loved the mathematical portion of the course, he changed the class to aptitude testing, which focused on scientific basis of vocational guidance. On the side, Hull also conducted research to build a machine that could perform all the correlational work for him automatically. After teaching the aptitude testing class, Hull went on to teaching an introductory class for premedical students. While teaching this class he particularly took notice of suggestion and hypnosis. This was the starting point of his experimental testing in this field in which Hull focused on the quantitative methodology in experimental psychology. After ten years of in-depth research, he wrote the book Hypnosis and Suggestibility in 1933. After writing the book, he decided to continue in experimental field by teaching this course in addition to the premedical course. Hull had a great desire to teach this course and felt as though this specific type of science was the foundation of true psychology. In 1929 he was called to the Institute of Psychology at Yale University as a research professor of psychology where he worked on the problems concerning systematic behavior theory. In 1930, he came to several conclusions about psychology: the first was that he believed that psychology is a true natural science. The second was that its primary laws are expressed quantitatively by moderate number equations and that all complex behavior or single individuals will be derived as second laws. The third was that the primary laws with the behavior (based on the condition) can also be derived as quantitative laws from the same primary equation. he and other psychologists (Neal E. Miller, John Dollard, and O.H Mower) looked into these ideas more, they sought to understand what underlined conditioned reflex and behavior while also seeking to understand Freud and others like him. This eventually led to his work that he is primarily known for, Principles of Behavior.\n\nParagraph 7: In 1992, Vampiro would be part of multiple hair vs hair matches. The first of which would be on March 21 defeating Bestia Negra II. Throughout the months Vampiro would beat Rick Patterson, Pirata Morgan, Aaron Grundy and Sangre Chicana in hair vs hair matches. In late 1992, Vampiro participated in the CMLL World Heavyweight Championship tournament and reached the semi-final before being defeated by Black Magic. In early 1993, Vampiro would team up with Pierroth Jr. to take part in the CMLL World Tag Team Championship tournament and progressed to the final where the two would take on Dr. Wagner Jr. and El Canek in a best two out of three falls match. Going into the last match between the two teams where drawing with one win each,  Dr. Wagner Jr. and El Canek would win the last match and therefore the vacant CMLL World Tag Team Championship. In the first round of the Gran Prix 1994 he lost to Yamato. In mid to late 1994, Vampiro would begin to team up with Pegasus Kid, along with El Rayo de Jalisco Jr, in the final of the Trios Tournament. The trio would lose to El Dandy, El Texano and Silver King. Vampiro and Pegasus Kid later fell to El Texano and Silver King in the quarterfinals of the CMLL World Tag Team Championship number one contendership tournament. Vampiro would go on to team up with Apolo Dantés and lost to Dr. Wagner Jr. & Pierroth Jr. in the semi-final of the CMLL World Tag Team Championship number two contendership tournament. In July 1995, Vampiro reached the final of the Gran Prix 1995 before being defeated by Headhunter A. In what was perhaps the biggest match of his career to this point, he took on Apolo Dantes in a best out of three falls match for the CMLL World Heavyweight Championship. In 1996, Vampiro would leave CMLL to join other top Mexican promotions such as International Wrestling Revolution Group (IWRG), Lucha Libre AAA World Wide (AAA) and Promo Azteca (AZTECAS). However, in 1998 he would return to CMLL and would take part in the CMLL World Trios Championship tournament and Gran Prix 1998, ultimately winning neither. His last match for CMLL for many years would take place on December 11, 1998.\n\nParagraph 8: When the Women's National Basketball Association started with eight expansion teams in 1997, Chancellor had applied for six of the teams with doubt that he would be hired. However, he was hired by the Comets (as owned by Leslie Alexander, part of the plan for certain teams to be operated by NBA owners), to coach the team, and he believed that the team would be special from the very get go due to the talents of Cynthia Cooper (who had led USA to a gold medal in the 1988 Olympics and silver in 1992 while playing in European leagues) in practice. Houston was bolstered by fellow player allocation Sheryl Swoopes (who had led Texas Tech to the 1993 NCAA title) and WNBA draft pick Tina Thompson to make a Big Three trio, all of whom would be inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. The 1997 season did not go without hitches, as Thompson and Cooper wanted less rigid patterns from Chancellor when it came to offensive sets, which they responded by setting ball screens on the perimeter; Swoopes did not play until the second half of the season due to her pregnancy. They won four of their first seven games before closing out the season on a 14-7 run to finish 18-10, the best record of the eight teams; in the four-team playoff, they won both games (including a 65-51 victory over the New York Liberty, who had beaten Houston three out of four times in the regular season) to win the inaugural WNBA championship. To build chemistry, he set up a three-player committee composed of a young player, a mid-level player, and an older player. Chancellor cited the help of NBA coach Rudy Tomjanovich in asserting the importance of training camp and the nature of motivating college players.\n\nParagraph 9: The episode opens in the \"red reality\" (where Hannah is alive and Rex is not from the car accident), and Michael Britten (Jason Isaacs) is jogging around Los Angeles. When Michael gets home, he talks to his wife Hannah (Laura Allen), who is in Oregon looking at a university. Later in the \"green reality\" (where Rex is alive and Hannah is not), Michael and Rex (Dylan Minnette) are stuck in traffic, and Michael is later called into work. His partner in the \"green reality\", Isaiah \"Bird\" Freeman (Steve Harris) talks to Michael, then Michael goes for a run at the Griffith Park. He goes to the top of a hill overlooking the city, while a dog appears from behind a bush and barks at him. Michael notices human flesh in him, and goes to investigate, where he finds a corpse sitting against a tree. Michael goes to the police station, and shows Captain Harper similar cases starting in 1999. In each case, a killer, nicknamed Gemini (Salvator Xuereb), vertically slashed the victim's wrists and carved a Roman numeral in their chests. The murders have taken place all across the United States, but everyone believes that Gemini is dead after an FBI agent Elizabeth Santoro (Megan Dodds) had shot him. Michael wants to cover the area as much as they can and Captain Tricia Harper (Laura Innes) agrees, telling Michael to pick up the profiler that the FBI has sent. Michael goes to Brentwood and meets with FBI agent Elizabeth Santoro. They discuss his history and she admits that she has been focused solely on the \"Gemini Killer\" for the last 12 years. Michael confirms that they did not find one on the body, so she figures that it is a copycat. Michael goes to the crime scene, while Bird is already there. The partners go over the hillside and find the dog. They take him to Dr. Banks (Chris McGarry) and have him check his stomach, where he finds a United States two-dollar bill in it. When Michael takes the evidence to Harper and Santoro, Santoro insists that it only means that someone with classified information to the case is involved. She suggests they check anyone who has recently laid off law enforcement officers with psych problems. Bird and Santoro create a database if the killer is alive. Santoro lets Harper decide and she tells the detectives to pull the files on law officers. As Santoro leaves, Michael approaches her and says that he understands the implications if the man she shot was Gemini. Meanwhile, the killer prepares a set of medical tools, a wad of two-dollar bills, and a syringe.\n\nParagraph 10: In first match for 2018 FIFA World Cup qualification, Serbia started off their campaign with a 2–2 draw against Ireland at the Rajko Mitic Stadium. Republic of Ireland take the lead in 3rd minute. The Eagles equalized by Filip Kostić's goal in 62nd minute and seven minutes later take the lead after Dušan Tadić successfully completed the penalty. Conceded goal in 80th minute has costed Serbia three points. One month later, Serbia made a first victory, over Moldova in Chișinău. Filip Kostić scored first goal on the match again, this time in 19th minute. Captain Branislav Ivanović scored in 37th minute. Dušan Tadić scored in 59th minute and with one goal and two assists helped Serbia to beat Moldova 3–0. Three days later, on 9 October 2016, Serbia defeated Austria (3–2) at Rajko Mitić Stadium and made very important victory. Brace from Aleksandar Mitrović in 6th and 23rd minute and Dušan Tadić's in 74th minute masterpiece helped Serbia to win the match. On 12 November 2016, Aleksandar Mitrović's goal in 86th minute, helped Serbia to take a point against Euro 2016 semi-finalists, Wales in Cardiff. On 24 March, in first match in 2017, Serbia defeat 3–1 Georgia in Tbilisi. Dušan Tadić scored the equalizer, from penalty spot in 44th minute. Aleksandar Mitrović with beautiful goal give Serbia lead in 64th minute. Mijat Gaćinović replaced Filip Kostić 81st minute, and scored a goal five minutes later in his first game for national team. On 11 June 2017, Aleksandar Mitrović scored the only goal for Eagles, against Wales (1–1) in the front of 47,000 fans at Rajko Mitić Stadium. On 2 September 2017, Serbia defeated Moldova 3–0 at Partizan Stadium. Mijat Gaćinović scored 20th minute and ten minutes later assisted for Aleksandar Kolarov's first goal in these qualifications. Aleksandar Mitrović scored the third goal for Serbia on this match and continued his amazing performance in these qualifications (six goals in last five qualification matches). Three days later, Serbia defeated Ireland in Dublin 1–0 and come on the step of 2018 FIFA World Cup. Aleksandar Kolarov scored a goal in 55th minute. Nikola Maksimović was sent off thirteen minutes later and Eagles played almost half an hour with a player less. Serbia needed a victory on one of two remaining matches. On 6 October, at Ernst-Happel-Stadion in Wien Serbia has lost 3–2. The Eagles take the lead in 11th minute, after Luka Milivojević's first goal for national team, but Austria reversed result in 76th minute, but Nemanja Matić has scored the equalizer seven minutes later. In 89th minute, Austrians scored the winning goal. Three days later at Rajko Mitić Stadium, Aleksandar Prijović's goal in 74th minute against Georgia sent Serbia to the 2018 FIFA World Cup. A couple days after match, coach Slavoljub Muslin was sacked. Mladen Krstajić succeeded Muslin as coach of the Serbia national team, initially as a caretaker. He led team on two matches in November. In first match, he made victory against China 2–0, but in second Serbia draw 1–1 with South Korea. In December, it was announced he would take on the role permanently and at least until the end of the 2018 FIFA World Cup. In March, Serbia played two matches against two strongest African teams. In first match, in Turin, Serbia lost 1–2 against Morocco. Dušan Tadić scored goal for Serbia, in his 50th match for national team. On 27 March, Serbia beat 2–0 Nigeria in London. Mitrović scored two goals for Serbia. In first week of June, Serbia played two matches in Graz against South American teams. In first match, Serbia lost 0–1 against Chile, but in second they demolished Bolivia with 5–1. Serbia scored four goals in first half. Mitrović scored first hat-trick in national team.\n\nParagraph 11: Upon Elmer Henry Maytag’s death in 1940, his sons Fred and Robert Maytag assumed leadership of the farms. It was Fred Maytag-President & CEO of the Maytag Appliance Company who pursued his idea of creating a uniquely American blue cheese made from cow's milk. Fred collaborated with Iowa State University dairy researchers to pioneer the first great American blue cheese that would compete with classic European cheeses such as Roquefort made from sheep's milk. The cheese plant and caves were completed a year later and the first wheels of Maytag Blue Cheese were formed in October 1941. The milk from Maytag's Iowa Holsteins resulted in a rich, creamy cheese that resembled the flavors of European bleu cheeses. Ever a visionary, Fred sold his cheese in a unique new way—by catalog—essentially creating the practice of mail-ordering food that thrives today.", "answers": ["Paragraph 1"], "length": 3541, "dataset": "passage_retrieval_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "16106ae2e02795fc384e6fb4725e099b89a3349ae5e26580"}
{"input": "The text explains that cyclopropanones, which are three-membered ring ketones, undergo hydration to a significant extent. This is because the strained structure of the three-membered ring favors sp3 hybridization over sp2 hybridization. The addition of a nucleophile to the carbonyl group in cyclopropanones helps release some of the strain in the small ring, making them highly reactive electrophiles. In larger rings, the stability of hemiacetals is due to entropy and the proximity of the nucleophile to the carbonyl group. The formation of cyclic hemiacetals is more favorable because it involves a single molecule reacting with itself, while acyclic acetals involve the consumption of two molecules. Cyclic hemiacetals also have a higher forward rate of reaction, making them more stable. Many biologically relevant sugars, including glucose, are examples of cyclic hemiacetals.", "context": "Paragraph 1: Where Have All the Merrymakers Gone? is the debut studio album by American rock band Harvey Danger. It was initially released by the independent record label the Arena Rock Recording Company on July 29, 1997. The second song on the album, \"Flagpole Sitta\", received extensive airplay in the United States and resulted in the band's fame. As the song gained national attention, the album was picked up and reissued by Slash Records, a label associated with London Records. On July 29, 2014, 17 years to the day after the album's initial release, Where Have All the Merrymakers Gone? was re-released, for the first time as a vinyl LP, by No Sleep Records. The album has been described by Fuse as \"a definitive indie power pop punk record at a time and place where grunge reigned supreme\".\n\nParagraph 2: Hugh of Arles was born in 880/1, the eldest surviving son of Count Theobald of Arles and Bertha of Lotharingia. By inheritance, he was count of Arles and Vienne, which made him one of the most important and influential nobles in the Kingdom of Provence. After Emperor Louis III was captured, blinded, and exiled from Italy in 905, Hugh became his chief adviser in Provence and regent. By 911, most of the royal prerogatives were exercised by Hugh and Louis ceded him the titles dux of Provence and marchio of the Viennois. He moved the capital to his family's chief seat of Arles and in 912 married Willa, widow of King Rudolph I of Burgundy. Hugh then unsuccessfully attempted to take Burgundy from Rudolph's son, Rudolph II.\n\nParagraph 3: The volcano is  high. It is a double volcano, with the north-northeasterly Chang Peak caldera and the south-southwesterly Mount Waesche proper. The Chang Peak caldera is  wide and the largest in Marie Byrd Land; Mount Waesche rises almost  over and lies on the rim of the caldera. Mount Waesche is the more conspicuous peak and lava flows crop out on its southern and southwestern flank, while a  wide caldera lies at its summit. On the northern side of Chang Peak caldera lies a  high outcrop, and it and another outcrop consist of pumice and vitrophyre. Both volcanoes appear to be mainly formed by lava. At least five parasitic vents lie on the volcano, with several aligned on radial fissure vents; they are cinder cones and scoria cones and have erupted cinder, lava and volcanic bombs. A  long large radial dyke projects from Mount Waesche and is the only part of the edifice where hyaloclastic tuff crops out. The Bennet Saddle separates Mount Waesche from Mount Sidley  to the northeast.\n\nParagraph 4: Davis was a consensus All-American in 1974, and led the USC Trojans in rushing, scoring and kick return yardage for three consecutive seasons. He is especially remembered for scoring 11 touchdowns in three games against Notre Dame.  In a 45–23 USC win on December 2, 1972, he scored six touchdowns which set a school single game record. Two of those scores came on kickoff returns. He returned the opening kickoff 97 yards for a touchdown after Notre Dame won the coin toss and chose to kick. After Notre Dame scored on a short pass and narrowed the Trojans' lead, he returned the following kickoff 96 yards for a touchdown. In this game, Davis had three kickoff returns for a total of 218 yards, an average of 72.7 yards per return. This set an NCAA record for the highest average gain per return in a single game.  In his career as a Trojan he returned 37 kickoffs for 1,299 yards, an NCAA record 35.1 yard average. His six career kickoff returns for touchdowns set an NCAA record which stood until 2009, when it was broken by C. J. Spiller of Clemson. Davis' kickoff return average of 42.5 yards in 1974, is the highest kickoff return average for any single season leader ever.  He was also the first Pacific-8 Conference player to rush for more than 1,000 yards in three consecutive seasons – 1,191 in 1972; 1,112 in 1973 and 1,469 in 1974. For his career at USC, he carried the ball 784 times for 3,772 yards and 44 touchdowns. Davis was also a repeat (1973, 1974) first-team All-Pac-8 Conference selection.  He was also the third multiple recipient of the W.J. Voit Memorial Trophy, awarded each year to the outstanding football player on the Pacific Coast. Davis won the Voit trophy in 1972 and 1974.\n\nParagraph 5: Albuquerque was host to two other Class D minor-league teams (the Dons and the Albuquerque Cardinals, the latter for which Tingley Field was built) before the Dukes returned in 1942, this time with the Class D West Texas–New Mexico League.  The Dukes went 24-30, but withdrew from competition in June of that year.  The league was silent from 1943 to 1945 due to World War II, but play resumed in 1946 with the Dukes returning to the league, which was reclassified as Class C.  In 1955 the West Texas–New Mexico League stepped up one more level, to Class B.\n\nParagraph 6: Near the end of the OVA, Tetsuya returns with a new and much more powerful Great, which is discovered in Doctor Juzo Kabuto's laboratory. This is said to be the real Great Mazinger (or \"Shin Great Mazinger\"). The \"true\" Great is structurally the same as the earlier version, but the color scheme for the forearms and legs is blue, as in the original 70's version. It is explained that the Great Mazinger made by Doctor Kenzo Kabuto (Kouji's father) is the prototype version seen in the early episodes, whereas Doctor Juzo Kabuto (Kouji's grandfather), who secretly works in an underground laboratory, managed to finish the final version of Great Mazinger. With a tremendous power compared to the prototype version, Tetsuya asked Kouji to confront Dr. Hell in Bardos Island. Kouji, without knowing the true Shin Great Mazinger, was worried and asked Tetsuya if he can handle an entire army of super robots. However, having the confidence with Shin Great Mazinger, Tetusya scolds Kouji of his cockiness. Therefore, Kouji flies off to fight Dr. Hell leaving Tetsuya against an entire army of mechanical beasts. Consequently, Shin Great Mazinger defeated the entire army of Doctor Hell including the possessed Venus Ace (although most of the battle was not shown). After the battle without damage, Great Mazinger decided to find and help Kouji in the Floating Fortress of Dr. Hell. The concept of Shin Great Mazinger is to bring Great Mazinger to the ranks of modern and more powerful robots such as Mazinkaiser and Shin Getter Robo.\n\nParagraph 7: Cyclopropanones- three-membered ring ketones- are also hydrated to a significant extent. Since three-membered rings are very strained (bond angles forced to be 60˚), sp3 hybridization is more favorable than sp2 hybridization. For the sp3 hybridized hydrate the bonds have to be distorted by about 49˚, while for the sp2 hybridized ketone the bond angle distortion is about 60˚. So the addition to the carbonyl group allows some of the strain inherent in the small ring to be released, which is why cyclopropanone and cyclobutanone are very reactive electrophiles. For larger rings, where the bond angles are not as distorted, the stability of the hemiacetals is due to entropy and the proximity of the nucleophile to the carbonyl group. Formation of an acyclic acetal involves a decrease in entropy because two molecules are consumed for every one produced. In contrast, the formation of cyclic hemiacetals involves a single molecule reacting with itself, making the reaction more favorable. Another way to understand the stability of cyclic hemiacetals is to look at the equilibrium constant as the ratio of the forward and backward reaction rate. For a cyclic hemiacetal the reaction is intramolecular so the nucleophile is always held close to the carbonyl group ready to attack, so the forward rate of reaction is much higher than the backward rate. Many biologically relevant sugars, such as glucose, are cyclic hemiacetals.       \n\nParagraph 8: Given the task of forming the personalities of the Crash Nitro Kart cast through the full-motion videos, the Red Eye Studio artists set certain rules for how each character would carry itself by default. As animator Thomas Happ noted, \"N. Gin, for example, would always default to twitchy, side-to-side glances, while Tiny would often scratch his head in confusion. There were a lot of scenes where the characters are just standing around listening to Emperor Velo talk, and we had to invent ways to personalize their mannerisms and create a uniquely 'thinking character'.\" To achieve the bold and deeply saturated colors and textures for the characters and environments, the artists used Maya as well as Adobe Photoshop and Corel Painter. While the artists adapted many of the sets and props in the cinematics from in-game counterparts, they recreated the majority of these objects from scratch in order to add surrealism to the scenery. The cinematics were completed well in advance of the four-month deadline. The console version of Crash Nitro Kart was announced by Vivendi Universal prior to the Electronic Entertainment Expo of 2003, while the N-Gage version was announced on February 16, 2004. Crash Nitro Kart is among the first titles to be developed using the Intrinsic Alchemy middleware technology following Vicarious Visions' purchase of its rights from the defunct Intrinsic Graphics.Crash Nitro Kart was released for the PlayStation 2, Xbox, GameCube and Game Boy Advance in North America on November 11, 2003, and in Europe on November 28, 2003; The N-Gage version of the game was released in Europe on June 30, 2004, and in North America on July 28, 2004. The mobile version was released on September 20, 2004. The PlayStation 2 version was re-released in the three-disc \"Crash Bandicoot Action Pack\" compilation (alongside Crash Twinsanity and Crash Tag Team Racing) in the United States on June 12, 2007, and in Europe on July 20, 2007.\n\nParagraph 9: A more modern form of the EPG, associated with both television and radio broadcasting, is the interactive [electronic] programming guide (IPG, though often referred to as EPG). An IPG allows television viewers and radio listeners to navigate scheduling information menus interactively, selecting and discovering programming by time, title, channel or genre using an input device such as a keypad, computer keyboard or television remote control. Its interactive menus are generated entirely within local receiving or display equipment using raw scheduling data sent by individual broadcast stations or centralized scheduling information providers. A typical IPG provides information covering a span of seven or 14 days.\n\nParagraph 10: On 9 December 1962, the 1st Green Jackets (43rd and 52nd) led by Lieutenant Colonel Tod Sweeney was deployed to Brunei on the island of Borneo after an Indonesian-backed uprising occurred. Major David Wood was second-in-command of the regiment during the Brunei Revolt. Major David Mostyn, Captain Robin Evelegh and Lieutenant Robin Letts who later served with 22 SAS, was awarded the Military Cross: Borneo 1965 and later transferred to the Australian Army, joined the Australian SAS and served in the Vietnam War, also took part in operations against the North Kalimantan National Army (TNKU). Lieutenant Colonel Tod Sweeney tasked Captain John Stevenson the battalion's transport officer and NCOs with collecting troops from Jalan Gajah and other parts of the island; many troops were out of the barracks as it was a Sunday. The regiment moved from Penang on 9 December 1962 by 19.00hrs within 6 hours notice. First driving through the night to Kuala Lumpur which they reached early the following day; the regiment then continued to Singapore and arrived there by nightfall. The regiment had been informed that they were moving to Singapore to relieve the 1st Battalion, Queen's Own Highlanders (Seaforth and Camerons). Following the 640-mile Journey 1st Green Jackets (43rd and 52nd) were then told by the Military Police to drive straight to the docks where they boarded the cruiser HMS Tiger and received orders for the regiment's deployment. The mobilisation of the regiment, move to Singapore and embarkation on HMS Tiger were all completed within 34 hours.\n\nParagraph 11: The legislative veto was first developed in context of the delegation to the president to reorganize governmental agencies and was first authorized by the Legislative Appropriations Act in 1932. It was furthered by the necessities of providing for national security and foreign affairs immediately prior to and during World War II. While the scope of the nondelegation doctrine was greatly limited, Congress wished to provide a method of retaining power over delegated authority, and used the legislative veto as a method of allowing the Executive Branch to respond flexibly to events under \"intelligible principles\" while allowing Congress to overturn Presidential actions that would have lacked sufficient support for legislation explicitly authorizing them.\n\nParagraph 12: Under Wang Mang's Xin dynasty other than cash coins with \"flower holes\" also spade money with \"flower holes\" were cast. Under the reign of the Tang dynasty the number of Chinese cash coins with \"flower holes\" started to increase and circulated throughout the entire empire, concurrently the casting of Chinese cash coins was switched from using clay moulds to using bronze ones, however the earliest Kaiyuan Tongbao cash coins were still cast with clay moulds so the mould type alone cannot explain why these \"flower holes\" became increasingly common. As mother coins (母錢) were used to cast these coins which were always exact it indicates that these \"flower holes\" were added post-casting, the largest amount of known cash coins with \"flower holes\" have very prominent octagonal holes in the middle on both sides of the coin, comparatively their legends are usually as defined as they appear on \"normal cash coins\", for this reason the hypothesis that they were accidentally added is disproven. All sides of these coins (either octagonal with \"flower holes\" or hexagonal with \"turtle shell holes\") are clearly contained inside of the cash coin's central rim. After the casting of cash coins had shifted to using bronze moulds these coins would appear as if they were branches of a \"coin tree\" (錢樹) where they had to be broken off, all excess copper-alloy had to be manually chiseled or filed off from the central holes. It is suspected that the \"flower holes\" and \"turtle shell holes\" were produced during chiseling process, presumably while the employee of the manufacturing mint was doing the final details of the cash coins. As manually filing and chiseling cash coins was both an additional expense as well as time-consuming it is likely that the creation of \"flower holes\" and \"turtle shell holes\" was ordered by the manufacturer. However, as the quality of Tang and Song dynasty coinages was quite high it's unlikely that the supervisors would have allowed for a large number of these variant coins to be produced, pass quality control or be allowed to enter circulation. Cash coins with \"flower holes\" were produced in significant numbers by the Northern Song dynasty, Southern Song dynasty, and Khitan Liao dynasty. Until 1180 the Northern Song dynasty produced \"matched cash coins\" (對錢, duì qián) which were cash coins with identical inscriptions written in different styles of Chinese calligraphy, after these coins were superseded by cash coins that included the year of production on their reverse sides the practice of casting cash coins with \"flower holes\" also seems to have drastically decreased. Due to this one hypothesis states that \"flower holes\" were added to Chinese cash coins to signify a year or period of the year or possibly a location where a cash coin was produced.", "answers": ["Paragraph 7"], "length": 2718, "dataset": "passage_retrieval_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "9366ed74e314180c3b8e8e60911b382761d83c503de3a83a"}
{"input": "The text is about Calvin Zabo, a biochemist who becomes obsessed with the idea of transforming into a superhuman form similar to the character Mr. Hyde in Stevenson's novel. He robs his employers to fund his experiments and seeks revenge on Donald Blake, a doctor who refuses to give him a job. Zabo successfully creates a formula that transforms him into a Hulk-like creature called Mister Hyde. Hyde attempts to kill Blake, but Blake transforms into Thor and survives. Hyde then kidnaps Blake and Jane Foster, but Thor ultimately defeats him. The authorities suspect Thor of the crimes, but he allows Hyde to escape to keep Blake safe.", "context": "Paragraph 1: With very few feature films made in Canada at all prior to the 1960s, in some years no Film of the Year winner was named at all, with the awards for Best Short Film or Best Amateur Film instead constituting the highest honour given to a film that year. Even the award for Film of the Year, when presented at all, often also went to a short film. The awards were also almost totally dominated by the National Film Board, to the point that independent filmmakers sometimes alleged a systemic bias which was itself a contributing factor to the difficulty of building a sustainable commercial film industry in Canada. Particularly in the 1960s, television films were also eligible for the awards; in 1969, in fact, no theatrical films were entered into the awards at all, and the nominees and winners at the 21st Canadian Film Awards consisted almost entirely of television films. Despite the creation of the ACTRA Awards in 1972, the Canadian Film Awards continued to present selected \"non-feature\" awards, inclusive of television films, until the 1st Genie Awards in 1980. After launching the Genies, the Academy of Canadian Cinema and Television created the Bijou Awards, which were presented in 1981 as a new home for several award categories that were being dropped from the Genies, although the Bijous were never presented again after 1981, and instead the Gemini Awards were launched in 1986 to replace the ACTRAs as Canada's primary television awards.\n\nParagraph 2: On January 26, eight senators spoke out against impeachment. Senator James Lankford (R-OK) said \"This is not a trial; this is political theater. You cannot remove someone from the office who is already out of office. In this trial, there is no current President, no Chief Justice, and no possibility someone could be removed from office because they are not in any office. In a moment when our nation needs to unite, this trial will only create even deeper divisions.\" Senator Jim Inhofe (R-OK) tweeted \"Given that the penalty for impeachment shall be removed from office, my reading of the Constitution leads me to believe that the Founders did not intend for us to impeach former federal officeholders. I agree with @RandPaul that it's not constitutional to try a former president.\" Senator John Kennedy (R-LA) said \"Today, I voted to affirm that these impeachment proceedings are unconstitutional. Based on the information I have right now, I voted today and will vote again later in the impeachment trial to dismiss the impeachment proceedings against former President Trump.\" Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) tweeted \"This impeachment is nothing more than a partisan exercise designed to further divide the country. Democrats claim to want to unify the country but impeaching a former president, a private citizen, is the antithesis of unity.\" Senator Richard Shelby (R-AL) told reporters he has \"deep reservations whether they should be trying him at all.\" Senator Roy Blunt (R-MO) tweeted that \"I believe the constitutional purpose for presidential impeachment is to remove a president from office, not to punish a person after they have left office.\" Senator Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV) said \"My vote today to dismiss the article of impeachment is based on the fact that impeachment was designed to remove an officeholder from public office. The Constitution does not give Congress the power to impeach a private citizen. This charge is directed at an individual who no longer holds public office. I believe it is time we focus our attention and energies on the numerous challenges our country presently faces. Instead of taking a path of divisiveness, let us heed the call to unity that we have heard spoken so often over the past few weeks.\" Senator Thom Tillis (R-NC) said \"On January 6, I said voting to reject the states' electors was a dangerous precedent we should not set. Likewise, impeaching a former President who is now a private citizen would be equally unwise.\"\n\nParagraph 3: Reviewers emphasized that the game achieves its surprising impact on the player due to its outward resemblance to typical eroge games: it has a pronounced anime style in its character design, and the game's goal is to develop a relationship with one of the characters. In addition, the characters consist of anime stereotypes whose behavior is sparsely displayed through their sprites, and the game's musical accompaniment is light, bouncy, gentle and playful. According to critics, these aspects combined to create the impression of a standard visual novel that would prompt the player to become attached to the characters. VisualNovelist of Jeuxvideo.com positively compared the game's visual quality to Everlasting Summer, another independent visual novel with the appearance of a professional production. Reviewers pointed out that the game's horror was built on the destruction of a sense of control over what happens in the game and the feeling of helplessness that stems from the distortions in the game's world. Victoria Rose of Polygon stated that this approach was strikingly different from traditional horror games and films, where the viewer remains alienated from what is happening on the screen. Amy Josuweit of Rock, Paper, Shotgun noted that while earlier visual novels have broken the fourth wall by crashing the client or adding extra files, Doki Doki Literature Club! changed the angle by deliberately destroying files rather than adding them.GQs Tom Philip commented that at times the narrative felt like \"a slog, clicking through endless amounts of inane, flirty conversation about poetry.\" Fenner opined that the game did not pass the Bechdel test and positioned the protagonist as a seductive casanova. However, he emphasized that the plot is ultimately a \"sharply aware polemic against harem anime/visual novels\" in which \"the lengths the ladies go to are not wholly because of the protagonist, but rather he can be read as a symptom—an easy outlet.\" Fenner also felt that the game, like Katawa Shoujo before it, \"appears to veer dangerously close to fetishization of very real issues.\" Ben \"Yahtzee\" Croshaw of The Escapist described the game as \"a nice little idea with a memorable moment or two,\" but added that the game \"doesn't really have anywhere to go once the rabbit's out of the hat.\" Nevertheless, reviewers recognized the game's plot focus as successful and relevant. 8 Bit Rambles stated that Doki Doki Literature Club! \"revolves around love in its most demented and deconstructive form,\" and characterized the game as an example of postmodern art.\n\nParagraph 4: Viewing semiotics as a social theory of the production of meaning, Moisés de Lemos Martins distances it from theories of consciousness and subjectivity, because meaning is not centred on the individual. Nor is it centred on the message that circulates between a sender and a receiver, as is the case of information theory. In the idea of semiotics that he proposes, Moisés de Lemos Martins is inspired by the transcendental conditions of the possibility of meaning and communication, which constitute the central axis of the theories, of Francis Jacques, on the one hand, and of Karl-Otto Apel and Jürgen Habermas, on the other. In so doing, Moisés de Lemos Martins opens signification to intersubjectivity and interaction, i.e. to communicative action. Starting from the a priori conditions of meaning, of Kantian inspiration, both Francis Jacques, com o with the primum relationis, and Karl-Otto Apel and Jürgen Habermas, with the “ethics of communicative action”, had established the transcendental conditions of communication. Moisés de Lemos Martins’ perspective in semiotics consists, however, in inverting the transcendental conditions of the possibility of meaning and communication, in conditions of the historical and social possibility of production of meaning. In all three cases - Jacques, Apel and Habermas - the primacy of the interlocutive relationship prevails, which is a relationship of communication. But in Moisés de Lemos Martins, the transcendental relationship, which underpins the dialogism of the three philosophers, becomes a socio-historical relationship, which is why his understanding of semiotics is social. This conclusion is reiterated by António Fidalgo, full professor of semiotics, at the University of Beira Interior: \"the indication of its object is a very important element for its understanding as a science. Traditionally, semiotics was understood as the science of signs, but today new schools are appearing and authors are defending semiotics as a science of meaning as opposed to semiotics as a science of signs. One of these authors is Moisés Martins\". And the reason why Moisés de Lemos Martins proposes a semiotics of discourse, rather than a semiotics of the sign, is that both the logic of communication and the theory of information, which constitute the dual tradition of the semiotics of the sign, have both ended up being mobilised at the service of the all-powerful technological, cybernetic and cyberspatial system for the circulation of verbal, sound and visual messages. There is, in fact, no doubt about the operative capacity of signs, given the fact that they bring together the logic of communication and the theory of information in the sense of their technological mobilisation.\n\nParagraph 5: Seinfeld was the founder, bassist and vocalist for the New York hardcore/heavy metal band Biohazard. Seinfeld founded the band in 1987 but left the band in early 2011. Evan was also the bassist for the short-lived supergroup Damnocracy, featured in the VH1 reality television show Supergroup, with other members including Ted Nugent, Sebastian Bach, Scott Ian and Jason Bonham. In March 2007, Evan Seinfeld debuted his new band, The Spyderz, as an opening act for a Buckcherry performance. The band was originally named White Line Fever until it was discovered that a UK band already owned the name. The Spyderz also featured guitarist John Monte, formerly of Ministry, M.O.D. and The Disparrows vocalist Daniel Weber. In October 2008, Seinfeld briefly joined Tattooed Millionaires as a bassist and co-vocalist.\n\nParagraph 6: The film begins with a casket, opening up and a man takes a selfie of him, and told himself that he's an ugly dead man. John Samson, is about to record a video message to his friend Mark Caramat, who is also a theater actor. However, John has been diagnosed with cancer and has only one to two years to live. He tried several treatments, but to no avail. When John told Mark about his condition, he became devastated. John then suggests to fake his death and have a played wake and funeral. Mark refused to help him, but in the end he decided to help him. The plan is that John and Mark would go on a vacation in a resort. On the night of the vacation, John would die in his sleep. But, they would use a dead body to look like John really died. He doesn't want to be buried, but to be cremated. But he doesn't want his ashes to be buried, but rather scatter his ashes in the sea. In the wake, he wanted to have a different funeral decorations daily. As John's condition worsen, they decided to go with their plan. He also told Mark that when he dies, he will give to him his laundromat business and water refilling station. At the day 1 of his mock wake, John disguised himself as Yolly Redgrave, a transgender woman. In his wake, different people gave their eulogies to John. On the second day, John's older sister Mary came unexpectedly. She attempted to open the casket, but Mark tried to stop her until he fainted. They decided to lock the casket to prevent it from opening. On the third day, John's bestfriend Luke came and said his eulogy. He said that he's thankful to John because he'd became a good friend to him. As a reward, John gave Mark a trip for two to Maldives. On the fourth and final day, Mark gave his eulogy to John. Joseph, visits the wake. Joseph met Mark at a bathhouse. But it was raided and he sought help of John. John then met Joseph. Six months after, Joseph and Mark broke up. There, Joseph told Mark that he and John had an affair. But, John broke up with him because he didn't want to hurt his friend. Because of what happened, their friendship ended. The remains of the fake John was cremated. Yolly came to Mary and confessed that she is really John. John attended the stage play of Mark. But, Mark didn't mind the gift from John. Until Mark texted John about the trip to Maldives. John replied that he will not go if he's not with him. After a party with his fellow stage actors, Mark met his death in a vehicular accident. This left John devastated and mourning. Mary and John who is disguised as Yolly visit the wake of Mark. She then gave a video message for Mark. The message is a farewell message of John to Mark. \n\nParagraph 7: In December 2019, in Operación Alacrán, the website Armando.info published an investigation on corruption among opposition politicians, leading to the expulsion of deputies, including Luis Parra, José Brito and , from PJ. On 2020, José Brito and Conrado Pérez filed a complaint in the Supreme Tribunal of Justice against the leadership of Justice First. The deputies asked to be restituted in the party, saying that there was no justification to be expelled, and that their due process, right of defense and presumption of innocence had not been respected. They also asked the high court to appoint a new leadership \"that was in Venezuela\", since the current one was in exile, and to summon new internal elections. The deputies were received by the president of the Constitutional Chamber and the meeting lasted a little more than an hour. Outside the Supreme Tribunal, a group of around two hundred people met in support of the deputies. El Pitazo reported that earlier in the morning, some persons were handing out shirts of the party, most apparently new. Several demonstrators interviewed by the outlet expressed ignoring the reasons of the meeting or the contents of the complaint introduced. In some cases, they affirmed having been taken by bus, could not say for long they were part of Justice First, did not know that Luis Parra was not present or declared being paid for assisting. The party's secretary general, Tomás Guanipa, declared that the deputies sought to give the party's electoral card to Nicolás Maduro. In January 2020, the disputed 2020 Venezuelan National Assembly Delegated Committee election took place to determine who would be the President of the National Assembly for the period 2020-21 period; pro-government MPs and the expelled PJ deputies voted for Parra while the remaining PJ deputies endorsed incumbent president Juan Guaidó.\n\nParagraph 8: When French forces under Napoleon Bonaparte invaded Egypt in 1798, Bonaparte brought with him a corps of scientists and scholars, generally known as the savants, to study the land and its ancient monuments. In July 1799, when French soldiers were rebuilding a Mamluk fort near the town of Rosetta that they had dubbed Fort Julien, Lieutenant Pierre-François Bouchard noticed that one of the stones from a demolished wall in the fort was covered with writing. It was an ancient Egyptian stela, divided into three registers of text, with its lower right corner and most of its upper register broken off. The stone was inscribed with three scripts: hieroglyphs in the top register, Greek at the bottom and an unidentified script in the middle. The text was a decree issued in 197BC by Ptolemy V, granting favours to Egypt's priesthoods. The text ended by calling for copies of the decree to be inscribed \"in sacred, and native, and Greek characters\" and set up in Egypt's major temples. Upon reading this passage in the Greek inscription the French realised the stone was a parallel text, which could allow the Egyptian text to be deciphered based on its Greek translation. The savants eagerly sought other fragments of the stela as well as other texts in Greek and Egyptian. No further pieces of the stone were ever found, and the only other bilingual texts the savants discovered were largely illegible and useless for decipherment. The savants did make some progress with the stone itself. Jean-Joseph Marcel said the middle script was \"cursive characters of the ancient Egyptian language\", identical to others he had seen on papyrus scrolls. He and Louis Rémi Raige began comparing the text of this register with the Greek one, reasoning that the middle register would be more fruitful than the hieroglyphic text, most of which was missing. They guessed at the positions of proper names in the middle register, based on the position of those names in the Greek text, and managed to identify the p and t in the name of Ptolemy, but they made no further progress.\n\nParagraph 9: The territorial fragmentation of political sovereignty in Germany on the outset of the 16th century pushed the individual territorial lords (‘’Landesherren’’) into the position of the official decision-maker regarding the acceptance or rejection of the new Reformation process. The monastic convents had to fear for their survival, as the new movement set out to secularize and expropriate what they saw as an expression of the decadence and detachment from the faithful in the outside world. Lüne Abbey fell into the jurisdiction of the Duchy of Brunswick-Lüneburg which had been the main site of the Hildesheim Diocesan Feud in 1519. The convent suffered greatly under the joint raids of the princes of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel and Calenberg, at some point even having to evacuate the convent building and move into the city of Lüneburg itself. The feud saw Brunswick-Lüneburg fall into major debt and its convents become weakened as a result. In 1525, as many German territories had to face peasant uprisings, Duke Ernest I tried to quickly consolidate his budget by sending a demand over 28,000 guilders to all convents in Brunswick-Lüneburg which he threatened to enforce by a military show of force, if necessary. It did not take long after that, however, for the duke to publicly declare his allegiance to the cause of the Reformation and thus target the Roman Catholic convents directly. The female convents of Brunswick-Lüneburg, tightly knit together since the monastic reform of 1481, staunchly opposed the duke’s demands, and the situation effectively went into a standstill for the next four years. In 1529, Duke Ernest and his court decided to break up the monastic network by first targeting its male provosts. He hoped to replace them one by one with a Protestant preacher loyal only to the duke himself, as those provosts had once themselves deposed the old leadership of the convents without much opposition. Indeed, in late 1529, the Lüne provost Johannes Lorber resigned from his post and made way for a ducal administrator, Johannes Haselhorst, and a Protestant preacher, Hieronymous Enkhusen. In the following year, these measures were followed up by the inception of a new monastic policy which changed the liturgy within the convents drastically and nullified all monastic vows. The female communities were explicitly stated to be the new religious enemies. In 1531, one of the ducal tax collectors even went so far as to destroy one of the chapels of Lüne Abbey, consecrated to Saint Gangulphus of Burgundy.\n\nParagraph 10: Calvin Zabo was born in Trenton, New Jersey and becomes a morally abject, but brilliant biochemist who discovered the effects of hormones on human physiology. His favorite storybook is Stevenson's 1886 classic, Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde. He convinced himself that the experiment Dr. Jekyll performed in the story could actually be accomplished and obsessed with the idea of unleashing his full bestial nature in a superhuman form. However, he needed money to do this, so he robbed his various employers systematically. Though too intelligent to be caught, the medical community got suspicious for his tendency of always getting employed by organizations which were subsequently robbed. Zabo eventually sought work as a surgeon in the hospital where Donald Blake, now a directing physician, yet would not allow him that job due to his history. Zabo became so enraged that Blake would not give him the position, even though he did indeed intend to rob the organization, and swore revenge. He even became successful in creating his formula and turned himself into a massive, Hulk-like creature he called Mister Hyde, named after the character in the novel. In this new form, Hyde found out he had immense strength allowing him to crush cars and tear through steel as though it were made of cardboard. With his new superhuman powers he sought out Blake, whom he tried to kill by throwing him from a window, but Blake transformed into Thor by striking his cane on the wall and survived, with Thor claiming that he have saved Blake. Hyde, hearing of this on the radio, decided to eliminate Thor. He tried framing him for a bank robbery by using his vast strength to rip open a bank vault while disguised as Thor. While Blake and Jane Foster were out, Hyde met and kidnapped them at gunpoint. As Blake, he got tied up next to a bomb that would explode in 24 hours unless Hyde defused it. However, when attempting to steal a Polaris submarine to roam the seas like a pirate, After Thor defeated Hyde, the authorities saw his brute strength and realized he must have impersonated Thor, but Thor forced himself to let him escape, as Jane thought Blake is still in danger.", "answers": ["Paragraph 10"], "length": 3675, "dataset": "passage_retrieval_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "c7eeea5b285b2c95ce8e80fb2937bc5027dd7ef9835b1e68"}
{"input": "The text describes the career of an Australian pilot named Evans. He qualified as a flying instructor after being posted to Central Flying School in Victoria in 1949. He served in this capacity for four years and also had an exchange posting in New Zealand. He was supposed to be posted to the Korean War but the armistice prevented it, so he returned to his previous squadron as an instructor. In 1954, he was assigned to transporting VIPs and served with the Governor-General's Flight until 1956. He was then promoted to squadron leader and attended RAAF Staff College. He became a personal staff officer to the Minister for Air in 1958. In 1959, he underwent training on De Havilland Vampire and English Electric Canberra jets. From 1960 to 1962, he served as a flight commander in Malaysia. In 1963, Evans helped formulate operational requirements for a new RAAF bomber and ordered 24 General Dynamics F-111C jets. As an interim measure, the US government offered 24 Boeing B-47 Stratojets, and in November 1963, the Chief of the Air Staff test flew one with Evans as a passenger. In 1965, Evans was posted to Washington, D.C., as assistant air attaché.", "context": "Paragraph 1: Roxxon is revealed to be orchestrating the young superheroes being falsely outlawed by the public. Having acquired the dragons from War of the Realms event, their first step was to get rid of the high schooler Aliana Kabua. Although Kamala Khan got injured from saving Aliana, Roxxon begin to shift the blame to the Champions for the damage they never started. While forming a partnership with Senator Geoffrey Patrick and C.R.A.D.L.E., Roxxon manipulates them into unknowingly furthering their shady businesses, such as permanent imprisonment, brainwashing and unethical experimentation, as well as possibly kidnapping of the kids who oppose the unjust law. Viv Vision, who survived Roxxon's assault on Aliana, had been monitoring her fellow younger superheroes, but discovers that she is unintentionally selling her friends to C.R.A.D.L.E. and Roxxon. Once the Champions reveals Roxxon's conspiracy to Senator Patrick and the public, the senator finally begins to repeal the unjust law, ending the partnership with Roxxon, and clearing Kamala's name while re-evaluating his business dealings. Later, Miles Morales and Sam Alexander go undercover as interns, prior to being suggested to hire Kamala Kahn. While Roxxon attempts to cover up their illegal activity by releasing a social app called \"Roxx-On\", a Champion and a former prisoner of C.R.A.D.L.E.'s harassment, Snowguard rallies a group of mobs because they still openly do not trust Roxxon for their previous activities. Much worst, Roxxon already hired Ironheart's nemesis from Stark Unlimited, Andre Sims, in an attempt to collect data to dispose of those who are deemed threats to its business. He replaced young superheroes with his Chaperon robots to ensure the unjust Kamala's Law remains active. During Roxx-On concert, Roxxon lost its public trust thanks to Kamala's public speech about the company's ongoing shady business, thus repealing Kamala's Law and disbanding C.R.A.D.L.E.. However, Roxxon's reputation becomes worst when Andre attempts to dispose of young people like the Champions because of his personal issues, but is immediately stopped by Roxxon's higher-up Miriam Blakemoore. After that, Roxxon finally makes a public speech to apologize for their actions and takes responsibility for Andre's crime.\n\nParagraph 2: Returning to Australia in November 1949, Evans was posted to Central Flying School (CFS) at RAAF Base East Sale, Victoria, where he qualified as a flying instructor. He served in this capacity for the next four years, including an exchange posting with the Royal New Zealand Air Force from May 1951 to July 1953. As he was preparing to depart New Zealand, he received word that his next posting would be to the Korean War as a pilot with No. 77 Squadron; the armistice prevented this and he returned to No. 38 Squadron as an instructor. In 1954 he was assigned to transporting VIPs, serving with the Governor-General's Flight (later No. 34 (Special Transport) Squadron) until 1956. As well as Governor-General Sir William Slim and Lady Slim, his passengers included Prime Minister Robert Menzies and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. Promoted to squadron leader, Evans's service with the VIP flight earned him the Air Force Cross in the Queen's Birthday Honours promulgated in the London Gazette on 13 June 1957. The same year, he attended RAAF Staff College at Point Cook, Victoria. He became personal staff officer to the Minister for Air in 1958, a position he found valuable for the insight he gained into Australia's political culture. In November 1959, he took a refresher course at CFS, qualifying on De Havilland Vampire and English Electric Canberra jets. He underwent further training on Canberra bombers with No. 1 Operational Conversion Unit at RAAF Base Amberley, Queensland, graduating in May 1960. From then until 1962 he served as a flight commander in No. 2 Squadron, operating Canberras out of RAAF Base Butterworth, Malaysia. He subsequently attended the RAF College of Air Warfare. In January 1963, Evans was transferred to Air Staff Division, Canberra, where he helped formulate operational requirements for a new RAAF bomber. His final specification included a payload of , speed of Mach 2, and range of . This requirement was met by the General Dynamics F-111C, 24 of which were ordered by the Australian government in October 1963. As an interim measure until delivery of the F-111, the US government offered 24 Boeing B-47 Stratojets to the RAAF. Though the offer was never seriously considered, a B-47 was test flown from Amberley to Darwin in November 1963 by the Chief of the Air Staff, Air Marshal Val Hancock, with Evans as passenger. Evans had been assigned to fly the plane but was replaced at the last moment by Hancock; the take-off almost ended in disaster after Hancock unknowingly switched off the engines' water injection—needed to ensure sufficient thrust in hot conditions—that Evans had switched on before vacating the pilot's seat. In January 1965, Evans was posted to Washington, D.C., as assistant air attaché, having \"had quite enough of writing Air Staff Requirements\".\n\nParagraph 3: Fennica is classified by Det Norske Veritas with a class notation 1A1 POLAR-10 Icebreaker Tug Supply Vessel SF HELDK EPR E0 DYNPOS-AUTR. Her ice class, POLAR-10, means that her hull is strengthened for unassisted operation in the Arctic, sub-Arctic and Antarctic regions, where the vessel can encounter winter ice with a nominal thickness of , pressure ridges, multi-year ice floes and glacial ice inclusions. The additional class notation \"Icebreaker\" states that she has no limitations for repeated ramming. To improve the maneuverability of the ship in ice her hull is wider at the bow than in the stern. These \"reamers\" increase the width of the ice channel and reduce friction between the hull and ice. The reamers are designed so that they create minimum additional resistance in the astern mode by breaking ice downwards. In addition the forward part of the hull has explosion-welded stainless steel ice belt that reduces friction and protects the steel plates from abrasion.\n\nParagraph 4: Extensive development of the island began after it was bought by William W. Eastman and John L. Merriam in 1865. In 1866, Eastman and Merriam tried to sell the island to the city of Minneapolis, to be a park, but the proposal was rejected in a referendum. Eastman and Merriam began building mills on the south side of the island and the Eastman tunnel, and residential buildings on the north side. The Eastman tunnel extended from Nicollet Island to the south end of Saint Anthony Falls via Hennepin Island. The tunnel collapsed in 1869, and almost destroyed Saint Anthony Falls. The fix was a concrete dike (wall)  built by the Corps of Engineers  just upstream from the falls all the way across the river from just under the limestone cap down as much as 40 feet (12 m). After the failure of the tunnel, Eastman built a system of turbines at the falls and overhead cables to provide hydropower to factories on the south end of the island, including the Island Power Building (razed in 1937, it contained a variety of shops), a plant of the Cedar Lake Ice Company, and the Island Sash and Door Company (now the Nicollet Island Inn).\n\nParagraph 5: As the northern Atlantic opened to the east of Greenland during the Eocene, North America and Eurasia drifted apart; the Mid-Atlantic Ridge formed as an oceanic spreading center and a part of the submarine volcanic system of mid-oceanic ridges. The initial plume head may have been several thousand kilometers in diameter, and it erupted volcanic rocks on both sides of the present ocean basin to produce the North Atlantic Igneous Province. Upon further opening of the ocean and plate drift, the plume and the mid-Atlantic Ridge are postulated to have approached one another, and finally met. The excess magmatism that accompanied the transition from flood volcanism on Greenland, Ireland and Norway to present-day Icelandic activity was the result of ascent of the hot mantle source beneath progressively thinning lithosphere, according to the plume model, or a postulated unusually productive part of the mid-ocean ridge system. Some geologists have suggested that the Iceland plume could have been responsible for the Paleogene uplift of the Scandinavian Mountains by producing changes in the density of the lithosphere and asthenosphere during the opening of the North Atlantic. To the south the Paleogene uplift of the English chalklands that resulted in the formation of the Sub-Paleogene surface has also been attributed to the Iceland plume.\n\nParagraph 6: Immigrant Chronicle is a collection of poems by Peter Skrzynecki, remembering the experiences of his family as they immigrated from post-war Poland to Australia. The family, Peter Skrzynecki and his two parents, were in transit for over two years from 1949–51 (either physically travelling, or in a migrant hostel) before they were allowed to begin their new life in Australia. The book also expounds the ongoing hardships that Skrzynecki and his parents still suffer because of their journey to Australia. Immigrant Chronicle was one of the five prescribed \"Physical Journeys\" texts in the compulsory New South Wales HSC English syllabus, and was a prescribed poetry text for \"Area of Study: Belonging\" for 2009–14. This core text is the main focus of the unit, and it requires students to find their own related text(s) and compare the texts in the form of an essay.\n\nParagraph 7: Vachellia collinsii exhibits a symbiotic relationship with several species of ants. Some noted species include Pseudomyrmex spinicola and Pseudomyrmex ferruginea. The ant-Vachellia system involving this species has been studied by ecologists like Daniel Janzen in Palo Verde National Park and Santa Rosa National Park, which are both located in Guanacaste Province, Costa Rica. The ants chew holes in the tips of the hollow stipular thorns, known as domatia, so that they can enter and create their colony inside. A single ant colony may span several V. collinsii trees. Medium sized herbivores are often deterred by the thorns alone, but the ants help protect the trees from other potentially threatening animals. Smaller animals such as caterpillars have no issue avoiding the thorns, and larger animals like elephants are less affected by these thorns. When a predator brushes and shakes the plant’s thorns in an attempt to feed, the ants will become disturbed, run outside, and release alarm pheromones to alert other ants. All ants that come in contact with the alarm pheromones become aggressive and attack the animal by biting and stinging. Beyond defending the trees from herbivores, ants occupying V. collinsii trees may even cut down surrounding vegetation and trim the encroaching branches of other plants. This provides V. collinsii with valuable space and unimpacted access to sunlight, allowing the trees to thrive. In exchange, V. collinsii not only provides the ants with hollow thorns in which to live, but also produces lipid- and protein-rich food bodies, known as Beltian bodies, on the tips of new leaflets. These bodies are consumed by the ants, providing critical nutrients for the colony. When starved of nutrients, V. collinsii produces more Beltian bodies to encourage the presence of ants. When the tree has enough extra nutrients, it will create less Beltian bodies. This behaviour suggests a feedback loop. Vachellia collinsii also provides the ants with sugar-rich nectar from extrafloral nectaries located at the leaf petiole. Since there are several species of ants that may occupy a V. collinsii, there has been observations of intraspecific interactions between these species of ants, especially between Pseudomyrmex spinicola and Crematogaster brevispinosa. C. brevispinosa may take over trees occupied by Pseudomyrmex spinicola or Pseudomyrmex nigrocinctus. C. brevispinosa will also occupy trees that are dying or heavily damaged, or trees that were previously inhabited. Furthermore, a hypothesized benefit to hosting ant colonies is that the acacia may have receptors within the domatia for ant feces that triggers absorption pathways for additional nutrient uptake at the extremities of the plant's stem tissue. When ants defecate in the domatia, their feces contain nutrients from their food which could be good for the plant. This allows the plant to obtain additional nutrients and in a shorter period of time as the nutrients do not need to travel all the way up starting from the roots.\n\nParagraph 8: The Hidden Valley Kings are a neighborhood-based gang in Charlotte, North Carolina. It was formed in the late 1990s, as a branch of the Queen City Kings, which started in the Cedar Greene housing complex, east of Hidden Valley, near the streets of Craighead and North Tryon.  The Queen City Kings were formed by a People Nation member who moved to Charlotte from Chicago in the mid 1990s. He initially established a People Nation faction in the Cedar Greene Apartment Complex but as a way to be inclusive of the growing Folk Nation influence within the growing Supreme King Queen Nation, an agreement was made by all parties involved to change the name of the gang to the Queen City Kings, which played on the nickname of the City of Charlotte, which people dub the \"Queen City.\" The name, according to the Original Kings, was the gang's affirmation to the claiming of the city, stating: \"The Queen City is our bitch, which makes us the Kings.\" Shortly thereafter, he was incarcerated on an unrelated offense. A Cedar Greene Apartments resident named \"Korn,\" along with Korn's half-brother, was left in charge; Korn proved to be a very charismatic and dedicated leader, remaining loyal to the movement until his suicide, several years later. The Kings, which originally stood for Knowledgeable Islamic Nubian Gods, then renamed Krucial Islamic Nubian Gods,  was meant to be a Charlotte, home-grown version of the Chicago gangs. The Kings were structured similar to the Los Angeles gangs, but instead of \"Original Gangsta\" (OG) or \"Baby Gangsta\" (BG) the Queen City Kings used \"Original King\" (OK) or \"Baby King\" (BK). The Kings color is black but the Hidden Valley Kings wear the color green for their neighborhood, the Hidden Valley neighborhood sign is green and Hidden Valley Elementary school colors are green. Just as the nations in Chicago had different branches, or \"sets,\" the Queen City Kings had a number of small sets as well. These sets were actually small groups of members who lived in different Charlotte communities, who were dedicated to spreading the Kingz to each of these neighborhoods. Some of them were successful but many of them were unknown in their respective neighborhoods. Among the factions were the Wilmore Kings (WMK), Tuckaseegee Kings (TSK), Beatties Ford Kings (BFK), Maple Run Kings (MRK), North Side Jamaican Kings (NJK), Westside Kings (WSK) the Creek Town Kings (CTK or FOC), The Cedar Greene Kings (CGK), the Woodview Kings (WVK),  the Hidden Valley Kings (HVK) among others of these various sets, the Hidden Valley Kings became the most prominent.\n\nParagraph 9: Watching his kingdom slip into chaos, George II ceded the crown to his 16-year-old son David IV in 1089. King David IV proved to be a capable statesman and military commander. As he came of age under the guidance of his court minister, George of Chqondidi, David IV suppressed dissent of feudal lords and centralized the power in his hands to effectively deal with foreign threats. In 1089–1100, he organized small detachments to harass and destroy isolated Seljuk troops and began the resettlement of desolate regions. By 1099 David IV's power was considerable enough that he was able to refuse paying tribute to Seljuqs. In 1104 David's supporters in the eastern Georgian province of Kakheti, nobles: Baramisdze and Arshiani captured the local king Aghsartan II (1102–1104), a loyal tributary of the Seljuk Sultan Barkiyaruq (c.1092-1105), and reunited the area with the rest of Georgia. Following the annexation of Kakheti, in 1105, David routed a Seljuk punitive force at the Battle of Ertsukhi, leading to momentum that helped him to secure the key fortresses of Samshvilde, Rustavi, Gishi, and Lori between 1110 and 1118.To strengthen his army, King David launched a major military reform in 1118–1120 and resettled several thousand Kipchaks from the northern steppes to frontier districts of Georgia. In return, the Kipchaks provided one soldier per family, allowing King David to establish a standing army in addition to his royal troops (known as Monaspa). The new army provided the king with a much-needed force to fight both external threats and internal discontent of powerful lords. The Georgian-Kipchak alliance was facilitated by David's earlier marriage to the Khan's daughter. Starting in 1120, King David began a more aggressive policy of expansion. He entered the neighbouring Shirvan and took the town of Qabala. In the winter of 1120–1121 the Georgian troops successfully attacked the Seljuk settlements on the eastern and southwestern approaches to the Transcaucasus. Muslim powers became increasingly concerned about the rapid rise of a Christian state in southern Caucasia. In 1121, Sultan Mahmud b. Muhammad ( 1118–1131) declared a holy war on Georgia. However, 12 August 1121, King David routed the enemy army on the fields of Didgori, with fleeing Seljuq Turks being run down by pursuing Georgian cavalry for several days. A huge amount of booty and prisoners were captured by David's army, which had also secured Tbilisi, the last Muslim enclave remaining from the Seljuk occupation, in 1122 and moved the Georgian capital there and inaugurated Georgia's Golden Age.\n\nParagraph 10: Gun control is another divisive issue, which stems at least partially from the fact that California's constitution does not explicitly guarantee the right for ordinary citizens to keep and bear arms.  In the cities, California has one of the U.S.'s most serious gang problems, and in some farming regions, some of the highest murder rates.  The state also contains many individuals who desire to keep and bear arms in defense of themselves, their families, and property.  The legislature has passed restrictive gun control laws.  Private purchase of assault weapons (generally, semi-automatic rifles that look like military rifles) without prior approval from the state Department of Justice (which rarely grants such approval) is a felony.  The law does not, however, prohibit sales of semi-automatic hunting-style civilian weapons, leading many to question the effectiveness of the cosmetic distinction.  Pistols may be purchased and kept in one's home or place of business (however, they are required to be registered to the state and must be considered a \"safe\" handgun (see AB 1471), but it is illegal to carry weapons or ammunition outside these areas without a concealed weapons permit, except in a locked area (car trunk) to licensed practice ranges or other legitimate uses (hunting, repair, collection, etc.) Open carry of an unloaded firearm in some areas is legal but very uncommon due to the confusing web of state and federal laws, such as the Federal Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990, which makes it a felony to carry a gun within 1000 feet of a school, even without malicious intent. As of 2012, open carry of firearms is for the most part banned, with exceptions made for law enforcement, hunters, and individuals in rural areas of the state. Except in a handful of rural counties, most people find it impossible to get concealed weapons permits since they are issued at the discretion of the local law enforcement officials; California is not a \"shall issue\" state for concealed weapons permits. Because of the importance of local law enforcement's discretion, some counties are nevertheless virtually \"shall issue\" while others are de facto \"no issue\", leading to the peculiar situation of rural residents of one jurisdiction being able to legally carry their handguns in areas where the local residents cannot. For more see gun laws in California.\n\nParagraph 11: Many of the Topolino Snow White comics were the works of Romano Scarpa. His comic \"The Seven Dwarfs and King Arbor's Crystal\" (I Sette Nani e il cristallo di Re Arbor) provides an explanation as to how the Queen would have survived her apparent death in the film (as some branches and bushes eased the fall and she was rescued by her loyal guards) and why she could not change back to her normal self (as her castle was burned down by the Huntsman and her book of magic is gone). In this story, Grimhilde (Grimilde) enlists the aid of her great admirer and past suitor, the evil King Arbor of Vegetalia, in a plot to use a magic crystal device to swap her old body with Snow White's. The intrigue is foiled by the dwarves who destroy the crystal, and the resigned Arbor allows the Witch to live with him, saying he will try to remember she was \"the most beautiful among queens\". The uneasy relationship between Grimhilde and Abor continued in \"The Seven Dwarfs and the Fountainhead\" (I Sette nani e la fonte meravigliosa), in which she desperately attempts to regain her youth, but instead only turns into a childlike version of her Witch form for a short time. Other comics by Romano Scarpa do have the Queen back in her youthful body, and sometimes even taking other shapes, as well as commanding various minions. In \"The Seven Dwarfs and the Birtch Ring\" (I Sette Nani e l'anello di betulla by Romano Scarpa), the Queen learns about the eighth Dwarf named Ginger (Zenzero), who has left his companions to go in search of fortune traveling the world, and transforms into a pixie calling herself Fagottina to send him home and sow discord among his brothers. In \"The Seven Dwarfs and the Wolf's Cliff\" (I Sette Nani e la balza del lupo), she sends a gang of three bandits named Bragia, Sghembo and Schidione to kidnap Snow White. In \"The Seven Dwarfs and the Throne of Diamonds\" (I Sette Nani e il trono di diamanti), Jiminy Cricket is deeply enamored by the Queen's beauty and attempts to convince her to become good, but the Queen refuses to be redeemed. Instead she orders her loyal soldiers to steal the throne that the Dwarfs make for Snow White in a plot to turn her rival into an old woman. Eventually, the Queen is captured by another witch named Tardona and Snow White is restored to her youth.", "answers": ["Paragraph 2"], "length": 3856, "dataset": "passage_retrieval_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "b6d6fccbf020898cff9ee83be5e758916e44fa23e876acfa"}
{"input": "The text describes a tragic event involving an airship where only three out of twelve crewmen in the bow of the airship survived. The crewmen were positioned in different areas of the bow, including the mooring shelf, lower keel walkway, and platforms beside the stairway.

The three survivors were located at the aft of the bow and were standing near air vents that provided cool air. Most of the crewmen standing along the bow stairway either fell into the fire or attempted to jump out while the airship was still too high.

They have released one EP, entitled The Some of All Things, or: The Healing Power of Scab Picking. This brought on speculation that Eyedea & Abilities were no longer together. However, in August 2007, the duo announced on their Myspace that they would be at the Twin Cities Celebration of Hip-Hop performing old songs and new material. In December 2007, Eyedea & Abilities embarked upon their Appetite for Distraction Tour with Crushkill labelmate Kristoff Krane and Minnesotan duo Sector7G.\n\nParagraph 2: Urban Renewal destroyed many historical sites, whose history has been lost except through oral stories passed from one generation to another. One such story is The First Apostolic Church, the old 2-story rock church that stood at the corner of 21st and Nogales. It was built by the hands of the men of the church, one sandstone at a time, with collections from congregants of bags of cement which were mixed with sand from the Arkansas River sand bars. It was transported to the site, a few blocks away, one pickup truck full at a time. The bell tower on the church was finished in 1937. It was built in the poorest community of Tulsa which at that time were called the derogatory name, \"The River Rats\". The Pastor, CP Williams and his wife Mary, a graduate of Tulsa University, also founded a 4 year accredited Apostolic College and K-12 school located from 55th to 56th and Peoria and encompassed the whole block back to Quincy Place. The tall white buildings had been salvaged from Ft. Sill and put back together from men of the church, and students of the college. The college and school were active on that site until early 1960s. Both sites, the church on Nogales and the College on Peoria, are now low income housing projects. That small church and college community educated many ministers and missionaries, many of whom were women who started schools and churches in many foreign countries as far away as post war Japan and China. CP and Mary Williams started a church on 4th street and North Utica and their son, John D Williams was pastor when Urban Renewal took the land of the old rock church. They merged the Utica and Nogales churches. They helped the church buy and renovate the old Carbondale Assembly of God church on the corner of 48th Street and 38th West Ave which thrived, through 1960s through 1980s. Many of the Pentecostal and Apostolic churches in the USA and foreign missions are in someway connected to that church, college or school.\n\nParagraph 3: Early on in the eleventh Century, the Catholic Church declared Muslims, specifically Moors, infidels as a way to unite all of Christendom around a single cause. Heston states that \"The Church in Rome [the Catholic Church] and other Christians to the north envied the prosperity of southern Spain\" which was controlled primarily by Moors. There were multiple military campaigns in the eleventh century, primarily in Aragón and Castile, aimed at driving Moors off of the continent they had occupied since the eighth century. These actions were led by the Church and shifted from battles to a full blown crusade. They also served as a precursor to the Crusades to the Holy Land, which began in 1095, as well as the Inquisition. During the First Crusade, Pope Urban II actively worked to divert forces from Jerusalem to al-Andalus, calling the Moors a \"threat\" and arguing that they needed to be driven off their lands. In the 1100s, Urban II offered indulgences to men who were willing to fight on the peninsula, but only when Christian states were in extreme danger. This was an incentive that was offered to crusaders who \"taken the cross\" for the Holy Land. Additionally, only people from the peninsula itself or from neighboring lands were supposed to be diverted from their original purpose. In the 1200s, fighting crusades in the Baltics and al-Andalus was \"thought to merit the same rewards as fighting in the Holy Land.\" As a result, many were given indulgences for fighting \"infidels\" in these regions where it had not been allowed in the previous century. The inability of crusaders to keep Jerusalem under Christian control prompted many to blame outside groups for the losses instead of their own (lack of) military might, which led to the Inquisition. There were three different monastic groups for whom the Inquisition became their \"special responsibility.\" In 1209, the Cathars began overseeing the Inquisition. That authority was then passed to the Dominicans in 1233, during which time the form of the Spanish Inquisition as it is known today was created. Specifically, it developed after the capture of Córdoba in 1236 which was during the Valencian Crusade. The Christians who conquered the town built a church on top of the mosque (the same one that al-Mansur had beefed up using pieces from the Church of St. James) as was a common practice at the time. They also forcibly converted Mudéjars and Jews who remained; those that converted were subject to suspicion and many were the victims of torture. Additionally, Christians viewed \"bathing as sacrilegious\" and destroyed bathhouses located around the region. In 1246, a year after the signing of the al-Azraq Treaty of 1245 and a year before the ensuing Mudéjar revolts, responsibility for the Inquisition was passed to the Franciscans. In 1492, Ferdinand and Isabella expelled all of the Jews from Spain, resulting in a large migration of Muslims and Jews who still practiced their faith, as well as those who had converted to Christianity, from the country. The last execution for heresy in Spain took place in 1826 and the Inquisition did not end until 1834.\n\nParagraph 4: In November 1840 Rose was sent, as one of a group of British military advisers, to Syria with the local rank of colonel to assist General Omar Pasha, commander of the Ottoman Army, who was seeking to secure the expulsion of the forces of Mehemet Ali from Syria during the Egyptian–Ottoman War. Rose served as deputy adjutant-general on Pasha's staff at the Battle of El Mesden in January 1841 and then became senior British officer on Pasha's staff later that year. He became British consul-general for Syria and Lebanon in August 1841 and found himself preventing feuds between the Maronites and Druzes. On one occasion in 1841, he rode between them at imminent risk to his life and by the sheer force of a stronger will stopped the conflict. On another occasion he rescued 700 American missionaries from Mount Lebanon and took them to Beirut walking himself all the way so that his horse could be available to old women. He transferred to the diplomatic service in January 1848 and Lord Palmerston appointed him secretary of the embassy at Constantinople in January 1851. He became chargé d'affaires in the absence of Sir Stratford Canning during a diplomatic crisis over Russian demands that they be allowed to give protection over all Christians in Turkey. He so strengthened the hands of the Ottoman Porte that the Russian attempt to force a secret treaty upon Turkey was foiled. He was promoted to brevet colonel on 11 November 1851.\n\nParagraph 5: Of the 12 crewmen in the bow of the airship, only three survived. Four of these 12 men were standing on the mooring shelf, a platform up at the very tip of the bow from which the forwardmost landing ropes and the steel mooring cable were released to the ground crew, and which was directly at the forward end of the axial walkway and just ahead of gas cell #16. The rest were standing either along the lower keel walkway ahead of the control car, or else on platforms beside the stairway leading up the curve of the bow to the mooring shelf. During the fire the bow hung in the air at roughly a 45-degree angle and flames shot forward through the axial walkway, bursting through the bow (and the bow gas cells) like a blowtorch. The three men from the forward section who survived (elevatorman Kurt Bauer, cook Alfred Grözinger, and electrician Josef Leibrecht) were those furthest aft of the bow, and two of them (Bauer and Grözinger) happened to be standing near two large triangular air vents, through which cool air was being drawn by the fire. Neither of these men sustained more than superficial burns. Most of the men standing along the bow stairway either fell aft into the fire, or tried to leap from the ship when it was still too high in the air. Three of the four men standing on the mooring shelf inside the very tip of the bow were actually taken from the wreck alive, though one (Erich Spehl, a rigger) died shortly afterwards in the Air Station's infirmary, and the other two (helmsman Alfred Bernhard and apprentice elevatorman Ludwig Felber) were reported by newspapers to have initially survived the fire, and then to subsequently have died at area hospitals during the night or early the following morning.\n\nParagraph 6: CharactersDashti The narrator and the writer of the \"Book of a Thousand Days\", fifteen-year-old Dashti leaves the plains where she was raised to find work in a nearby city after her mother passes away.  As a person from the plains, she is looked down on as a \"mucker\", a low-class citizen, by nobility.  However, she accepts the role of becoming the lady's maid of Lady Saren, abiding by her oath of service to follow Saren even as she is imprisoned for seven years in a tower.  Describing herself as thin, with skinny ankles, worn-out hands, long black hair, and with birth marks, or what she calls \"blotches\" on her face and hands, Dashti is revealed to be a resilient and resourceful young woman.  The strength of her will and spirit allows her and Saren to survive in the tower and go on living after their escape, and Dashti's knowledge of songs of healing soothe the damaged spirits of those close to her.  She is deathly loyal to Lady Saren, seeing it as her duty to her ancestors and the gods she worships.Lady SarenSixteen-year-old Saren is the third child of the ruler of Titor's Garden, who regarded her as a worthless and ugly brat.  Her unusually vehement refusal to marry Lord Khasar, claiming that she is betrothed to Khan Tegus, results in her imprisonment in a tower with only one maid for company for the next seven years.  Dashti astutely perceives that Saren's lack of self-esteem and nervous disposition are the results of a deep-rooted sickness within Saren's heart and gradually helps her heal.  Though she is initially afraid of everything and easily jealous, she comes to trust Dashti as a true friend.Khan Tegus The ruler of the Song of Evela, one of the Eight Realms.  A suitor of Lady Saren, he bravely visits her in the tower where she is imprisoned, though because of Saren's fright, Dashti impersonates her to convey what she believes as Saren's feelings for the Khan.  When his visits abruptly cease and Dashti and Saren escape the tower, the two young women manage to find their way to the Song of Evela, with Dashti hoping to reunite Saren and Tegus.  However, Tegus and Dashti eventually fall in love.Lord Khasar The brutal ruler of the Thoughts of Under, who demanded Saren as a bride.  A powerful warlord seeking to conquer the Eight Realms, he possesses a terrifying secret that Saren learned and has fearfully kept hidden.Lady Vachir The ruler of Beloved of Ris who becomes engaged to Khan Tegus when he believed that Saren had perished with the destruction of Titor's Garden.

The southbound side of I-395 has no access to northbound US 1 here. I-395 crosses East Potomac Park (exit 2) and a second bridge, the Francis Case Memorial Bridge over the Washington Channel. Here, the route bends from a generally northeast direction to a due east direction, interchanging (exit 3) with the 9th and 12th Street Expressways, two tunnels that carry traffic under the National Mall. A series of complex interchanges (numbered 4, 5, 6, and 7) provide partial access to Maine Avenue and C Street Southwest, as well as connections to I-695. Immediately after I-695, the freeway makes a hard turn to the due north to follow the 3rd Street Tunnel immediately under Union Square, just to the west of the US Capitol building and underneath the Frances Perkins Building. I-395 follows a depressed roadway (the Center Leg Freeway), which was placed underground in 2019, that has three more partial interchanges (exits 8, 9, and 10) with local streets before terminating at New York Avenue/US 50.\n\nParagraph 8: Due to formation of the women's aviation regiments by Marina Raskova, Sholokhova was drafted into the military in December 1941. Like other members of the 587th Bomber Aviation Regiment, she underwent additional training at Engels Military Aviation School in Saratov, initially on the obsolete Su-2 bomber, before later retraining to fly the more advanced Pe-2 dive bomber. Due to the amount of training needed to fly the Pe-2, the regiment did not deploy to the frontlines until 1943. Initially posted as a flight commander, she soon began to accumulate a tally of combat sorties before being badly wounded in battle during a mission over Kuban on 2 June 1943. Flying in a squadron of nine Pe-2 dive bombers with Yevgeniya Timofeeva as squadron commander, they were soon confronted by German fighters as they approached their targets. The Soviet fighter escort fought off the first wave of German fighters, but three of the bombers were heavily damaged from anti-aircraft fire, including Timofeeva's, who radioed to Sholokhova to transfer command of the squadron to her, who went on to boldly dodge attacks from a second wave of Messerschmitts in order to complete the mission. Despite losing one engine and sustaining severe injuries to the head and jaw from the ordeal of fighting with the Messerschmitts, she went on to bomb the target before proceeding to lead her crippled plane to friendly territory to make an emergency landing. Upon landing, despite being weakened by her injuries, she made sure the rest of her crew was safe, and helped the gunner-radio operator Stepan Tsidrikov get out of the plane while navigator Valentina Volkova was able to climb out. Soon they were rescued and brought to a field hospital, but it was not until 1944 that Sholokhova was released from the hospital and allowed to return to flying combat missions. That year, she was promoted to deputy commander of the first squadron, which was led by Nadezhda Fedutenko, who had become the squadron commander. Earlier, the regiment had been honored with the guards designation and renamed as the 125th Guards Bomber Aviation Regiment. In December 1944, Sholokhova shocked pilots from the Normandie-Niemen regiment when she safely landed her Pe-2 during a blizzard at the airfield they were based at; while the French pilots had heard of the Soviet women combat pilots who piloted the simple Po-2 as a night bomber, but had no idea that women flew the highly advanced and formidable Pe-2 dive bomber that many male pilots had difficulty mastering. In April 1945 she was nominated for the Order of Alexander Nevsky, a medal for leadership in combat awarded only to officers; her award nomination sheet cited her 55 sorties in the war as well as various feats in combat, including how she twice replaced the squadron commander during the battles for East Prussia as well as a flight on 20 April in which a rod on her left engine broke while returning to their airbase yet she skillfully maneuvered the plane to make a safe landing, saving the plane from having to be written off. Later that month the award nomination was approved, and she became one of only nine women of the Soviet Union to receive the Order of Alexander Nevsky.\n\nParagraph 9: Zhengding (), originally Zhending (), is a county in southwestern Hebei Province, North China, located approximately  south of Beijing, capital of China. It is under the administration of the prefecture-level city of Shijiazhuang, the capital of the province, and has a population of 594,000. Zhengding has been an important religious center for more than 1,000 years, from at least the times of the Sui dynasty to the Qing dynasty. It is the founding place of several major schools of Chan Buddhism. However, many former religious building complexes have been severely damaged throughout history.  A noted temple is the Longxing Monastery, where the historical building ensemble has been preserved almost intact. Furthermore, four famous pagodas, each with its own architectural style, are still standing.\n\nParagraph 10: Portrayed by Dillon Casey, Sean Mason Pierce is a Lieutenant Commander in the U.S. Navy and SEAL Team Six operator, with a considerable reputation and record. His mother, Oversight member Senator Madeline Pierce contracts him as an agent at Division, sending him to keep an eye on Amanda. When Sean met Alex, he thought of her as a traitor and completely untrustworthy. Later, after seeing her in action, he acts as a mentor to Alex—reminding her to see past her own mission in life to bring down Semak. Due to his background, he has a code of honor and is determined to never leave a man behind, unlike Division—something Alex quickly comes to respect. Sean was originally dedicated to terminating Nikita and her team due to their actions endangering his mother, and to this end began seducing Alex as he was aware she was still connected to the rogue agent. In \"Clean Sweep\", however, Sean and his mother are both saved by Nikita when the rest of Oversight is killed, and so they team up with Nikita, Michael, and Alex in the hopes of destroying Division. Sean works with Nikita and the others, and his relationship with Alex gets closer after his mother's death (an event that was completely devastating to him—but he gained some sense of comfort after personally killing the assassin, who worked for Percy). Sean and Alex share their first kiss in \"Dead Drop.\" In the Season 2 finale, Sean and Alex begin a romantic relationship. In Season 3, their relationship becomes strained when Sean sees Alex isn't distancing herself from Division, and her continued service was endangering her life. Sean briefly left her, not wanting to witness another person he loved die due to their connection to Division, and it resulted in Alex going off the rails and relapsing into drug use. Later, however, Sean returned to save her life, realizing how much he needs her, and so the two become sexually active. Amanda targets Sean due to his place as a member of Nikita's team, and so destroys his life—after assassinating CIA Director Morgan Kendrick with a car bomb, Amanda frames Sean for the assassination, making it look like a delusively paranoid Sean killed Kendrick and his Navy therapist as revenge for the CIA's assassination of his mother. Efforts to clear Sean fail, forcing Division to fake his death. Sean was then forced to remain at Division, his sisters believing him dead and the public believing him a murderer and traitor. In \"Broken Home\", Sean was involved in the mutiny at Division, and after a gunfight, succumbed to internal bleeding and died in Alex's arms.", "answers": ["Paragraph 5"], "length": 3608, "dataset": "passage_retrieval_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "6c7f1f61caca40be72b7fb9e4a04ab71251506686722806c"}

Over time, Amfilohije's views on the West shifted, and he began distinguishing between a \"bad\" secular Europe and a \"good\" anti-secular Europe.

After the Ninth Doctor (Christopher Eccleston) arrives at Jackie's flat in search of Rose, Jackie attempts to seduce him. She is later attacked by shop window dummies but is saved when Rose and the Doctor destroy the alien consciousness able to control plastic. When Rose returns to London, twelve months have passed; in the intervening year Jackie had organised a missing person campaign to search for her daughter and accused Rose's boyfriend Mickey Smith (Noel Clarke) of murder. She also suspects the Doctor of being an internet predator. She learns the truth about Rose's new life after battling the Slitheen and being present with Mickey as he organises a missile strike to destroy the aliens. The episode \"Father's Day\" depicts two younger versions of Jackie also played by Coduri. It is shown that whilst Rose was a child (Julia Joyce) Jackie told her idyllic stories of her deceased father, Pete (Shaun Dingwall). Rose attends her parents' marriage, in which Pete is unable to recite Jackie's full name, Jacqueline Andrea Suzette Prentice, and after then travelling ahead to 1987, learns that her father was a failed entrepreneur and that her parents' marriage had been stormy; Jackie suspects Pete is an adulterer and also threatens him with divorce. In the 2005 series finale, \"The Parting of the Ways\", Jackie is glad to have Rose home after the Doctor returns her to the 21st century from the far future in order to protect her. She is persuaded to help return Rose to save the Doctor after Rose mentions her encounter with her father, reminding Jackie that he would try anything rather than give up.\n\nParagraph 2: The film received mostly positive reviews. Peter Travers of Rolling Stone wrote that the film \"runs on pure emotion\", and \"celebrates the mysterious power of a music that can make you feel like dancing and bring you to your knees\". Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times wrote that the film's \"story is as old as the movies, but The Mambo Kings is so filled with energy, passion and heedless vitality that it seems new, anyway\". Ebert and his colleague, Gene Siskel, gave the film a \"Two Thumbs Up\" rating on their syndicated television program, Siskel and Ebert and the Movies. Rita Kempley of The Washington Post praised the film's director, writing that \"Glimcher shows an epicure's taste in his choice of both cast and crew. The look of \"The Mambo Kings\" is doubtless richer than the text, which is, however, strengthened by Glimcher's nostalgia for the teenage, eager America of the 1950s\". Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly wrote, \"The Mambo Kings is most fun when it practically dares you to swoon. It's a movie you don't have to believe to enjoy\". Betty Goodwin of the Los Angeles Times praised the film's visual style: \"The innocence of the pre-MTV '50s mambo scene is expressed through meticulously real details and honest styling\".\n\nParagraph 3: Rabbi Joshua and Rabbi Eliezer differed about when the events took place in , where it says, \"In the sixth hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, on the seventeenth day of the month.\" Rabbi Joshua taught that the events of  took place on the seventeenth day of Iyar, when the constellation of the Pleiades sets at daybreak and the fountains begin to dry up. Because the generation of the Flood perverted its ways (from the way of creation), God changed for them the work of creation and made the constellation of the Pleiades rise at daybreak. God took two stars from the Pleiades and brought the Flood on the world. Rabbi Eliezer, however, taught that the events of  took place on the seventeenth of Cheshvan, a day on which the constellation of the Pleiades rises at daybreak, and the season when the fountains begin to fill. Because the generation of the Flood perverted its ways (from the way of creation), God changed for them the work of creation, and caused the constellation of the Pleiades to rise at daybreak. God took away two stars from it and brought the Flood on the world. If one accepts the view of Rabbi Joshua, then one can understand why  speaks of the \"second month\" (to describe Iyar, because  describes Nisan as the first month, and Iyar follows Nisan). If one accepts Rabbi Eliezer's view, the \"second month\" means the month that is second to the Day of Judgment (Rosh Hashanah, which  recognizes as the beginning of a year when it says, \"The eyes of the Lord are upon it (the Land of Israel) from the beginning of the year\"). If one accepts Rabbi Joshua's view, the change in the work of creation was the change in the constellation and the waters. If one accepts Rabbi Eliezer's view, the Gemara asked what change there was in the natural order (as the constellation usually rose at that time and that time of year is usually the rainy season). The Gemara found the answer in the dictum of Rabbi Hisda, when he said that with hot passion they sinned, and with hot waters were they punished. The Rabbis taught in a Baraita that the Sages of Israel follow Rabbi Eliezer in dating the Flood (counting Rosh Hashanah as the beginning of the year) and Rabbi Joshua in dating the annual cycles (holding that God created the world in Nisan). The scholars of other peoples, however, follow Rabbi Joshua in dating the Flood as well.\n\nParagraph 4: These figures, seemingly incongruous especially after the issues caused by the 2021 I-40 bridge closure which forced all traffic crossing the river at Memphis (including trucks) to use this bridge, may be explainable by way of the routing of I-40, I-55 and U.S. 78 (supplanted in part by I-22 and its connecting freeway I-269) thru the Memphis area, as well as the locations of major distribution and transportation hubs in the area ranging from the FedEx Express \"super hub\" at Memphis International Airport to regional grocery warehouses operated by Kroger  and Associated Wholesale Grocers . Despite the U.S. Supreme Court's landmark 1971 decision in Citizens to Preserve Overton Park v. Volpe that led to the cancellation of I-40's originally planned route thru Overton Park (which in part dictated the location of the I-40 bridge), the advantages of I-40 as a cross-country interstate proved to be undeniable; thus the I-40 bridge is used by long-haul truckers & other cross-country travelers, as well as by commuters from Arkansas going to & from jobs in downtown Memphis which is generally closer to that bridge. Meanwhile, most Memphis area distribution and transportation hubs are in the southern part of Memphis and its Mississippi suburbs such as Southaven and Olive Branch, with ready access to I-55 via such routes as I-240 across south Memphis (not to be confused with the I-240 in north Memphis that became I-40 after the Overton Park cancellation), U.S. 78, I-22 and I-269; thru truck traffic to & from Birmingham, Alabama and points east (such as Atlanta) also flows thru Mississippi & south Memphis via U.S. 78, I-22, I-269 and I-55. Finally, though both I-40 and I-55 go thru Memphis, they actually cross in West Memphis, Arkansas and not Memphis proper; the rerouting of I-40, along with both the original and current designs of its interchange with I-240 west of Overton Park, do not facilitate high volumes of trucks from the south seeking to use the I-40 bridge. Thus, it is generally easier for trucks going between Memphis (as well as Birmingham via U.S. 78 / I-22) and points west of Memphis, ranging from Arkansas grocery stores all the way to Los Angeles, to use this bridge to reach I-40 at West Memphis rather than the I-40 bridge itself, on top of the expected traffic using I-55 (and in some cases I-57 further north) to reach St. Louis, Chicago and other major Northern cities.\n\nParagraph 5: The Talmud recounts the story of her last day during the Siege of Jerusalem (AD 70). (Talmud Gittin 56a.) At that time, Martha sent her manservant out to bring her some fine flour, but it had sold out. After that, the manservant is repeatedly sent out to buy the next-lesser quality of flour (white flour - dark flour - barley flour) only to find it sold out as well. Finally, the desperate woman went out to see if she could find anything to eat without even putting on her shoes, but stepping in some dung, she died of shock. According to Rashi, the reason for her death was the feeling of extreme disgust that gripped her until she died because of her delicacy. Rabban Johanan ben Zakkai thus applied to her the Biblical verse, \"The tender and delicate woman among you who would not adventure to set the sole of her foot upon the ground.\" ()The second opinion holds that, while walking down the street, she saw figs on the floor, and began to eat, and died. These figs were those of Rabbi Zadok, who fasted for 40 years so that Jerusalem would not be destroyed by the Romans and when he wanted to restore himself, they used to bring him a fig, and he used to suck the juice and throw the rest away.Martha felt in these figs that he sucked them because of his sickness, you tasted his sickness and because she did get sick and soon after died. (Talmud Gittin 56a.) When Martha was about to die, she brought out all her gold and silver and threw it in the street, saying, \"What is the good of this to me\", thus giving effect to the verse, \"They shall cast their silver in the streets.\" ()  (Talmud Gittin 56a.)\n\nParagraph 6: The Baháʼí Faith in Pakistan begins previous to its independence when it was part of India. The roots of the Baháʼí Faith in the region go back to the first days of the Bábí religion in 1844 especially with Shaykh Sa'id Hindi – one of the Letters of the Living who was from Multan. During Baháʼu'lláh's lifetime, as founder of the religion, he encouraged some of his followers to move to the area. Jamal Effendi visited Karachi in 1875 on one of his trips to parts of Southern Asia. Muhammad Raza Shirazi became a Baháʼí in Mumbai in 1908 and may have been the first Baháʼí to settle, pioneer, in Karachi. National coordinated activities across India began and reached a peak by the December 1920, first All-India Baháʼí Convention, held in Mumbai for three days. Representatives from India's major religious communities were present as well as Baháʼí delegates from throughout the country. In 1921, the Baháʼís of Karachi elected their first Baháʼí Local Spiritual Assembly. In 1923, still as part of India, a regional National Spiritual Assembly was formed for all India and Burma which then included the area now part of Pakistan. From 1931 to 1933, Professor Pritam Singh, the first Baháʼí from a Sikh background, settled in Lahore and published an English-language weekly called The Bahaʼi Weekly and other initiatives. A Baháʼí publishing committee was established in Karachi in 1935. This body evolved and is registered as the Bahaʼi Publishing Trust of Pakistan. In 1937, John Esslemont's Baháʼu'lláh and the New Era was translated into Urdu and Gujrati in Karachi. The committee also published scores of Baháʼí books and leaflets in many languages. The local assemblies spread across many cities and in 1957, East and West Pakistan elected a separate national assembly from India and in 1971, East Pakistan became Bangladesh with its own national assembly. Waves of refugees came from the Soviet Union invasion of Afghanistan and the Islamic Revolutionin Iran and later from the Taliban. Some of these people were able to return home, some stayed, and others moved on. In Pakistan the Baháʼís have had the right to hold public meetings, establish academic centers, teach their faith, and elect their administrative councils. However, the government prohibits Baháʼís from traveling to Israel to have Baháʼí pilgrimage. Nevertheless, Baháʼís in Pakistan set up a school and most of the students were not Baháʼís. as well as other projects addressing the needs of Pakistan. And the religion continues to grow and in 2004 the Baháʼís of Lahore began seeking for a new Baháʼí cemetery. The World Christian Encyclopedia estimated over 78,000 Baháʼís lived in Pakistan in 2000 though Baháʼís claimed less than half that number.\n\nParagraph 7: The girls' field hockey team won the North Jersey II Group II state sectional championships in 1990, 2001, 2003–2005, 2007, and 2015; won the North II Group I titles in 1994, 1997, 2016, and 2017; won the North I Group I titles in 1995, 2000 and 2006; and won the North I Group II sectional titles in 2009 and 2014. The team won the Group I state championship in 1995, and the Group II titles in 1997, 2003, 2009, and 2015. The program's five state titles are tied for ninth-most in the state. The 1997 team finished the season with a 21–0–3 record after finishing the season by winning the Group I state title by defeating Haddonfield Memorial High School by a score of 2–0 in the championship game. In 2003, the field hockey team won the Group II state championship with a 5–1 win over Pequannock Township High School in the semifinals and a 2–1 win against Allentown High School in the tournament's final match. In 2007, the field hockey team won the North II, Group II state sectional championship with a 4–2 win over Hackettstown High School (which like Madison, is now part of the new Northwest Jersey Athletic Conference) in the tournament final. In 2009, the field hockey team finished the season ranked 4th in the state by The Star-Ledger, having won the North II, Group II state sectional championship, the Morris County Championship (for the 4th consecutive year), the NJAC Conference Championship, and, most notably, the Group II state championship with a 3–1 win against Bishop Eustace Preparatory School. In 2015, under coach Ann Marie Davies, the field hockey team won the NJAC title, Morris County Tournament, North II Group II state sectional title, and the Group II state title with a 5–0 win against Wall High School. The field hockey team won the 2015 Morris County Tournament with a 2–1 win against West Morris Mendham High School in the tournament final, winning the team's fifth consecutive county title and their 21st overall.\n\nParagraph 8: This property is most relevant in chemistry, when amounts of substances are often specified in moles rather than by mass or volume. The molar heat capacity generally increases with the molar mass, often varies with temperature and pressure, and is different for each state of matter.  For example, at atmospheric pressure, the (isobaric) molar heat capacity of water just above the melting point is about 76 J⋅K−1⋅mol−1, but that of ice just below that point is about 37.84 J⋅K−1⋅mol−1. While the substance is undergoing a phase transition, such as melting or boiling, its molar heat capacity is technically infinite, because the heat goes into changing its state rather than raising its temperature.  The concept is not appropriate for substances whose precise composition is not known, or whose molar mass is not well defined, such as polymers and oligomers of indeterminate molecular size.\n\nParagraph 9: The novel is fundamentally the story of five months in the lives of David Bourne, an American writer, and his wife Catherine. It is set mainly in the French Riviera, specifically in the Côte d'Azur, and in Spain. The story begins with their honeymoon in the Camargue, then moves to Spain, then back to France (at a \"long low rose-colored Provençal house where they had stayed before... in the pines on the Estérel side of la Napoule\" (within easy driving distance to Cannes). However, early in the book, Catherine seemed to change (from David's point of view—the novel is entirely from his vantage). While at le Grau du Roi, Catherine announces \"I have a big surprise\", but does not tell David what it is other than to hint \"Oh it's very simple but it's very complicated\" and \"...I'm going to be changed.\"  She bicycles into town, then returns with \"Her hair... cropped as short as a boy's.\" Later, that night, she tells him \"Don't call me girl.\" and \"Please love me David the way I am.\" and implies that he is changing also (\"You are changing,\" she said. \"Oh you are. You are. Yes you are and you're my girl Catherine.\")\n\nParagraph 10: Due to his opposition toward Milošević, Amfilohije for a short time found common ground with Milo Đukanović when in 1997 the Democratic Party of Socialists of Montenegro (DPS) became divided into pro- and anti-Milošević groups. Amfilohije gave blessings to Đukanović when he became Montenegrin president in January 1998. Over time, as Đukanović advocated for an independent Montenegro, a rift emerged in their relationship and Amfilohije became a strong critic of the Montenegrin president. Attempts to alleviate ecclesiastical tensions resulted in Đukanović and Prime Minister Igor Lukšić asking Amfilohije to become part of the MOC, a move that is unachievable as the MOC lacks recognition and is considered heretical by other Orthodox churches. In the late 1990s, Amfilohije, as head of the Montenegrin metropolitanate, was in charge of 160 clergy such as priests, monks and nuns that provided religious service to more than 90% of parishes and monasteries within Montenegro. In the mid-2000s, Amfilohije commented and made critical statements regarding the integration of Serbia into the European Union. Amfilohije opposed dialogue and was anti-ecumenical in relation to the Catholic Church. In the late 20th century, Amfilohije gave support to nationalists and radical anti-Westerners and in the early twenty first century he had devoted his efforts toward dialogue between the Orthodox and Catholic churches. During February 2003, Amfilohije was head of a SOC delegation that visited Vatican City and German Catholic media reported that he invited the Pope to Belgrade, later denied by the SOC. Exposed to Catholic influence, Amfilohije has shifted his position about the \"evil essence\" of people in the West and has begun to distinguish between a \"bad\" secular and \"good\" anti-secular Europe. Amfilohije has promoted and advocated for the concept of \"theo-democracy\" without going into the specifics of the idea as a possible opposition toward liberal democracy. Amfilohije's views remain distant from a liberal perspective and as such, Klaus Buchenau states, he cannot be labelled a \"pro-Westerner\". In 2005 Amfilohije urged Radovan Karadžić, who evaded capture from the ICTY indictment, to give himself up.", "answers": ["Paragraph 10"], "length": 3225, "dataset": "passage_retrieval_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "7a85ca09f913abf631ad11da35f0322fa04019e6413f0eaf"}
{"input": "The text discusses the size and arrangement of magnetotactic crystals, which are crystals found in bacteria that allow them to orient themselves according to Earth's magnetic field. The crystals range in size from 30 to 120 nanometers, which is optimal for their magnetotactic abilities. Smaller crystals are not as efficient and larger crystals can form magnetic domains in opposing directions. Some magnetotactic bacteria have magnetosomes (clusters of magnetotactic crystals) that deviate from the ideal chain-like arrangement. These non-ideal arrangements may serve additional functions related to metabolism, although these functions are currently unknown.", "context": "Paragraph 1: ABN AMRO, Albert Heijn, Shell, Vroom & Dreesmann and KLM were contractually confirmed as anchor partners during the summer and the Air Miles programme launched via a massive advertising campaign in October 1994. The program enjoyed immediate success, with millions of Dutch households enrolling into the program before year's end. More than a dozen additional retailers also joined the Air Miles program just prior to --- or within a year --- following the launch. These included Praxis, Etos, Gall & Gall, Blokker, Hunkemoller, Videoland and several others. Similar to other Air Miles programs, Air Miles in the Netherlands originally included flights. But it also added a handful of other travel and leisure rewards. The initial rewards were KLM, Center Parcs, NS (Dutch Rail), Stena Line, Efteling and Noorder Dierenpark Emmen. In 1998, the reward program was expanded to include a wide-ranging catalogue of merchandise redemption options. The program's popularity later waned starting in 2004, when ABN AMRO ceased its participation. Albert Heijn subsequently limited its issuance of Air Miles just to private-label products to allow for greater product discounting via its Bonus Card program. At Shell gas stations, customers can choose between Air Miles or stamps. Currently Air Miles has over 3.8 million active users, making it the largest loyalty program in the Netherlands.\n\nParagraph 2: T. R. Miller High School has had success in several athletic programs, especially since the mid-1980s. The men's basketball team brought home a mythical state championship in 1952, which is to date the only championship the boys basketball program has won. The athletic program most closely identified with the school is the football team. The Tigers currently have six football state championships (1969, 1984, 1991, 1994, 2000, and 2002.)  Most of the success had been under the helm of    T. R. Miller graduate turned head coach Jamie Riggs. Under Riggs the Tigers won four state titles. The T. R. Miller football team was considered to be \"the winningest football team of the 1990s\" in the State of Alabama. In 2015, Riggs won his 300th coaching victory, becoming one of only four coaches in the state to achieve that milestone. On December 14, 2015, Riggs announced his retirement. On January 25, 2016, Riggs announced that he would put off his retirement until a suitable candidate for the position was found. On February 29, 2016, it was announced that Andrew Thomas of Trenton High School in Florida would take over as head football coach and athletic director effective April 1, 2016. Thomas resigned after a 5–5 season in 2017 which TRM failed to make the playoffs for the first time since 1983. On Dec. 22, Keith Etheredge was hired as the new coach for the Tigers. Etheredge comes to TRM from Pell City where he coached two years. He is most known for his winning ways at Leeds High School, outside Birmingham. After one season at Miller Coach Etheredge left and was replaced by Coach Brent Hubbert. His first season at Miller, Hubbert coached the Tigers to the state semifinals. The Tiger track program has won numerous state championships over the last twenty years, most recently in 2009, 2010, and 2011, and the Lady Tiger basketball team brought home state titles in 1995, 1996, 2002, and 2009. T. R. Miller also has a successful baseball team under head coach Kevin Madden, softball team under head coach Haley Lynch, volleyball team under coach Terry Lynne Thompson, tennis teams under head coach Teralyn Kast, golf team under head coach Benson Stonicher, and swim team under head coach Lisa Atkinson.\n\nParagraph 3: Alvarez attended several US military schools including Ranger, Special Forces and the Corps of Cadets at Texas A&M University, where he had the distinction of being the first cadet to receive commission in a foreign army. During Alvarez’s career he has been awarded several medals and recognitions including the Honduran Army Combat Medal, Commendation Medal, US Special Forces School Achievement Medal and Special Recognition from the US State Department, FBI and DEA. Mr. Alvarez has a BA in political science from Texas A&M University and has attended the School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS) taking courses on International Relations and Security Studies.\n\nParagraph 4: Magnetotactic crystals range anywhere in size from 30 nanometers to 120 nanometers. This size allows them to be magnetically stable and to help optimize the MTB ability toward magnetotaxis. The single domain crystals have the maximum possible magnetic moment per unit volume for a given composition. A smaller size would not be as efficient to contribute to the cellular magnetic moment, the smaller size crystals are superparamagnetic, therefore they are not continuously magnetic. Crystals exceeding 120 nanometers can form magnetic domains in opposition to the desired direction. While a single magnetosome chain could appear to be ideal for magneto-aerotaxis, a number of magnetotactic bacteria have magnetosomes or magnetosome arrangements that depart from the ideal. A reported example includes large magnetosomes (up to 200 nanometers) found in coccoid cells in Brazil. These cells contain enough magnetosomes that the calculated magnetic dipole moment of the cell is about 250 times larger than that of a typical Magnetospirillum magnetotacticum. Some bacteria have magnetosomes that are not arranged in chains, but the magnetosomes are clustered on one side of the cell. In this arrangement, the shape anisotropy of each crystal provides the stability against remagnetization, rather than the overall shape anisotropy in the magnetosome chain arrangement. These non-ideal arrangements may lead to additional, currently unknown functions of magnetosomes; possibly related to metabolism.\n\nParagraph 5: Eva Jessye (January 20, 1895 – February 21, 1992) was an American conductor who was the first black woman to receive international distinction as a professional choral conductor. She is notable as a choral conductor during the Harlem Renaissance. She created her own choral group which featured widely in performance. Her professional influence extended for decades through her teaching as well. Her accomplishments in this field were historic for any woman. She collaborated in productions of groundbreaking works, directing her choir and working with Virgil Thomson and Gertrude Stein on Four Saints in Three Acts (1933), and serving as musical director with George Gershwin on his innovative opera Porgy and Bess (1935).\n\nParagraph 6: Waiyaki Wa Hinga, was the son of Kumale ole Lemotaka, a Maasai whose family had sought refuge in Muranga, most probably during the Lloikop wars. Due to his Maasai background, Kumale ole Lemotaka was given the name Hinga by the Kikuyu. This name, meaning dissembler, was given to those who lived amongst Kikuyus but spoke the Maa language, or those who had lived among Maasais before. Waiyaki Wa Hinga was the owner of a large Agikuyu fort at the frontier of Kikuyu country. Upon encountering the Imperial British East Africa Company, he was genuinely interested in establishing and cementing ties with them. We see this when Waiyaki welcomes Frederick Lugard, and gives him land so hat he can set-up a fort. However, there was a mis-understanding right from the very beginning on which position Waiyaki held in Kikuyu society. British officials understood him to be the \"Paramount Chiefs of the Agikuyu\". However, Kikuyus did not have paramount chiefs in their political system; Waiyaki was a Kikuyu Muthamaki (singular) out of the many influential athamakis (plural). In Kikuyu society, a muthamaki was a spokesman, the chairman of a territorial unit and leader of his age-set. Athamakis were the first or leading personalities among peers; their role was highly controlled by their fellow peers. Given this, Waiyaki Wa Hinga did not hold the most superior position amongst Kabete Kikuyus. He had no powers to make a treaty that affected the welfare of the community, nor even control the warriors, which Waiyaki tried to do a number of times when he soldiers wanted to attack the company. So when there were constant mis-understandings between the Company and the Kikuyu community at Lugard’s Fort, any retaliation by the Kikuyu community to the Company was not done so at Waiyaki’s command. In 1892, a quarrel between him and Purkiss leads to his death. This is after an expedition to punish Kikuyus of Githinguri for killing Maktubu, a worker of the Imperial British East Africa Company, fails. Purkiss is angry with Waiyaki as it was him who warned the community. Waiyaki feared his cattle would be impounded together with those of the culprits who had murdered Maktubu. A row flared between him and Purkiss. Waiyaki was then wounded in the head with his own sword, which he had drawn to attack Purkiss with. Due to this, Waiyaki is taken to Mombasa to be tried under IBEACo. Unfortunately, he never reached Mombasa: he died and was buried at Kibwezi en route to the kenyan coast. Waiyaki Way in central Nairobi is reportedly named after him.\n\nParagraph 7: Bernard Black is a grumpy, drunken, cynical, pessimistic, and at times depressive Irish misanthrope, whose sole pursuits in life appear to be drinking, smoking, reading, and insulting people. His assistant Manny implies that Bernard does not have a heart, referring to it as \"just a shard of ice\". His only other friend Fran, however, has \"always seen it as a piece of flint\". Bernard's role as the owner of the bookshop 'Black Books' is an interesting vocational choice when one takes into account the fact that he hates both the pressures and responsibilities involved in retail, as well as his customers, with extreme passion. To Bernard, the purchasing of his books is indeed a very bad thing, as it means he will have to take the time to order more from \"the place where you order books from for when you want to sell them in your bookshop\". This is a process capable of reducing him to genuine despair, and he is willing to pay people to take the second hand books they bring to sell him away from the shop so that he doesn't have to catalogue and sell them again. Despite his disdain of the process of retail, he displays an appreciation for the medium in which he deals – when asked at one point if the binding on a set of the collected works of Charles Dickens is real leather, he counters with \"They're real Dickens\" – and on numerous occasions displays a fondness for the shop itself, demonstrating a defensive reaction to Manny's suggestions for improvement on his first day at work (\"It is a lovely place!\") and refusing to leave it for anything further than two minutes' walking distance away,'Party', Black Books episode six, series three, although this could in fact be related to his apparent distaste for anything but the most limited of human contact. However, Bernard has been shown to physically mistreat books, using a cookery book featuring an empty plate on the front cover as a substitute plate when expanding the shop into a restaurant and ripping out the last chapters of a book when a customer tries to buy it for fifty pence under the asking price. Despite his apparent fondness for the shop, he doesn't appear to have much faith in it – such as an instance in one episode, when a customer asked for a certain book, Bernard replied, \"How should I know? Go to a proper book shop!\". Bernard has even once displayed physical violence toward a customer after he was asked to find a book for the customer. The unfortunate man was forced to his knees and coldly informed, \"from where you are now to that corner is our music section\", before being savagely kicked and ordered to search. He then inadvertently locks said customer in the shop for 2 weeks while noisy construction is occurring next door, and the customer emerges at the end of Bernard, Manny, and Fran's holiday, happy to have found his book, but driven mad by the noise next door.\n\nParagraph 8: Diverted while en route, Albemarle anchored in the harbor at San Juan, Puerto Rico, on the morning of 28 February, and that afternoon received the official call of Rear Admiral Raymond A. Spruance, Commandant of the 10th Naval District. That same day, she embarked 91 men from Patrol Squadron (VP) 51 and VP-61 from VP-52 for temporary duty and transportation, and sailed for Norfolk on the morning of 2 March. While en route, Commander Mullinnix was relieved as commanding officer by Commander H. B. Sallada. Albemarle moored at Pier 7, Naval Operating Base (NOB), Norfolk, on the afternoon of 5 March, but lingered there for less than a day, getting underway the following afternoon for Philadelphia. She returned to the Philadelphia Navy Yard and spent the rest of March there, undergoing post-shakedown repairs. The seaplane tender departed Philadelphia on 6 April, and arrived back at Norfolk the following afternoon; there she took on board depth charges and depth bombs. She sailed for Newport on the morning of 10 April, and soon after standing out into international waters past the Virginia Capes, met her escort for the trip – six \"flush-deck\" destroyers, one of which was the ill-fated . That afternoon she fueled two of her escorts,  and  at the same time, the former to starboard, the latter to port.\n\nParagraph 9: Pasek was born in Węgrzynowice (now in Tomaszów Mazowiecki County) in 1636, to Marian Władysław Pasek and Jadwiga Pasek (née Piekarska) a petty noble family. Jan was their only child and a very much beloved son. Pasek attended a Jesuit school at Rawa. He later enlisted in the army at age 19 and for 11 years he was a soldier in the Polish military, where he initially fought in the campaigns under Hetman Stefan Czarniecki, for whom he had great respect, against the Swedish Empire during the Swedish invasion of Poland (potop szwedzki) and the 1657 Hungarian invasion of Southern Poland led by George Rákóczi who had allied with the Swedish forces. In 1658 his division under Czarniecki was sent to aid the defence of Denmark where he took part in the capture of Als and the storming of Koldinghus castle. During his time in Denmark he nearly married a lady known as Eleanor of Croes Dyvarne, but instead decided to return to Poland with the rest of the army in 1659, a decision that was to personally trouble him for the rest of his life.\n\nParagraph 10: Southend settled into the Second Division, finishing in the top-half of the table in 1991–92, and Angell again finished as the club's top scorer with 23 goals and was named as the club's Player of the Year. The Roots Hall faithful continued to witness second-tier football in 1993–94, however Angell attracted interest from bigger clubs, and joined top-flight Everton on loan in September 1993 and again in January 1994. Despite Angell playing just one game in each spell, manager Mike Walker signed him for a fee of £500,000 on 21 January (£160,000 of this went to Stockport as part of a tribunal agreement made four years earlier). However Angell had just undergone major surgery on his left leg and was unable to play to his full potential so it proved to be a disastrous spell, his only goal in nineteen games for the \"Toffees\" being a tap-in against Chelsea. Neville Southall later said that \"the step up to the Premier League was probably too much for him\" and he \"had a first touch like a tackle\". Manager Joe Royle sold Angell to Sunderland for £600,000 in March 1995, where he was similarly unsuccessful. He played eleven games for the \"Black Cats\", scoring once in the League Cup at Preston. Manager Mick Buxton was sacked shortly after Angell arrived at the club, and he failed to impress new boss Peter Reid. He is widely regarded by fans of both Everton and Sunderland as one of the worst players to turn out for both of these clubs, where he failed to reproduce the form he showed in the lower divisions.\n\nParagraph 11: According to Peyrefitte, the scandal started with a failed blackmail attempt by d'Adelswärd's former servant demanding 100,000 francs in return for his silence. D'Adelswärd's mother refused to pay, so he went to the police. At the beginning, the police dismissed the allegations. But the story was later confirmed by another arrested blackmailer who was an intimate acquaintance of Albert François de Warren. Will Ogrinc reported that after investigating the French National Archives in 2003, he did not come across any documents about the failed blackmail attempt by d'Adelswärd's former valet, and that it was probably invented by Peyrefitte. In the court documents, the valet, whose name was Velpry, told investigators about the periodic visits of brothers Croisé de Pourcelet to d'Adelswärd's apartment, and that after one of their visits, he had found obscene photos and handkerchiefs stained with semen on the table. He also claimed that he had let d'Adelswärd's mother know about it and quit his job. Some documents mention that d'Adelswärd was blackmailed by several rent boys with whom he had relations. The dossier mentions the names of six rent boys: Beret, Boscher, twenty-one-year-old Kothé, Lefebvre, nineteen-year-old Leroy, and fifteen-year-old Verguet, though there is no mention as to which of them might have been the blackmailer.\n\nParagraph 12:  On 17 May 2004, a De Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter Series 300 collided with the sea-wall of runway 18 at Ibrahim Nasir International Airport after experiencing problems taking off from the seaplane base at Hulhule, adjacent to the international airport. Both pilots and one passenger were seriously injured in the accident. The aircraft, SN 434, was written off. Subsequently, SN 434 was rebuilt by Viking Air Limited to serve as the technical demonstrator (proof of concept) aircraft for Series 400 Twin Otter development.  It flew again as a Series 400 prototype in the fall of 2008, and is currently registered as C-FDHT.", "answers": ["Paragraph 4"], "length": 3059, "dataset": "passage_retrieval_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "67f2724f91d6268e2ce088bf931eed87b81f44d4f975e420"}
{"input": "The text discusses the phenomenon of \"quilling,\" which is when a locomotive engineer uses the valve to control the flow of steam through a whistle, allowing them to play it like a musical instrument. The frequency of the whistle increases with blowing pressure, and an experiment showed that increasing steam pressure drove the whistle to a higher pitch. Pitch deviations in the whistle's frequency are likely caused by velocity differences in the steam jet downstream from the aperture. The text also mentions that frequency can vary with differences in temperature and blowing pressure. Industrial steam whistles are typically operated within a specific pressure range, and excessive pressure can cause the whistle to produce odd harmonics. The text also mentions that the length of the whistle affects the number and amplitude of harmonics produced. The harmonic profile of a whistle can also be influenced by aperture width, mouth cut-up, and lip-aperture offset.", "context": "Paragraph 1: Immediately prior to performing a powerful movement the body instinctively performs an isometric preload: this generates force in the muscles which adds to the power of the subsequent dynamic movement. A fundamental element of this preloading is an isometric press action. An everyday example is when a person gets up off a chair. The person raises their posterior off the chair and forms an isometric press, involving the downward force of their torso onto their bent legs, which push upwards with an equal amount of force. From this point the person then stands up. The isometric press which was generated by the torso and the legs helped them to preload their muscles so as to aid the subsequent move to stand up fully. A more dynamic example of this process can be found in a vertical jump. In this case, the jumper crouches down, generates an isometric press involving the downward force of their torso and the upward force of their bent legs, before powering upwards into the jump. Isometric presses may also be adapted to suit sports specific requirements, such as in boxing. Here, a boxer may position their bodyweight primarily over their bent lead leg before throwing a lead hook. The force generated by the isometric press, involving the downward force of the torso and the upward force of the lead leg, is channelled into the subsequent punch making it more powerful. In athletic events such as sprinting, deliberate apparatus, called starting blocks, are used so the sprinters can perform a more powerful isometric press and channel this additional power into their first strides forwards: this ability to perform an enhanced isometric press allows them to start faster. Isometric presses may be performed faster or slower and in a variety of different ways but all perform the same role of isometrically preloading the muscles so a subsequent dynamic movement can be performed more powerfully. For this reason, isometric presses feature strongly in sports and athletics. The force they can generate can be increased and their instinctive use can be encouraged through the training of the respective actions required to form them (e.g. knee raises, sit-ups, squats, jumps) and the associated musculature (e.g. glutes, thighs, hamstrings, core). In terms of a person's direct utilisation of isometric presses as a power generation method, this is achieved as part of their instinctive and intuitive performance of isometric preloads, and their further deliberate intensification of them.\n\nParagraph 2: The Isuzu VehiCROSS (UGS250) is a compact SUV from Isuzu. Produced from 1997 through 2001 (Japanese market 1997–1999; US market 1999–2001), it shares many of its components with the Trooper, including both its 3.2 L and 3.5 L V6 engine that produces  at 5400 rpm and  of torque at 3000 rpm. The vehicle also features the Torque on Demand (TOD) 4-wheel-drive system produced by BorgWarner. It is a small, sporty 2-door crossover vehicle with aggressive external styling, including short overhangs, an aggressive forward stance, titanium \"teeth\" in the grille, a black hood-insert, and black plastic cladding over the entire lower half of the vehicle. The US VehiCROSS came equipped with 16\" polished wheels in 1999 and 18\" chrome wheels during the remainder of production. The Japanese version came equipped with 16\" alloys with chrome center caps.\n\nParagraph 3: No Wo ambassador, for example, came to China during the second century. This interval continued well past the third century. Then within merely nine years, the female Wo ruler Himiko sent four ambassadors to the Wei court (220-265) in 238, 243, 245, and 247, respectively. After the death of Himiko, diplomatic contact with China slowed. Iyoo, the female successor to Himiko, contacted the Wei court only once. The fourth century was another quiet period in China-Wo relations except for the Wo delegation dispatched to the Western Jin court (265-316) in 306. With the arrival of a Wo ambassador at the Eastern Jin court (317-420) in 413, a new age of frequent diplomatic contact with China began. Over the next sixty years, ten Wo ambassadors called on the Southern Song court (420-479), and a Wo delegation also visited the Southern Qi court (479-502) in 479. The sixth century saw only one Wo ambassador pay respect to the Southern Liang court (502-557) in 502. When these ambassadors arrived in China, they acquired official titles, bronze mirrors, and military banners, which their masters could use to bolster their claims to political supremacy, to build a military system, and to exert influence on southern Korea. (Wang 2005:221–222)\n\nParagraph 4: The hall would originally have had a central hearth, with the smoke rising through the hall to a vent in the roof, examples can be seen at Stokesay Castle and Ludlow Castle. Later chimneys were added, and it would then have one of the largest fireplaces of the palace, manor house or castle, frequently large enough to walk and stand inside.  The hearth was used for heating and also for some of the cooking, although for larger structures a medieval kitchen would customarily lie on a lower level for the bulk of the cooking.  Commonly the fireplace would have an elaborate overmantel with stone or wood carvings or even plasterwork which might contain coats of arms, heraldic mottoes (usually in Latin), caryatids or another adornment. In the upper halls of French manor houses, the fireplaces were usually very large and elaborate. Typically, the great hall had the most beautiful decorations in it, as well as on the window frame mouldings on the outer wall. Many French manor houses have very beautifully decorated external window frames on the large mullioned windows that light the hall. This decoration clearly marked the window as belonging to the lord's private hall. It was where guests slept.\n\nParagraph 5: Prior to their formation, David Jones, the main songwriter in Enemy You, recorded several releases with his pop punk band After School Special on Mutant Pop Records. The group never toured or played a show, but still had a small dedicated following. In 1997, Enemy You was formed and began rehearsing together. They were heavily inspired by Bad Religion and other melodic punk acts. After Enemy You began writing tunes together as a band they received interest from Ben Weasel and his fledgling label, Panic Button Records. Weasel would often call Fat Wreck Chords, and heard about the band through Chris, who was the bassist for Enemy You, and an employee at Fat Wreck Chords. This led to their debut appearance on the four-way split dubbed Four On The Floor alongside Screeching Weasel, Teen Idols and Moral Crux. This was followed by their debut album, Where No One Knows My Name, in 1999. Based on the album's success the band was asked to open for a number of notable punk bands including Bouncing Souls, Lagwagon, Bad Religion, T.S.O.L., Mad Caddies, and NOFX. The band released a 7-inch on the Fat Club series on Fat Wreck Chords. They followed that with an 1980s-themed seven inch EP that came out on Geykido Comet Records, titled \"Video to Radio.\" Geykido Comet Records re-released the EP in 2017, with all the proceeds going to suicide prevention. Around this time, guitarist, Ken Yamazaki, started to play guitar for the Hardcore punk band, Western Addiction. He still stayed with Enemy You, though. In 2005 the band released their second album, Stories Never Told on Red Scare Industries. David was friends with label owner, Toby Jeg, and the label also eventually re-released [Where No One Knows My Name. Enemy You then signed with Nitro Records. Their third studio album, Fade Away was released as an iTunes Store exclusive on December 2, 2008, after being shelved for a few years. Vocalist David Jones committed suicide in March 2015.\n\nParagraph 6: Band agent Wally Jones sends telegrams to members of a band he represents, which is presently \"between engagements;\" leader Earl Gordon is blowing bugle at a race track, singer Linda Farrell is selling tickets at a movie theater, harpist Michelle O'Toole is working as a hat-check girl and other band members are playing golf. They are all instructed to go to Centerville, where Wally has arranged for them to audition for the Titan Tire Company's president, Mr. Gillingwater, who wants new talent for his company's radio show. When the band arrives in Centerville, however, they are told by Wally that Gillingwater has hired Benny Goodman instead. Although they have hotel rooms for the night, they are low on cash and contrive to get a free meal at a \"Magonnagle for Governor\" political rally. The small crowd pays paying little attention to the candidate until Earl and the band start playing, so Magonnagle hires the band to accompany him on the rest of his campaign tour. Magonnagle is running with the slogan, \"A Vote for Magonnagle Is a Vote for the Common Man,\" but has little hope of beating the political machine that is backing corrupt, incumbent Governor Quilby. Composer Allen Clark shows up at one campaign stop, wanting to sell the band a song he has written. Earl buys the song for Linda, but Allen really wants to join the band as a singer. Wally finally hires him, partly to help carry his girl friend Michelle's harp. At one rally, Magonnagle is too drunk to speak and Allen delivers a brief pitch on his behalf. Mark Dwyer, a member of the corrupt State Campaign Committee decides to drop the ineffectual Magonnagle and instead run Allen as a candidate to avoid accusations of fraudulent election practices. Allen doesn't want to be involved, but Wally convinces him that it would be good exposure for his singing talents. Dwyer then introduces Allen to several political appointees, who are all cronies of his, and dupes him into signing continuing \"appointments\" for them. Allen does so, as he, too, fully expects Quilby to win. After Allen and Linda fall in love, Gillingwater asks the band to join his radio show, and Wally negotiates a thirty-nine-week contract at $10,000 per week. To Allen's surprise and distress, however, the polls indicate that he could win the election. Despite further inducements from the political machine, Allen wants to quit, but Dwyer threatens to break them all by revealing the phony \"appointments.\" To protect them, Allen dismisses the band. Magonnagle then returns and tells Linda about the political crooks backing Allen, and thinking that Allen has become one of them, she leaves with the band. In his closing campaign speech, prompted by Magonnagle, Allen denounces Dwyer and his political machine. Linda and the band hear Allen's speech on their bus's radio and return to help him escape from Dwyer. With Allen safely on board, the bus is pursued by police. When the police finally catch up with the bus, they inform Allen that Quilby has conceded the election to him. His friends convince Allen that he can be both governor and radio singer.\n\nParagraph 7: Ordered to Kentucky and duty at Camp Wickliffe, Kentucky, until February 1862.

In 1730, the Virginia House of Burgesses passed the Warehouse Act, which required inspectors to grade tobacco at 40 different locations.  This led to much development at the Falls of the James.  Seven years later, in 1737, William Mayo laid out the original street plan for the town of Richmond, on land provided by Colonel William Byrd II of nearby Westover Plantation.  Mayo divided the town into four-lot thirty-two squares, and immediately outside of town limits there were larger plots of land which were to be sold as the future sites for suburban villas. The name came from Richmond, England. In 1741, Henrico Parish Church (affiliated with the Church of England) was built in the present day neighborhood of Church Hill, the oldest neighborhood in the city, overlooking downtown Richmond, Shockoe Bottom and Shockoe Slip.  The First Great Awakening impacted the area in the 1740s, leading Samuel Davies to be sent from Pennsylvania in 1747 to lead  and minister to religious dissenters in Hanover County, Virginia. He eventually helped found the first presbytery in Virginia (the Presbytery of Hanover), evangelized slaves (remarkable in its time), and influenced young Patrick Henry who traveled with his mother to listen to sermons. Richmond was chartered as a town in 1742. By 1768, William Byrd III had squandered the family fortune and resorted to a public lottery to raise money for his debts.  He auctioned off large lots of still-undeveloped Byrd family land in the Richmond region.\n\nParagraph 9: The Iowa, Chicago and Eastern Railroad (IC&E)  was a Class II railroad operating in the north central United States. It has been controlled by the Canadian Pacific Railway and operated as a part of its system since October 30, 2008. Formerly, the IC&E was jointly owned with the Dakota, Minnesota and Eastern Railroad by Cedar American Rail Holdings (CARH), making the combined system the largest class II railroad in the United States. Created by the purchase of I&M Rail Link, IC&E commenced operations on July 30, 2002. The  line, based in Davenport, Iowa, serves the states of Illinois, Iowa, Missouri, Minnesota and Wisconsin. Principal commodities include chemicals, coal, steel, automobiles, and agricultural products. Train dispatching is performed at a joint DM&E/IC&E facility in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. On December 26, 2008, the IC&E was merged into parent CARH, which immediately merged into the DM&E.\n\nParagraph 10: Blowing pressure – Frequency increases with blowing pressure, which determines gas volume flow through the whistle, allowing a locomotive engineer to play a whistle like a musical instrument, using the valve to vary the flow of steam. The term for this was “quilling.” An experiment with a short plain whistle reported in 1883 showed that incrementally increasing steam pressure drove the whistle from E to D-flat, a 68 percent increase in frequency. Pitch deviations from the whistle natural frequency likely follow velocity differences in the steam jet downstream from the aperture, creating phase differences between driving frequency and natural frequency of the whistle. Although at normal blowing pressures the aperture constrains the jet to the speed of sound, once it exits the aperture and expands, velocity decay is a function of absolute pressure. Also, frequency may vary at a fixed blowing pressure with differences in temperature of steam or compressed air. Industrial steam whistles typically were operated in the range of 100 to 300 pounds per square inch gauge pressure (psig) (0.7 - 2.1 megapascals, MPa), although some were constructed for use on pressures as high as 600 psig (4.1 MPa). All of these pressures are within the choked flow regime, where mass flow scales with upstream absolute pressure and inversely with the square root of absolute temperature. This means that for dry saturated steam, a halving of absolute pressure results in almost a halving of flow. This has been confirmed by tests of whistle steam consumption at various pressures. Excessive pressure for a given whistle design will drive the whistle into an overblown mode, where the fundamental frequency will be replaced by an odd harmonic, that is a frequency that is an odd number multiple of the fundamental. Usually this is the third harmonic (second overtone frequency), but an example has been noted where a large whistle jumped to the fifteenth harmonic. A long narrow whistle such as that of the Liberty ship John W. Brown sounds a rich spectrum of overtones, but is not overblown. (In overblowing the \"amplitude of the pipe fundamental frequency falls to zero.\") Increasing whistle length increases the number and amplitude of harmonics, as has been demonstrated in experiments with a variable-pitch whistle. Whistles tested on steam  produce both even-numbered and odd-numbered harmonics. The harmonic profile of a whistle might also be influenced by aperture width, mouth cut-up, and lip-aperture offset, as is the case for organ pipes.", "answers": ["Paragraph 10"], "length": 3231, "dataset": "passage_retrieval_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "59054ee2c7da9a42a8f6b4009048079b71ed077a7b8a9cac"}
{"input": "The text discusses the career of a filmmaker named Otis Turner Boggs. In 1908, Boggs made a live travelogue presentation of L. Frank Baum's Oz story called The Fairylogue and Radio-Plays in Chicago. He then filmed one of the first motion pictures completely made in Los Angeles, called In the Sultan's Power. Boggs later traveled to California and Oregon for location shoots. He eventually returned to Los Angeles and set up a satellite studio for Selig. Boggs played a role in launching the careers of several actors and actresses, including Hobart Bosworth, Robert Z. Leonard, Art Acord, Betty Harte, Bessie Eyton, Bebe Daniels, and Roscoe \"Fatty\" Arbuckle. Boggs worked with Arbuckle on four short films and gave him his first movie role in Ben's Kid in 1909.", "context": "Paragraph 1: Martin returns to Walford to support Sonia on the evening of her Fat Blasters' Christmas party, but arrives late and discovers she has collapsed due to complications with a gastric band she got in Bulgaria. Sonia tells Martin that she had the operation as she felt he was not attracted to her any longer and he later recognises that they do not love each other and they separate, with Martin returning to Dagenham. Martin returns to Walford for the wedding of his cousin Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt). He, Stacey Slater (Lacey Turner) and Kush Kazemi (Davood Ghadami) discover Nick's dead body at number 23 (recreating the first ever scene of EastEnders). After agreeing not to speak of the matter, they discover that Nick's mother Dot Branning (June Brown) has called the police and confessed that she has killed him. After walking Stacey home, he tries to kiss her but she rejects him. He later returns while Ian and his wife Jane Beale (Laurie Brett) are on their honeymoon, staying at their house and catches Cindy Williams (Mimi Keene) having sex with Liam Butcher (James Forde) and decides to keep an eye on her. He manages to convince his and Sonia's daughter, now calling herself Bex (Jasmine Armfield) to come to Walford, where she reveals her new look as a Goth. He also attends Donna Yates' (Lisa Hammond) birthday party with Kush and their friends from football. He tries to kiss Donna for a bet but ends up getting into a fight with Arthur \"Fatboy\" Chubb (Ricky Norwood). He also confides in Kush that he thinks he and Sonia could get their marriage back on track but then spots Sonia kissing her new girlfriend, Tina Carter (Luisa Bradshaw-White). He later argues with Sonia in The Vic after revealing the truth about her and Tina and tells Bex that Sonia is a lesbian, making her reject Sonia. After Martin and Sonia have a meaningful conversation about their relationship, he sends Bex to live with Sonia. It is later revealed that Martin is homeless and sleeping in the back of his van. Alfie Moon (Shane Richie) tells Ian of Martin's troubles and Martin moves in with Ian and later tells Sonia that he has lost their house in Dagenham. After filing for divorce, Martin rents a flat with Stacey and her daughter Lily Slater (Aine Garvey) and they start dating, which gets serious despite Stacey's lingering feelings for Kush. Their relationship progresses as Martin and Sonia's divorce comes through and Martin researches bipolar disorder.\n\nParagraph 2: In Chicago in 1908, he made The Fairylogue and Radio-Plays, which had its writer, L. Frank Baum, present a slide show and films as a live travelogue presentation of his Oz story. In March 1909, he returned to the west coast, where he filmed In the Sultan’s Power, one of the first motion pictures completely made in Los Angeles. He left Los Angeles in April to go on location in Yosemite and Oakland in California and the Hood River Valley in Oregon. In October, Boggs returned to Los Angeles and rented a small bungalow in the Edendale district as a permanent base from which he operated a west coast satellite studio for Selig. Other East Coast studios soon began filming on the west coast to take advantage of its moderate climate. Among people Boggs started in the film industry were actor-director Hobart Bosworth, actor-director Robert Z. Leonard, cowboy star Art Acord, and actresses Betty Harte, Bessie Eyton, and Bebe Daniels. (The Sergeant, a Western short in Yosemite produced and directed by Boggs and written and starring Bosworth, was released in September 1910.) He also gave Roscoe \"Fatty\" Arbuckle his first movie work, 1909's Ben's Kid, and made four short films with him. \n\nParagraph 3: The collection contains 126 long and short pieces of verse in its present form.  This number is included in the recension of al-Anbari, who received the text from Abu 'Ikrima of Dabba, who read it with Ibn al-A‘rābī, al-Mufaḍḍal's stepson and inheritor of the tradition. We know from the Fihrist of Ibn al-Nadim (d. ca. 988 AD) that the original book, as transmitted by Ibn al-A‘rābī, contained 128 pieces and began with the poet Ta’abbaṭa Sharran Thābit ibn Jābir; this number agrees with the Vienna manuscript, which includes an additional poem, poems annotated by al-Anbari, al-Muraqqish the Elder, etc., and a poem by al-Harith ibn Hilliza. The Fihrist states (p. 68) that some scholars included more and others fewer poems, while the order of the poems in the several recensions differed. It is noticeable that this traditional text, and the accompanying scholia, as represented by al-Anbari's recension, derive from al-Mufaddal's fellow philolgists of the Kufan school.  Sources from the rival school of Basra claimed however that al-Mufaddal's original dīwān ('collection') was a much smaller volume of poems. In his commentary (Berlin MS), Ahmad ibn Muhammad al-Marzuqi gives the number of original poems as thirty, or eighty in a clearer passage,; and mentions too, that al-Asma'i and his Basran grammarians, augmented this to a hundred and twenty. This tradition, ascribed by al-Marzuqi and his teacher Abu Ali al-Farisi to Abu 'Ikrima of Dabba, who al-Anbari represented as the transmitter of the integral text from Ibn al-A'rabi, gets no mention by al-Anbari, and it would seem improbable as the two schools of Basrah and Kufah were in sharp competition. Ibn al-A'rabi in particular was in the habit of censuring al-Asma'i's interpretations of the ancient poems. It is scarcely likely that he would have accepted his rivals' additions to the work of his stepfather, and handed them on to Abu 'Ikrima with his annotations.\n\nParagraph 4: The extensive system of tunnels and conduits have long been considered to help control climate inside the mound. The termite mound is able to regulate temperature, humidity and respiratory gas distribution. An early proposition suggested a thermosiphon mechanism. The heat created due to the metabolism of termites imparts sufficient buoyancy to the nest air to push it up into the mound and eventually to the mound’s porous surface where heat and gases exchange with the atmosphere through the porous walls. The density of air near the surface rises due to heat exchange and is forced below the nest and eventually through the nest again. This model was proposed for mounds with capped chimneys and with no large vents constructed by the species Macrotermes natalensis. A similar model based on the Stack effect was proposed for mounds with open-chimneys. The tall chimneys are exposed to higher wind velocities compared to openings at ground level due to surface boundary condition. Therefore, a Venturi flow draws fresh air into the mound through the openings at ground level which flows through the nest and finally out of the mound through the chimney. The flow is unidirectional in the stack effect model compared to the circulatory flow in the thermosiphon model.\n\nParagraph 5: Practices of craft or \"domestic arts\" have traditionally existed and been organized spatially within the private sphere. Therefore, the labor and production of craft was generally interpreted as unproductive female labor in the home, as it was never integrated into profit-making systems. Rather, it was marginalized and undervalued. As a result, women's significant and creative work in the private sphere—clothing the family, knitting blankets, weaving the loom—did not receive the same respect as male-dominated activity in the public realm. Furthermore, the patriarchy has been successful in claiming these domestic values for women and using it as a way to keep women in subservient roles. The rise of consumer-friendly crafts, including kits, transfers and readymade designs, has further diminished the status of craft and women's amateur practices. Women and craft have been excluded from the fine art world and as a result many women put their creativity towards craft practices. Craft was \"a universal female art from transcending race, class, and national borders. Needlework is the one art in which women controlled the education of their daughters and the production of art, and were also the critics and audience.\" Although practices of craft were spatially organized within the private sphere, women occasionally would organize groups to engage in these practices collectively. In these craft circles or meet ups women would not only share patterns and skills but also engage in conversation about their lives in the private sphere. These groups of women would discuss their lives and personal struggles encountered as women. This type of group discussion is a form of activism rooted in Consciousness raising that was key to Second-wave feminism as it helped to raise awareness about the types of oppression women were experiencing in their everyday lives.\n\nParagraph 6: Judge Archer was born in Anderson County, South Carolina in 1820 and attended the University of Virginia and studied law under Armisted Burt in Abbeville, South Carolina before he moved to Yazoo County, Mississippi in 1841, where he was admitted to the bar. In Yazoo County, Archer contracted malaria and moved to St. Joseph, Missouri in 1843 for his health. He was elected district attorney in 1848 and married the former Louise Martin that same year, but resigned in 1851 and they moved to California to improve his health. In California, the Archers first settled in Sacramento, then briefly in San Francisco before arriving at San Jose in January 1853.\n\nParagraph 7:  When the Moon Waxes Red (1991) When the Moon Waxes Red: Representation, Gender and Cultural Politics challenges patriarchal ideologies and feminist resistance to expand its terms to a multiply-marginalized subject. This collection of essays describes the position of a multi-hyphenated subject whose liminal and shifting existence should be used to disrupt and exceed existing ideology. The essays revolve around film theory, feminism, and Third World artists and critics. In the first section of the essays, Trinh critiques the tradition of documentary and its deceptive practices. She argues that documentaries about Third World countries exist to propagate a first-world, subjective truth. The film positions the documenters against the interviewees, creating a power dynamic in which the latter is made to depend on the former in order for their voices heard. Often, orientalism and patriarchy appear obscured in documentaries even while continuing to operate. In the second section of essays, Trinh questions other theorists and artists for confining the multi-hyphenated subject to certain categories. However, she also conceptualizes an interstitial space in which feminists of color can produce theory and criticism that questions traditional gender and race politics. She posits that subjects in this interstitial space should be able to produce new modes of thinking without recirculating previous positions of power. It is in this space that the Third World critic is simultaneously part of the culture and an outside observer of the culture. The critic in this space now must be able to produce new representations of ideology without falling on hegemonic ones. However, Trinh's own work must answer the same question of how one can create without circulating dominant ideology. In the third section of essays, she advocates for a non-binary opposition of politics against dominant ideology. Trinh warns the reader to \"solicit and sharpen awareness of how ideological patriarchy and hegemony work,\" especially when some artifacts still remain even with new representations of ideology.\n\nParagraph 8: The surface of the Moon is covered with lunar regolith, a mixture of fine dust and rocky debris made by meteorite impacts, considered the soil of the Moon. Astronauts found few rock samples to pick up on mature regolith surfaces. The rocks had all been broken to fine soil by micrometeorite bombardment over the past billion years.  The bulk of lunar regolith is a fine gray soil, breccia and rock fragments of the local bedrock. Continuous attacks by micrometeorites further disintegrate and melt soil particles. This melt, mixed with lithic fragments, forms irregular clusters called agglutinates. Lunar soil is fine-grained, unconsolidated material that is poorly sorted and has high porosity (41-70%) and relatively low density (0-9-1.1 g/cm3) compared to its constituent particle density (2.9-3.2 g/cm3). The rock fragments found in Lunar paleosol grains vary in size (ranging from silt-sized grains to boulder-sized grains) and include fragments of highland anorthosite and mare basalt from meteorite impacts. Lunar paleosols also contain mineral grains that make up the largest fraction of silt-sized grains (0.06-0.03 mm) in the soil since the crystals in lunar basalts are fine-grained. Paleosols found on the Moon contain many plagioclase and pyroxene minerals (ranging from a few to 40%). Olivine minerals are present but occur much more sporadically and rarely than these other minerals. Grains of ilmenite, spinel, metallic particles of kamacite and taenite, phosphide (schreibersite), and sulfide (troilite) have also been found in Lunar paleosols. However, they are also much less common than plagioclase and pyroxene. A third soil component found in Lunar paleosols, along with rock fragments and mineral grains, are glass particles, of which there are two main kinds: homogeneous glasses and agglutinates. Homogeneous glasses are variable in size (<2 μm-2 cm) and are typically found as dumbbell or teardrop-shaped glass particles. These particles are hypothesized to have formed as volcanic ash or melted rock that resulted from the heat released from meteoroid impacts. Agglutinates are inhomogeneous glass-bonded aggregates that are variable in size (<2 μm-1 mm) and are described as irregular masses of glass and crystals. These glass particles are cemented together by bridges of glassy cement between the minerals and rock fragments and are usually ring or bowl-shaped in appearance, much like a crater. Ring or bowl-shaped agglutinates form from the outward spreading of impact melt that cemented surrounding soil grains. Less common or distinct agglutinate shapes are known to form from the cementation of scattered drops of impact melt or parts of agglutinates that have broken from later impacts. Lunar paleosols closely resemble the parent material in chemical and physical composition. Although these paleosols form more physically than chemically, chemical processes on the Moon have formed thin (20-50 μm) amorphous rings in the soil resulting from the local cooling of vapor from meteoroid impacts. These impacts have created an enrichment of silica (Si) and sulfur (S) and depletion in magnesium (Mg), calcium (Ca), aluminum (Al), and titanium (Ti).  Lunar exploration has found all essential minerals for growth of plants in sufficient quantities. Organic matter in the form of amino acids have been detected in lunar samples from the Apollo missions, but isotopic and molecular evidence of these compounds suggests terrestrial contamination as the source.\n\nParagraph 9: The film, released on DVD in 2014 as part of a boxset also containitng Melancholie der Engel (2009) and Reise nach Agatis (2010), deals with the everyday life of a man, Carsten (), who works on the set of the 2004 Ulli Lommel film Zombie Nation. At the same time, he is planning to realize his own film, a task he finds extremely difficult. First, he tries to place casting ads in a supermarket. During his daily work on the film set, the man seems frustrated. Also, he is isolated in his private life, and spends his time by watching and masturbating to his opulent VHS film collection of homosexual rape pornography and films such as Cesare Canevari’s 1977 Gestapo’s Last Orgy, Dennis Donnelly's 1978 The Toolbox Murders, Werner Herzog’s 1974 The Enigma of Kaspar Hauser, Peter Schamoni’s 1976 , and Rino Di Silvestro’s 1976 Werewolf Woman, and tinkering with props for his own planned film. He also likes to read Astrid Proll’s works about Andreas Baader and Ulrike Meinhof and the writings of Eduard Mörike. In his spare time, he shoots photos of animal cadavers while playing with them, also partly collecting them to take home with him, as he seems to have sexual attraction to them, and rapes women (Martina Adora, Stefanie Müller, and Carina Palmer) in the woods while they urinate. He indulges in several disturbing sexual fetishes including defecating, urinating, necrophilia, bestiality, anal fisting, rape, murder, nose-picking, and other unspeakable acts. He is in regular contact with a prostitute, Patrizia (Patrizia Johann), who puts an enema into her anus and defecates into a bucket while placing the man onto a table, shoving her fist into his anus and pulling feces out of there while he is putting the bucket to his face. By telephone, he also stays in contact with Jesús Franco, , Peter Martell, and David Hess (who composed most of this film's score). After a while, he actually contacted a woman, Franziska (Alexandra Dumas), who read his advertisement in the supermarket. They arrange a meeting in the man's house. When he tells her what he is supposed to do in his film, the woman gets scared and wants to leave the house. Then, Carsten overwhelms her and kills her by strangling her with a telephone cord and beating her head. Afterwards, he films himself as he is sexually aroused by her corpse. He cuts her nipples off in graphic detail and uses his scalpel to cut the dead woman's clitoris off. He then takes the scalpel and peels the skin off one of her fingers and eats the pieces of dismembered skin. The film ends with a scene showing Carsten burning the same woman's body and going jogging, as in the first shot of this film.\n\nParagraph 10: In July 2010, the airline took delivery of an Embraer 135 with 37 seats and signed a lease on a second, thus adding jet aircraft to their fleet for the first time since the acquisition to replace their previously operated Embraer ERJ aircraft. They will be used mainly on charter services to central and Eastern Europe; however, they will also offer increased flexibility on the airline's scheduled services. Also in July 2010 the airline named one of their Jetstream 41 aircraft after the comedian Ken Dodd in celebration of the year anniversary of the start of scheduled services from Liverpool and Dodd's support shown in the region. In September 2010, it was announced that Eastern Airways had bought Air Southwest.

{"input": "The text discusses a painting called \"Still Life with Globe, Books, Sculpture, and Other Objects\" by an artist named van der Heyden. The painting is in the genre of Dutch still life and depicts vanitas symbols that represent the fleeting nature of life. It is influenced by the works of Dutch painter Gerard Dou, particularly his Allegorical Self-Portrait in a Studio. The objects in the painting reference the passion of contemporary scholars for collecting various objects and evoke both the contemplative life of art and philosophy, as well as the active life of trade and exploration with the New World. The painting also includes a map of fortifications, referencing the nation's founding myths and recent hostilities with France. Additionally, there is a Protestant Bible opened to the Book of Psalms, which likely references messages of wisdom, self-discipline, justice, and the vanitas theme of the painting.", "context": "Paragraph 1: The Isuzu VehiCROSS (UGS250) is a compact SUV from Isuzu. Produced from 1997 through 2001 (Japanese market 1997–1999; US market 1999–2001), it shares many of its components with the Trooper, including both its 3.2 L and 3.5 L V6 engine that produces  at 5400 rpm and  of torque at 3000 rpm. The vehicle also features the Torque on Demand (TOD) 4-wheel-drive system produced by BorgWarner. It is a small, sporty 2-door crossover vehicle with aggressive external styling, including short overhangs, an aggressive forward stance, titanium \"teeth\" in the grille, a black hood-insert, and black plastic cladding over the entire lower half of the vehicle. The US VehiCROSS came equipped with 16\" polished wheels in 1999 and 18\" chrome wheels during the remainder of production. The Japanese version came equipped with 16\" alloys with chrome center caps.\n\nParagraph 2: Music-specific neural networks exist in the brain for a variety of music-related tasks. It has been shown that Broca's area is involved in the processing of musical syntax. Furthermore, brain damage can disrupt an individual's ability to tell the difference between tonal and atonal music and detect the presence of wrong notes, but can preserve the individual's ability to assess the distance between pitches and the direction of the pitch. The opposite scenario can also occur, in which the individual loses pitch discrimination capabilities, but can sense and appreciate the tonal context of the work. Distinct neural networks also exist for music memories, singing, and music recognition. Neural networks for music recognition are particularly intriguing. A patient can undergo brain damage that renders them unable to recognize familiar melodies that are presented without words. However, the patient maintains the ability to recognize spoken lyrics or words, familiar voices, and environmental sounds. The reverse case is also possible, in which the patient cannot recognize spoken words, but can still recognize familiar melodies. These situations overturn previous claims that speech recognition and music recognition share a single processing system. Instead, it is clear that there are at least two distinct processing modules: one for speech and one for music.\n\nParagraph 3: Bert Ljung is the main character, the only son of optician Fredrik Ljung and bus driver Madelene (née Olsson). Bert starts as a 12-year-old child in the spring term of the 5th grade but later becomes a mischievous teenager discovering his own sexuality. From the book Berts första betraktelser, the readers can learn that Bert Ljung was born on February 21, 1976, but there are a lot of anachronisms, with the later books largely following a floating timeline. His family is also depicted in the books. In Berts bryderier, Bert tells the tale of his paternal great-grandfather Vladimir Livanov, who hailed from Saint Petersburg and made glasses, before building a raft and paddling with his hands and ending up in Gotland, where he married Beda (who dies on October 14 in Berts bravader). They had a son - Bert's paternal grandfather Stanislav Livanov, who after being teased for his name, changed his name at 18 to Sten Ljung. He married Märta Öberg, and they had two sons - Fredrik, and his younger brother Janne, who became a successful businessman in New York City. Janne visits Bert and his family over Christmas in Berts ytterligare betraktelser and again in Berts befrielse, and Bert visits him in NYC with family in Berts vidare betraktelser and on his own in Bert Babyface. His religious maternal grandmother Svea Olsson also makes a lot of appearances in the books. Bert plays the electric bass, sings and writes songs in the amateur rock band Heman Hunters (changed to Population Station Groovy WY in Berts befrielse and after a mistake made with posters, to 13 kor och en spann (13 Cows and a Bucket in Swedish) in Bert och beundrarinnorna). He also plays soccer for the amateur team Öreskoga-Kamraternas Idrottsförening, before quitting in Bert och beundrarinnorna. Bert is also interested in mopeds, which in Sweden, one is allowed to drive at 15. He gets a Crescent Trampis moped in Berts bekännelser, before selling it in Berts befrielse.\n\nParagraph 4: These receptor proteins are typically composed of at least two different domains: a transmembrane domain which includes the ion pore, and an extracellular domain which includes the ligand binding location (an allosteric binding site). This modularity has enabled a 'divide and conquer' approach to finding the structure of the proteins (crystallising each domain separately). The function of such receptors located at synapses is to convert the chemical signal of presynaptically released neurotransmitter directly and very quickly into a postsynaptic electrical signal. Many LICs are additionally modulated by allosteric ligands, by channel blockers, ions, or the membrane potential. LICs are classified into three superfamilies which lack evolutionary relationship: cys-loop receptors, ionotropic glutamate receptors and ATP-gated channels.\n\nParagraph 5: The section of current PA 34 between Mount Holly Springs and Carlisle was chartered as part of a private turnpike known as the Hanover and Carlisle Turnpike in 1812, connecting Hanover with Carlisle. This turnpike provided an improved trade link between the Cumberland Valley and Baltimore. When Pennsylvania first legislated routes in 1911, what is now PA 34 was designated as Legislative Route 41 between Gettysburg and Carlisle, Legislative Route 40 between Carlisle and New Bloomfield, and as part of Legislative Route 31 between New Bloomfield and Newport. PA 34 was designated in 1928 to run from US 15 (now US 15 Bus.) in Gettysburg north to US 11 in Carlisle along a paved road. The same year, the road between US 11 in Carlisle and PA 5 (now PA 274) Mecks Corner was designated as PA 33 while the road between Mecks Corner and US 22 (Juniata Parkway) east of Newport was designated as part of PA 5; the entire length of the road between Carlisle and Newport was paved. By 1930, Red Hill Road/Hunters Valley Road between Newport and US 11 south of Liverpool was an unnumbered unpaved road. In 1937, PA 34 was extended north from Carlisle to US 22 east of Newport, replacing the PA 33 designation between Carlisle and Mecks Corner and the PA 5 designation between Mecks Corner and Newport. In addition, Red Hill Road was paved between Newport and Bucks Valley Road. By 1941, Hunters Valley Road was paved between Cherry Road and US 11/US 15. The remainder of Red Hill Road/Hunters Valley Road was paved by 1960. In 1963, PA 34 was extended south from Gettysburg to US 15 near Fairplay, following the former alignment of US 15 after that route was moved to a bypass of Gettysburg. By 1966, the south end of the route reverted to its current location at US 15 Bus., with US 15 Bus. replacing the route to the south of Gettysburg. PA 34 was extended north from Newport to US 11/US 15 south of Liverpool in 1970.\n\nParagraph 6: In 1993, she had a supporting role in the Corey Haim-led teen comedy Just One of the Girls. She also appeared in the television thriller film The Substitute, in a supporting role. Parker portrayed Alice Ramsey in \"The Wrath of Kali\" (1995), a fourth-season episode of Highlander: The Series. She played the daughter of a lesbian military officer in the television film Serving in Silence (1995), opposite Glenn Close and Judy Davis. She also appeared in a minor role as a nurse in the Western Last of the Dogmen (1995), as well as the Lifetime holiday television film Ebbie (also 1995) playing the niece (and sister) of Susan Lucci's Scrooge character, in a modern retelling of Charles Dickens's A Christmas Carol. She then won a Gemini Award nomination for her performance in the Canadian television film Paris or Somewhere. The following year, Parker had her breakthrough portraying a necrophiliac medical student in Lynne Stopkewich's controversial film Kissed (1996). The film saw Parker win the Genie Award for Best Actress that year. Also in 1996, Parker appeared in an episode of the Canadian horror series Poltergeist: The Legacy, as well as Bruce McDonald's independent film Hard Core Logo, in which she portrayed an aspiring actress. In 1997, Parker starred as Chyna Shepard, a kidnap victim, in the television horror-thriller film Intensity, an adaptation of the Dean Koontz novel.\n\nParagraph 7: An example of his early works in this genre is the Still Life with Globe, Books, Sculpture, and Other Objects (c. 1670, Academy of Fine Arts Vienna).  This painting stands in a long tradition of Dutch still life paintings depicting vanitas symbols.  These symbols include not only hourglasses, skulls and smoking candles but also attributes of scholarship and intellectual inquiry assembled in an amateur collector's cabinet or the study of a humanist scholar.  This tradition is also found in the Dutch painter Gerard Dou's rare still lifes, which are considered an important influence on van der Heyden's still lifes.  Dou's Allegorical Self-Portrait in a Studio, which includes still life elements, has been identified as an important influence on this composition.  In particular, like in Dou's composition, van der Heyden's still life scene depicts a wide range of objects of an artistic as well as a scientific nature.  These objects reference the passion of contemporary scholars for putting together collections of miscellaneous objects.  The objects in van der Heyden's Still Life with Globe, Books, Sculpture, and Other Objects were apparently selected to evoke the two intellectual attributes of the active and contemplative life.  The contemplative life is the life of art, philosophy and theology while the active life is characterised by curiosity about the outside world and, in particular, the commerce with the New World in which the home country of van der Heyden was actively involved.  This world of trade is represented in the globe and atlas, as well as the imported products such as the Chinese silk cloth on the table, the Japanese lacquered box and the exotic animal (a South American iguana) suspended at the back of the composition.  The map on which the atlas is open is a plan of the fortifications of Bergen-op-Zoom.   These fortifications had been built during the Eighty Years War with Spain and had played an important role in achieving the first victories against the Spanish troops.  They thus referenced the founding myths of the nation. Van der Heyden may also have selected this map as a reference to the recent hostilities with France.  The same map is also included in two of his later still lifes.   In the lower right of the painting is a large Protestant Bible opened to the end of Het Boeck der Psalmen (Book of Psalms) at the chapter entitled PROVERBIA / Spreuken / SALOMONIS (Solomon's Proverbs).  It is likely that the artist intended to reference the messages in Solomon's Proverbs about wisdom, self-discipline and justice as well as the vanitas message, as one of the Proverbs states that only righteousness can deliver from death.\n\nParagraph 8: In December 1911, Heckel moved from Dresden to Berlin. Die Brücke was dissolved in 1913. Heckel volunteered for service in Berlin when the war broke out in 1914. Although he underwent a brief training period, he was ultimately rejected by the army for being too old. He then turned to the Red Cross, joining a hospital train in Flanders in March 1915 as a medical orderly. It was stationed successively in Roeselare, Ostend and Ghent. The platoon was assembled by Walter Kaesbach, a curator from the National Gallery of Berlin, and included painters such as Max Kaus, Otto Herbig and Anton Kerschbaumer, as well as the poet Ernst Morwitz. At a certain moment in Roeselare, Heckel found himself in the same hospital train as Max Beckmann. From May 1915 until the end of the war in November 1918, Heckel served in the Ostend emergency hospital. Housed in the railway station, it was home to a true artists’ colony. The orderlies painted, made woodcuts and read and discussed literature and poetry. They adorned the building with murals and window decorations and produced special works at Christmas. Heckel befriended James Ensor who invited him into his house and his studio. He also continued his artistic activities in Germany. On the home front, he established contacts with collectors and prepared for exhibitions. As a draughtsman, he made numerous sketches of the places he visited and the people he observed. But as a painter, the Flemish landscape and North Sea created the deepest impression, especially the sunlight penetrating the unusual cloud formations. \n\nParagraph 9: They formed the band in Ojinaga, Chihuahua in 1980 and later moved to Texas, and remain one of the oldest norteño bands still active today (Along with Conjunto Primavera, Los Tigres del Norte, Los Huracanes del Norte, and Conjunto Rio Grande). The band's name, \"Los Rieleros\", is based on work that some members did on the railroads of Pecos, Texas. Unlike many other norteño bands, the Rieleros del Norte use both saxophone and accordion in their music, creating a dual-instrument hybrid. All original members of the band are natives of Ojinaga, Chihuahua, a town from which many other Norteño-Sax bands originated.\n\nParagraph 10: Seed companies produce a huge range of seeds from highly developed F1 hybrids to open pollinated wild species. They have extensive research facilities to produce plants with genetic materials that result in improved uniformity and appeal. These qualities might include disease resistance, higher yields, dwarf habit and vibrant or new colors. These improvements are often closely guarded to protect them from being utilized by other producers, thus plant cultivars are often sold under the company's own name and protected by international laws from being grown for seed production by others. Along with the growth in the allotment movement, and the increasing popularity of gardening, there have emerged many small independent seed companies. Many of these are active in seed conservation and encouraging diversity. They often offer organic and open pollinated varieties of seeds as opposed to hybrids. Many of these varieties are heirloom varieties. The use of old varieties maintains diversity in the horticultural gene pool. It may be more appropriate for amateur gardeners to use older (heirloom) varieties as the modern seed types are often the same as those grown by commercial producers, and so characteristics which are useful to them (e.g. vegetables ripening at the same time) may be unsuited to home growing.", "answers": ["Paragraph 7"], "length": 2524, "dataset": "passage_retrieval_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "3a40d35c65b9ce79803469088ac7204019af121390116684"}
{"input": "The text describes the process of selecting a new Sultan for the Habr Yunis tribe after the death of Sultan Deriyeh. Sultan Deriyeh had eighteen sons, and there were disputes among different sections of the tribe about who should succeed him. The Ba Makahil initially claimed that Ismail and Hirsi were entitled to the position, but they were killed in fighting. The Ba Makahil then chose Nur, the son of Ahmed Aman, to be their Sultan. Meanwhile, the Baha Segulleh selected Awad Deriyeh, but he was also killed, leading them to choose Mattar, the son of Hirsi, as the next Sultan. The tribe eventually decided to hold a meeting to resolve the conflict, and after much discussion, they agreed to let the claimants toss a coin to determine the Sultan. Nur won the toss and became the Sultan of the Habr Yunis tribe.", "context": "Paragraph 1: Broughton was born in the City of Westminster, England. He was educated first at Queen Elizabeth's School, Barnet, then at The King's School, Canterbury, where he was a King's scholar. His fortunes turned from commerce to theology when he inherited a substantial sum, allowing him to study at Pembroke College, Cambridge. He graduated Bachelor of Arts (BA) as 6th wrangler in 1818 and was married 13 July that year to Sarah Francis (herself daughter of a priest, John Francis of Canterbury) at Canterbury Cathedral. Per tradition, he proceeded Master of Arts (MA Cantab.) five years later in 1823. He was ordained deacon on 15 February 1818 and priest on 17 May the same year, both times by John Fisher (bishop of Salisbury), at the Quebec Chapel, Marylebone (but on behalf of Brownlow North, Bishop of Winchester, in whose diocese Broughton served); he became a curate in Hampshire and later in Surrey where he was noticed by Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington, who materially assisted his prospects, including influence in Broughton being offered the Archdeaconry of Sydney.\n\nParagraph 2: Kobayashi made his return from injury on June 6, 2010, losing to Naomichi Marufuji in a GHC Junior Heavyweight Championship number one contender's match. On October 30, 2010, Kenta and Atsushi Aoki defeated Roderick Strong and Eddie Edwards in the finals of a tournament to win the 2010 Nippon TV Cup Junior Heavyweight Tag League. As a result, Kenta and Aoki received a shot at the GHC Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship, but were defeated by the champions, New Japan Pro-Wrestling representatives Koji Kanemoto and Tiger Mask, on November 23, 2010. On January 29, 2011, Kenta turned heel and join the Disobey stable with members Muhammad Yone, Yoshinobu Kanemaru and Genba Hirayanagi. Kenta would change his look and attitude. Then on March 5, he turned on Yone, removing him from the group. One week later, he renamed the stable No Mercy. On May 25 Kenta and Yoshinobu Kanemaru defeated Atsushi Aoki and Kotaro Suzuki of the ANMU stable to win the vacant GHC Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship. After months of trying to persuade his mentor Yoshihiro Takayama to join No Mercy, on June 26 Takayama turned on his partner Takuma Sano during a tag match against Kenta and Kanemaru and became the fourth member of the group. Kenta and Kanemaru would then make it to the finals of the Junior Tag League on July 30. They lost to Atsushi Aoki and Kotaro Suzuki. Then on August 18, 2011, Kenta and Yoshihiro Takayama won the Noah 2 Day Tag Team Tournament. On August 24, Kenta and Kanemaru successfully defended their tag title against Aoki and Suzuki, who got the shot due to their victory in the Junior Tag League. On September 23, Kenta confronted GHC Heavyweight Champion Go Shiozaki after he defeated Takayama to retain the title. Kenta got a number one contender's match with Takashi Sugiura, which he won on October 10. Kenta and Kanemaru lost the GHC Junior Heavyweight tag title to Aoki and Suzuki on October 16.\n\nParagraph 3:  Bright Rainbow After the Rain (2010): The movie is unique in a sense that it is in English and it could be known as the first English movie in Thailand done by Thai students. The movie was filmed in Phayao Province. It is drama about two girls who were best friends- น.ส.สิริพร จันทร์เอี่ยม  (Siripon Janauem) as Ana and น.ส.ณัฐณิชา ขอนพิกุล (Natnicha Khonpikul) as Sara. Ana was rich and Sara was poor with no father when she was growing up. Sara's mother sells vegetables at the market for a living. Sara helped her mother by having a part-time job. Sara's best friend Ana wants to study overseas and searches the internet to find overseas scholarship available for Thais. Sara also wanted to study overseas but didn't have the confidence to apply. Finally, Ana finds a scholarship abroad in Canada, but seeing her very poor best friend struggling in poverty has brought pain in her heart and has become her turning point. She cannot stand to see her best friend having so many difficulties in life while she is enjoying life's comfort. So Ana decided to help Sara escape poverty, but wants to do it secretly. She pretends to be Sara and applys for a scholarship in Sara's name. Ana does this without Sara's knowledge. She steals Sara's personal information and passport to complete Sara's scholarship application. Ana wants to study abroad but had sacrifices her dream for the sake of her best friend. At the end, Sara gets a scholarship in Canada through Ana's secret help. The \"Bright Rainbow After the Rain\" is the first English movie in Thailand with Thai students as the cast. The director Alejandro Cardeinte is an English teacher teaching at Phayao Pittayakhom School (โรงเรียนพะเยาพิทยาคม). The goal of the movie is to help Thai students learn English. The movie has English subtitles but no Thai subtitles. The movie uses simple day-to-day English. The film's soundtrack was written by the movie director himself. But partly, some music he used is not cleared with copyright yet. The movie is for educational purposes only and not for business.\n\nParagraph 4: D'Utassy helped to raise and organise the 39th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment, a unit that was mustered in New York City for a service period of three years on May 22, 1861. Initially divided into 11 companies of men from Germany, Hungary, Switzerland, Italy, France, Spain and Portugal, it would ultimately host 11 different nationalities. His brothers Carl (on the muster rolls as Carl von Utassy) and Anton also joined the regiment as Lieutenants (Anton Anthony D'Utassy rose to Captain during the war). On May 27, 1861, they deployed to Washington and in July the 39th participated in the movement of the army towards Manassas. Attached into the 1st Brigade (Col. Louis Blenker) of the 5th Division (Col. Dixon S. Miles) it was only slightly engaged at the First Battle of Bull Run. Stationed in Alexandria, the ill feelings of the multi-ethnic regiment turned into violence and sparked several mutinies - all of those were quelled in D'Utassy's presence. In August, when Blenker was elevated to command of the German Division, D'Utassy took temporary command of the brigade. D'Utassy tried to Americanize his regiment, going so far as refusing to accept orders written in German, trying to use English as the only language used in the regiment and ordering his officer to pass language examinations. D'Utassy was a strong and hot-tempered disciplinarian and initiated severe punishment and several courts-martial for drunkenness or misconduct. He was utterly despised by a great portion of the regiment's officer corps, so much that many officers resigned. At the same time rumors were spread that D'Utassy was an impostor who forged his military records, and in reality an Austrian Jew by the name of Frederick Strasser; but he never officially denounced them. His hatred of all German, a common sentiment in the Hungarian revolutionaries, infuriated both his German superiors and his regiment as about half of the regiment was German. In November the quarrelsome Colonel reverted to command his regiment, and brigade command was given to Julius Stahel, who was junior to D'Utassy and has been promoted to Colonel just few weeks before. At the same time D'Utassy was accused of fraudulently drawing additional rations, but he proved the correctness of his action and the charge was neutralized. In April the feud between D'Utassy and Blenker, that was used under heavy use of the media, culminated in D'Utassy being arrested. D'Utassy demanded a court-martial, but this was denied.\n\nParagraph 5: This is generally applied to crimes that do not require criminal intent, e.g., those that affect the public welfare but which do not require the imposition of a prison term. The principle is that in such cases, the public interest is more important than private interest, and so the vicarious liability is imposed to deter or to create incentives for employers to impose stricter rules and supervise more closely. In Commonwealth v. Koczwara, the defendant was the licensed operator of a tavern which was found to have supplied minors with alcohol. The offence became one of strict or absolute liability when applied vicariously because of the need to protect weak and vulnerable members of society, and the omission of words such as \"knowingly\", \"willfully\" or \"intentionally\" in some of the offences indicated a legislative intent to permit this eventuality. In Staples v United States, the defendant was initially convicted of being in possession of an unregistered machine gun. It was a rifle that had been modified for rapid fire, thereby putting it in violation of the National Firearms Act. The Supreme Court reversed and remanded the case. The majority held that the defendant needed actual knowledge about the nature of his weapon in order for him to be convicted. The dissenting opinion states that it was irrelevant that he did not know about the modification because statutes regulating dangerous weapons are public welfare statutes and can be interpreted to exclude the mens rea requirement of knowledge. Hence, as long as defendants know that they are dealing with a dangerous product or device that places them in a responsible relationship to the public, they should recognize that strict regulations are more likely and assume that the United States Congress would intend to place the burden on the defendant to ascertain at his peril whether his conduct comes within the inhibition of the statute.\n\nParagraph 6: Hurley began his football career at Millwall in 1953, making his debut at the age of seventeen in a 2–2 draw away to Torquay United on 30 January 1954. He went on to make 16 league appearances in the season. He followed this up with 38 league games in 1954–55 and also played three FA Cup ties. At the start of 1955–56, he was considered good enough to represent London in the first English team to play in a European competition. London beat t Frankfurt 3–2 at Wembley in the Fairs Cup and the headline in the Daily Mail was HURLEY HOLDS . He was thus selected to play for the Republic of Ireland at aged 20 but a cruciate knee ligament injury, whilst representing the army side on his national service, ended any such plans and put Hurleys' career into doubt. Rehabilitation involved rest and then twelve to eighteen hours work a day for six weeks. On his recovery, Hurley swiftly returned to  action but for the rest of his career the Irishman had to be particularly careful when making a sliding tackle and required constant treatment on his left knee.\n\nParagraph 7: For round two, each team (starting with the team in the lead or the winners of the 3 a.m. coin toss in case of a tie) performed a stunt and answered a list of questions for 40 seconds (45 seconds in the first season). The team that was in the lead (or if teams were tied, the 3 a.m. coin toss winners) were allowed to choose one of two stunts, that they must participate in. (which in season one, teams chose between stunts, that were hidden under covered dinner plates, and were completely by chance. In season two, stunts are shown upfront, and contestants chose the task strictly, loosely related on a book or magazine they were told to study. The actual components of the task are still unknown to the teams.) The round tested the teams' ability  to multitask after being deprived of sleep. Stunts took various forms, such as demonstrating yoga positions, matching cuts of meat to a picture of a cow, or even firing hard candies at small chocolate bunnies using a slingshot. All of the aspects of the stunts, were things that the contestants had been given to study overnight. Every stunt had seven physical items, tasks, or activities the teams were asked to do. Once each team was done with a task, Elwood would then mediate scoring and judging. Each successful part of the stunt won 20 points for the team. The other team would automatically perform the second activity, with the format being identical as far as scoring. During the stunt, in some cases, teams may be allowed to change their mind on an answer, as long as this is done before time is over. When judging the challenge afterwards, only the answer given while time was elapsing would be considered.\n\nParagraph 8: The majority of backing tracks on the first three sides of the album were recorded at I.D. Sound Studios, Los Angeles, engineered by James Lowe with assistance from John Lee. The studio was one of the first independent units in LA, and Lowe believes Rundgren chose it due to the ability to work hands-on without record company interference and having all the latest technology and equipment. Rundgren played every instrument in turn, starting with the drums, noting it \"was the logical place to start,\" with the others individually laid down on top. While recording the drums, Rundgren would try and hum the song in his head to remember where he was, but \"if I would screw up, then I would change the song afterwards, to fit the mistake that I had made, because it was easier than going back and fixing it.\" In retrospect, Rundgren felt he might have performed better with a click track, being a novice drummer at the time, but concluded that the end result \"sound[s] like a band\". He didn't think his lack of technical proficiency on the instrument was a particular handicap, saying that \"people comprehend what you're playing, and it has a greater impact.\" Engineering the album, Lowe recalled he was \"mostly working in the dark\", and that Rundgren would leave spaces for instruments during recording, spontaneously developing a song as it was being recorded. \"I was never sure exactly where the song was going until we'd put down about four or five tracks.\"\n\nParagraph 9:  Deriyeh, the head of the Rer Segulleh, was universally proclaimed Sultan by the rest of the Habr Yunis tribe, and was really the first of the Habr Yunis Sultans, although his father, Segulleh, had tried to pose as such. Sultan Deriyeh lived to a great age, and had no less than eighteen sons, of whom the first two were borne to him by a woman of the Makahil section of the Habr Awal tribe, and the elder of these, Aman by name, joining with his brother, formed the Ba Maka-hil, while his remaining sixteen stepbrothers formed the Baha Deriyeh. Aman had ten sons, the eldest of whom was Ahmed, who died before his father, who himself died before his old father, the aged Sultan Deriyeh. Now, as soon as Sultan Deriyeh died there was trouble as to his successor. The Ba Makahil claimed that Ismail and Hirsi, of their section, were entitled to the honour ; but the Rer Segulleh and some of the Baha Deriyeh, said, \"No, as several of the late Sultan's sons are still living, one of them should be their Sultan before any of the grandsons\"; so they invited Awid Deriyeh to be their representative. In the meantime, Ismail was killed fighting with the Ogaden and Hirsi by the Baha Segulleh. The Ba Makahil now had to look for another successor, so they sent for Nur, the son of Ahmed Aman, and nephew to Ismail and Hirsi, who was living the life of a Mullah at Hahi, near Odweina. Nur, much against his will, consented to be their Sultan, although he preferred the life he was leading as a Mullah. For some years now there were two Sultans of the Habr Yunis, namely, Sultan Nur of the Habr Yunis, Ba Makahil, and Sultan Awd Deriyeh of the Baha Segulleh; so it will be seen the powerful section of the Baha Segulleh had gone to the Baha Deriyeh for their representative\". Awad Deriyeh was killed in a fight with the Ogaden Rer Ali, so the Baha Segulleh had to find another Sultan. Accordingly, they chose his brother Hirsi's son, Mattar; but this choice the Baha Deriyeh were not at all pleased with, so all the Habr Yunis tribe decided to meet and discuss the matter out and decide on one Sultan. After a great deal of discussion the two clans, Ba Makahil and Baha Deriyeh, who had claimants for the sultanate, decided to let them toss for it, the winner to be proclaimed Sultan, while the loser got one hundred camels as compensation from the winner. Sultan Nur won, and was proclaimed Sultan of the Habr Yunis tribe.\n\nParagraph 10: Black Stallion is a monster truck that races on the USHRA circuit and for other promoters.  Black Stallion started out as a stock 1982 Ford F350 back in 1982, owned and modified by Michael Vaters.  The first modification was a homemade 12\" lift kit, since such kits were unavailable at the time.  Mike then later added two sunroofs, an Alpine stereo system, a Ford 460 Engine, Rockwell 5 ton toploaders, Clark 20 ton planetaries, 66\" terra tires, a 9\" television and later on, a 1988 Ford F series front end.  Between 1990 and 1991, Mike realized the future of monster trucks, which was racing.  To be competitive, Mike replaced the leaf springs with airbags, the old heavy split ring rims with lightweight one piece rims, fiberglass body pieces, cutting the tires, gutting the interior out, 4 linking the truck and putting in a bigger engine.  The modifications proved to be beneficial to Mike, with close races with First Blood, and competing in some Pendaliner Special Events racing events.  After a violent rollover in Bloomsburg Pennsylvania in 1991, Mike decided to put King shocks on the truck, which he later added coil springs in 1992.  Along with the coil springs, Mike also removed the airbags.  Mike is credited as the first owner to use bypass shocks. Also for 1992, Mike changed the front clip to a 1992 Ford F-series front end.  Mike rarely ran this truck after he built the popular Boogey Van in 1993, driven by his then wife, Pam Vaters.  Due to this, the truck was nicknamed Rodney, after the comedian, Rodney Dangerfield.  Mike then built a truck for the 1996 season for research and development, named Black Stallion 2000, since his crew members joked about Mike not building a new truck for himself until the new millennium.  This chassis is still running strong to this day.  For his 20th anniversary, Mike decided to repaint Black stallion, with the front of the truck yellow, going into black with a horse face painted on.  The truck currently has the same paint scheme. The drivers for 2016 are Michael Vaters & Matt Cody. Vaters will compete in the Fox Sports 1 Championship Series. Cody will travel to Birmingham, Toronto, Newark, Charleston, Columbia, Worcester, Wheeling & Baton Rouge.", "answers": ["Paragraph 9"], "length": 3292, "dataset": "passage_retrieval_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "03a2ca693db1158290762a5a6f4713826956d330753de4d6"}
{"input": "Lou Peters played youth football for Bristol City and signed as a professional for the team in March 1961. He made his league debut as an outside right in 1960-61, and went on to share the left wing duties with Jantzen Derrick in the following seasons. Peters made several appearances and scored goals for Bristol City as the team moved up and down the league table. He played in different positions, including outside right and outside left. Peters was the top scorer for Bristol City in the 1966-67 season and helped the team avoid relegation. He also played in the FA Cup, reaching the 5th round twice before being knocked out. In the 1967-68 season, Peters had limited appearances and did not score any goals. The team finished in 19th place and avoided relegation again.", "context": "Paragraph 1: Alexander Robertson started repairing boats in a small workshop at Sandbank in 1876, and Alexander Robertson & Sons went on to become one of the foremost wooden boat builders on Scotland's River Clyde. The 'golden years' of Robertson's yard were in the early 1900s when they started building classic 12- and 15-metre racing yachts. Robertsons was well known for the quality of its workmanship and was chosen to build the first 15-metre yacht designed by William Fife (Shimna, 1907). More than 55 boats were built by Robertsons in preparation for the First World War and the yard remained busy even during the Great Depression in the 1930s, as many wealthy businessmen developed a passion for yacht racing on the Clyde. During World War II the yard was devoted to Admiralty work, producing a wide range of large high-speed Fairmile Marine Motor Boats. After the war the yard built the successful one-class Loch Longs and two David Boyd designed 12-metre challengers for the America's Cup: Sceptre (1958) and Sovereign (1964). Due to difficult business conditions the Robertson family sold the yard in 1965, and it was turned over to GRP production work until it closed in 1980. During its 104-year history, Robertson's Yard built 500 boats, many of which are still sailing today. The yard ceased trading in the early 1980s and the site was levelled soon after. The site has since been consumed by residential building and the new Holy Loch Marina development.\n\nParagraph 2: thumb|left| The Bf 110 was a twin-engine heavy fighter ('Zerstörer' - German for 'Destroyer'). The one which crashed in Meads on 16 August 1940 (A2 + GL) was the first enemy aircraft to be brought down in the County Borough of Eastbourne. At about 5.30 pm on Friday 16 August 1940, the first German aircraft to be brought down within what was then the County Borough of Eastbourne crashed in Meads.  A Messerschmitt Bf 110 of the Luftwaffe unit known as ZG 2 had left the former French aerodrome at Guyancourt as part of an escort for bombers raiding RAF airfields at Feltham, Heston and Heathrow.  Over the South Downs, the Messerschmitt was engaged by a British fighter – almost certainly the Hurricane flown by Pilot Officer H N E Salmon of No. 1 Squadron. The German aircraft broke up in the air, and the pilot, Hauptmann Ernst Hollekamp, was killed when he fell on the roof of Hill Brow School in Gaudick Road, his parachute unopened. Part of the nose fell onto the Royal Eastbourne golf course, close to the end of Gaudick Road.  The rear gunner, Feldwebel Richard Schurk, came down in the sea off Holywell and was drowned.  The bulk of the aircraft crashed in the grounds of Aldro School in Darley Road — the wreckage was incorrectly identified in the local press as being that of a Heinkel He 111.  At the same time, a lorry was hit in Hampden Park by a bomb which had probably been jettisoned by one of the German bombers returning from the raid on RAF airfields.  Three Council workmen were killed – two instantly, the other dying the following day from burns.\n\nParagraph 3: Lou Peters played youth football for Bristol City. Peters signed as a professional for Bristol City in March 1961. Manager Fred Ford gave Peters his league debut at outside right in the final Third Division match in 1960–61 in a 3–0 win v Brentford on 29 April 1961. Jimmy Rogers was the regular outside right as City rose to 6th place in 1961–62. Peters started the season at outside left but had to share the left wing duties with Jantzen Derrick and made only 13 appearances scoring his first goal in the final game of the season on 28 April 1962 in a 2–2 draw v Crystal Palace. Peters had a mid season spell in the side the following season, firstly on the right wing in place of Alex Tait and then on the left wing in place of Derrick. Peters made 19 appearances scoring three goals as the \"Robins\" slipped to 14th place in the table in 1962–63. In 1963-64 Bristol City recovered to 5th place in the Third Division but Peters failed to make the first team with Derrick playing outside right and new signing Peter Hooper the regular on the left wing. Peters returned to the left wing at the start of the following season making 40 appearances scoring six goals including 2 goals in the 3–0 win v Port Vale on 27 February 1965. This was the promotion season as Bristol City finished runners up in the Third Division. Peters started the Second Division campaign in the outside right position with Hooper on the left wing but switched to the left wing when Derrick replaced Hooper in October. In 1965-66 Bristol City finished 5th in the Second Division and Peters made 35 appearances scoring six goals. Bristol City struggled against relegation for much of 1966–67. The emergence of Danny Bartley on the left wing at the start of the season restricted Peters and Derrick to sharing the outside right position but at Christmas Peters reclaimed the outside left position with City lying 19th and retained the no.11 shirt for the rest of the season as City finished clear of relegation in 15th place. Peters made 28 appearances and was top scorer with nine goals in 1966-67 including a run of 7 goals in the final 12 league games. Peters also netted two goals against Halifax Town in the FA Cup as City reached the 5th round before losing 0–2 at Tottenham Hotspur. The following season saw Bristol City stave off relegation after a season long struggle finishing in 19th place. Peters had several spells in the first team making 22 appearances without scoring on the left wing sharing duties with Bartley in 1967–68. Peters also played in 3 FA Cup ties as City reached the 5th round again before losing 0–2 at Leeds United.\n\nParagraph 4: The A300,  registered as B-1814, was en route from Ngurah Rai Airport in Bali, Indonesia to Taipei, Taiwan. The weather was inclement, with rain and fog when the aircraft approached Chiang Kai-shek International Airport, so the pilot executed a missed approach. After the jet was cleared to land at runway 05L, the autopilot was disengaged, and the pilots then attempted a manual go-around. The jet slowed, pitched up by 40°, rose , stalled, and crashed into a residential neighborhood, bursting into flames at local time 4:20 pm. All 196 people on board were killed (including the governor of Taiwan's central bank, Sheu Yuan-dong, his wife, and three central bank officials), along with seven people on the ground. Hsu Lu, the manager of the Voice of Taipei radio station, said that one boy was pulled alive from the wreckage and later died.\n\nParagraph 5: The mammoth steppe was dominated in biomass by reindeer, bison, horse, and the woolly mammoth, and was the center for the evolution of the Pleistocene woolly fauna. Megaloceros, saiga antelope and musk ox also lived on the mammoth steppe (the first one not in the northernmost parts). In the Siberian parts were animals like the argali, Snow sheep and the Mongolian gazelle. Not so far before the last glacial maximum (roughly 40.000 years ago), an extinct paleospecies of argali (Ovis argaloides) lived also in Europe. Notable carnivores found across the whole range of the mammoth steppe included Panthera spelaea, the Wolverine, the wolf Canis lupus and the brown bear Ursus arctos. While the cave hyena was part of mammoth steppe faunas in Europe, it did not extend into the core high latitude north Asian range of the biome. Bird remains are rare because of their fragile structure, but there is some evidence for snowy owl, willow ptarmigan, gyrfalcon, common raven and great bustard. Other bird species are white-tailed eagle and golden eagle. Vultures like griffon vulture and cinereous vulture are not known but they were likely common scavengers on the mammoth steppe, following the large herds and scavenging on dead animals. On Wrangel Island, the remains of woolly mammoth, woolly rhinoceros, horse, bison and musk ox have been found. Reindeer and small animal remains do not preserve, but reindeer excrement has been found in sediment. Small animals on the mammoth steppe were, for example, steppe pika, ground squirrels and alpine marmot. In the most arid regions of the mammoth steppe that were to the south of Central Siberia and Mongolia, woolly rhinoceros were common but woolly mammoths were rare. Reindeer live in the far north of Mongolia today and historically their southern boundary passed through Germany and along the steppes of eastern Europe, indicating they once covered much of the mammoth steppe. \n\nParagraph 6: In August 1939, the 71st Infantry Division was set up in Military District XI (Wehrkreis XI) and was mainly recruited from soldiers from what is now Lower Saxony: Hanover, Hildesheim, Braunschweig and the western Harz. Mainly those born between 1910 and 1920 were drafted, with a divisional strength of 15,000 men. Mobilization took place on 25/26 August 1939 by Infantry Commander 19 (Infanterie-Kommandeur 19) in Hildesheim under the code word \"Sigurd 9757\". In spring 1939, under Colonel Wolf, Infantarie-Regiment 211 (IR 211) was already prepared for combat operations as Training Infantry Regiment 1 (Übungs-Infanterie-Regiment 1) at the Bergen military training area and was assigned a section on the Siegfried Line. The training in the army's rear area consisted mainly of weapon operation, combat field training, silent approach, movement in the dark and shooting. The first division commander was Generalmajor Wolfgang Ziegler in Hildesheim, former commander of the 19th Infantry Division. The positions of regimental commanders were filled with experienced officers from the First World War. Shortly after the general mobilization, the remainder of the 71st Infantry Division was moved to Pirmasens in night marches to secure the border, in order to move into their deployment zone for the Western campaign in France.\n\nParagraph 7: Moved to Jefferson City, Mo., September 1861.

In a series of letters sent to Empress Theophanu, Emma's sister-in-law, Adalbero expressed loyalty on behalf of himself, Queen Emma, and her son King Louis V (Adalbero's lord at the time). It was Emperor Otto I who had named Adalbero archbishop, along with the other clergy members who were given their positions by the emperor and is why Adalbero had felt such loyalty towards them. However, not all clergy felt the same way, and so they created a political party to oppose Queen Emma in the Frankish courts, one whose goal was to reinstate the policies of her husband, King Lothair, and expand the Frankish kingdom eastward, to gain the territory of Lorraine, Adalbero's home. The opposing party eventually prevailed when Louis disregarded the advice given to him by Adalbero and Emma, which was to seek friendship with Otto III, Theophanu's son. This unfortunate turn of events forced Adalbero to step down from his position as archbishop and flee. This act was perceived as treason by Louis, and Adalbero was called to trial at an assembly of leading Franks at Compiègne.  The sudden death of Louis V prevented this trial from taking place, and allowed Adalbero to give his support for Hugh Capet as rightful heir and denounce the Carolingian claimant, Charles, Duke of Lower Lorraine.\n\nParagraph 9: In August 2006, Cox was hired to return to Chicago as the host of The Morning Fix, a new conceptual ensemble show at heritage alternative WKQX-FM (Q101). (Ironically, this put Cox down the hall from his former mentor Brandmeier, who returned to host mornings at sister station WLUP after the station was purchased by Emmis in 2005.) The Morning Fix combined the sensibilities of improv and stand-up comedy with traditional radio elements and replaced the outgoing Mancow Muller, who had been Q101's morning host for nearly a decade. In November 2007, after 14 months of turbulence, the ensemble members of the Morning Fix were let go, due to the show's high cost and insufficient ratings. Cox and sports anchor Jim Lynam were asked to stay and create a more music-intensive show.  The new show was a more conversational and caller-intensive incarnation of the former show, and more reminiscent of Cox's solo show. On August 1, 2008, Cox & Lynam's \"Morning Fix\" was canceled.  They were replaced temporarily by Q101 weekend DJ Alex Quigley until August 11, 2008, when Q101's former late afternoon duo Sherman and Tingle took over the WKQX morning duties. Ironically, the ratings at the time of their dismissal placed Cox and Lynam in the top 5 rankings, leading some to speculate that the change was financially motivated, due to Emmis's sagging stock price coinciding with the end of Cox's expensive contract.\n\nParagraph 10: Missiles typically have a lower chance of hitting a target in a head-on engagement because of the very fast closure rate. If the missile is travelling at Mach 2.5 and the aircraft at Mach 1, the combined rate of Mach 3.5 doesn't give the missile very much time to respond to violent evasive maneuvers the aircraft might perform or to recover from being fooled by countermeasures, etc. In addition, the aircraft can turn away from the missile and then toward it again just before impact, forcing the missile to turn in a much tighter circle than the aircraft needs to in order to follow it through this maneuver. Although missiles can turn faster than aircraft, this advantage is often enough to cause the missile to fly past the aircraft without coming within lethal range.\n\nParagraph 11: The name Mumbi comes from the Bantu root verb KUMBA, \"BA\", the same root word that gives rise to \"UMBA\". The prefix \"Mu\" is the Bantu noun classifier for nouns that have souls, like humans. The verb UMBA indicates the action of moulding, shaping, designing or creating. The suffix \"i\" replaces the terminal \"a\" in the Bantu language noun or verb to create the name for the performer of the action. Being derived from a Bantu root, the word Mumbi is also widely used by the Kamba ethnic community. Among the Kamba community the name carries the same meaning as among the Kikuyus.", "answers": ["Paragraph 3"], "length": 3022, "dataset": "passage_retrieval_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "411771705a8c584adfda256f30514ebaf8a587eac6be9623"}
{"input": "A door closer is a mechanical device that allows a door to close in a controlled manner after it has been opened. It prevents the door from slamming by using stored energy from a spring to return the door to a closed position. Door closers can also be connected to a building's fire alarm system, where they are used to hold doors open until the alarm is triggered, at which point they release the doors to close. These hold-open devices can be separate from the door closer or integrated into its design.", "context": "Paragraph 1: The design of the caisson lock at Combe Hay was not a success: on 15 February 1798 the first descent failed. Mr Weldon (the inventor) made one successful descent on 7 June and said \"I will undertake to pass 1,500 tons of goods through the lock in 12 hrs\". Tenders were invited on 28 June for further constructions. Two more attempts to use the lock took place on 11 April and 2 May, but only the latter was successful. By 22 August 1799 the second rebuilding of the caisson had been abandoned. It was replaced by three locks and an inclined plane trackway, but the trackway was not successful either, and the company proposed to raise more money to finance the building of a flight of 19 locks to replace it, the use of which would incur an additional toll of one shilling per ton on all traffic. This was vigorously opposed by the owners of the Kennet and Avon Canal and the Wilts and Berks Canal, on the grounds that the price of coal to their customers would be too high. After negotiation, the company obtained a new Act of Parliament on 30 April 1802, which authorised the formation of a separate body called \"The Lock Fund of the Somerset Coal Canal Company\", with powers to raise the sum of £45,000. The money was raised by the Kennet and Avon, the Wilts and Berks and the Somerset Coal Canal each contributing £15,000, and the one shilling surcharge was to be levied until the capital had been repaid, after which it would cease. The act set the tonnage rates to be charged:\n\nParagraph 2: After the death of Justinian in 565, the Eastern Roman Empire came increasingly under attack on all fronts, and emperors often left the more remote provinces to themselves to cope as best they could for extended periods, although military officers, such as Heraclius the Elder (Exarch  598–610), continued to rotate between the eastern provinces and Africa. By the 640s and 650s, Byzantium had lost its  province of Mesopotamia to the Muslims, who also extinguished the Byzantines' rival, the Sassanian Empire (651). Constantinople thereby lost an important source of experienced officers seasoned by constant border warfare with the Persians. The Heraclian dynasty (610-711) did continue to appoint some competent eastern officers to African posts, such as the Armenian Narseh, who commanded Tripoli, and John, the dux of  Tigisis. Walter Kaegi speculates that some Armenian officers might have asked to transfer back to the east to defend their homes as the Muslims advanced into Armenia, but the sources are silent. Yet the officers who continued to arrive from the east after the loss of Mesopotamia would have been more accustomed to defeats like the Battle of Yarmouk (636) than the previously winning strategies used against the Sassanians, and new tactics and strategies developed slowly.\n\nParagraph 3: Ross earned a Bachelor of Arts degree with a major in film and a minor in theatre from the University of Manitoba in 1992. He spent the first five years of his life in the Métis community of Kinosota, Manitoba before moving to Winnipeg, which he currently now calls his home. Ross has written for theatre, film, television and radio, and has been writing plays for a number of years but is perhaps best known as the creator of Farewel. FareWel is Ross’ first professional production, which later won him the 1997 Governor General's Award for English Drama, making Ross the first Métis to win the award.\n\nParagraph 4: From 1972 to 1985, Anderson wrestled primarily for Jim Crockett Promotions and Georgia Championship Wrestling. From the mid-1970s through the early 1980s, The Minnesota Wrecking Crew became synonymous with tag team wrestling in the Georgia and Mid-Atlantic territories by capturing the NWA Georgia Tag Team Championship and the Mid-Atlantic territorial version of the NWA World Tag Team Championship 7 times each. The Andersons feuded with such stars as Mr. Wrestling and Mr. Wrestling II, Wahoo McDaniel, Jack Brisco, Jerry Brisco, Dusty Rhodes,  Tommy Rich, Johnny Weaver, Dino Bravo, Paul Jones, Ric Flair, Greg Valentine, Ricky Steamboat, Rufus R. Jones, The Mongols, and Thunderbolt Patterson throughout the 1970s and early 1980s. Behind the scenes, Anderson was also the primary booker for GCW and also had a stint booking JCP in 1981–82. For a time he even booked both companies simultaneously, often combining both rosters for supercards which were noted for offering some of the best action in the business at that time. He later left JCP to book and wrestle for GCW full-time. When Jack and Jerry Brisco sold their majority interest in the GCW promotion to Vince McMahon, Anderson resisted the change, and joined forces with longtime NWA-sanctioned promoters Fred Ward and Ralph Freed to start a new company called Championship Wrestling from Georgia.\n\nParagraph 5: The lieutenant governor of Prince Edward Island is vested with a number of governmental duties and is also expected to undertake various ceremonial roles. For instance, the lieutenant governor acts as patron, honorary president, or an honorary member of certain Prince Edward Island institutions, such as the Prince Edward Island Council of the Arts, the Royal Commonwealth Society of Prince Edward Island, and the Canadian Cancer Society (Prince Edward Island division). Also, The viceroy, him or herself a member and Chancellor of the order, will induct deserving individuals into the Order of Prince Edward Island and, upon installation, automatically becomes a Knight or Dame of Justice and the Vice-Prior in Prince Edward Island of the Most Venerable Order of the Hospital of Saint John of Jerusalem. The viceroy further presents numerous other provincial honours and decorations, as well as various awards that are named for and presented by the lieutenant governor. These honours are presented at official ceremonies, which count amongst hundreds of other engagements the lieutenant governor partakes in each year, either as host or guest of honour; the lieutenant governor of Prince Edward Island undertook an average of 350 engagements in both 2006 and 2007.\n\nParagraph 6: Paul Myers was a 1930s broadcast radio host in Los Angeles. But Paul's life spun out of control due to alcoholism. He hit bottom. His wife locked him out of the house, but told him she would pray for him. As Myers began to read a Gideon Bible he found in his skid row hotel along San Diego’s waterfront, he found forgiveness, hope, and new life in the Lord Jesus Christ. With his new hope, he was back on the Los Angeles airways on KHJ (AM), and in 1934 started the radio broadcast The Haven of Rest. Paul Myers would host the on air program for 37 years. Paul Myers gave himself the name \"First Mate Bob\" and he was on the \"Good Ship Grace\".  He used a nautical theme for his program, which had teaching and singers. The program started with a ships’ air horn, then Eight Bells and a quartet of singer singing  “The Haven of Rest,” an 1890 song, by Henry L. Gilmour about a sinner anchoring his soul in Christ. Myers retired in 1971 and turned the program over to Pastor Paul Evans. Evans continued the tradition Myers had started till he stepped down in 1981. In 1979 Paul Evans wrote Divine Communication and in 1980 Divine Resources, both published by Haven of Rest. In 1988, the Haven of Rest was on 275 stations. In 1981, Dr. Raymond C. Ortlund Sr., the Senior Pastor at Lake Avenue Congregational Church in Pasadena, California, took over the program. Ortlund at the same time stepped down from pastorate at Lake Avenue. Raymond's Sunday morning services at Lake Avenue Congregational Church were broadcast over radio station KRLA. After 20 years at Lake Avenue Ray and wife Anne founded Renewal Ministries at about the same time he took over The Haven of Rest program. With Renewal Ministries they traveled around the world teaching about renewal and revival among God’s churches. Ray hosted the Haven of Rest radio broadcast with his distinctive voice for 19 years, from 1981 to 2000. Raymond C. Ortlund Sr. also served as a teaching pastor at Mariner's Church in Newport Beach, California in the 1980s. The National Religious Broadcasters Hall of Fame inducted Ray in 2008 for his years of hosting the Haven of Rest. Ray retired from The Haven of Rest in 2000. Charles Morris took over the program in 2000 and changed the program name to Haven Today. The in-house music quartet singers were replaced with contemporary Christian music in 2001. Charles Morris attended in seminary in Philadelphia. Charles was a news reporter and an editor for United Press International. Charles also worked as press secretary for two former U.S. Senators. For a time he owned and operated his own radio station. He worked with the late Dr. James Montgomery Boice before the Haven program. Charles has authored several books with his wife: Saving a Life, Jesus in the Midst of Success, and Missing Jesus.\n\nParagraph 7: For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty while serving as a HM2 with Battery D, 2d Battalion, at Phu Loc 6, near An Hoa. During the early morning hours, an estimated battalion-sized enemy force launched a determined assault against the battery's position, and succeeded in effecting a penetration of the barbed-wire perimeter. The initial burst of enemy fire caused numerous casualties among the Marines who had immediately manned their howitzers during the rocket and mortar attack. Undaunted by the intense hostile fire, HM2 Ray moved from parapet to parapet, rendering emergency medical treatment to the wounded. Although seriously wounded himself while administering first aid to a Marine casualty, he refused medical aid and continued his lifesaving efforts. While he was bandaging and attempting to comfort another wounded Marine, HM2 Ray was forced to battle two enemy soldiers who attacked his position, personally killing one and wounding the other. Rapidly losing his strength as a result of his severe wounds, he nonetheless managed to move through the hail of enemy fire to other casualties. Once again, he was faced with the intense fire of oncoming enemy troops and, despite the grave personal danger and insurmountable odds, succeeded in treating the wounded and holding off the enemy until he ran out of ammunition, at which time he sustained fatal wounds. HM2 Ray's final act of heroism was to protect the patient he was treating. He threw himself upon the wounded Marine, thus saving the man's life when an enemy grenade exploded nearby. By his determined and persevering actions, courageous spirit, and selfless devotion to the welfare of his Marine comrades, HM2 Ray served to inspire the men of Battery D to heroic efforts in defeating the enemy. His conduct throughout was in keeping with the finest traditions of the U.S. Naval Service.\n\nParagraph 8: A door closer is defined as any mechanical device that closes a door in a controlled manner, preventing it from slamming, in general after someone opens it, or after it was automatically opened. The force used to open the door is stored in some type of spring and when released this energy is then used to return the door to a closed position. Door closers can be linked to a building's fire alarm system.  Where doors need to be held open for the majority of the time they are held back with an electromagnetic device. When the fire alarm is triggered it cuts power to the electromagnetic hold-open device allowing the doors to close. These hold-open devices can be separate from the door closer or part of its design.\n\nParagraph 9: Amula was born in the Aryek patrilineage as the son of Alworuna and Acoamfa. The fortunes of the Aryek family had been rising before Amula's birth. The first known Aryek patriarch, Abok Ucweda had been an insignificant man in the politics of the Ukuru clan. The same couldn't be said for some of his sons. Ugena had been chief for five years (1845–1850) before being deposed with help from his half-brother Nziri, Amula's paternal grandfather. Amula's father Alworuna had been known to be the best warrior of the Ukuru clan. Three brothers of Alworuna, Amatho, Kubi and Avur also managed to become powerful, respected men. Four Amula brothers, including his full brother Aryem, also became powerful. Amula grew up in  the 1878 Ukuru-Panduru war which the Ukuru clan lost and in which around 600 Ukuru men died in a few days of intense fighting. Amula's father Alworuna was burned alive by Panduru forces led by their chief, Ujuru. Amula's uncle Amatho died trying to avenge his brother's death. Amula grew up to be a powerful man who rapidly rose in the social hierarchy from the age of 15. In 1890, at 19 years old, he was elected as the chief of the Ukuru clan. He immediately began a war with the Panduru clan and managed to avenge his father's death. Afterward, he consolidated his hold on the Ukuru clan by entering into allegiances with other powerful patrilineages mainly with the Palei, Parombo and sections of the Patek patrilineage. He also could count on the support of many individual men. Amula proved to be a good chief, strong willed but compassionate. He was skillful in wars partly because of his ability to secure alliances with other clans. He was the voice of reason when the British arrived in 1914, compelling the clan not to fight them. He was exiled by the British in 1917 for not rigidly following their orders but was allowed back in 1922. He died in 1942, still very popular and loved by the clan. As a chief, Amula had many wives and children. His son Jalusiga (1896–1978) succeeded him as chief although this was a British doing and not a choice of the clan. Another son of his, Jalaure (born in 1888), acted as chief in his absence from 1917–1922.\n\nParagraph 10: In 1982, Holmes placed a want ad in a Toronto newspaper looking for new musicians to join the band. Percussionist Chris Steffler and guitarist Sergio Galli answered the ad. Steffler (b. 1958/1959) grew-up in Wasaga Beach, where his parents owned a trailer park and campground, and where Steffler played drums for local bands before moving to Toronto in 1978. Galli (b. 1959/1960) was enrolled in the architecture program at the University of Toronto when he answered Holmes' ad. The band recorded a seven track demo tape on a four-track recorder and sent it to British music producer David Tickle who liked their sound and flew to Toronto to work with them. The band signed to Epic Records Canada and Tickle produced their self-titled EP, which was released in 1983. Tickle also produced their debut, full-length album Standing in the Dark, which expanded upon the tracks from their EP and was released later that same year. Standing in the Dark sold over 200,000 copies in Canada, which was certified double platinum at the time. The band's videos for the singles \"Standing in the Dark\" and \"Doesn't Really Matter\" were directed by Rob Quartly and were both nominated for video of the year at the 1984 Juno Awards. The Canadian music cable network MuchMusic (later known as Much) also launched in 1984, further exposing their music to a wider audience.\n\nParagraph 11: Thirty Seconds to Mars started in 1998 in Los Angeles, California, as a collaboration between brothers Jared Leto and Shannon Leto, who had been playing music together since their childhood. The duo later expanded to a four-piece when they added guitarist Solon Bixler and bassist Matt Wachter to the line-up. Additional guitarist Kevin Drake, who first auditioned for the position of bassist, also joined the band as a touring musician. The band played its first concerts under different names, before finally settling on the name \"Thirty Seconds to Mars\", which was taken from a rare manuscript titled Argus Apocraphex. Jared Leto described the name as \"a reference, a rough translation from the book. I think the idea is interesting, it's a metaphor for the future,\" he explained. \"Thirty seconds to Mars—the fact that we're so close to something that's not a tangible idea. Also Mars being the God of War makes it really interesting, as well. You could substitute that in there, but what's important for my brother and I, is that it be imaginative and really represent the sound of our music in as unique a way as possible.\" He described it as a name that \"works on several different levels, a phrase that is lyrical, suggestive, cinematic, and filled with immediacy.\" When Thirty Seconds to Mars first started, Jared Leto did not allow his vocation as a Hollywood actor to be used in promotion of the band.\n\nParagraph 12: The school survived the Civil wars including the two battles of Newbury but declined as its funds were appropriated by the unreformed  corporation in the late 18th century and in the early nineteenth century it closed. In 1849 a new body of trustees rebuilt the Litten and revived the school which opened with 60 boys being taught. The headmaster was Henry Newport.  In 1876 the headmaster was the Rev. J. Atkins. In 1885 the charity commissioners agreed to the provision of new buildings in Enborne Road at the corner with Buckingham Road for 150 pupils including 20 boarders. In 1902 the Rev. Atkins retired and was replaced by Edward Sharwood-Smith.  He had considerable enthusiasm for the school and in 1903 composed the school song and the school moto.  After the tragedy of the first world war he named four school houses after ex-pupils who had died in the 1914-8 period, three of them killed in action. These were Curnock, Davis, Evers and Patterson. Sharwood-Smith retired in 1924 and in 1925 he was replaced by the Rev.T.Rutherford-Harley. He led the school through the second world war and in 1948 was replaced by J. Andrew Ballantyne. In that year the combined cadet force (C.C.F.) was established at the school.  The 1950s was a period of recovery from the war, in which many of the teachers had fought. There were many older-style features – teachers wore gowns, the head master could still use the cane and games were restricted to cricket and rugby. In 1960 Andrew Ballantyne retired and was replaced by Basil E.D. Cooper. There followed a period of progressive reform.  In 1968 the boarding house closed and in 1975 he was to take over running of the comprehensive school formed by the merging of the boys' grammar school with the girls' high school at the other end of Buckingham Road.\n\nParagraph 13: The 3rd Battalion,  4th Gorkha Rifles (3/4 GR), Chindits, Sainli Paltan, was raised in the Leslie Lines, Bakloh, on 1 October 1940.  The nucleus of the new battalion was formed by drafts  of 3 officers and 200 men each from the 1st and 2nd Battalions. The remainder of the battalion was formed from recruits and 'recruit boys'.  Soon after the raising the battalion moved into Tytler lines after the First battalion moved to Ambala.  The Leslie lines were  turned over for raising the Regimental Centre.   The battalion held its first attestation parade on 15  March 1941. Soon after it   was moved to Chaman, Baluchistan, now in Pakistan, to form part of the Khojak Brigade.  It occupied defensive positions between Chitral and Duzdhap, on the India-Iran border, to meet threats from either Nazi Germany or  USSR.  In March 1944 the battalion was called to provide nucleus for the raising of the 4th Battalion.  On 16 June the battalion was ordered to form part of 111 Independent Brigade, under Brigadier Joe Lentaigne, as part of the Chindit, which was being concentrated in the area of Saugor  for training.\n\nParagraph 14: Electro-Motive Corporation (later Electro-Motive Division, General Motors) produced five 1800 hp B-B experimental passenger train-hauling diesel locomotives in 1935; two company-owned demonstrators, #511 and #512, the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad's #50, and two units for the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway, Diesel Locomotive #1.  The twin engine power unit layout and multiple unit control systems developed with the B-B locomotives were soon adopted for other locomotives such as the Burlington Route's Zephyr locomotives built by the Budd Company in 1936 and EMC's own EMD E-units introduced in 1937.  The B-B locomotives worked as proof-of-concept demonstrators for diesel power with the service loads of full size trains, breaking out of its niche powering the smaller custom Streamliners.\n\nParagraph 15: Tsvety () is a Soviet and Russian rock band that, according to Itogi magazine, \"started all Russian alternative culture\". It was one of the first bands to introduce rock music to the Soviet show business. The Flowers were established in 1969 by guitar player and songwriter Stas Namin. In 1973 The Flowers released flexis with producing company Melodiya; overall seven million copies were sold. After becoming a major hit in the USSR, in 1974 the band went on its first professional tour; but in 1975 the band dissolved as a result of a conflict with the Philharmonic Society, and it was liquidated by a decree of the Ministry of Culture of the USSR, its name was banned. It was only in 1977 that the band was resurrected under the new name The Stas Namin Group, in 1978 it went on tour still being banned by all central mass media outlets. In 1980, during the years of the Olympic Thaw, the band managed to release a solo album with Melodiya – Hymn to the Sun – and participate in a TV show, after that they were banned once again. The period of bans and persecution that lasted to 1986 ended with Perestroika when the life of the band got much easier: with their returned name The Flowers went on tour, performed abroad in the Western countries and completed a world tour in four years. In 1990 the band ceased its activities and, as a matter of fact, did not exist for the next almost ten years.\n\nParagraph 16: Hotline was designed in 1996 and known as \"hotwire\" by Australian programmer Adam Hinkley (known online by his username, \"Hinks\"), then 17 years old, as a classic Mac OS application. The source code for the Hotline applications was based on a class library, \"AppWarrior\" (AW), which Hinkley wrote. AppWarrior would later become litigious, as Hinkley wrote parts of it while he was employed by an Australian company, Redrock Holdings. Six other fans of Hotline, David Murphy, Alex King, Phil Hilton, Jason Roks, David Bordin, and Terrance Gregory, joined Adam Hinkley's efforts to promote and market the Hotline programs, working day and night and using the company's own products to stay in touch from across the US, Canada, and Australia. Eventually, Canadian Jason Roks approached Adam Hinkley and encouraged him to move to Toronto, where Hotline Communications, Ltd. was incorporated. In 1997, Hotline won a \"Best of the Show\" award from one of the award ceremonies concurrent with the Boston MacWorld Expo. It received accolades in computer magazines and the mainstream press from Macworld Sweden (which awarded it a \"Golden Mouse Award\") to the Los Angeles Times, which called it one of the \"best kept secrets on the internet\", as well as a short article in Wired Magazine's September 1997 issue. At the time, the company's main objective was to release a stable Windows-compatible version to reach a wider audience.", "answers": ["Paragraph 8"], "length": 3994, "dataset": "passage_retrieval_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "916e58a4b5eef032cd0395c65303980fcbb0ae42a18b3482"}
{"input": "Ellis Park Stadium, also known as Emirates Airline Park, is a sports stadium located in Johannesburg, South Africa. It is primarily used for rugby union and association football matches. The stadium gained international attention in 1995 when it hosted and witnessed the victory of South Africa's national rugby team, the Springboks, in the Rugby World Cup final. Originally upgraded in 1982 to hold nearly 60,000 spectators, the stadium remains one of the most modern in the country. Today, it continues to host both rugby and football matches, as well as other large events such as concerts. Ellis Park Stadium has become closely associated with rugby, with the exception of a brief period in the early 1980s when it underwent construction during its upgrade.", "context": "Paragraph 1: For there to be an offence under section 2(1)(c) there must be dishonesty and a deception that obtains some exemption from or abatement of liability to make a payment. Because both sections 2(1)(a) and (b) require an \"existing\" liability to pay, they do not cover situations where the point of the deception is to prevent a liability from arising in the future. Section 2(1)(c) would apply when a person flags down a taxi and claims only to have £5. The driver agrees to carry the passenger to the destination for this amount. The contract is made for a reduced amount, which is an \"abatement\" for these purposes. If the driver agreed to carry for no charge, this would be an \"exemption\". The Criminal Law Revision Committee (CLRC) gave examples where the defendant dishonestly obtained a rate rebate or a reduction in rent for the future. Another example would be waving a credit card at a ticket collector at a railway station to avoid having to pay to board the train. In roader than previous two offences as not limited to existing liabilities. In R v Firth, the defendant failed to tell the NHS that patients using NHS facilities were in fact private patients thereby obtaining facilities without payment (an example of an omission or silence constituting the deception). In R v Sibartie [1983] Crim LR 470, CA, the defendant was convicted of attempting section 2(1)(c) when he deceived a ticket collector on the underground into believing that he had paid for the whole of his journey. In fact, he had only purchased tickets for the first few and last few stations in his journey. The court of first instance said that that was a dishonest attempt to obtain an exemption from the liability to pay the excess. On appeal, it was argued that this was an attempt to induce the creditor to forgo payment of part under section 2(1)(b). The Court of Appeal held that although this illustrated the overlap between section 2(1)(b) and section 2(1)(c), it did not make liability under section 2(1)(c) wrong.\n\nParagraph 2: The simplicity and convenience of calculating PEG leaves out several important variables. First, the absolute company growth rate used in the PEG does not account for the overall growth rate of the economy, and hence an investor must compare a stock's PEG to average PEG's across its industry and the entire economy to get any accurate sense of how competitive a stock is for investment. A low (attractive) PEG in times of high growth in the entire economy may not be particularly impressive when compared to other stocks, and vice versa for high PEG's in periods of slow growth or recession.\n\nParagraph 3: On January 31 at the tapings of the February 3 episode of Impact!, Fortune, without Flair, who was not at the show due to a torn rotator cuff, turned face by attacking Immortal, when they interfered in a TNA World Heavyweight Championship rematch between Anderson and Hardy, in the process revealing themselves to be the \"they\" Kurt Angle and Crimson had been referring to for the past weeks. A.J. Styles explained that Fortune was not going to allow Bischoff to destroy TNA like he did to World Championship Wrestling (WCW). Flair returned on February 14 at the tapings of the February 17 episode of Impact!, promising Eric Bischoff to bring Fortune and Immortal back together. Later, during a match between A.J. Styles and Immortal member Matt Hardy, Flair came to ringside cheering on Styles, before turning on him and costing him the match, revealing himself still being aligned with Immortal. On March 13 at Victory Road, Fortune scored a clean sweep, when Kazarian successfully defended the X Division Championship in an Ultimate X match against Jeremy Buck, Max Buck and Robbie E, Beer Money, Inc. successfully defended the World Tag Team Championship against Ink Inc. (Jesse Neal and Shannon Moore) and Styles defeated Matt Hardy, managed by Flair, in a singles match. On the following episode of Impact!, Styles was sidelined with a storyline injury, when Immortal's newest member, Bully Ray, aided by Flair, powerbombed him off the entrance stage through a table. On the March 31 episode of Impact!, Christopher Daniels made his return to TNA and aligned himself with Fortune in their battle with Immortal, vowing to avenge his best friend, A.J. Styles. On April 17 at Lockdown, Daniels, Kazarian, Roode and Storm defeated Immortal representatives Ric Flair, Abyss, Bully Ray and Matt Hardy in a Lethal Lockdown match, after Styles made his return and attacked Ray. On the following episode of Impact!, Daniels was officially named a member of Fortune. On May 16 at the tapings of the May 19 episode of Impact Wrestling, Kazarian lost the X Division Championship to Abyss. On June 12 at Slammiversary IX, Styles ended his feud with Bully Ray by losing to him in a Last Man Standing match. On July 10 at Destination X, TNA's first ever all X Division pay-per-view, Fortune members Styles and Daniels faced each other in the main event, with Styles emerging victorious. Fortune resumed their feud with Immortal on the July 14 episode of Impact Wrestling by disguising themselves as clowns and attacking each member of the group, preventing them from interfering in the evening's main event, where Mr. Anderson ended up losing the TNA World Heavyweight Championship to Sting. On August 7 at Hardcore Justice, Styles, Daniels and Kazarian defeated Immortal representatives Abyss, Gunner and Scott Steiner in a six-man tag team match. Two days later, at the tapings of the August 18 episode of Impact Wrestling, Beer Money, Inc.'s record-setting TNA World Tag Team Championship reign ended, when they lost the title to Mexican America (Anarquia and Hernandez).\n\nParagraph 4: Following the events of House of X and Powers of X, the mutants of the world attempt to adjust to their new lives on the Krakoa and face the challenges of building a mutant society. Cyclops, having chosen to live on the Moon, invites his father Corsair to a family dinner and gives him a Krakoan flower so that he is able to visit the island whenever he wants. The Orchis Initiative, still recovering from their defeat during House of X/Powers of X, are dealt another blow when Cyclops, Storm, Magneto and Polaris liberate captured mutants from one of their vaults; however, their director, Devo, is optimistic about his plans to get revenge on the mutants. Arakko, a new sentient island, appears near Krakoa and the two appear to be moving towards one another, so Cyclops, Prestige and Cable head to Arakko to investigate and find the island swarming with monsters. An envoy is sent to meet with the X-Men, but a miscommunication leads to a fight before Prestige is able to facilitate a parley. The envoy reveals that the two islands are reuniting after a long estrangement and later meets with Apocalypse, warning him of a coming danger. When the guardian of the Krakoan gate to the Savage Land is bypassed, Pixie and Anole are attacked by a group of elderly women wielding advanced weaponry who somehow managed to pass through the gate, despite not being mutants. The compromising of one of its gates causes Krakoa great pain, which is felt by the telepaths on the island, prompting the Krakoan Council to send Cyclops, Emma Frost and Sebastian Shaw to investigate. The group, Hordeculture, is composed of radical botanists and bioengineers who, tired of humanity poisoning Earth, have enacted a plan to take control of the world's food supply; however, the emergence of Krakoa has unexpectedly altered their plans and they now require some Krakoan flowers to further their research. They manage to defeat the X-Men and retreat with their samples, while Cyclops and the others report the threat to the council. Meanwhile, Professor X, Magneto, Apocalypse, Cyclops and Gorgon attend an economic conference in Switzerland, where various world dignitaries ask them about their plans as a nation. Professor X senses assault groups closing in on them and sends Cyclops and Gorgon to take care of them while Magneto fields questions, criticising the human race for all of its shortcomings in regards to how it treats its people. Xavier reveals to the dignitaries that their assault teams have been taken care of and that, while he reiterates his love for both humans and mutants, this type of aggressive behaviour will not be tolerated by Krakoa.\n\nParagraph 5: PDA supports the following legislation: S. 1135 the FRAC Act aka Fracturing Responsibility and Awareness of Chemicals Act \"To amend the Safe Drinking Water Act to repeal a certain exemption for hydraulic fracturing, and for other purposes\", H.R. 1175 the FRESHER Act aka Focused Reduction of Effluence and Stormwater runoff through Hydrofracking Environmental Regulation Act \"To amend the Federal Water Pollution Control Act and direct the Secretary of the Interior to conduct a study with respect to stormwater runoff from oil and gas operations\", H.R. 1154 the BREATHE Act aka Bringing Reductions to Energy's Airborne Toxic Health Effects Act \"To amend the Clean Air Act to eliminate the exemption for aggregation of emissions from oil and gas sources\", and H.R. 2825 the CLEANER Act aka Closing Loopholes and Ending Arbitrary and Needless Evasion of Regulations Act \"To require regulation of wastes associated with the exploration, development, or production of crude oil, natural gas, or geothermal energy under the Solid Waste Disposal Act.\"\n\nParagraph 6: During the 1950s, while the airport was still named Uplands and a joint-use civilian/military field, it was the busiest airport in Canada by takeoffs and landings, reaching a peak of 307,079 aircraft movements in 1959, nearly double its current traffic. At the time, the airport had scheduled airline flights by Trans-Canada Air Lines (Toronto, Montreal, and Val-d'Or), Trans Air (Churchill), and Eastern Air Lines (New York via Syracuse and Washington via Montreal). With the arrival of civilian jet travel, the Canadian government built a new field south of the original one, with two much longer runways and a new terminal building designed to handle up to 900,000 passengers/year. The terminal building had been scheduled to open in 1959, but during the opening ceremonies, a United States Air Force F-104 Starfighter went supersonic during a low pass over the airport, and the resultant sonic boom shattered most of the glass in the airport (including the entire north wall) and damaged ceiling tiles, door and window frames, and even structural beams. As a result, the opening was delayed until April 1960. The original terminal building and Trans-Canada Airways/DOT hangar continued in private use on the airport's north field until the Fall 2011 when it was demolished.\n\nParagraph 7:  SH 46 was originally designated on October 20, 1919 as a route from New Braunfels north to Johnson City. On July 13, 1925, the route had been shortened, with the section north of Spring Branch transferred to SH 108.  This alignment of SH 46 only consisted of the portion from US 281 to US 81 in New Braunfels.  US 81 no longer exists today in favor of I-35 and is known as a business loop of I-35. On July 16, 1928, it extended to Seguin. On July 15, 1935, the section from New Braunfels to Seguin was cancelled. On October 26, 1967, the highway was relocated in New Braunfels to the east along the alignment of Loop 337, but still had an eastern terminus at US 81.  The original alignment in New Braunfels was redesignated as Loop 453, but to be signed as a business route of SH 46. On June 21, 1990, the designation of this segment was officially changed to Business 46.  On February 26, 1968, SH 46 was extended to the south from US 81 to I-35, replacing part of Farm to Market Road 25.  On September 28, 1988, the highway was extended at both ends, extending the eastern end south replacing Farm to Market Road 25 from I-35 to FM 78 and then replacing part of Spur 351 from FM 78 to I-10 in Seguin.  The western terminus was extended to the west replacing Ranch to Market Road 475 from US 281 to SH 16.  A portion of this route had been FM 1719 which had been combined with RM 475 in 1951. On May 14, 1990, the highway was extended to its current alignment when it was extended south from I-10 to SH 123 replacing the remainder of Spur 351.\n\nParagraph 8: Stanley M. Sanger, who graduated from Emerson in 1969, and who never set foot in Union Hill until he became a teacher, characterized the Union Hill-Emerson rivalry by saying, \"It's our Mason-Dixon line. You knew Union Hill was north and Emerson was south, and you respected the boundary. It was the natural state of things.\" An old traditional greeting before the game was \"Are we having hot turkey or cold turkey?\", as the loser was said to eat \"cold turkey\", figuratively speaking. Over the decades, coaches were known to zealously guard their game plans and players, who were alert for spies, were often excused from their classes to practice in secret locations. When sharing Roosevelt Stadium for practice, they would use opposite ends of the 50 yard line. While the athletic coaches were not permitted to recruit players from the rival school, students were known to often recruit players from the elementary and middle schools to attend their high schools. A 50 lbs. brass trophy whose base is engraved with scores from every game, was passed back and forth between the two schools, and the winning school was rewarded with a half-day of school on the Monday after the game. According to David Wilcomes, a former football player and later football coach and the last principal of Union Hill High School, the Turkey Game developed a nearly religious significance as a Thanksgiving ritual for Union City citizens, and a loss for one's favored team would cast a pall upon the day's subsequent holiday festivities, commenting, \"If you don’t win, it's a long Thanksgiving dinner.\" Wilcomes, whose father also played for Union Hill, stated that he stopped answering his home following losing games because his strategies would be endlessly reviewed and second-guessed by various relatives. By 2007, the Union City district spent $130,000 annually on football.\n\nParagraph 9: Brian Desmond Smith (September 6, 1940 – August 2, 1995) was a Canadian professional ice hockey player and sportscaster. Smith was born in Ottawa, Ontario, the son of former professional ice hockey player Des Smith and brother of former professional ice hockey goaltender Gary Smith. Smith was a professional ice hockey player from 1960 to 1973, playing 67 games in the National Hockey League (NHL) with the Los Angeles Kings and Minnesota North Stars during the 1967–68 and 1968–69 seasons. He also later played for the Houston Aeros of the World Hockey Association during the 1972–73 season. Following his hockey career, Smith was a broadcaster for CJOH-TV in Ottawa until 1995, when he was shot and killed by gunman Jeffrey Arenburg.\n\nParagraph 10: Ellis Park Stadium (known as Emirates Airline Park for sponsorship reasons) is a rugby union and association football stadium in the city of Johannesburg, Gauteng Province, South Africa. It hosted the final of the 1995 Rugby World Cup, which was won by the country's national team, the Springboks. The stadium was the country's most modern when it was upgraded in 1982 to accommodate almost 60,000 people. Today, the stadium hosts both football and rugby and is also used as a venue for other large events, such as open-air concerts. It has become synonymous with rugby as the only time when rugby was not played at Ellis Park was during 1980 and 1981, when the stadium was under construction during the upgrade.\n\nParagraph 11: In Tactical mode, the player takes command of a team of soldiers in various missions to combat the aliens wherever they might appear. Instead of pushing impersonal armies around on giant maps, the players uses only the team of soldiers assigned to deal with this mission (as of 2.5, the maximum number of player-controlled actors is 12). Tactical mode uses a turn-based system, where the human team and the aliens take turns to make moves. During the player's turn the troops can be ordered to move around, fire their weapons, throw grenades or use other equipment. Each soldier gets a certain number of Time Units (TUs), representing the total time they have to act during the current turn.  All actions in Tactical mode require Time Units to perform and once a soldier is out of Time Units, the soldier cannot do anything more until the next turn. Both aliens and humans can reserve TUs for reaction fire, however, and if the actor sees an enemy perform actions with equal or greater TU cost, during their turn, they will fire. Therefore, soldiers armed with pistols, and other weapons with low TU costs are often able to get the first shot on an enemy armed with a heavier and deadlier weapon. There are many tiers of weapons, such as explosives, projectiles, lasers, plasma, particle beams, and EM guns, each with their strengths and weaknesses (examples being the high accuracy of lasers, but relatively low damage output, or the high damage of particle beams, but low rates of fire and high recoil). Unlike X-COM and many similar games, there is no one \"super weapon\" that the player rushes to and then arms every single soldier with as soon as they can but should rather keep a healthy, balanced arsenal to be effective at different ranges and amounts of cover. Civilians and other bystanders may be found during the mission, either being targeted by the aliens, or just getting in the way while the troops try to protect them. Saving the game is impossible in tactical mode, though you can retry the mission at any time.\n\nParagraph 12: WCAX radio had been a CBS Radio affiliate since 1940, so channel 3 became a CBS television affiliate and has been with the network ever since. As such, until 2017, WCAX-TV was one of the few stations in the United States (not counting network owned-and-operated stations) that has had the same owner, channel number, and primary network affiliation throughout its history. The station did hold a secondary Fox affiliation from 1994 through 1997, carrying that network's sports and children's programming; through this arrangement, WCAX-TV was able to carry Fox's NFL coverage, which consisted of the rights to NFC games that had been held by CBS (and thus aired on WCAX-TV) until 1994. Cable and satellite viewers received the rest of Fox's programming via the Foxnet cable service in northern Vermont, New York City-based superstation WNYW in most areas of the New York side of the market (except for the far southern reaches, which were served by Albany affiliate WXXA-TV), and Rochester affiliate WUHF and later Buffalo affiliate WUTV in southwestern Quebec. The secondary Fox affiliation ended when WFFF-TV (channel 44) signed on in 1997. On October 25, 2006, WCAX-TV upgraded its digital signal to broadcast CBS programming in high definition.\n\nParagraph 13: Not all missense mutations lead to appreciable protein changes. An amino acid may be replaced by an amino acid of very similar chemical properties, in which case, the protein may still function normally; this is termed a neutral, \"quiet\", \"silent\" or conservative mutation. Alternatively, the amino acid substitution could occur in a region of the protein which does not significantly affect the protein secondary structure or function.  When an amino acid may be encoded by more than one codon (so-called \"degenerate coding\") a mutation in a codon may not produce any change in translation; this would be a synonymous substitution and not a missense mutation.\n\nParagraph 14: As the group returns to the village with the survivor Yae, they find one of their comrades extremely sick, due to accidentally getting hit with a poison dart from their assassination of Kato. Their masters angrily berates the group for killing people who weren't their targets, even if they were saving someone else. The group breaks off, and the master takes two assassins with him while Azumi and the rest are expelled from the mission. As the master leaves, their sick comrade commits suicide to prevent him for being a burden to them. Azumi and Hyuga bury their dead comrade, and Hyuga decides to go with Yae. Sometimes later he is confronted by Saru and Bijomaru, and a battle between the assassin and the mercenary ensues. During the battle, Bijomaru uses psychological warfare in addition to swordplay as he explains to a frightened Hyuga that his sword does not contain a hand-guard since he has never had to defend another's blow. As Hyuga lays bleeding and defeated, Bijomaru forces Yae to watch him toy with the dying boy. Saru, uncomfortable and sicken with this lack of respect for another warrior, finishes Hyuga off as an act of mercy, and confronts Bijomaru as well as prevent him from killing Yae. They leave and Yae buries Hyuga. Azumi senses something and soon finds Yae by Hyuga's body. After burying another of her friends, Azumi is convince by Yae to abandon her violent lifestyle to become a woman. Together they begin a journey over the mountains and out of the valley to go and live in peace with Yae's kin in Tangou. Yae socializes Azumi during the journey, dressing her in a kimono and adorning her with make-up, perfume and hair treatment, the first time Azumi has every wore traditional female clothes. Just as they begin to get comfortable during their journey, a band of brigands finds them as they sleep, and attempts to gang rape the young women. Azumi, who has not slept beside her sword as her training normally dictated, is caught off guard, and initially hesitates to do anything but then right before they can rape Yae, Azumi steals the sword of a would-be captor, castrating him before killing all of the brigands and saving Yae. Azumi apologizes to Yae but tells her that sometimes violence is the only way. The experience leaves Azumi to now fully understand that she must obey her training, and complete her mission of assassinating the other two warlords. The next morning she sets off to find her master and comrades, but not before walking Yae to a safe road, telling Yae that she will meet her later, in Tangou.", "answers": ["Paragraph 10"], "length": 3860, "dataset": "passage_retrieval_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "19f648fad34cba29007b0cc95933721f7f8b6a81c237b433"}
{"input": "The text describes the growth and changes that have occurred in the St. Bethlehem area. In the 1960s, the area experienced rapid growth after the relocation of the Trane Company factory. In the 1980s, there was a possibility of annexation to Clarksville, but the vote on this issue narrowly passed. In recent years, the St. Bethlehem post office has become a branch of the Clarksville post office, and St. Bethlehem is no longer recognized as a distinct address. Additionally, a cancer treatment center and a medical center have been opened in the area.", "context": "Paragraph 1: The layout of a store is a significant factor for the maintenance of a thriving business, which can help advance sales and profitability. An effective store layout encourages consumers to shop the entire store and view an extensive assortment of merchandise. The most common forms of store layouts include grid layout, racetrack layout and free form layout. Choosing a store layout depends on the type of store and the nature of the product sold. A grid layout is generally organized in a rectangular shape, which allows customers to shop quickly and maximize shop floor space, ideal for a supermarket or hardware store. A racetrack layout ensures that the consumer only follows one path when browsing the store. This is beneficial in the sense that the consumer will come into contact with every product on the shelf. However, this can irritate customers. Customers may feel that they are being forced to follow a certain path, and can be frustrating when trying to make a quick purchase. Free form layout is a suitable layout for a store that encourages browsing. This type of layout is more relaxed in its structure, which leaves the customer feeling less rushed. The entrance of the store, otherwise known as the transition zone, is an important area in the store. The term \"transition zone\" was first coined by retail anthropologist Paco Underhill. This is an area where all shoppers pass on entry into store, and is significant as this zone is where consumers can observe the stimuli and sense the general vibe of the store. Therefore, thoughts and representations a consumer has about the store and the brand depend on this area. When customers enter the transition zone they need time to adjust to the new environment including the lighting, the temperature and other sights and sounds. Higher profit margin items aren't recommended to be placed in that area because customers don't notice it while they are preoccupied with adjusting to the new environmental stimuli. Spatial design of a retail store is a key aspect when it comes to creating an enjoyable experience, and is also an effective way of communicating with customers. Colour can be considered one of the most important variables when it comes to ambiance in retail. (Van Rom pay, Tania-Dijkstra, Verhoeven, & van Es, 2011). Certain colours that can be considered highly arousing can encourage customers to make purchases out of impulse. Warm colors such and orange, red, and yellow give consumers a sense of excitement, but also provide a sense of anxiety and create a distraction. Recreational shoppers that enjoy a sense of excitement may prefer these high arousal colors. (Van Rompay et al.,. 2011). In general, people prefer cool colours such as green and blue and associate these colours with a sense of calmness and security. Shoppers that are more task oriented are more likely to prefer these cool colours as they bring this calming effect and are also less likely to distract them from the task at hand. The way the furniture such as shelves and racks and seating are set up is a tangible element in store design. A store layout with a higher regard for space can increase customer pleasure, and a store filled with clutter can have the opposite effect. (Van Rompay et al.,. 2011). When It comes to a simple well-spaced layout in a store, task oriented customers find this type of layout to be the most effective, as they can easily locate the items they want without the unnecessary clutter and obstacles in their way.  These simple factors can encourage customers to stay in the store longer and in turn spend more. (Van Rompay et al.,. 2011).\n\nParagraph 2: Faye is introduced to Eddie (Steve Huison) and Anna Windass (Debbie Rush) by her social worker, Hilary Pugsley (Caroline Pegg). After several visits, Faye begins to like the Windasses but the adoption is threatened by the revelation that their son, Gary (Mikey North), has been discharged from the army and will be living with them. Despite this, Faye stays the night at the Windasses' for the first time in February. When Faye visits in March, she is annoyed to discover that Eddie and Anna have been searching her bag and she storms out in a mood. Gary, however, speaks to Faye and convinces her that they can be trusted. When Faye stays overnight, Eddie accidentally washes Faye's blanket, she is furious and tells him that it is the only thing that she has to remember her mother by before insisting on returning to her foster home. Faye later moves in with the Windass family permanently. When Faye and Anna visit neighbour, Fiz Stape (Jenny McAlpine) and her baby Hope, Faye steals a bag containing £500 that Fiz is keeping secret from husband, John (Graeme Hawley). Faye gives Anna the bag as a gift but Anna finds the money and insists Faye tell her where she got it from. Faye admits that she stole it and a box of chocolates from The Kabin and earrings from her foster home that she also gave Anna, making Anna and Eddie worry about Faye's behaviour. Soon after, Anna and Eddie learn from Hilary that Faye's mother has died from a heroin overdose and she urges them to tell Faye. Anna wants to tell her after a picnic that she and Faye had planned but Eddie accidentally tells her. When Eddie leaves for Germany, Faye thinks it is her fault that he left but Anna reassures her that she is not to blame. When Katy Armstrong (Georgia May Foote) falls pregnant, Faye tells her father, Owen (Ian Puleston-Davies), making Katy think Anna told him so Anna asks Faye if she was responsible but she denies it. In November 2011, Faye's adoption becomes official but her happiness is short-lived when she discovers that Owen is dating Anna. Faye is scared that Owen will not want her around but Gary, Owen and Anna promise her that nothing will change. Faye wins the role of Mary in the Bessie Street Primary Nativity, but she suffers an onset of nerves before the play and refuses to participate so Katy takes over and gives birth to her son, Joseph Brown, during the production.\n\nParagraph 3: The play opens at Rocky's residence on Caidoux Street in Montreal's red light district. Rocky receives an unwanted visit from Dawson, a police officer he has been paying off to keep quiet about a murder. Rocky offers Margy, a prostitute who works for him, as payment to Dawson, but she refuses. Dawson leaves without trouble, but swears to return for his money. Margy longs to leave Rocky for a better life, but she currently has no realistic alternative. Rocky leaves for a date with a \"society dame\", whom he plans to seduce and blackmail. Once Rocky has left, Margy receives several visitors. The first is her best friend Agnes, who, despite Margy's warnings about rejection, plans to return home to her parents once she's saved enough money. Margy's second visitor is Gregg, a Royal Navy officer who, while he is a customer, is also a friend. Gregg encourages Margy to follow the fleet around and entertain the military men so she can see the world and get rich. To prove he truly cares about her, he takes her out on a nice date with the money he planned on using for her services. Rocky returns with his \"society dame\" Clara, whom he quickly drugs and hauls into the bedroom once she is unconscious.\n\nParagraph 4: Toney Mountain is an elongated volcanic massif that rises from a basaltic lava plateau. A  wide summit caldera tops the volcano, and is elongated in east-west direction; this orientation is shared with calderas on other volcanoes in Marie Byrd Land and reflects regional tectonic stress. The slopes of the volcano feature parasitic vents and glacial corries, and are much steeper north of the volcano than south of it. Most of the mountain is covered by ice and its eastern sector may be a crater. That the mountain is mostly ice covered makes it difficult to determine its composition, the origin of the elongated shape of the volcano and the volcanological relation between the parasitic cinder cones and the main volcanic pile. Its volume may be about .\n\nParagraph 5: The defeat of the governing centre-right parties came as no surprise as the coalition parties had already been defeated in the 1993 local elections. The majority of the voters were disenchanted with coalition's shock therapy policies and scandals which had already brought about the dismissal of Prime Minister Mart Laar. Laar's premiership was also characterised with internal fights between coalition partners as well as different groups in his own Fatherland party. This led to a split in 1994, when several groups left Fatherland party. The winning KMÜ, while declaring to represent \"right-wing politics\", ran on a populist campaign highly critical of the previous center-right governments, accusing them of injustice, pauperization of the people and selling out people's properties. \"Fatherland\" on the other hand asked in its programme rhetorically, \"whether we would like to let to power those who led us under Soviet rule resolutely towards the abyss, do we want back bread cartons and the oppressing embrace of the great Eastern neighbour, do we want hyperinflation and pension queues? Or do we want to continue building up a free and wealthy society?\". The main slogan of KMÜ was \"Competence, Cooperation, Domestic Peace\"; the \"Fatherland\" ran under slogans \"Choose the Right\" and \"A Choice for the Thinking Person\".\n\nParagraph 6: A larger campus was created out of four converted brownstones beginning at 157 East 74th Street, in Manhattan's Upper East Side. After 1938, the school was known as the Mannes Music School in recognition of the broader course of study that expanded the school well beyond that of a community music school, including the three-year Artist Diploma. When Clara died in 1948, their son Leopold Mannes became president, endowing the school with his fortune from co-inventing Kodachrome film. In 1953 the school began offering a bachelor of science degree and changed its name to the Mannes College of Music. In 1960 it merged with the Chatham Square Music School. In 1984 the school moved to larger quarters on West 85th Street.  In 1989 Mannes joined The New School. In 2005, the New School administration changed the name to Mannes College: the New School for Music. In 2015, the university renamed it Mannes School of Music, and moved it to Arnhold Hall in the West Village. It is now part of the College of Performing Arts at The New School, which also includes the School of Drama and the School of Jazz and Contemporary Music. The College of Performing Arts, including Mannes Prep, has a total of 1,450 students. The students in any of the three schools of the College of Performing Arts can take courses in the three schools (Drama, Jazz, Mannes), no matter which school they are directly enrolled in, expanding the opportunities for self-directed study.\n\nParagraph 7: It was only in 1855 that the idea was raised of founding a school specifically for the education of sons of ministers like the Methodist Church in England had at Kingswood School in Bath. Funds were raised with significant amounts coming from the United States and England. The original site for the school was to be in Portadown but the location was changed, first of all to Dublin. Land was acquired in Dublin but proceedings stalled. Several prominent Belfast Methodists began a campaign to have the school built in Belfast. The Methodist Conference allotted the remaining £2000 left from the purchase of the Dublin site to Belfast so long as they could raise £8000 extra with the added proviso that no building could take place until they had raised £10,000. A last attempt was made 1863 for the building to take place in Portadown but this failed. The necessary money had been raised by 1864 to satisfy the Conference's stipulations but it was held that £10,000 would not be sufficient. Further fundraising missions were made to the United States and England in 1866. These were led by Robinson Scott, Robert Wallace and William McArthur. Wallace would die on this mission in Cincinnati from cholera. However an additional £10,000 was raised. Several subsequent missions took place to fund building work.\n\nParagraph 8: The large grains in interstellar space are probably complex, with refractory cores that condensed within stellar outflows topped by layers acquired during incursions into cold dense interstellar clouds. That cyclic process of growth and destruction outside of the clouds has been modeled to demonstrate that the cores live much longer than the average lifetime of dust mass. Those cores mostly start with silicate particles condensing in the atmospheres of cool, oxygen-rich red-giants and carbon grains condensing in the atmospheres of cool carbon stars.  Red giants have evolved or altered off the main sequence and have entered the giant phase of their evolution and are the major source of refractory dust grain cores in galaxies. Those refractory cores are also called stardust (section above), which is a scientific term for the small fraction of cosmic dust that condensed thermally within stellar gases as they were ejected from the stars. Several percent of refractory grain cores have condensed within expanding interiors of supernovae, a type of cosmic decompression chamber. Meteoriticists who study refractory stardust (extracted from meteorites) often call it presolar grains but that within meteorites is only a small fraction of all presolar dust. Stardust condenses within the stars via considerably different condensation chemistry than that of the bulk of cosmic dust, which accretes cold onto preexisting dust in dark molecular clouds of the galaxy. Those molecular clouds are very cold, typically less than 50K, so that ices of many kinds may accrete onto grains, in cases only to be destroyed or split apart by radiation and sublimation into a gas component. Finally, as the Solar System formed many interstellar dust grains were further modified by coalescence and chemical reactions in the planetary accretion disk. The history of the various types of grains in the early Solar System is complicated and only partially understood.\n\nParagraph 9: When the Trane Company moved its factory into the area in the 1960s, the area exploded in growth, both residentially and commercially. During the 1980s, St. Bethlehem faced possible annexation to Clarksville, though the vote on the annexation barely passed. In recent years, the St. Bethlehem post office has become a branch of the Clarksville post office and St. Bethlehem has ceased to exist as an address.  November 2004 had the opening of the Gateway-Vanderbilt Cancer Treatment Center just off U.S. 79, and in June 2008, the new Gateway Medical Center opened south of U.S. 79, next to the newly constructed Governor's Square Loop.\n\nParagraph 10: Over the years the street vendors have organized themselves into trade unions and associations, and numerous NGO's have started working for them. In fact, The National Association of Street Vendors of India (NASVI) based in Delhi, is a federation of 715 street vendor organizations, trade unions and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). Kolkata has two such unions, namely the Bengal Hawkers Association and the Calcutta Hawkers' Men Union. In September, 2012, long-awaited Street Vendors (Protection of Livelihood and Regulation of Street Vending) Act was introduced in the Lok Sabha (Lower of Indian Parliament) aimed at providing social security and livelihood rights, and regulated the prevalent license system. The Bill was passed in the Lok Sabha on 6 September 2013 and by the Rajya Sabha (upper house) on 19 February 2014. The bill received the assent of the President of India on 4 March 2014. Only three states have implemented the bill as of April 2017. The bill handed governance over public space and vendors over to municipalities. Although, one of the main purposes of the Street Vendors Act was to allow the vendors to have a voice in governance, the bill made conditions more difficult for vendors as they have become more heavily scrutinized.\n\nParagraph 11: As war raged in Europe, Fanning intensified her preparations for any eventuality. When two German auxiliary cruisers visited Norfolk in September 1916, Fanning acted as part of their escort while they sailed in United States territorial waters. On 8 October, Fanning put out of Newport, Rhode Island, to search for the crews of ships sunk not far from Nantucket Light Ship by the German submarine . The destroyer recovered six survivors and landed them at Newport, Rhode Island the next day. The presence of U-58 led to the speculation that a secret German submarine base might exist in the Long Island Sound—Block Island Sound area; Fanning searched from 12 to 14 October for evidence of such a base but found nothing, and returned to her regular operating schedule.\n\nParagraph 12: The Stone Age setting allowed for gags and word plays involving rocks and minerals. For example, San Antonio becomes \"Sand-and-Stony-o\"; the country to the south of Bedrock's land is called \"Mexirock\" (Mexico). Travel to \"Hollyrock\", a parody of Hollywood, usually involves an \"airplane\" flight — the \"plane\", in this case, is often shown as a giant pterosaur, with the fuselage strapped to its back. Sun Valley becomes \"Stone Valley\" and is run by \"Conrad Hailstone\" (Conrad Hilton). The last names \"Flintstone\" and \"Rubble\", as well as other common Bedrock surnames such as \"Shale\" and \"Quartz\", are in line with these puns, as are the names of Bedrock's celebrities: \"Cary Granite\" (Cary Grant), \"Stony Curtis\" (Tony Curtis), \"Ed Sulleyrock/Sulleystone\" (Ed Sullivan), \"Rock Pile/Quarry/Hudstone\" (Rock Hudson), \"Ann-Margrock\" (Ann-Margret), \"Jimmy Darrock\" (James Darren), \"Alvin Brickrock\" (Alfred Hitchcock), \"Perry Masonary/Masonite\" (Perry Mason as played by Raymond Burr), \"Mick Jadestone and The Rolling Boulders\" (Mick Jagger and The Rolling Stones, called \"Mick Jagged and the Stones\" in the live-action film The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas''), \"Eppy Brianstone\" (Brian Epstein) and \"The Beau Brummelstones\" (The Beau Brummels). Once, while visiting one of Bedrock's houses of \"Haute Couture\" with Wilma, Betty even commented on the new \"Jackie Kennerock (Jackie Kennedy) look\". In some cases, the celebrity featured also provided the voice: \"Samantha\" and \"Darrin\" from Bewitched were voiced by Elizabeth Montgomery and Dick York. Examples from the above list include Ann-Margret, Curtis, Darren, and the Beau Brummels. Other celebrities, such as \"Ed Sulleystone\" and \"Alvin Brickrock\", were rendered by impersonators. Some of Bedrock's sports heroes include: football player \"Red Granite\" (Red Grange), wrestler \"Bronto Crushrock\" (Bronko Nagurski), golfer \"Arnold Palmrock\" (Arnold Palmer), boxers \"Floyd Patterstone\" (Floyd Patterson) and \"Sonny Listone\" (Sonny Liston), and baseball players \"Sandy Stoneaxe\" (Sandy Koufax), \"Lindy McShale\" (Lindy McDaniel), \"Roger Marble\" (Roger Maris), and \"Mickey Marble\" or \"Mickey Mantlepiece\" (Mickey Mantle). Ace reporter \"Daisy Kilgranite\" (Dorothy Kilgallen) was a friend of Wilma. Monster names include \"Count Rockula\" (Count Dracula), Rockzilla (Godzilla), Rocky Races Penelope Pitrock (Wacky Races Penelope Pitstope) and \"The Frankenstone Monster\" (Frankenstein's monster), and locations such as RocDonald's (McDonald's), Toy-S-aurus (Toys \"R\" Us), Bronto King (Burger King) and Bank of Ameroka (Bank of America)\n\nParagraph 13: Skullflower was formed when Bower joined up with Stefan Jaworzyn, Gary Mundy and Stuart Dennison in 1987 having previously worked under the name Pure with Alex Binnie and Alex Windsor. Unlike most of their immediate contemporaries in the London-based industrial underground, they used traditional rock instruments such as guitars and drums as well as  tapes, synths etc.  The line-up could be fluid, with members of contemporaries such as Whitehouse, Coil and Ramleh contributing. The group are often cited as having been a strong influence on Justin Broadrick of Godflesh and, indeed, Broadrick later released two Skullflower albums on his HeadDirt label. Jaworzyn left the band with bassist Anthony DiFranco and guitarist Russell Smith (formerly of Terminal Cheesecake) joining. The unit moved further and further away from any recognisable rock genre with albums such as Obsidian Shaking Codex and Transformer showcasing a free-flowing, rootless brand of drone music, often adding reeds and strings, sometimes played by John Godbert. Skullflower was put on hold around 1997 with Bower pursuing other activities, and triumphantly revived in 2003, with Bower enlisting people like Mark Burns, Neil Campbell, Michael Flower and Colin Potter (of Nurse With Wound) for new material. Although he recorded some of these albums (including Tribulation) alone, many of the group's live commitments were fulfilled by a duo of Bower and Lee Stokoe (who records solo as Culver). A show at the 2008 Colour Out Of Space festival saw Bower and Stokoe being joined by Alex Binnie and Stuart Dennison. At April 2009, the full line-up of Skullflower was Bower, Stokoe, Dennison and Samantha Davies. He and Samantha Davies also record together as Voltigeurs. 2011 saw the release of 'Fucked on a Pile of Corpses' more visceral/Black Metal/and an almost return to the industrial sounds of Total. Fittingly, it was released on long running English Industrial label Cold Spring. At the close of 2011 the full band line up is Bower, Sokoe, Davies and West Yorkshire Patriot, George Proctor (Mutant Ape).", "answers": ["Paragraph 9"], "length": 3599, "dataset": "passage_retrieval_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "6db5d771ecd6ffbbc157fb27596a8e1ebda3cf41dde1173b"}

When Argentine landing craft approached Stanley Harbour, Marine Rick Overall fired an anti-tank round, which allegedly penetrated an Argentine Marine Landing Craft Vehicle Personnel and killed everyone on board. At the same time, Lieutenant-Commander Hugo Jorge Santillán sent an Amtrack Amphibious Recovery Vehicle to repair damaged amphibious armoured personnel carriers near the Ionospheric Research Station. Fireman Neville Bennett, who documented the Argentine occupation, observed one of the personnel carriers in trouble after losing a track. A helicopter was sent to assist, and after fixing the issue, they moved towards the naval fuel depot.", "context": "Paragraph 1: Section 24 of the Australian Constitution requires that the number of members in the House of Representatives be, as nearly as possible, twice the number of members in the Senate. The most important effect of the \"nexus\" in the Australian Constitution is to prevent the dilution of the collective voting power of the Senate, which represents the Australian states equally, in any joint sitting of both houses following a double dissolution election. The nexus ensures that Senators will always have about one-third of the votes in a joint sitting, and Members of the House of Representatives about two-thirds. The referendum question asked the public to vote on whether \"the number of members of the House of Representatives may be increased without necessarily increasing the number of Senators\". It was defeated, with 59.75% of voters voting \"No\" to this question.\n\nParagraph 2: In February 1944, the Army relocated to the area of the Perekop Isthmus. The Crimean Offensive was launched across the Perekop Isthmus on 8 April 1944 by elements of the 2nd Guards Army and 51st Army, under the 4th Ukrainian Front. On 1 May 1944 the army comprised the 13th Guards Rifle Corps (3rd, 24th and 87th Guards Rifle Divisions); 54th Rifle Corps (126th, 315th, and 387th Rifle Divisions); 55th Rifle Corps (33rd Guards, 87th, and 347th Rifle Divisions); and the 78th and 116th Fortified Regions. In cooperation with other troops of the 4th Ukrainian Front and the Black Sea Fleet, Sevastopol was liberated on May 9, 1944. In May and June the 2nd Guards Army was relocated to the area of the cities Dorogobuzh Elnya. On May 20, was moved to the Reserve of the Supreme High Command and on July 8 the unit was a part of the 1st Baltic Front. By that time, it consisted of the 11th and the 13th and 54th Guards Rifle Corps. In this structure, on 5–20 July 1944 took part in the Vilnius Offensive/operation at the end of July, and in the Siauliai offensive reflect enemy counterattacks west and north-west of Siauliai. In October, the 2nd Guards Army participated in the Memel offensive. On December 20 it was reassigned to the 3rd Belorussian Front.\n\nParagraph 3: Emma Foulkes and Petrina Bloodworth were the first same-sex couple to marry in Georgia just one hour after the Supreme Court's ruling. Fulton County Judge Jane Morrison officiated at their marriage at the Fulton County Courthouse in Atlanta. The Mayor of Atlanta, Kasim Reed, said, \"Today is a historic occasion for the City of Atlanta, for Georgia and for America. The Supreme Court's ruling marks a momentous victory for freedom, equality, and love. It is clear that the arc of history continues to bend ever closer toward justice.\" Jeff Graham, the executive director of Georgia Equality, issued the following statement: \"The United States Supreme Court has ruled in favor of the freedom to marry across the nation. It's a national victory – and it means that soon, thousands of loving, committed couples throughout the United States – including our state of Georgia – will be able to say 'I do' and at last be respected under the law.\" Christie and Kindra Baer, a couple for 13 years, were the first to receive a marriage license in Savannah, and Moriah Martin and Jordyn Dolente were the first to marry in Athens just after 2 p.m. at the Clarke County Courthouse. Taylor Nash and Kelly Martinelli were the first same-sex couple to marry in Gwinnett County. Representative John Lewis welcomed the court ruling, saying, \"Races don't fall in love, genders don't fall in love--people fall in love.\", and Representative Hank Johnson called it \"historic\". Bernice King, CEO of The King Center and daughter of Martin Luther King Jr., said, \"It is my sincere prayer that this ruling helps to alleviate violence, in all forms, including physical force, toward our LGBT brothers and sisters; and that the Supreme Court ruling encourages the global community to respect and embrace all LGBT global citizens with dignity and love. In the words of our founder and my mother, Coretta Scott King, 'The Civil Rights Movement that I believe in thrives on unity and inclusion, not division and exclusion.'\" State Senator Vincent Fort said the decision was \"a victory not just for the LGBT community but for all Americans who believe in justice\", and Rob Wright, the Episcopal Bishop of Atlanta, said, \"In the days ahead, whatever your position, I ask you to keep close to your heart and lips the words of scripture, that \"God is love.\" Christ's church is trans-political, above all earthly partisanship. Therefore, if love has won even a small victory today, then let us rejoice.\"\n\nParagraph 4: Once David realizes who she is, he is quickly drawn to Sabrina and invites her to join him at a party at the mansion, and then later invites her to the indoor tennis court. When Linus sees this, he fears that David's imminent marriage to Elizabeth Tyson may be endangered. If that engagement were broken it would ruin a profitable opportunity for a great corporate merger between Larrabee Industries and Elizabeth's very wealthy father's business. Instead of confronting David about his irresponsibility, Linus pretends to sympathize with him. Linus manipulates David to sit down on champagne glasses he has placed in his pockets, and David is incapacitated for a few days.\n\nParagraph 5: In 1993, Purvis ran the most races in a season for his career. Making eight starts, Purvis ran three races for Finch and five races for Morgan-McClure Motorsports in their No. 4 Eastman Kodak Chevy. At Talladega in July, Purvis was able to top his previous best start with a 21st, as well as enjoying the best runs of his career. He earned his best qualifying effort of 18th at Richmond and quickly followed it up with his career-best 16th-place finish. The next week, he broke his best finish again with a 13th-place finish at Dover and also added a 17th at Martinsville.\n\nParagraph 6: The traditional costume of the Kadazandusun is generally called the \"Koubasanan costume\", made out of black velvet fabric with various decorations using beads, flowers, coloured buttons, golden laces, linen, and unique embroidery designs. The traditional costume that is commonly commercialised as the cultural icon of the Kadazandusun people is the Koubasanan costume from the Penampang district. The koubasanan costume from the Penampang district consists of 'Sinuangga' worn by women and 'Gaung' for men. 'Sinuangga' comes with a waistband called 'Himpogot' (made out of connected silver coins, also known as the money belt), 'Tangkong' (made out of copper loops or rings fastened by strings or threads), 'Gaung' (decorated with gold lace and silver buttons) and a hat that is called 'Siga' (made out of weaved dastar fabric). The decorations and designs of the koubasanan costume are usually varied by region. For example, the koubasanan dress design for Kadazandusun women of Penampang usually comes in a set of sleeveless blouse combined with long skirts and no hats, while the koubasanan dress design for Kadazandusun women of Papar comes in a set of long sleeves blouse combined with knee-length skirts and wore with a siung hat. There are over 40 different designs of the Koubasanan costume across Sabah that belong to different tribes of the Kadazandusun community.\n\nParagraph 7: Chris and Charity eventually realise that Zoe is ill and she has to be sectioned. While in hospital, she is diagnosed with schizophrenia. Charity supports Zoe when she realizes she is pregnant and considers giving the baby up for adoption, revealing she had a baby girl that she put up for adoption. Charity is shocked when Paddy (Dominic Brunt) and Emily Kirk's (Kate McGregor) foster daughter, Debbie Jones (Charley Webb), realises that Charity is her birth mother. Charity initially refuses contact with Debbie but comforts her when her mother dies. Despite her reserve, she and Debbie bond so Charity files for custody and wins, much to Paddy and Emily's dismay. Charity is delighted when Chris and Debbie bond and he suggests adopting her. Cain later realizes that he is Debbie's father and bonds with his daughter, leading him and Charity to begin an affair. Chris sees them and throws her out. A month later, Charity goes to Home Farm to discuss her marriage, hoping they will reconcile. However, Chris knows that he has an inoperable brain tumour and frames Charity for his murder, before committing suicide. The police arrest Charity after finding her fingerprints on Chris's glass and her signature on an order for poison. She and Cain blame each other so Charity is released on bail when she learns that she is pregnant and moves in with Marlon. After getting drunk, they sleep together. Charity realises Zoe knows that Chris killed himself and kisses her but Zoe testifies that Charity killed Chris so Charity is found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment. While in prison, she gives birth to a son who she names Noah (Alfie Mortimer). Unsure of Noah's paternity, she arranges for Zoe, Cain and Marlon to do a DNA test and the results show that Chris is Noah's father. Charity strikes a deal with Zoe – she can have custody of Noah in return for £20,000 and evidence that Chris committed suicide. Zoe agrees and Charity is released. Zoe refuses to allow Charity any contact with Noah, who she calls Christopher, and plans to adopt him but permission is refused, due to already having 2 children (Chris's eldest son, Joseph (Oliver Young), and her daughter, Jean (Megan Pearson), running Home Farm and her mental health issues. Social Services ask Charity to decide if she wants to raise him or put him up for adoption elsewhere. She chooses to raise him and Zoe returns him to Charity.\n\nParagraph 8: This disease is named after J. Malouf, who performed a case study on a family with this disease in 1985. The study consisted of two sisters displaying the above symptoms. The parents of the sisters were first-degree cousins, suggesting the possibility of a genetic disorder. In 1992, a new case study of an 18-year-old female conducted by Narahara et al. resulted in similar findings as Malouf. Although the prevalence of Malouf syndrome is unknown, there are less than 20 affected families discussed in literature. While there is no specific cure for Malouf syndrome, symptoms can be treated. The treatment options individualized and should be determined by a doctor or specialist.\n\nParagraph 9: In jail, Isaiah is placed in the same cell as Nat Love, a famous gunslinger, and leader of a gang.  Isaiah quickly expresses his awe and admiration, saying he would love to receive whatever tutelage he could from him.  Nat simply tells him to enjoy the day as Nat is scheduled to be hung the next day.  Bloomington arrives to gloat at Isaiah's capture, and Isaiah vows to come back from the grave for revenge if need be.  When Isaiah mentions Jedediah's name, Nat instantly tells Isaiah that he was alive, grew up to be a good man and a gunslinger in his own right, but lost a duel to the Undertaker.  Isaiah then vows to also kill the Undertaker as well.  That night, Cortina arrives and breaks Isaiah out of jail, with Nat also escaping.  When they're about to part ways, Isaiah shoots a man that had shot and missed Cortina, thus saving his life once more.  Nat steals Isaiah's horse, with Isaiah having to ride with Cortina yet constantly falling off his horse as they followed Nat back to his hideout where he's met with open arms by his gang.  Isaiah then manages to convince Nat to allow them to stay for a few days, and shortly after meets the rest of his gang:  Stagecoach Mary, and a group of nuns who also serve as accomplices.  During their time there, Isaiah is constantly mocked and disrespected by Nat's gang as he comically and dangerously tries to practice gunslinging.  Nat Love takes matters into his own hands and forces Isaiah to shoot a can off his hand at gunpoint, telling Isaiah that he would kill him if he hit him.  Isaiah then makes his first successful shot and is told by Nat to plan on dying whenever he shoots as someone.  Isaiah then learns to ride a horse after Nat compares riding a horse to being with a woman, and Stagecoach Mary takes his virginity to give him a basis after some mockery from the men.  Isaiah continues to work on his skills and excels quickly, much to Nat's wonder and admiration.  One night Nat calls for a meeting in which he declares that Isaiah needs a gunslinger name.  After some mockery from some of the gang members, Nat asks Isaiah what it is that he's proud of, as a man must have a name that he can be proud of.  Isaiah instantly names his half-Cherokee father, who died fighting for his convictions.  It is then that he is given the name \"The Cherokee Kid\".\n\nParagraph 10: In the meantime, Corporal Stefan York and his section had been patiently manning their hiding place on the western end of Navy Point. As Argentine landing craft were reported approaching Stanley Harbour, Marine Rick Overall fired a Carl Gustav anti-tank round which the British, in an interview with military historian Martin Middlebrook, claimed to have penetrated the side of an Argentine Marine Landing Craft Vehicle Personnel, killing all on board. According to Lieutenant-Commander Hugo Jorge Santillán, an Amtrack Amphibious Recovery Vehicle around this time had entered Stanley Harbour after the capture of Government House, to carry out emergency repairs on the two amphibious armoured personnel carriers that had been damaged in the earlier gun-battle near the Ionospheric Research Station.Local fireman Neville Bennett kept a dairy of the Argentine occupation and would report seeing one amphibious personnel carrier in difficulty after losing one of its tracks, \"Some of the APCs were to be seen moving down the other side of the harbour. One appeared to be in difficulty, I think it had shed a track. One of the helicopters goes over to look at it, all fixed and they move off again towards the naval fuel depot with its tanks and diesel and other stores.\"\n\nParagraph 11: A more modern form of the EPG, associated with both television and radio broadcasting, is the interactive [electronic] programming guide (IPG, though often referred to as EPG). An IPG allows television viewers and radio listeners to navigate scheduling information menus interactively, selecting and discovering programming by time, title, channel or genre using an input device such as a keypad, computer keyboard or television remote control. Its interactive menus are generated entirely within local receiving or display equipment using raw scheduling data sent by individual broadcast stations or centralized scheduling information providers. A typical IPG provides information covering a span of seven or 14 days.\n\nParagraph 12: Burris left the 2016 season opening game in the third quarter after injuring the pinky finger on his throwing hand. He was replaced by backup quarterback Trevor Harris who was brought in as a free-agent during the offseason to replace the 41-year old Burris in the event of an injury or diminished performance. Initially it was reported that Burris would miss only one game, however he was quickly transferred to the six-game injured list. After an injury to backup quarterback Harris, Burris returned early from his hand injury to play in Weeks 6 and 7. In a halftime interview during their Week 7 match against the Eskimos Henry Burris sounded off in response to criticism from some of the TSN staff regarding his poor performance in Week 6 and the impressive play by Harris before his injury. He was quoted as saying, \"So all the people talking junk out there, you can take that and shove it. All right? That's all I have to say\". Following a bye in Week 8 Burris started in Week 9 but was once again unable to lead the Redblacks to victory. Harris returned to the starting lineup from Week 10 through 15 with mixed results. Burris returned to the starting role in Week 17 (the fourth last week of the regular season). Ottawa split their remaining 4 games, winning 2 and losing 2 to finish below .500 with a record of 8-9-1. This was the first time in CFL history that a team with a losing record finished first in their division. Following their first round bye Burris led the Redblacks to an East Division Final victory over the Edmonton Eskimos in a snowstorm, advancing the team to its second consecutive Grey Cup game. In the 104th Grey Cup, Despite suffering a slight knee injury during warmups, Burris passed for 461 yards and 3 touchdowns leading the Redblacks to a 39-33 over time win over the Calgary Stampeders to win the Grey Cup for Ottawa for the first time in 40 years. At the Grey Cup parade two days following the victory Burris was in crutches stating he would likely need surgery to repair his knee which he injured in warm-ups before the Grey Cup game. He also told the 40,000 fans in attendance that he would delay his decision regarding the future of his playing career until January 2017.\n\nParagraph 13: Vancouver made the trade not with the intention of keeping Vanbiesbrouck, but rather in an attempt to keep other players on their roster from being drafted. Rules of the 1993 NHL Expansion Draft allowed teams to protect one goaltender, nine forwards and five defensemen. Additional rules stated that teams could only lose one goaltender in the draft and prevented teams from losing both a defenseman and a goaltender. Prior to the draft, Florida Panthers general manager Bobby Clarke won a coin-toss giving them the first pick in the draft. Thus, with their first selection, the Panthers picked Vanbiesbrouck to be the number one goaltender for their team. Upon his arrival in Florida, Vanbiesbrouck went on a \"mall tour\" to help elevate the visibility of the franchise and made an informative video explaining ice hockey terms for Blockbuster, then owners of the franchise. In January 1994, he made his return to Madison Square Garden. In his first game back to his former home venue, Vanbiesbrouck made 51 saves, ultimately losing the game 3–2. During the season, he was also named to the All-Star game as the Panthers' sole representative. In the game, Vanbiesbrouck played the third period, made six saves and was credited with the win. At the completion of his first season in Florida, he played in 57 games posting a 21–25–11 record, registering a 2.53 GAA, and his career best save percentage of .924 ranked him second in the league. Vanbiesbrouck was named a Second Team NHL All-Star and was shortlisted for the Hart and Vezina Trophies. His 21 wins tied the Minnesota North Stars' Cesare Maniago's record for the most by an expansion goaltender. The record was later passed by Ron Tugnutt during the Columbus Blue Jackets' inaugural season. The Panthers finished the season with 83 points, one point behind the New York Islanders, for the eighth and final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference. The following season was shortened due to the 1994–95 NHL lockout. Consequently, Vanbiesbrouck played in just 37 games registering a 14–15–4 record. He lowered his GAA from the previous year to 2.47 and increased his shutout total from one to four. However, his save percentage dropped to .914. The Panthers again fell a point short of making the playoffs.", "answers": ["Paragraph 10"], "length": 3368, "dataset": "passage_retrieval_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "0fad908bd27911fe79e7d2195b2ae05d784e8b75388478f3"}
{"input": "The text discusses the praise and recognition received by saxophonist Louise Linden, a female wind player, in the late 19th century. Reviewers commended her technique, breath control, and ability to play difficult passages without taking breath. The saxophone itself was described as a novelty instrument with a unique sound that resembled a mixture of clarinet, saxhorn, and bassoon. Despite the positive reviews, Linden's gender was often mentioned as a surprising factor due to the rarity of female wind players. The text also mentions another female musician, cornetist Anna Theresa Berger, who was comparable to Linden in skill and received similar reviews. Overall, Linden's performances were seen as remarkable and deserving of admiration.", "context": "Paragraph 1: The January 1906 general election returned Sheehan unopposed. The IPP deputy leader John Dillon set about splitting the ILLA, forming a new ILLA group under its secretary, the Dillon and IPP loyal J. J. O'Shee (MP), – to confine Sheehan's movement, otherwise \"the whole of Munster will be poisoned and no seat safe on vacancy\". Later that year, the Irish Party mounted a feud against Sheehan for being a \"factionist\" by supporting a policy of Conciliation and for not allowing his labourers' movement be subservient to the Party autocracy, his reason being \"to realize the great democratic principle of the government of the people, by the people and for the people\". Also for not adhering to the party pledge and expelled both him and John O'Donnell from its ranks. It deprived them both of the quarterly party stipend provided for attendance at Westminster, particularly damaging because the first regular salary for an MP was set in 1911. Sheehan retaliated by resigning his seat in November and challenged the IPP to stand against him. He was re-elected unopposed as Ireland's first Independent Nationalist Labour MP on 31 December 1906. His income from then depended on constituent's collections at church gates on Sundays.\n\nParagraph 2: Different sources give very different percentages. in 2006, fewer than 7% attend church or mosque regularly (at least once a month). Similar studies were done in 1966, 1979, and 1996, showing a steady decline of religious affiliation. That this trend is likely to continue is illustrated by the fact that in the age group under 35, 69% are non-affiliated. However, those who are religious tend to be more profoundly religious than in the past. Religious belief is also regarded as a very personal affair, as is illustrated by the fact that 60% of self-described believers are not affiliated with any organized religion. There is stronger stress on the positive sides of belief, with Hell and the concept of damnation being pushed into the background. 53% of the Dutch population believe in a form of life after death, of which a third believe in some kind of heaven (with or without a god), but with only 4% believing in Hell. Of the entire population, 10% believe in a reunion of family and loved ones, and 10% in the survival of the spirit, soul or consciousness. Of the people who answer positively to whether they believe there is life after death, 15% think of the afterlife as \"living on in the memory of others\". Furthermore, 6% believe in reincarnation generally, and 5% in reincarnation in human form exclusively. One-quarter of non-believers sometimes pray, but more in a sense of meditative self-reflection. Atheism, agnosticism, and Christian atheism are also on the rise, and are becoming broadly accepted. The expected rise of spirituality (ietsism) has come to a halt according to research in 2015. In 2006 40% of respondents considered themselves spiritual, while by 2015 this had dropped to 31%. The number who believed in the existence of a higher power (theists and certain ietsists) fell from 36% to 28% over the same period.\n\nParagraph 3: In 1858, at the suggestion of Dickens, Toole joined Benjamin Webster's company at the Adelphi Theatre and established his popularity as a farceur, creating, among other parts, Joe Spriggins in Ici on parle français by T. H. Williams, Augustus de Rosherville in The Willow Copse by Boucicault, in Birthplace of Podgers, Tom Dibbles in Good for Nothing by J. B. Buckstone, and in Bengal Tiger. He remained at the Adelphi as principal low comedian for nine years, frequently partnering with Paul Bedford, whose sedate comic style complemented his own contrasting energetic style. His most successful roles there included Bob Cratchit in A Christmas Carol; or, Past, Present, and Future (1859), the title role in Asmodeus in 1859, Peter Familias in The Census by William Brough (among many pieces by Brough), Milwood in George de Barnwell by H. J. Byron (1862), Caleb Plummer in Dot (1862), by Dion Boucicault, Pitcher in The Area Belle (1864), and Prudent in The Fast Family by B. Webster, Jr. His other great successes there were as Mr. Tetterby in an adaptation of Dickens' The Haunted Man and of a frightened servant in Boucicault's The Phantom. He played a season in 1867 with the impressive new company at Queen's Theatre that included Irving, Henrietta Hodson, Lionel Brough and Charles Wyndham, where he appeared in such works a H. J. Byron's Dearer Than Life, as Michael Garner, and W. S. Gilbert's La Vivandière, as Sergeant Sulpizio.  Frederick Waddy wrote of Toole in 1873 that as Harry Coke in Off the Line, \"Mr. Toole makes one of those perfect pictures of everyday life of the lower class in which he has so often proved himself a consummate artist. But in low comedy and broad farce it would be difficult to find an actor of equal merit....  As Paul Pry he keeps his audience in a roar whenever he is on the stage\".\n\nParagraph 4: Howell was born about 1664 at Deptford and received his education at Lewisham Grammar School, where he was a foundation scholar, and Jesus College, Cambridge, where he graduated BA in 1684 and MA in 1688. He was a zealous member of the nonjuring party, and probably left the university in 1688. In 1708 the Lord Mayor ordered that the Oath of Abjuration should be tendered to him. On 2 October 1712 he was ordained priest by George Hickes, suffragan bishop of Thetford, in his oratory at St. Andrew's, Holborn. In the list of nonjurors at the end of Kettlewell's Life it is stated that Howell was at the Revolution master of the school at Epping, and curate of Estwich, Suffolk, but there is no such parish in that county, and Eastwick, Hertfordshire, may be meant. He composed the speech which William Paul, a nonjuring clergyman, who was convicted of taking part in the rebellion, delivered at his execution on 13 July 1716. He also wrote a pamphlet for private circulation entitled The Case of Schism in the Church of England truly stated. In this seditious work George I was denounced as a usurper, and all that had been done in the church, subsequently to Archbishop Sancroft's deprivation, was condemned as illegal and uncanonical. Howell was arrested at his house in Bull Head Court, Jewin Street, and about a thousand copies of the pamphlet were seized there. A prosecution was first instituted against Redmayne, the printer, who was sentenced to pay a fine of 500l., to be imprisoned for five years, and to find security for his good behaviour for life. Howell was tried at the Old Bailey on 28 February 1716–17 before the Lord Mayor and Justices Powys and Dormer. The jury found him guilty, and two days afterwards he was sentenced to pay a fine of 500l., to be imprisoned for three years without bail, to find four sureties of 500l. each, and himself to be bound in 1,000l. for his good behaviour during life, and to be twice whipped. On his hotly protesting against the last indignity on the ground that he was a clergyman, the court answered that he was a disgrace to his cloth, and that his ordination by the so-called bishop of Thetford was illegal. By the court's direction the common executioner there and then roughly pulled his gown off his back. A few days later, on his humble petition to the King, the corporal punishment was remitted. He died in Newgate on 19 July 1720.\n\nParagraph 5: On June 15, 2005, The Fuse was announced for released in two months' time; alongside this, the artwork and track listing was posted online. Pennywise toured Europe with Stretch Arm Strong in June and July 2005, and included appearanves at the Greenfield, Feria and Fury festivals. On July 5, 2005, \"Knocked Down\" was posted online; followed by \"Disconnect\" near the end of the month. The Fuse was released on August 9, 2005, through Epitaph Records. In September 2005, they toured the East Coast with H2O, Death by Stereo and A Wilhelm Scream. For the next two months, they went on a North American trek with Bad Religion, and supported Sick of It All for a handful of East Coast shows. Pennywise opened 2006 with a month-long US West Coast tour, with support from No Use for a Name, the Suicide Machines, and Love Equals Death. An Australian tour was intended to follow, but the band cancelled citing \"unforeseen circumstances\". On April 26, 2006, a music vieo was released for \"Knocked Down\". In July 2006, they embarked on an Australian tour with support from Goons of Doom. They then went on a Canadian tour with Circle Jerks, Ignite, and Brown Brigade, before playing a few East Coast US shows.\n\nParagraph 6: Akins did not release another single until his signing with BNA Records in 2005, when he released the No. 57-peaking \"Kiss My Country Ass\", which was later recorded by Blake Shelton for his 2010 extended play Hillbilly Bone. It was included on his album People Like Me, which was originally to have been released via BNA on June 14, 2006, but was ultimately self-released in June 2007. \"If Heaven Wasn't So Far Away\" was the second single from People Like Me, which failed to chart for Akins, but was later recorded by Justin Moore, whose version went to number 1. Down South followed in 2008, as did its only single, the title track, which again failed to chart.\n\nParagraph 7: McNamara left Syracuse as one of the most beloved players in Orange basketball history; his final regular-season game at the Carrier Dome on March 5, 2006, was the arena's first-ever advance sellout for a basketball game. The final attendance of 33,633, at that time an all-time NCAA record for an on-campus regular-season game, included more than 3,000 fans—dubbed \"McNamara's Band\" by the media—from the Scranton area (according to media reports more than 60 buses made the two-hour trip from Scranton to Syracuse for the game). Among those people coming up from Scranton were McNamara's parents, who were in attendance for every game in his college career. Syracuse lost the game to highly ranked Villanova University; McNamara led all scorers with 29 points.\n\nParagraph 8: It is difficult to estimate the number of people who emigrated from Ottoman and Mandate Palestine between the start of the Zionist movement and the establishment of the State of Israel, or the proportion of emigrants compared with the number of immigrants into the country. Estimates of the extent of emigration during the period of the initial Zionist settlement in Palestine with the First Aliyah, as well as the Second Aliyah, range between approximately 40% (an estimation made by Joshua Kaniel) of all immigrants and up to 80–90%. Although the precise number is unknown, it is known that many of the European Jewish immigrants during this period gave up after a few months and left, often suffering from hunger and disease. In the latter part of the Fourth Aliyah, during 1926–1928, the mandatory authorities recorded 17,972 Jewish immigrants, and the Jewish Agency counted about 1,100 more who were not registered with the authorities. During the same period, the authorities recorded 14,607 Jewish emigrants. Overall, it is estimated that about 60,000 Jews emigrated from Mandatory Palestine between 1923 and 1948, and that the total number of Jews who emigrated from the start of the Zionist project to the establishment of the state was around 90,000.\n\nParagraph 9: Merrill was born in The Bronx, New York City on February 19, 1951, the son of two jazz musicians, singer Helen Merrill and saxophone/clarinet player Aaron Sachs. He went to Aiglon College in Switzerland from age 9 to 13, a British-style boarding school. On returning to the United States, he attended schools in New York and Los Angeles, and at Sophia University (a private Jesuit research university in Tokyo, Japan). He started his semi-pro career in New York City aged 14 when he began playing in Greenwich Village's Cafe Wha? with the bands The Kaleidoscope, The Rayne, and Watertower West. The groups played the club during the 1966–1968 period.\n\nParagraph 10: Former Australian Boomer and 1964 Olympic representative Ken Cole was signed as coach of the Adelaide 36ers for the 1985 NBL season. Under Cole (who had previously coached in South Australia in the 1970s), the 36ers became one of the league's premier teams. Import players including 6'9\" (207 cm) centre Bill Jones, New York-born combo guard Al Green (who had been drafted by the San Diego Chargers as a Defensive back in the 1979 NFL Draft despite not playing football) and an NBL rookie in 24-year-old Power forward from Philadelphia, Mark Davis who joined the team 5 games into the season after dominating the local league with South Adelaide, combined with local players Darryl Pearce, team captain Peter Ali, young gun Mike McKay, and veteran Ray Wood to help Adelaide to a 20–6 record and second on the regular season ladder behind the Brian Kerle coached Brisbane Bullets who featured Australian Olympian Larry Sengstock, arguably the league's best player and former West Adelaide championship player Leroy Loggins, Ronnie \"The Rat\" Radliff, and the \"Black Pearl\" Cal Bruton. The team had a bye going into the semi-final where they easily defeated for the Newcastle Falcons 151–103 at home in what the then record semi-final win in the NBL, something Ken Cole had publicly predicted would happen. Leading 105–84 going into the last period, Cole told his team that he wanted a record score for a Semi-final and the team responded, producing a 46–19 last period to blow the Falcons away and get the record. In the last single game NBL grand final ever played, Adelaide were up against the Brisbane Bullets on the Bullets' home court (Sleeman Sports Centre). Going into the final period the game the Bullets' were leading 78–74 but a 42–21 last period in favour of the home team with Loggins leading the way saw Adelaide fail to win their first grand final going down 95–120.\n\nParagraph 11: Another review in the Courier praised her technique and breath control:Miss Louise Linden, the remarkable performer upon the saxophone . . . is said to be superior as any performer in the country. Her powers of execution are marvellous and she can play a long and difficult passage, that ordinarily requires from two to three inspirations, without removing the instrument from her lips or taking breath.Due to the rarity of female wind players and the newness of the saxophone, both Linden and her instrument were promoted—and responded to—as novelties. Reviewers often attempted to describe the sound of the saxophone to readers who presumably had never heard the instrument:The most pleasing part of the programme at this resort during the past week was the Saxophone solos by Miss Louise Linden. This instrument is but little known, but in the hands of such an artist is capable of some most charming effects. Its tones are a mixture of clarionette, saxhorn and bassoon, susceptible of great modulations and flexibility of sound, and resembling somewhat the human voice.Cornetist Anna Theresa Berger (1853–1925) was actually Linden's closest peer as a musician. Each equaled prominent male soloists on her respective instrument in both technique and expression. Although Linden and Berger both received exceedingly positive reviews, these were often tempered by disclaimers taking into account their gender. Linden's 1881 performance of The Carnival of Venice at the Summer-Garden Concerts at the Academy of Music in Baltimore, createdmuch interest by her superior execution on the instrument. She played in response \"Old Folks at Home\" very sweetly. Later in the evening she played \"Home, Sweet Home.\" The audience were entertained not only with the music but with the novelty. It is an exceptional thing for men to play solos on the saxophone, let alone a woman.\"A reviewer from the Rochester, New York, Union & Advertiser pronounced astonishment that a woman could display such capability on a wind instrument:By far the most remarkable performance of the evening, however, was Miss Louise Linden's playing upon the saxophone. This instrument, a comparatively modern invention, requires not only great endurance in a player, but also the utmost facility of manipulation. These difficulties were most brilliantly surmounted by the young lady. It must have required no slight amount of courage for a woman to undertake so unusual a task as the learning of a wind instrument, and no slight amount of perseverance to overcome the many obstacles that such a task would naturally present. The artistic finish with which Miss Linden acquitted herself last night merits unstinted praise and admiration.", "answers": ["Paragraph 11"], "length": 2887, "dataset": "passage_retrieval_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "b5029fc27862396d45a7b698154c52c544f31b48d899fca3"}
{"input": "In 1982, Margaret Thatcher's Conservative Government privatized the National Freight Corporation by offering shares to its employees at a price that underestimated the company's value on the stock market. The businesses National Carriers and Roadline later merged, operating briefly as National Carriers Roadline before being renamed Lynx Express Delivery Network. Despite this, Lynx Express remained the company's official name, although it was commonly referred to by its shortened version. Eventually, after a reorganization, rationalization of core business interests, and a rebranding effort, NFC plc (formerly National Freight Corporation) merged with Ocean Group plc and became known as Exel. Lynx Express was considered outside the company's primary focus following this merger.", "context": "Paragraph 1:  Sufficient circumference to distribute the force comfortably and safely over the hand.  An example where this requirement is almost the sole purpose for a handle's existence is the handle that consists of two pieces: a hollow wooden cylinder about the diameter of a finger and a bit longer than one hand-width, and a stiff wire that passes through the center of the cylinder, has two right angles, and is shaped into a hook at each end. This handle permits comfortable carrying, with otherwise bare hands, of a heavy package, suspended on a tight string that passes around the top and bottom of it: the string is strong enough to support it, but the pressure the string would exert on fingers that grasped it directly would often be unacceptable.\n\nParagraph 2: For a diatomic molecule with a center of symmetry, such as  or  (i.e.  point group), rotation of a molecule by  radian about an axis perpendicular to the molecule axis and going through the center of mass will interchange pairs of equivalent atoms. The spin–statistics theorem of quantum mechanics requires that the total molecular wavefunction be either symmetric or antisymmetric with respect to this rotation depending upon whether an even or odd number of pairs of fermion nuclear pairs are exchanged. A given electronic & vibrational wavefunction will either be symmetric or antisymmetric with respect to this rotation. The rotational wavefunction with quantum number J will have a sign change of . The nuclear spins states can be separated into those that are symmetric or antisymmetric with respect to the nuclear permutations produced by the rotation. For the case of a symmetric diatomic with nuclear spin quantum number I for each nucleus, there are  symmetric spin functions and  are antisymmetric functions for a total number of nuclear functions . Nuclei with an even nuclear mass number are bosons and have integer nuclear spin quantum number, I. Nuclei with odd mass number are fermions and had half integer I. For the case of H2, rotation exchanges a single pair of fermions and so the overall wavefunction must be antisymmetric under the half rotation. The vibration-electronic function is symmetric and so the rotation-vibration-electronic will be even or odd depending upon whether J is an even or odd integer. Since the total wavefunction must be odd, the even J levels can only use the antisymmetric functions (only one for I = 1/2) while the odd J levels can use the symmetric functions ( three for I = 1/2). For D2, I = 1 and thus there are six symmetric functions, which go with the even J levels to produce an overall symmetric wavefunction, and three antisymmetric functions that must go with odd J rotational levels to produce an overall even function. The number of nuclear spin functions that are compatible with a given rotation-vibration-electronic state is called the nuclear spin statistical weight of the level, often represented as . Averaging over both even and odd J levels, the mean statistical weight is , which is one half the value of  expected ignoring the quantum statistical restrictions. In the high temperature limit, it is traditional to correct for the missing nuclear spin states by dividing the rotational partition function by a factor  with  known as the rotational symmetry number which is 2 for linear molecules with a center of symmetry and 1 for linear molecules without.\n\nParagraph 3: On January 18, 1813, the Americans forced the retreat of the British and their Native American allies from Frenchtown, which they had earlier occupied, in a relatively minor skirmish. The movement was part of a larger United States plan to advance north and retake Fort Detroit, following its loss in the Siege of Detroit the previous summer. Despite this initial success, the British and Native Americans rallied and launched a surprise counterattack four days later on January 22. Ill-prepared, the Americans lost 397 soldiers in this second battle, while 547 were taken prisoner. Dozens of wounded prisoners were murdered the next day in a massacre by the Native Americans. More prisoners were killed if they could not keep up on the forced march to Fort Malden. This was the deadliest conflict recorded on Michigan soil, and the casualties included the highest number of Americans killed in a single battle during the War of 1812.\n\nParagraph 4: From 1882 through 1897 newspaper reports refer to this competition consistently as 'The Leinster Challenge Cup'. From 1898 through 2006, press reports refer to the competition as 'The Leinster Senior Cup'. How and why did this change in title come about? The change in reference title probably had more to do with semantics rather than any change(s) in the rules governing the competition. At a General Meeting of the Leinster Branch of the I.R.F.U. held in the Wicklow Hotel on 11 November 1888, a resolution was adopted to inaugurate a Leinster Junior Cup competition on the same basis as applied to the Leinster Challenge Cup. Following the Hon. Treasurer's report to the Annual General Meeting a month earlier, it had been proposed that the Leinster Branch purchase a 'Challenge Cup' for such competition. At the Leinster Branch A.G.M in October 1891, a motion that the 2nd XVs of Senior Clubs be allowed to compete in the Leinster Junior Cup was rejected. Essentially the same motion returned the Leinster Branch AGM in October 1895, but was amended to refer the matter to a subcommittee to draft rules to govern the proposed competition under which the latter might be approved and discussion adjourned to the next General Meeting. At the reconvened meeting in November 1895, delegates were informed that the original motion had been withdrawn because of intense opposition. The meeting then reconstituted itself as a special meeting to consider a new resolution \"that a Cup be presented by the Leinster Branch for competition amongst Second Fifteens of senior clubs on a league basis\". After much discussion and consideration of umpteen amendments and counter proposals, the final phrase of the original motion was amended to read \"amongst Junior Clubs and Second Fifteens of senior clubs on a league basis\". This was passed unanimously. Thus the Leinster Branch I.R.F.U. from the 1886-87 season now had a Leinster Junior Cup, the winners of which received a Challenge Cup, a Junior League Cup for Junior Clubs and the 2nd XVs of Senior Clubs, and a Leinster Challenge Cup, contested by Senior Clubs. Thus, to avoid confusion in reports of competitions, the Leinster Challenge Cup became referred to as the Leinster Senior Cup, the winners of which were presented with the original Challenge Cup.\n\nParagraph 5: From Detroit, at the urging of Louis Armstrong, Jeffries moved to Chicago where he performed in various clubs. One of his first gigs was in a club allegedly owned by Al Capone. Jeffries began his career working with Erskine Tate and his Vendome Orchestra. Tate signed the 19-year-old Jeffries to a contract with his Orchestra at the Savoy Ballroom in Chicago. His break came during the 1933 Chicago World's Fair A Century of Progress International Exposition singing with the Earl Hines Orchestra on Hines' national broadcasts live from the Grand Terrace Cafe. His first recordings were with Hines in 1934, including \"Just to be in Carolina\". By 1940, he was singing with the Duke Ellington Orchestra and then recorded with him from 1940 to 1942. His 1940 recording of \"Flamingo\" with Ellington, released in 1941, sold more than 14 million copies in its day. His name had been Herbert Jeffrey, but the credits on the record mistakenly called him Jeffries, so he renamed himself to match the typo. During his time with the Duke Ellington Orchestra as a lead vocalist, Jeffries proved his talent as a mature singer, demonstrating his wide vocal range in such songs as \"I Don't Know What Kind of Blues I've Got,\" \"The Brownskin Gal,\" and \"Jump for Joy\" (all 1941). The 1944 single \"My Little Brown Book\" by Ellington and his Famous Orchestra, on which Jeffries provided vocals, reached No. 4 on Billboard R&B chart.\n\nParagraph 6: Fleck wrote that the development of truth in scientific research was an unattainable ideal as different researchers were locked into thought collectives (or thought-styles). This means \"that a pure and direct observation cannot exist: in the act of perceiving objects the observer, i.e. the epistemological subject, is always influenced by the epoch and the environment to which he belongs, that is by what Fleck calls the thought style\". Thought style throughout Fleck's work is closely associated with representational style. A \"fact\" was a relative value, expressed in the language or symbolism of the thought collective in which it belonged, and subject to the social and temporal structure of this collective. He argued, however, that within the active cultural style of a thought collective, knowledge claims or facts were constrained by passive elements arising from the observations and experience of the natural world. This passive resistance of natural experience represented within the stylized means of the thought collective could be verified by anyone adhering to the culture of the thought collective, and thus facts could be agreed upon within any particular thought style. Thus while a fact may be verifiable within its own collective, it may be unverifiable in others. He felt that the development of scientific facts and concepts was not unidirectional and does not consist of just accumulating new pieces of information, but at times required changing older concepts, methods of observations, and forms of representation. This changing of prior knowledge is difficult because a collective attains over time a specific way of investigating, bringing with it a blindness to alternative ways of observing and conceptualization. Change was especially possible when members of two thought collectives met and cooperated in observing, formulating hypothesis and ideas. He strongly advocated comparative epistemology. He also notes some features of the culture of modern natural sciences that recognize provisionality and evolution of knowledge along the value of pursuit of passive resistances. This approach anticipated later developments in social constructionism, and especially the development of critical science and technology studies.\n\nParagraph 7: In Iron Man #168 (March 1983), Machine Man attempts to pay Iron Man a visit. Machine Man was seeking to compare notes with Iron Man, thought to be a robot by Machine Man. At the time, Iron Man was drunk, irate, and under considerable stress from the machinations of Obadiah Stane. Iron Man attacked Machine Man and almost killed two of his own employees. At the last possible second, Machine Man's extendable arm pushed them out of the way. In a meeting with the Thing of the Fantastic Four, Machine Man also first met and fell in love with another sentient robot, Jocasta. Alongside the Thing and Jocasta, he battled Ultron. However, during the battle, Machine Man witnessed the seeming destruction of Jocasta by Ultron. In 1990, Machine Man guest-starred in Iron Man Annual #11 (part of the \"Terminus Factor\" storyline). That story created strong hints that the 2020 Machine Man may turn out not to be the true X-51, but instead a duplicate created by Sunset Bain. The story concludes in Thor Annual #15, also in 1990. He later fought alongside the Avengers, which led to the invitation to become a team reservist. Later he was captured by S.H.I.E.L.D., who wanted to use his technology to create another Deathlok. He helps the X-Men and Douglock against the villainous Red Skull, who had taken over the Helicarrier where Machine Man was held. He helped the X-Men again against Bastion and his Sentinels. As a consequence, he was infected by Sentinel programming, assuming a more robotic look in the subsequent series X-51, and losing self-control whenever he was faced with a mutant. During this series he was on the run from Sebastian Shaw, who wants his technology for himself. Because of his new programming, while seeking aid from the Avengers, he attacks Justice and Firestar. Because of his actions against Justice and Firestar, X-51's membership in the Avengers is revoked. At the end of X-51, X-51 encountered one of the monoliths and disappeared, brought into the presence of the monolith's creators, the cosmic beings known as the Celestials.\n\nParagraph 8: In 1982, the Conservative Government led by Margaret Thatcher privatised these services, making shares in the newly formed National Freight Corporation available to employees at a price that proved to undervalue the company when they were floated on the stock market. Two businesses, National Carriers and Roadline, subsequently merged and operated briefly under the name National Carriers Roadline before becoming Lynx Express Delivery Network. This remained the company's full title, although it was shortened in practice. Following a reorganisation, rationalisation of core business interests and rebranding exercise, National Freight Corporation, by this time shortened to NFC plc, merged with Ocean Group plc and became known as Exel, and Lynx Express was seen as outside its main area of concentration.\n\nParagraph 9: The vestry book of St. Audeon’s Church, Dublin states at 16 April 1681 that in a recess on the northern side of the church door, a corner of the north-west part of the church (now the vestibule) was railed off with \"a rail and banister,\" for the Parry family burial place. It measured 14 feet by 8 feet and a rent of forty shillings a year was due for it by the Parry family, which was split fifty-fifty between the Prebendary and Churchwardens of St. Audeons. It acquired the name of the \"Bishop of Ossory's Chapel\". Many generations of the Parrys were buried in this tomb, which, having become defaced by time, was, on the repair of the Church in 1848, surmounted with an inscribed white marble slab at the expense of Dr. John Parry's representatives, Dame Emma Elizabeth Puleston of Albrighton Hall, Shropshire, relict of Sir Richard Puleston, Bart., Anna Eleanora, Frances and Elizabeth Hawkshaw, daughters of Lieutenant Colonel John Stuart Hawshaw of Divernagh, County Armagh. The monument of the spot, which still exists, reads- “In memory of Edward Parry and his two sons John and Benjamin Parry, who were interred near this spot. Edward Parry, D.D., Pro-Vice-Chancellor of the University of Trinity College, Dublin, was consecrated Bishop of Killaloe, 28th March, 1647, and died of the plague in this city, July 20th, 1650. John Parry, D.D., was promoted to the Deanery of Christ’s Church, Dublin, Apl. 2, 1666; was consecrated Bishop of Ossory Apl. 22, 1672; and departed this life Dec. 21st 1677. Benjamin Parry DD was promoted to the Deanery of St Canices Kilkenny Feb. 19th 1673, to the Deanery of St. Patrick's Dublin Feb. 17th 1674, was consecrated Bishop of Ossory on the death of his brother John Parry and departed this life Oct. 4th 1678. On the repairing of this church AD 1848 by permission of the Rev. James Howie AM prebendary of the same. Dame Emma Elizabeth Puleston of Albrighton Hall, Shropshire relict of Sir Richard Puleston Bart and Anna, Eleanora, Frances, and Elizabeth Hawkshaw, daughters of the late Lieut Colene John Stewart Hawkshaw of Divernagh Co. Armach, caused this new monument to be erected in memory of the above named bishops. The said Sir Richard Puleston and Lieut. Colonel John Steward Hawkshaw having been Lineally descended from the above named Edward Parry. The monument underneath was the one originally erected by the said John Parry to the memory of his Father Edward Parry”\n\nParagraph 10: On 27 September 2012, Romania's Supreme Defense Council approved a plan to buy 12 used F-16s from Portugal in a deal worth 670 million euros. It was planned that the aircraft would be delivered over the next five years, and would enter operational service in 2016 after pilot training. Romania was to complete negotiations and finalization of documents with Portugal by the end of May, and with the U.S. by September. 120 million euros were used to pay for the aircraft, with the rest paying for logistic support. Legislation regarding the F-16 deal was passed by the country's Chamber of Deputies in June 2013 and on 12 July 2013, Romanian President Traian Băsescu formally approved the purchase. On 11 October 2013, Romania completed the purchase of 12 Lockheed Martin F-16 Fighting Falcons with MLU package from Portugal. The package was worth $252.6 million/€186.2 million, and included nine former Portuguese Air Force aircraft and three former United States Air Force aircraft supplied to Portugal for the resale under the U.S. Excess Defense Articles program. Nine aircraft were single-seat and three were twin-seat. Portugal would receive 78 million euros for the sale, and the rest would be spent acquiring and upgrading the surplus USAF aircraft and associated equipment. The first F-16 was scheduled to be delivered in 2016 with initial operational capability achieved in 2017.\n\nParagraph 11: Cranberry Portage is an unincorporated community recognized as a local urban district located in the Rural Municipality of Kelsey, Manitoba. It was an important part of the pre-European contact trade routes of the Cree  and Assiniboine peoples. Long before the fur trade with the Bay and during the Fur Trade, this location was used as a campsite and portage between Grassy River, at the head of a number of well-used routes from Hudson Bay, and Lake Athapapuskow, which connected to the Saskatchewan River system. Once on the Saskatchewan routes were open through the prairies to the foothills of the Rocky Mountains.", "answers": ["Paragraph 8"], "length": 3001, "dataset": "passage_retrieval_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "a35eebf8716855e761d5f58072b019af39e2ebe765bfba6f"}
{"input": "The original vision for Shingwauk Hall was conceived by Chief Shingwauk, the chief of the Garden River Ojibway people, in the early 19th century. He believed that the Ojibway needed to acquire the white man's academic education in order to survive in an increasingly non-native world. Although Chief Shingwauk's idea of a teaching wigwam did not materialize in his lifetime, funding for a residential school was eventually secured in 1872 through the combined efforts of his sons, Chiefs Augustin and Buhkwujjenene Shingwauk, and Anglican Missionary Rev. Edward Francis Wilson.", "context": "Paragraph 1: The sitcom had Midler playing herself – a \"divine celebrity\" who is adored by her fans. To apply some ambiguity, neither Bette's last name nor that of her on-screen family's was used, to create the offset that there was some difference between the star's real-life and TV persona. There were several similarities to Midler's actual career through the show's run, as the character of Bette had – and directly performed – many of the real-life Midler's past hit songs and achievements. The core of the stories focused on Bette's personal life in her luxurious Los Angeles home. Her husband of nearly 20 years, Roy (Kevin Dunn, eps. 1–12; Robert Hays, eps. 16–18) was an earnest college history professor, and their 13-year-old daughter, Rose (Lindsay Lohan, pilot episode; Marina Malota, eps. 2–18) was bright, active, and not the least bit fazed by her mother's celebrity. Embarking with Bette on her long, wild journey around showbiz was her hardworking best friend and manager Connie Randolph (Joanna Gleason). Refined Englishman Oscar (James Dreyfus) was Bette's veteran musical director/accompanist, who had an obsession with tabloid media and was always on the lookout for new, strange exploitations of Bette. During the series' run, slightly fictional Bette recorded a new album, engaged in hijinks at awards shows, won a Grammy, made guest roles on series such as JAG and Family Law (a cross promotion by CBS), and starred in a TV Halloween special with Dolly Parton (who appeared as herself and was said to be a longtime friend of the Bette character; Parton and Midler are friends in real life). Other stories were out of the spotlight and closer to home; in one, Bette volunteered at Rose's school with surprising results, and in another, flashbacks were shown depicting the first time Bette met Connie, Roy, and Oscar (in that order), along with one featuring the birth of Rose.\n\nParagraph 2: Earl's career was highlighted by several flight records and a number of accidents.  In Erie, Pennsylvania, He had his first accident in his new Curtiss aeroplane on the first day that he experimented with it. Without intending to fly, he lifted from the ground and crash landed, but avoided personal injury. On January 28, 1912, Sandt set an altitude record for Erie of 900 feet. Later, he bested his own record by reaching an altitude of 7,800 feet.  His most notable flight was his 34-minute flight across a frozen Lake Erie on February 15, 1912, to Long Point Peninsula near Port Rowan, Canada.   Hailed as the first flight across inland seas in America and the first international flight from North America, this flight ended almost in tragedy, as Earl crash landed into the frozen Lake Erie on his return trip.  He survived the crash and despite a number of injuries to his eye and body, hiked his way back to shore over and around ice hammocks and thin ice. Despite Sandt's offer of a $300.00 award for the retrieval of his aeroplane, search parties failed to find any remnants of the aeroplane.  With the help of Erie newspapers and friends, Sandt managed to acquire a new Curtiss Aeroplane in May 1912. On his first public flight, he flew from Walnut Creek, where he was testing his machine, to Waldameer Park and crashed into a pole rather than hit spectators.  Earl's aeroplane was repaired and he resumed flying at his first exhibition outside of Erie in DuBois, Pennsylvania, reaching an altitude of 1800 feet. Sandt's next flight was in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where numerous  aviators had limited success in previous exhibitions. On June 15, 1912, after taking off from Schenely Park in Oakland, Sandt had a successful flight in Pittsburgh lasting 21 minutes in view of thousands of spectators, many watching from rooftops, over the main parts of the city. After a couple of successful flights at Conneaut Exposition Park, Earl returned to his hometown of Brookville, Pennsylvania. Another mishap occurred when he attempted a flight with his cousin on board.  Both survived with slight injuries. Later, Sandt, by himself, flew in what was reported as the first cross country flight in Western Pennsylvania from Brookville, Pennsylvania to Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, a distance of 22 miles. Returning to Conneaut Exposition Park, Sandt had several more fine exhibition flights until a bad crash  resulted in several severe contusions and a concussion. After weeks of convalescing, Earl resumed flying at Fort Recovery, Ohio.  Completing the engagement for another pilot, George Schmidt, Earl made the first air mail delivery for the state of Ohio. He then continued with flight exhibitions in Chrisney, Indiana, and Cortland New York.  At Cortland, he was presented with a \"Loving Cup\" to award him for his aviation achievements.  While in New York and flying from Moravia, he was shot at by a confused farmer.  On September 2, 1912, Sandt returned to Pittsburgh, where he flew three days in exhibitions at Brunot's Island.  He would finish the exhibition as the only successful flyer. His next flights took him to a number of small towns, Uricheville Ohio, Ripley West Virginia, and Clarion County. At Ripley, he ran his aeroplane into a wire fence, but escaped injury. While being filmed by the Columbia Educational Film Company he crashed into a barb wire fence while flying at an exhibition in Lorain, Ohio, October 6, 1912. Unhurt by his accident, Earl completed  engagements at Greenville, Meadville, and Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania.  In the winter of 1913, Sandt embarked on a series of flights in Erie, Pennsylvania with passengers, including Nellie Seidel, 16 years old, who became the first female to fly in an aeroplane in Erie, Pennsylvania. In the spring of 1913, Earl made experimental trips at Lake Erie to test the hydroaeroplane built by Henry Seidel.  This hydroaeroplane was the result of a collaboration between Earl, Seidel, and Earl's brother, Walter.  Canceling the testing of the Hydroaeroplane in public during the Memorial Day weekend in 1913, Sandt instead flew in Belleville, Ontario for the King George V birthday celebration and fair, where he became the first to fly over the Bay of Quinte.\n\nParagraph 3: She had never married, and her executors Thomas S. Mercer and Richard S. Mercer sold the Belmont estate in 1851 to George Kephart of Frederick County, Maryland, who also bought the former Thomas Ludwell Lee plantation called \"Coton\" across the Leesburg Pike. Eugenia Kephart, George Kephart's eldest daughter, operated the school and moved it by 1856 to Oak Hill plantation, before closing in the early 1870s when the new Virginia constitution enabled free public education. Richard S. Mercer may have used some of the sale proceeds in 1858 to erect Parkhurst manor in Harwood, in Anne Arundel County, nearly across the state from George Kephart's decades-long farm near Buckeystown (which is about 28 miles away from Belmont, with a nearly direct crossing of the Potomac River along historic Route 15). George Kephart had considerable notoriety, particularly among Loudoun County Quakers at the Goose Creek meeting (about 18 miles from Belmont), for his and his sons' slave catching activities, and 1836 had purchased the Alexandria, Virginia slave-trading firm once known as Franklin & Armfield at 1315 Duke Street (about 40 miles from Belmont, or 50 miles from Buckeystown). George Kephart classified himself as a farmer in the 1850 Federal census for Maryland, and the accompanying slave census only showed him as owning 17 enslaved persons there, but two men of the same name (the other possibly his eldest son on the Maryland census) owned a total of 49 enslaved people in Alexandria. The 1860 Federal census for Loudoun County, Virginia classified George as \"Merchant\" and his son William as \"Tradeing\", but the Kephart family (now without George Junior who disappeared from the census but would be buried nearby in 1888, and to which 6 year old Julius had been added, only owned one slave, an 18 year old mulatto woman. Kephart either provided for his children who chose not to continue the business or encountered financial difficulties by 1858, when the firm's name changed to Price, Birch and Co. (which remained the name when Union authorities converted the Alexandria office in 1862 into a jail for Confederate and other prisoners) and in 1860 the Loudoun Circuit Court ordered various properties including Coton liquidated. In 1864, Virginia abolitionist Moncure Conway published Testimonies Concerning Slavery and specifically criticized Kephart, who died at Belmont in 1869, about two years after his wife. His Alexandria slave trading office and jail is now also a historic site and museum.\n\nParagraph 4: In February 1997, Sagan was established as a new club which virtually took over Tosu Futures, which became insolvent in the previous month, and were admitted to participate Japan Football League from 1997 to 1998, as well as J. League Cup in 1997 as a preferential measure, although J. League Associate Membership status was not awarded to Sagan. In 1999 they were admitted to the new J. League Division 2 (J2) as one of the \"Original Ten\", which were the ten first members of the J2. They remained at the league until their promotion to J1 at the end of the 2011 season. Little by little, Sagan Tosu started to establish itself as one of the top clubs in the country with the new President & Chief Operating Officer Minoru Takehara, who is also part owner of the club.\n\nParagraph 5: Recurring charactersGiuseppina (played by Joe Salantri) – Johnny's wife, also played by Joe Salanitri. Giuseppina has been featured in numerous episodes with the rest of the ethnic mothers. Salanitri reprised his role of Giuseppina in an interview with Studio 10. Giuseppina and Johnny have a son and a daughter. Her daughter has slept with Angela's son, but is now engaged to a Greek man.Carmela (played by Carlo Salanitri) – Carlo Salanitri plays Carmela, Vince's wife. She and Vince often make fun of each other, and are confused as to why their son, Giuseppe, sees a psychologist. Carmela is not a fan of Giuseppe's wife, Sharon.Angela (played by Andrew Manfre) – The wife of Sam, whose son used to be in a relationship with Giuseppina's daughter. She and Sam have another ten children, including a daughter, and nine grandchildren. Angela had a crush on Sam's brother, but married Sam when his brother died.Costa (played by Carlo Salanitri) – The owner and boss of Kalamata Fish & Chips shop. He works at his shop with his nephew and Tasso. His nephew teases him for not being able to pronounce the word \"chips\".Tasso (played by Joe Salanitri) – A worker, who works in Kalamata Fish & Chips. He is from Kalamata. When migrating to Australia, he and Costa had the idea of starting a fish and chips business together.Stavro (played by Andrew Manfre) – A man, who comes to eat at Kalamata Fish & Chips. He explains that his cousin was run over by Uber Eats and that he had to sell his donkey to enable his wife to migrate to Australia, as he lost his money to the TAB. He is also beat by his wife.Giacomo (played by Carlo Salanitri) – Carlo Salanitri also portrays old married man Giacomo, who gives marital advice to Joe, with the help of Pino.Pino (played by Andrew Manfre) – An ethnic grandparent, who also gives advice to Joe. He has a wife. He and Giacomo came to Australia in the 1940s, when they accidentally boarded an immigration boat during World War II, believing it was an enemy ship.Joe (played by Joe Salanitri) – A young gas and sterioids salesman, acted by Joe Salanitri. When he tries to sell gas, he ends up getting marital advice. Joe is on parole.Tasoula''' (played by Joe Salinitri) – The Greek wife of Stavro, played by Joe Salinitri, who bashes Stavro for his TAB losses. She and Stavro have five daughters.\n\nParagraph 6: The original vision for Shingwauk Hall in the early 19th century came from  Chief Shingwauk, the chief of the Garden River Ojibway people, as he felt \"that the future Ojibway needed to learn the white man's academic method of education in order to survive in what was becoming a 'predominately non-native world with non-native values'\". While Chief Shingwauk's vision of a teaching wigwam for his people would not come to fruition in his lifetime, a residential school would eventually receive funding in 1872 from the combined efforts of Chiefs Augustin Shingwauk and Buhkwujjenene Shingwauk (Chief Shingwauk's sons) and the Anglican Missionary, Rev. Edward Francis Wilson.\n\nParagraph 7: Soul later worked as a barmaid at Martick's (later Martick's Restaurant Francais), a bistro run by Morris Martick on Mulberry Street in Baltimore. Here, she also worked as an artist's model. Her role in Baltimore was compared with Paris' Kiki de Montparnasse. Starting November 4, 1966, Martick's hosted \"The Maelcum Show\" with 25 art works of her nude, created by different artists, including her husband Dudley Grant with various styles and mediums. Some pieces were made of stained glass and cardboard cutouts. During her life, most \"young-Turk\" artists of Baltimore used Soul as a model. Earl Hofmann painted her as a surrealistic giant towering over Baltimore. In response to the exhibit, Soul reported \"It’s very funny to see 25 of yous staring at you. It's a happy things, a fun thing, I feel like it’s my birthday.\"\n\nParagraph 8: In section 28, Tacitus reports the tale of a group of men who had been recruited in Germania and how they mutinied against the Romans and had various adventures before being captured and sold into slavery (Tac. Ag. 28). In what follows, we are told of the background to the battle of Mons Graupius, including the death of Agricola's son (Tac. Ag. 29). Tacitus then reports a long pre-battle speech by one of the leaders of the Britons, called Calgacus (Tac. Ag. 30–32). Following this, Tacitus reports Agricola's own speech (Tac. Ag. 33–34). In what follows, Tacitus describes the course of the battle itself and its immediate aftermath, stating that only nightfall stopped the Romans’ pursuit (Tac. Ag. 35–38). Tacitus then reports how the news of Agricola's success in Britannia was received by the emperor Domitian, and Domitian's alleged jealousy of Agricola's military prowess (Tac. Ag. 40–41). Tacitus discusses how Domitian had sent confidants to discover Agricola's intentions in regards to becoming a proconsul of either Asia or Africa, and Domitian's temperament (Tac. Ag. 42). Tacitus, in discussing the end of Agricola's life, says that rumours were voiced in Rome that Agricola was poisoned on the Emperor's orders and that his death was lamented by many (Tac. Ag. 43). After reporting Agricola's death, Tacitus summarizes the circumstances of his birth and his character throughout his life (Tac. Ag. 44). In the final two sections, Tacitus addresses his departed father-in-law directly, honouring him and vowing that Agricola will live on through the story he has told of him (Tac. Ag. 45–46).\n\nParagraph 9: Krawcheck appeared in the top ten Forbes list of The World's 100 Most Powerful Women in 2005 and 2006. (2005 List) In 2008, she was named to Investment Advisor'' magazine's IA 25, the list of the 25 most influential people in and around the investment advisory business. She was recognized by the World Economic Forum as one of its Young Global Leaders.  In 2012, she was credited by The Daily Beast as remaining one of the \"rare honest voices on Wall Street.\" In December 2017, she was listed in a TechCrunch feature on 42 women succeeding in tech that year.\n\nParagraph 10: On July 1, 1977, 96% of Aeroamerica's unionised German flight attendants voted in favour of strike action in a ballot held by the German Salaried Employees' Union. They demanded pay parity with their colleagues working for Pan Am's Internal German Services (IGS) division and employment contracts governed by local labour law to bring them in line with their unionised counterparts at other Allied airlines that employed their flight attendants locally. The company countered these demands by arguing that the nature of its business required flight attendants to be stationed anywhere, involving frequent postings to overseas stations at short notice to cover global ad hoc and lease commitments. It furthermore argued that adopting other Allied airlines' local employment conditions and pay for its own flight attendants would restrict operational flexibility and increase costs, that this would undermine its ability to compete globally and that the worldwide nature of its operations made all flight attendants' employment conditions subject to American labour law as well as CAB and FAA regulations to comply with US legal requirements. Initially, the airline was able to maintain its full flying programme at the beginning of the busy summer holiday period despite staff not showing up for work, following the first week of unsuccessful negotiations between Aeroamerica's local management and the DAG union. However, the conflict escalated during the second week when the local management dismissed without notice two flight attendants who had picketed a Tegel-bound flight in Brussels. As the conflict was still unresolved by the end of July and threatened to disrupt the holiday plans of thousands of West Berliners during the peak month of August, management attempted to break the flight attendants' strike by temporarily reducing the number of flight attendants from four to three per aircraft as well as by hiring contract labour from an unnamed UK airline. As these developments further aggravated the already tense standoff between the airline and its flight attendants' union, the latter sought to increase pressure on the company to settle the dispute by airing its members' grievances in public. It alleged that Aeroamerica's policy of only complying with minimum FAA requirements resulted in overworking flight attendants, putting lives of crew and passengers at risk in case of an emergency. Despite the negative publicity, management refused to return to the negotiating table and the strike eventually collapsed as the peak summer season drew to a close by the end of August. Following the end of the labour unrest at the company, the FAA subjected Aeroamerica to an unannounced safety audit later the same year. The airline's management alleged that the FAA's move had been prompted by a dismissed flight attendant's act of revenge.\n\nParagraph 11:  On 22 August 2019, a Smartwings Boeing 737-800 (Registration: OK-TVO) operated flight QS-1125 from Samos, Greece to Prague, Czech Republic with 170 passengers on board. The aircraft was flying at 36,000 feet over the Aegean Sea about 100 nm northeast of Athens, Greece when it had an engine failure. The crew drifted the aircraft down to 24,000 without informing ATC of the emergency, only informing them of a \"technical malfunction\". Instead of, as per engine failure procedure, landing at the nearest suitable airport, the flight crew carried on to Prague at that level for a landing without further incident about 2 hours and 20 minutes later. The Czech Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) confirmed that an investigation had been launched into the incident: \"we have decided to launch an investigation as the procedure followed doesn't seem standard.\" Following the incident, Prague police launched an investigation into the flight on suspicion of endangering the public due to negligence, and a Smartwings internal investigation demoted the captain from his post as head of flight operations. In July 2020, the CAA released the final report by the Air Accidents Investigation Institute (AAII), which blamed the incident on the captain failing to follow mandatory procedures, including landing at the nearest possible diversion airport after an engine failure. As of July 2020 the captain Pavel Veselý continues to pilot Smartwings flights.\n\nParagraph 12: BiNet USA (officially Bi/Net USA, The Bisexual Network of the USA Inc.) was an American national nonprofit bisexual community whose mission was to \"facilitate the development of a cohesive network of bisexual communities, promote bisexual visibility, and collect and distribute educational information regarding bisexuality. Until 2020, BiNet USA provided a national network for bisexual organizations and individuals across the United States, and encouraged participation and organizing on local and national levels.\" They claimed to be the oldest national bisexuality organization in the United States. In 2020, all of the content on BiNet USA's website was replaced with a statement that the BiNet USA president, Faith Cheltenham, now identified as Christian conservative and was walking away from progressive politics entirely.", "answers": ["Paragraph 6"], "length": 3466, "dataset": "passage_retrieval_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "8c7d9e2095cbf464787cbec4a819d49d4ca29ea14c327701"}
{"input": "Chronos, a supervillain, made his appearance in Ivy Town where he attempted to steal an atomic clock. However, he was defeated by the Atom, who coincidentally obtained the idea to stop him from Ray Palmer, the Atom's alter ego. Chronos tried to uncover the Atom's secret identity but was unsuccessful. He managed to capture the Atom and lock him inside a watch, but the Atom escaped and tricked Chronos into thinking he was wrong. Chronos later escaped from jail by using a guard's watch. He continuously attempted to steal valuable items using his time-manipulating abilities, but the Atom always thwarted his plans. Chronos's knowledge of time led him to develop advanced weaponry, including lenses that obscured certain events, a costume with time-controlling circuitry, and even a time machine (which was ultimately destroyed). There are hints that Chronos may have received assistance from a future version of himself and also became a time traveler after encountering Dr. Fox, a mysterious criminal scientist. Chronos was a member of the Crime Champions, a group of villains from Earth-1 and Earth-2 who committed robberies and used vibratory devices to escape to the other world. He evaded Wonder Woman, Batman, and Green Lantern after stealing a large sum of money, and later impersonated by the Icicle during a battle with Batman, Wonder Woman, and Green Lantern. On Earth-2, Chronos attempted to steal a rare clock but was captured by Superman. He also aided the Fiddler in finding Earth-3 but was defeated by the Martian Manhunter and Black Canary.", "context": "Paragraph 1: Alvarez attended several US military schools including Ranger, Special Forces and the Corps of Cadets at Texas A&M University, where he had the distinction of being the first cadet to receive commission in a foreign army. During Alvarez’s career he has been awarded several medals and recognitions including the Honduran Army Combat Medal, Commendation Medal, US Special Forces School Achievement Medal and Special Recognition from the US State Department, FBI and DEA. Mr. Alvarez has a BA in political science from Texas A&M University and has attended the School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS) taking courses on International Relations and Security Studies.\n\nParagraph 2: Carl Daniel Peterson was born on May 26, 1943, in the Swedish Hospital in Minneapolis, Minnesota. He was the third of four sons born to Louise and Eric Peterson. His father worked heavy construction jobs throughout the Midwest, helping to build various military sites in the throes of World War II. When Carl was not yet four years old, the family moved to Long Beach, California, where Eric began a construction business with his brother-in-law. Carl attended Woodrow Wilson Classical High School in Long Beach, participating in football and baseball for the Wilson Bruins. It was there that the first steps on his future were written with the help of football coach Skip Rowland. Peterson played end, doing more blocking than catching, and also kicked extra points in a straight-on style. He was part of the graduating class of 1961 at Wilson and went on to earn three degrees from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA): a bachelor's degree in 1966, a master's degree in 1967, and a doctorate in 1970. His football playing career ended during a practice at UCLA (where he was a walk-on participant), when he suffered three torn knee ligaments. His coaching career began soon afterwards, at his alma mater, where he helped Rowland with the varsity and coached the junior-varsity team. He moved on to Loyola High School in Los Angeles, where he coached the offensive line for head coach Mario DiMuro, and also taught classes in math, geometry, trigonometry and health sciences. In 1969, he applied for and was hired at a new college - California State Sonoma—now known as Sonoma State University—in the Santa Rosa/Rohnert Park, California area. It was one of 18 California state universities. He was hired as the head baseball coach and an assistant under head football coach Lloyd Helgeson. Sonoma State competed the junior varsity level in 1969. Peterson succeeded Helgeson as head coach in 1970 when Sonoma State moved up to varsity status, competing at the NCAA College Division level. He led Sonoma State to a record of 6–12–1 in two seasons, 1970 and 1971, before the school disbanded its football program in 1972. Peterson left Sonoma State in February 1973 to become an assistant football coach at UCLA under head coach Pepper Rodgers. When Dick Vermeil took over as head coach of the UCLA Bruins in 1974, he retained Peterson on his coaching staff that eventually led UCLA to a Rose Bowl upset over head coach Woody Hayes' No. 1-ranked Ohio State Buckeyes on January 1, 1976.\n\nParagraph 3: Chronos made his debut in Ivy Town, but was defeated by the Atom when he tried to steal an atomic clock because of an idea ironically given to him by Ray Palmer. He came close to deducing the Atom's secret identity when he realized the Atom attacked him soon after Ray saw him, and succeeded in capturing the Atom and placing him inside a watch. The Atom escaped the watch while Chronos was breaking into a vault, and used a trick to make him think he was wrong. However he escaped from jail by adapting a guard's watch, making the ticks so loud they broke open his cell door. He next tried to steal a collection of historic Hungarian clocks which each had a gem hidden inside, but was again defeated. The Atom has since thwarted all of Chronos' plans. Each appearance or new crime prompted an evolution in Chronos' weaponry. His study of time led to more intricate and revolutionary inventions—lenses that prevent people from seeing certain events (e.g. his getaway vehicle or another specific object), circuitry embedded in his costume that could control the local flow of time, an hourglass of concentrated time that could speed points up briefly and even make bricks next to a bank vault crumble in a few seconds, and ultimately a fully functional time machine (before it and the designs were destroyed). One story suggests that Chronos may have been receiving help from a future version of himself, but it is unknown at what relative time frame that Chronos came from. Another story, published in World's Finest Comics #321 (1985), suggests that Chronos made the transition from a mere thief with a time gimmick to a full-fledged time traveler after becoming acquainted with the mysterious Dr. Fox, a criminal scientist who had never been apprehended and who was described by Chronos as \"the greatest mind since Einstein\". Pre-Crisis Chronos was a member of the Crime Champions, a trio of Earth-1 villains who teamed up with a trio of Earth-2 villains to commit robberies, then escape to the other world using a vibratory device the Fiddler accidentally discovered. Chronos is able to escape Wonder Woman, Batman and Green Lantern after stealing a million dollars from the Powers City Bank. When the Earth-2 Crime Champions impersonate the Earth-1 Crime Champions, the Icicle impersonates Chronos with the help of the Wizard's Tibetan magic, and fought Batman, Wonder Woman and Green Lantern, making them touch rubber, animal, and glass as part of a spell to trap the JLA. On Earth-2 Chronos tries to steal a rare clock from a lighthouse, and uses his vibratory watch to put Aquaman into a coma, but Superman is able to revive Aquaman and captures Chronos, crushing his watch. The JLA and JSA are captured again and magically placed in cages in space, but with the aid of the Green Lanterns escape and return to Earth. Chronos tries to help the Fiddler find an Earth-3 with his chronological knowledge, but is defeated by the Martian Manhunter and Black Canary.\n\nParagraph 4: One of the victims of the attack was a 16-year-old girl who tried to get away from the advancing soldiers, but was chased down and beaten to death near the steps of the government building, receiving blows to the head and chest. She was dragged out of the area by her mother, who was also attacked and wounded. This particularly violent attack was recorded on video from the balcony of a building located on the other side of the avenue. The video was used in the aftermath as evidence during Soviet politician  Anatoly Sobchak's Parliamentary commission on investigation of events of April 9, 1989. Groups of Soviet soldiers were reported to chase individual victims, rather than dispersing the crowd.\n\nParagraph 5: On January 31 at the tapings of the February 3 episode of Impact!, Fortune, without Flair, who was not at the show due to a torn rotator cuff, turned face by attacking Immortal, when they interfered in a TNA World Heavyweight Championship rematch between Anderson and Hardy, in the process revealing themselves to be the \"they\" Kurt Angle and Crimson had been referring to for the past weeks. A.J. Styles explained that Fortune was not going to allow Bischoff to destroy TNA like he did to World Championship Wrestling (WCW). Flair returned on February 14 at the tapings of the February 17 episode of Impact!, promising Eric Bischoff to bring Fortune and Immortal back together. Later, during a match between A.J. Styles and Immortal member Matt Hardy, Flair came to ringside cheering on Styles, before turning on him and costing him the match, revealing himself still being aligned with Immortal. On March 13 at Victory Road, Fortune scored a clean sweep, when Kazarian successfully defended the X Division Championship in an Ultimate X match against Jeremy Buck, Max Buck and Robbie E, Beer Money, Inc. successfully defended the World Tag Team Championship against Ink Inc. (Jesse Neal and Shannon Moore) and Styles defeated Matt Hardy, managed by Flair, in a singles match. On the following episode of Impact!, Styles was sidelined with a storyline injury, when Immortal's newest member, Bully Ray, aided by Flair, powerbombed him off the entrance stage through a table. On the March 31 episode of Impact!, Christopher Daniels made his return to TNA and aligned himself with Fortune in their battle with Immortal, vowing to avenge his best friend, A.J. Styles. On April 17 at Lockdown, Daniels, Kazarian, Roode and Storm defeated Immortal representatives Ric Flair, Abyss, Bully Ray and Matt Hardy in a Lethal Lockdown match, after Styles made his return and attacked Ray. On the following episode of Impact!, Daniels was officially named a member of Fortune. On May 16 at the tapings of the May 19 episode of Impact Wrestling, Kazarian lost the X Division Championship to Abyss. On June 12 at Slammiversary IX, Styles ended his feud with Bully Ray by losing to him in a Last Man Standing match. On July 10 at Destination X, TNA's first ever all X Division pay-per-view, Fortune members Styles and Daniels faced each other in the main event, with Styles emerging victorious. Fortune resumed their feud with Immortal on the July 14 episode of Impact Wrestling by disguising themselves as clowns and attacking each member of the group, preventing them from interfering in the evening's main event, where Mr. Anderson ended up losing the TNA World Heavyweight Championship to Sting. On August 7 at Hardcore Justice, Styles, Daniels and Kazarian defeated Immortal representatives Abyss, Gunner and Scott Steiner in a six-man tag team match. Two days later, at the tapings of the August 18 episode of Impact Wrestling, Beer Money, Inc.'s record-setting TNA World Tag Team Championship reign ended, when they lost the title to Mexican America (Anarquia and Hernandez).\n\nParagraph 6: According to Smith, he did not retranslate the material that Harris had lost because he said that if he did, evil men would alter the manuscript in an effort to discredit him. Smith said that instead, he had been divinely ordered to replace the lost material with Nephi's account of the same events. When Smith reached the end of the book, he said he was told that God had foreseen the loss of the early manuscript and had prepared the same history in an abridged format that emphasized religious history, the Small Plates of Nephi. Smith transcribed this portion, and it appears as the first part of the book. When published in 1830, the Book of Mormon contained a statement about the lost 116 pages, as well as the Testimony of Three Witnesses and the Testimony of Eight Witnesses, who claimed to have seen and handled the golden plates. According to Jeffrey R. Holland, an apostle in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), \"it was not tit for tat, this for that — you give me 116 pages of manuscript and I'll give you 142 pages of printed text. Not so: We got back more than we lost. And it was known from the beginning that it would be so.\"\n\nParagraph 7: Power noise  (also known as rhythmic noise) takes its inspiration from some of the more structured and distorted early industrial acts, such as Esplendor Geométrico. The Belgian group Dive also anticipated the style in the early '90s. Power noise groups meld noise music with various forms of electronic dance music.  The term \"power noise\" was coined by Raoul Roucka of Noisex in 1997, with the track \"United (Power Noise Movement)\". Typically, power noise is based upon a distorted kick drum from a drum machine such as a Roland TR-909, uses militaristic 4/4 beats, and is usually instrumental.  Sometimes a melodic component is added, but this is almost always secondary to the rhythm.  Power noise tracks are typically structured and danceable, but are occasionally abstract. This genre is showcased at the annual Maschinenfest festival in Krefeld, Germany, as well as at Infest in Bradford, England. Other artists include Imminent Starvation, Axiome, Converter, and Terrorfakt. The German labels Ant-Zen and Hands Productions specialize in the style. Technoid grew out of the scene, taking inspiration from IDM, experimental techno and noise music. German label Hymen Records is responsible for the term and the style. Artists include Gridlock, Black Lung, Revolution State, and Xingu Hill.\n\nParagraph 8: The school is believed to have been founded in Saxon times, but the first documentary proof of a school in the town is dated 1348 when Ricardum le Chamberlayn, who is described as 'the former master of the Schoolhouse' was one of 138 people who failed to appear before the Court of the King's Bench. It is suggested that he was involved in a mass disturbance, perhaps a riot. The medieval school, which was connected to a collegiate church in Ripon, was given land by benefactors but, in order to protect the school from the seizing of land by Henry VIII, priests told the king's commissioners the land had nothing to do with the church and the school was saved. However, in 1550, when the authorities discovered the chicanery that had occurred, the Duchy of Lancaster seized the lands and the future of the school was in doubt. Queen Mary, the only child of Henry VIII and his first wife, Catherine of Aragon, looked kindly on the school and signed a royal charter which established the Free Grammar School of Queen Mary at Ripon, granted the school's ten governors the disputed land. The re-founding in 1555 during the reign of Queen Mary is regarded as the foundation of the modern Ripon Grammar School. Originally a boys' school, the school merged with Ripon Girls' High School to become coeducational in 1962. Although most pupils are day pupils from the surrounding area and Ripon itself, there are boys' and girls' boarding houses, School House and Johnson House, which accommodate 100 pupils.\n\nParagraph 9: Bazil Marian nicknamed \"Bombardierul\" (The Bomber) because of his powerful shots was born on 7 November 1922 in Uioara de Sus, Romania and started playing junior level football at age 11 at local club Solvay. He made his Divizia A debut playing for Victoria Cluj on 24 September 1947 in a 2–1 home victory against Venus București. Victoria relegated by the end of the season, but he stayed in Divizia A, playing one season for Mica Brad before moving at Carmen București. At Carmen in December 1946 in a game against Ciocanul București at the score of 4–0 he ran alone towards the opposite goal, dribbled the goalkeeper, after which he sat down with his bottom on the ball and his hand over his eyes, as if looking for his opponents, before pushing the ball into the net. At the end of the season, following another victory against Ciocanul with 6–0 in which he scored two goals, the Carmen team was dissolved by the Communist regime that just took over the country, so he and teammate Valentin Stănescu wanted to flee to Italy, going on a ship from the Port of Constanța but were caught by the authorities who told them that they can choose from either going to jail or play for a working-class team such as Locomotiva București and both of them chose the latter. At Locomotiva he managed to score 32 goals in 24 appearances in the 1947–48 Divizia A season but did not win the top-goalscorer of the league as ITA Arad's Ladislau Bonyhádi scored a record of 49 goals. In 1950 in a game against CFR Timișoara, The Bomber scored a goal with a powerful shot from 18 meters that broke the net and after the game the opponents goalkeeper, Dumitru Pavlovici said:\"I am the happiest that Marian's bomb was a goal. Otherwise, if his kick would have hit me in full, I would have gone straight to the hospital\". At the end of the 1951 Divizia A season, Locomotiva relegated to Divizia B but Marian stayed with the club, helping it promote back to the first league after one season, also in a match played in a cold weather against Metalul București he scored a goal which was cancelled by the referee so he ran to the fence from the stands, where boiled țuică was sold and drank a cup, afterwards coming back to the pitch, scoring another goal which the referee cancelled again so he went to drink another cup of țuică, then he went and shook the referee's hand and asked to be replaced, leaving the pitch saying that if he scores another goal and it gets cancelled, he'll have to drink another cup and he will get drunk. He retired to start his coaching career after playing for Locomotiva on 14 November 1954 in a Divizia A match which ended with a 3–2 loss against Progresul Oradea, however six years later at age 39 he came out of retirement after he promoted Jiul Petroșani to the first league because the squad wasn't too strong, playing 14 games in which he scored two goals.\n\nParagraph 10: During the next crisis—the near-rebellion of Richard of York in Autumn 1450—Mowbray took York's side against the new royal favourite, Edmund Beaufort, Duke of Somerset. York canvassed Mowbray for support, as he was one of the few nobles openly critical of the court. For the former, this was a logical alliance as Mowbray was as bitter an enemy of Somerset as York was.  Mowbray gathered his forces at Ipswich on 8 November (having ordered John Paston to meet him there \"with as many clenly people as ye may get\"), and may have travelled into London with York, who had also recruited locally. Thus, when he arrived for the parliament it was with a large, heavily armed force. Mowbray was appointed, with the Duke of York and Earl of Devon, to maintain law and order in the City of London for the duration of the parliament, though his retinue caused as much trouble as it prevented. On 1 December, they joined with York's force and attacked Somerset's house in Blackfriars. The battle lead to the beleaguered duke seeking refuge in the Tower of London in for his own protection. Two days later the King and his magnates rode through London with up to 10,000 men; Mowbray rode ahead with a force of 3,000. The display was carefully designed to quell any remnants of support for Cade's rebels.", "answers": ["Paragraph 3"], "length": 3351, "dataset": "passage_retrieval_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "e76dfa479902ed7538fd64855456b7d4ff3831d2d2c701aa"}
{"input": "The text discusses the life of Dowd, who was drafted into the military at the age of 18 and given the rank of sergeant. Despite being in the military, he continued his studies in physics at Columbia University. He was involved in the famous Manhattan Project, where he worked on developing the atomic bomb. The true purpose of the project was only revealed in 1945. Dowd had plans to pursue a degree in nuclear physics after completing his work on the Manhattan Project. However, due to the top secrecy of his work, the university did not recognize it, and he ultimately decided not to continue his education there since the curriculum wouldn't have offered advanced physics education compared to his research work for the military.", "context": "Paragraph 1: Religion plays an important role in Knights of Honor. There are 4 different types of religion: The Catholic Church, The Orthodox Church, Islam, and Paganism. The catholic Pope has much influence in medieval Europe. He can excommunicate catholic kingdoms and call for crusades against non-catholic kingdoms. When a player chooses to go on a crusade they are granted powerful Crusader units. When the Pope dies, his successor is chosen among several clerics throughout Europe. If the player happens to have a very experienced cleric, there is a chance he will be chosen as Pope. From then on, the player controls the Pope and can choose to excommunicate kingdoms and call for crusades, a successful crusade can result in a puppet state that is unquestionably loyal to the leader of the crusade or plunder the town for a huge sum of gold. The Catholic Church is located in Western Europe and the Mediterranean.  Orthodox factions are located in south east Europe and answer to Byzantia. These factions can declare independence and form their own churches which grants them a greater sum of gold while lacking the disadvantage of being excommunicated which results in a gold penalty. Islamic empires have the ability to call a Jihad which is similar to a Crusade and will cause armies to spawn at their borders and attack any invaders or rebels. This is a powerful ability but it has a long cool down period . Islam is found in north Africa and the middle east. Paganism is the smallest religion being found only in Scandinavia and some parts of eastern Europe. Pagans do not collect piety (a religious resource used to build certain units and buildings and perform some diplomatic options) so are free to focus on gold and are not troubled by religious problems such as religious tension but they have a penalty on their income and have bad relations with all other religions. Paganism is the only religion the player or other kingdoms cannot convert to, the only way to play as a pagan nation is to start the game as one. The player can renounce his faith and adopt another official religion (except paganism) but such religious conflict will often split the kingdom up and one must reunify the nations as a result.\n\nParagraph 2: The conscription issue divided the Labor Party and wider Australian community in 1916. While much of the Australian labour movement and general community was opposed to conscription, Australian Labor Prime Minister Billy Hughes and Premier Holman strongly supported conscription, and both crossed the floor to vote with the conservative parties, and both were expelled from the Labor Party. When Hughes met with the executive of NSW Labor in September 1916 to attempt to persuade them to back his conscription plan, he lost the vote 21–5 and was warned that he would be expelled if he continued to press the matter. Ernest Durack became state party leader, while Holman formed a coalition on 15 November 1916 with the leader of the opposition Liberal Reform Party, Charles Wade, with himself as Premier. Following the exodus of pro-conscription MPs from the party, many leaders of the Industrial Section took advantage of the new vacancies to secure selection for open seats. Early in 1917, Holman and his supporters merged with Liberal Reform to form the state branch of the Nationalist Party of Australia, with Holman as leader.  At the 1917 election, the Nationalists won a huge victory. During his leadership of the Nationalist government, Holman vigorously defended the government-owned enterprises from his fellow conservatives in power. Durack's leadership lasted only for about three months, and he was succeeded by John Storey in February 1917. In April 1918 the Industrial Section changed its name to the Industrial Vigilance Council, a change in part prompted by a leftward shift in the union movement influenced by the Great War and the Russian Revolution. At this point it was increasingly beset by internal divisions, in particular between the relatively conservative AWU and smaller unions and radicals such as the syndicalist-influenced Sam Rosa. This came to a head during 1919 due to divisions over whether conscription should end following the closing of the First World War and whether the Australian union movement should adopt the syndicalist principle of the One Big Union. The faction was wound up in August 1919, with many of its radicals such as Albert Willis going on to form the Industrial Socialist Labor Party. This left the state party firmly in the control of the AWU At the 1920 election, Holman and his Nationalists were thrown from office in a massive swing, being succeeded by a Labor Government led by Storey. Labor won the 1920 election with a majority of one.\n\nParagraph 3: Apna Dal was founded on 4 November 1995 by Sone Lal Patel. Sonelal Patel had been a close associate of dalit leader Kanshi Ram, and along with Ram, he had been one of the founders of the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP). However, Kanshi Ram started giving great importance to his young female protégée, Mayawati, to the disappointment of many other party workers who had worked very hard to build the BSP. Mayawati's arrogant attitude was also resented by them. Matters came to a head in 1995, when for the first time ever, the BSP got the chance to head a coalition government in Uttar Pradesh, and Kanshi Ram chose Mayawati to be the Chief Minister. The government headed by Mayawati was extremely short-lived (June to October 1995), but the internal pressure which had built up in the party during this time was enough to cause many people to leave the BSP and form a new political party.\n\nParagraph 4: Frank Navetta (March 6, 1962 – October 31, 2008) was an American musician who was the original guitarist of the punk rock band the Descendents, which he co-founded. He formed the band in Manhattan Beach, California with Dave Nolte in the late 1970s and played on their 1979 debut single, the Fat EP (1981), and their first album, Milo Goes to College (1982). Navetta then quit the band and moved to Oregon to become a fisherman. He collaborated with the Descendents again on the 1996 album Everything Sucks, and prior to his death in 2008 had been working on new material with original Descendents members Bill Stevenson and Tony Lombardo. In 2021, the band released this material on the album 9th & Walnut, which has been critically lauded for Frank's songwriting and playing.\n\nParagraph 5: At age 18, Dowd was drafted into the military with the rank of sergeant. He continued his work in physics at Columbia University. He worked on the Manhattan Project, which developed the atomic bomb. The purpose of the work was unclear until 1945. Dowd planned to obtain a degree in nuclear physics when he completed his work on the Manhattan Project. However, because his work was top secret, the university did not recognize it, and Dowd decided not to continue, since the university's curriculum would not have been able to further his physics education. His research for the military was more advanced than academic courses at that time.\n\nParagraph 6: Granite Peak is often considered the second most difficult state high point to climb after Denali in Alaska, due to technical climbing, poor weather, and route finding. Granite Peak's first ascent was made by Elers Koch, James C. Whitham, and R.T. Ferguson on August 29, 1923, after several failed attempts by others. It was the last of the state high points to be climbed. Today, climbers typically spend two or three days ascending the peak, stopping over on the Froze-to-Death Plateau, although some climbers choose to ascend the peak in a single day. Another route that has gained popularity in recent years is the Southwest Couloir route, a non-technical route from the south starting near Cooke City; climbers generally take two days to complete it.\n\nParagraph 7: Some accounts state Hudson spent 1978 with the Seattle Sounders.  If he did, he never signed a professional contract as Hudson entered Belleville Area College in 1979 and played two seasons of college soccer.  He was a 1980 Honorable Mention National Junior College All American.  A September 10, 1981, newspaper article mentions a soccer camp at which \"professional players . . . Austin Hudson (Cleveland)\" will instruct.  Regardless, Hudson spent the 1981-1982 Major Indoor Soccer League season with the Kansas City Comets.  In 1982, he moved to the Oklahoma City Slickers of the American Soccer League.  The American Soccer League collapsed after the 1983 season, and the Slickers moved to the newly created United Soccer League and changed their name to the Oklahoma City Stampede.  In the fall of 1984, Hudson signed with the Louisville Thunder of the American Indoor Soccer Association.  On September 25, 1986, the Memphis Storm of the AISA signed Hudson.  He broke his shoulder during the season and returned to Oklahoma City to rehabilitate the shoulder.  In 1987, Hudson joined the Oklahoma City Warriors of the Southwest Indoor Soccer League.  He was the 1987–88 Southwest Indoor Soccer League MVP and assists leader.  Hudson then returned to the outdoor game with the Austin Thunder during the 1988 Lone Star Soccer Alliance season.  In the fall of 1988, he went on trial with several teams in Germany, but returned to sign with the Dayton Dynamo of the AISA.  In January 1989, Hudson returned to the Warriors as a player-assistant coach.  That summer the Warriors played outdoors in the 1989 Southwest Outdoor Soccer League.  Hudson played for them as they finished last in the league, then remained with the Warriors for the 1989–90 Southwest Independent Soccer League season.  In the fall of 1990, Hudson began the season as the head coach of the Tulsa Renegades.  The Renegades released him at mid-season and Hudson returned to the Warriors in December 1990.  He played ten games, then quit the team in February 1991 after a dispute with the team's management.  In August 1992, Hudson was back with the Warriors.  When the Warriors merged with the Oklahoma City Spirit of the LSSA and formed the Oklahoma City Slickers, Hudson continued to play for the new team until the end of the 1994 season.  In 1996, he played for the Oklahoma City Heat.  In 2008, he became the head coach of Fort Worth FC of the Women's Premier Soccer League.\n\nParagraph 8: Lorna Cordeiro is a popular singer and is referred to as the \"nightingale of Goa\". She sings in both English and Konkani. Some of her popular oldies are Pisso, Bebdo, Red Rose, Tuzo mog and Noxibak Rodta. Other popular musicians and singers include Anthony Gonsalves (violinist), António Fortunato de Figueiredo (conductor and violinist), Chris Perry (often called the king of Goan music), Hema Sardesai (playback singer), Ian D'Sa, (former guitarist of Canadian band Billy Talent, of Goan descent), Remo Fernandes (musician and playback singer), Kishori Amonkar (classical vocalist), Dinanath Mangeshkar (dramatist and classical vocalist), and Oliver Sean (singer/songwriter). Goa has produced many performers of Indian classical music, such as the vocalist Kesarbai Kerkar, Lata Mangeshkar and Asha Bhosle.\n\nParagraph 9: Sir Frederick Miles Warren   (10 May 1929 – 9 August 2022) was a New Zealand architect. He apprenticed under Cecil Wood before studying architecture at the University of Auckland, eventually working at the London County Council where he was exposed to British New Brutalism. Upon returning to Christchurch, and forming the practice Warren and Mahoney, he was instrumental in developing the \"Christchurch School\" of architecture, an intersection between the truth-to-materials and structural expression that characterised Brutalism, and the low-key, Scandinavian and Japanese commitment to \"straightforwardness\". He retired from Warren and Mahoney in 1994 but continued to consult as an architect and maintain his historic home and garden at Ohinetahi.\n\nParagraph 10: Walker had some international racing experience early in his career in the Australian rounds of the Tasman series in 1964–65 on challenging tracks like Longford and Sandown at a time when most Australian National 2.5 drives were near world class and he also finished 5th in the ex Follmer Lotus 70 in the Nov 1970 Australian GP at Warwick Farm. While few would have been surprised that Walker failed to match the fastest Australian F5000 driver  Frank Matich, Neil Allen and Kevin Bartlett, it was a pointer to Walker's later big car problems that at Warwick Farm he was slower than Australia's leading 2-litre single seater exponents, Kevin Bartlett, Max Stewart and Leo Geoghegan. During the 1960s Walker's racing career faltered (he was the 1969 British Formula Ford Champion and finished third in the 1969 European Formula Ford Championship), however finally broke through racing a works Team Lotus Formula Three car in 1970 and 1971. Walker dominated Formula 3 in those years against strong opposition including from James Hunt who found Walker's later failure in F1 inexplicable. He won 25 out of 32 races in 1971, including the Formula Three support races at the Monaco Grand Prix and the British Grand Prix at Silverstone. By the end of the year he had won both the Shell and Forward Trust UK Formula Three titles. In his initial non championship races in a Lotus 72 in early 1971 at the Race of Champion at Brands Hatch and at Hockenheim, Walker qualified only on the 3rd row and was no faster than John Miles in a BRM P160 who Walker had effectively replaced in the Lotus team.  Lotus founder Colin Chapman, was contractually bound by his John Player, British Imperial sponsors who rated Walker highly, to put Walker in F1 and when he won the 1971 F3 championship give Walker a full season Lotus F1 team drive. Imperial Tobacco extraordinarily wanted, Dave Walker to lead the Lotus F1 team in 1972 as they thought Fittipaldi form was patchy and he had not done enough. Walker was handed his Formula One debut at the 1971 Dutch Grand Prix to drive the Lotus 56B, powered by a Pratt & Whitney turbine engine. During the rain-affected race, Walker used the turbine car's advantages of four wheel drive and superior torque to rise from his starting position of 22nd to 10th place within five laps, but eventually spun off into retirement. The Lotus team management, Chapman and Manager Peter Warr were less than impressed as they thought the turbine Lotus 56 had an overwhelming advantage in the conditions and Firestone tyres well suited to the rain and had Walker taken a more cautious approach he was almost guaranteed victory\n\nParagraph 11: Towards the close of the fourth hour of the race, Dumbreck's Mercedes came into contact with the GTS-class Porsche 911 GT2 of the Estoril Racing team at the Ford Chicanes, but continued with no apparent damage.  On lap 76 Dumbreck was in third place and catching Thierry Boutsen's Toyota in second place.  The Mercedes and Toyota were nose to tail on the run from Mulsannes Corner to Indianapolis at nearly  with both drivers partially blinded by the setting sun ahead of them.  At a slight right kink in the straight, Dumbreck's CLR ran over the small apex kerbing and suddenly lifted its front wheels from the ground before somersaulting backwards as the entire car became airborne.  The Mercedes rotated three times as it flew in the air, reaching a height of nearly .  The car continued its trajectory as the circuit curved to the right, clearing a marshaling post and the safety barrier on the left side of the track and missing a large advertising billboard bridging the track just ahead of it.  Television cameras broadcasting the live world feed captured the CLR's aerobatics before it went out of view behind trees.  The car impacted the ground in an area of woods alongside the circuit that had been cut and cleared only two weeks prior and was inaccessible to spectators.  The car dug a rut in the dirt as it continued to tumble in the clearing.  The impact forced a tree limb to penetrate the monocoque between the driver's seat and fuel tank.  The CLR came to rest right side up and track marshals rushed to the stopped car.  Track officials quickly slowed the race with caution flags and safety cars to dispatch recovery vehicles.  Dumbreck was knocked unconscious after the initial impact but awoke and climbed from the car where he was found by the marshals and local Gendarmerie officers in the area.  Dumbreck was later given a breathalyser test by the officers due to Le Mans' use of public roads before being transported by ambulance to a local hospital for examinations before being released.  At the end of the 76th lap Lagorce was ordered by the team to bring the remaining CLR directly to its garage; upon the car's arrival AMG-Mercedes shut the last of its three garage doors signifying its official retirement from the event.  National rivals BMW went on to win the race the following day.\n\nParagraph 12: Ta'isha, or Ta'aisha, or Taaisha, one of a series of Arabic-speaking groups collectively called Baggara \"cattle people\", who live in Sudan, across southern Kordofan, Darfur, as well as Chad. The Ta'aisha tribal homeland is in the far southwest of Darfur, neighbouring to the east the Habbaniya, with whom they are closely related. The Ta'aisha rose to power when one of the members of their tribe, Abdallahi ibn Muhammad, later known as the Khalifa, became an early follower of Muhammad Ahmad, who would later become the Sudanese Mahdi. During the revolution, 'Abdallahi became the strongman of the movement and was designated as senior Khalifa by the Mahdi. Following the Mahdi's death in June 1885, the Khalifa 'Abdallahi ruled the Mahdist state until its destruction by an Anglo-Egyptian army. The Khalifa during his rule brought his tribe to Central Sudan and he went on to make extensive use of his relatives and other fellow Ta'a'isha as soldiers and administrators. Throughout the Mahdist period there was constant tension between the Ta'aisha leaders and the riverain Sudanese. Several Ta'aisha amirs who survived the Mahdiyya became prominent at the re-established Darfur Sultanate of Ali Dinar, one being Arabi Dafallah, who was appointed commander of the Equatorial province with its headquarters at Rejaf under the Khalifa's rule. Having been forced in 1897 to evacuate Equatoria by Belgians advancing from the Congo, he had made his way into southern Darfur where he faced Anglo-Egyptian forces and friendly tribes sent by Kitchener in pursuit of him. He then settled in the area of the present Central African Republic-Darfur border where he came into contact with encroaching French colonial power. After an unsuccessful attack on French outposts in the region he surrendered to Sultan 'Ali Dinar with his men and their arms in 1902, he subsequently lived in Al-Fashir and took part in many of the Sultan's military expeditions. Another one was 'Ali al-Sanusi, who was a Mahdist amir under Mahmud Ahmad in Atbara and fought at Karari after which he escaped to Darfur to be one of 'Ali Dinar's best generals. Under the British colonial rule, He was appointed Nazir of the Ta'aisha in Darfur and rendered valuable service to the new administration.\n\nParagraph 13: An author described the traditional IRA in 1982 as \"the biggest tax break in history\". The IRA is held at a custodian institution such as a bank or brokerage, and may be invested in anything that the custodian allows (for instance, a bank may allow certificates of deposit, and a brokerage may allow stocks and mutual funds). Unlike the Roth IRA, the only criterion for being eligible to contribute to a traditional IRA is sufficient income to make the contribution. However, the best provision of a traditional IRA — the tax-deductibility of contributions — has strict eligibility requirements based on income, filing status, and availability of other retirement plans (mandated by the Internal Revenue Service). Transactions in the account, including interest, dividends, and capital gains, are not subject to tax while still in the account, but upon withdrawal from the account, withdrawals are subject to federal income tax (see below for details). This is in contrast to a Roth IRA, in which contributions are never tax-deductible, but qualified withdrawals are tax free. The traditional IRA also has more restrictions on withdrawals than a Roth IRA. With both types of IRA, transactions inside the account (including capital gains, dividends, and interest) incur no tax liability.", "answers": ["Paragraph 5"], "length": 3517, "dataset": "passage_retrieval_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "1ff726e8ab922a46ba5dc09c8ab8325d22e1488aa716e4fd"}

Here. This. takes place in a natural history museum. The show follows the adventures and evolution of four friends as they journey through time--from the present day museum, to the past, and back again. Along the way, the \\exhibits inspire them to share stories from their lives. The action begins with a Big Bang. The opening number (What Are the Odds) tracks the evolution of the human race, all the way up to the moment when the foursome arrive at this very moment in time, on this stage, at this theatre, in front of this audience. Naturally, the discussion turns to the teaching of Trappist monk Thomas Merton, \"because nothing says musical theatre like a discussion about a Trappist monk.\" Merton asked folks to keep in mind three words: Now (not the past or the future), Here (exactly where you are), and This (whatever it is you're doing). Merton believed that if you can get to the intersection of these three things (\"Now. Here. This.), then you will be truly present to experience \"more life.\" The scene shifts to a planetarium exhibit in the museum, and the foursome ponder life's big and small questions, each expressing their desire for things that they hope will bring them happiness: more stuff, more love, more magic dogs named \"Mr. Winston Sparkles\" (More Life). The group decides to divide and conquer the museum in search of more life and the Now. Here. This. As they explore, exhibits begin to trigger memories and stories. At the deep sea exhibit, Jeff relives his experience performing at his middle school's Pancake Supper where she slays the audience with a mean Ed Grimley impersonation, and discovers his ability to cloak his true self from unwanted scrutiny (Dazzle Camouflage). For Heidi, it's recollections of childhood attention-seeking in the Hall of Birds (Give Me Your Attention). Hunter escapes into his familiar fantasy world while staring at a turtle display, imagining good times with his superdeluxe fantasy boyfriend (Archer), and at the bee exhibit, Susan recognizes herself as the busy bee who over-schedules her life with activities to distract from the discomfort of growing up in an unusual house (I Rarely Schedule Nothing). As their memories and stories grow into a chaotic (Cacophony), they all begin to understand the obstacles that stand between them and the Now. Here. This. The four then regroup in the Hall of Human Origins. Native garments and rituals ignite adolescent hopes of the perfect garment that will bring happiness and popularity (Members Only). Susan and Heidi sing about two kinds of lives with two different sets of struggles (That'll Never Be Me). Jeff recalls the regret of missing out on real college friends and fun because he was afraid to reveal his true self (Kick Me). The four friends continue to explore the museum and come across information about Aboriginal family trees and tribes. The gang sings in celebration of having found each other--their chosen tribe--out of all the people in the world (Then Comes You). A museum exhibit about the measurement of time inspires them to sing about an afternoon boat ride that seemed to last a millennium (The Amazing Adventures of the \"Doc\" Wilbert S. Pound). In (That Makes Me Hot) they exchange stories about moments when they found themselves in the 'Now. Here. This. Susan shares the myth of the (\"Golden Palace\"), a faraway place where only the privileged few are granted admission. In (Get Into It) we experience Hunter's fantasy world from the inside and the outside. Heidi struggles with rules and expectations determined long ago, eventually realizing that she can now define her own rules and choose her own adventure (This Time). After a full day at the museum, the (\"Finale\") exhorts the audience leave the museum of the past, to consciously step directly into the Now. Here.

On June 21, 2005, U.S. Under Secretary of State for Democracy and Global Affairs Paula Dobriansky used the term during a speech for the Hudson Institute: \"North Korea, Burma, Zimbabwe and Cuba are outposts of tyranny.\" In response, the North Korean deputy ambassador to the United Nations, Han Song-ryol, stated, \"Resuming the six-party talks would be possible if there is restraint on the part of the U.S. from using the words 'outpost of tyranny' for one month.\" South Korean Foreign Minister Ban Ki-moon was concerned over the implications for inter-Korean relations: \"It is regrettable for a high U.S. official to call North Korea an 'outpost of tyranny', which is not good for the two Koreas' efforts to have a reconciliatory atmosphere.\"\n\nParagraph 3: Dave Wilson Nursery is the largest wholesale grower of fruit trees for the home garden in the United States. It’s afamily-owned and operated nursery established in 1938, and now a corporation. It is one of the largest growers of deciduous fruit, nut and shade trees in the USA, farming more than  on a four-year rotation, growing more than two million trees a year. Its growing grounds are east of Modesto, California, near Hickman, California; and its regional office and variety test block are situated east of Reedley, California. The nursery, says its website, is the primary licensee and propagator (in the United States) of new fruit varieties developed by Zaiger's Genetics, including the Pluot and the Aprium.\n\nParagraph 4: Khasan is the only Russian-inhabited locality on the border with North Korea. It lies near Lake Khasan and the Tumen River. The border between Russia and North Korea is formed by the river, but the Tumen's course sometimes changes during floods, effectively diminishing the territory of Russia and threatening to flood the settlement of Khasan and the Peschanaya border station. Since 2003, work has been progressing to reinforce the area with rocky soil for protection against erosion by the river. There is an unobtrusive Russian outpost near the border with a large radar array. On the North Korean side of the border lies Tumangang. The closest Chinese town is Fangchuan.\n\nParagraph 5: \"Miracle\" was well received on the charts, with most of the chart climbing occurring during 2006 to 2007. The song appeared on the Ö3 Austria Top 75 on the chart's issue date of 26 May 2004, charting at number fifty-eight. The second week on the chart saw the song climb thirty-four places to number twenty-four, its highest peak on the chart. It lasted nine more weeks after, leaving the chart at number seventy-five on the chart issue date of 25 July 2007. \"Miracle\" debuted high on the Swedish pop charts at number eleven. It fell next week to number eighteen and stayed there for another week before falling four places to twenty-two. In its next week, the song logged its highest peak at number ten in its fifth and eighth week on the chart. In Ireland, the song logged twenty consecutive weeks on the charts, peaking at number four in its seventh week and logging four non-consecutive weeks within the top ten positions. \"Miracle\" charted for a moderate amount of time in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, logging between eleven and twelve weeks on the chart starting in mid-February 2007. It logged three non-consecutive weeks in its peak position of number six on the Dutch Top 40 and one week at its peak of number eight on the UK Singles Chart. The song lasted a total of six weeks within the top ten in the Netherlands. In France, the song charted most successfully, logging its first four weeks at number two. The song reached the summit of the SNEP chart in its fifth week. It continued its chart run for twenty-three more weeks, lasting within the top ten for four more weeks. It exited the chart on the week after the chart issue date of 29 September 2007, exiting at number ninety-seven. The song charted poorly in Switzerland, lasting one week on the chart at number eighty-five.\n\nParagraph 6: Following the secession of South Carolina from the Union on December 20, 1860, citizens of Forsyth County were reported in local newspapers as having sparred over the subject of the possibility of the future secession of North Carolina. The county's Whig newspaper, The People's Press, is cited as having advised its readers to \"watch their tongues\" in response to the recent outbreak of quarreling. A public meeting was arranged to be held at the Winston courthouse on December 29 to discuss this issue. In 1860, Forsyth had a population of 12,692, of that population an estimated 800 citizens attended the meeting that day, roughly 16% of the total population. R. L. Patterson, who was asked to serve as chairman of the meeting, said that the event was held for members of the community to \"counsel together\" — \"and to see if there was not some common ground on which all [local] parties could unite in the present crisis.\" D. H. Starbuck was one of five men who addressed the meeting. It was Starbuck's motion that the chairman appoint a committee of fifteen gentlemen to draft resolutions on how the meeting should act. Starbuck was among the men appointed to the committee. Rufus Watson Wharton with whom Starbuck had previously shared a residence in 1850, was also among them. Other notable members included lawyer and editor of The Western Sentinel Col. John Wesley Alspaugh, Dr. Beverly Jones, Dr. T. F. Keehln, Col. Joseph Masten, lawyer John Watson, and Judge Thomas J. Wilson. After two hours the committee returned with eleven resolutions. These resolutions consisted largely of rhetoric that was being argued throughout the country already. Notably, one of these resolutions proposed levying high tariffs on states which did not cooperate with the return of fugitive slaves. The fourth resolution stated \"that waiving the Constitutional question of the power of a State to secede from the Union, such act of secession, if effected peaceably, is not an appropriate and adequate remedy for the injuries under which the Southern States are now laboring. To depart from the Union, leaving behind in the hands of her supposed enemies, all her accumulations of eighty years, in which she had proportional rights, would be a sacrifice on the part of a State, except under pressure of overruling necessity, as incompatible with her dignity as her interests.” The eleventh resolution called for the publication of these resolutions in all local newspapers, and that copies of these resolutions should be sent to the General Assembly and Congress.\n\nParagraph 7: Rangers fan discontent was demonstrated during a Championship game against Queen of the South at Ibrox, with fans holding up red cards in the 18th and 72nd minutes, and this was not improved when, on 3 September, it was revealed that Mike Ashley bought the naming rights to Ibrox Stadium for just £1 in a deal with Charles Green in 2012. Concurrently, Rangers former commercial director Imran Ahmad finally succeeded in a bid to have £620,000 of club assets frozen prior to pursuing litigation over an alleged unpaid £500,000 bonus. A few days later the club were granted leave to appeal this decision yet, on 12 September, the club agreed a settlement with Ahmad much to the dismay of fans. As some Rangers supporters groups considered boycotting home matches in protest at the board, it was revealed that Ashley would not be participating in the share offer. Ashley's motivates for not investing became clear in the following month, namely withholding much needed money from the club in order to undermine the board. At the end of the share issue, on 12 September, it was announced that it had raised just over £3m which still £1m short of its minimum target. As the share issue was undertaken in order to allow Rangers to continue to operate into the new year but the failure to reach the targets meant that further funding was required. A few days later, it came to light that Sandy Easdale had met with several investors that had been introduced to him by Rafat Rizvi, a convicted fraudster wanted by Interpol, which led to calls by the Union of Fans for Easdale to resign. However, in a move to demonstrate his strength, Easdale increased his personal shareholding at Rangers to 5.21% on 24 September. On the same day as the club repaid the £1.5m loan to Sandy Easdale and George Letham. The next day, BNP Paribas bought a 5% stake in Rangers making it the fifth-highest shareholder but less than twenty-fours later it was revealed that the transaction was completed on Ashley's behalf thus increasing his stake to 8.92%. Less than a week later, Ashley's holding company, MASH Holdings, called for an EGM to remove chief executive Wallace. This signaled the start of a crucial stage in the boardroom power struggle at Rangers with King appearing to be outflanked by Ashley, who had secured the support of Sandy Easdale, David Sommers as well as the largest shareholder in Rangers, Laxey Partners.\n\nParagraph 8: The Holidays, a Roman family living at the Venus DeMilo Arms Apartments in A.D. 63, dealt with a variety of modern-day problems. Gus Holiday worked at the Forum Construction Company for his demanding boss Mr. Tycoonius who is constantly threatening to fire Gus if an assignment he is given goes awry. He lived with his wife Laurie, children Precocia and Happius, and pet lion Brutus. Their neighbors are good friends Herman, Henrietta, and their daughter: Happy's girlfriend Groovia. Their lives are embittered by their exasperated landlord Mr. Evictus who tries to find proof of Brutus living with the Holidays, has a daughter named Snobbia, and excites Gus's tagline \"Evictus will evict us!\"\n\nParagraph 9: In 2012, Duke is happily reunited with Anna who pushes him away still shaken by her experience with Faison—as he'd been masquerading as Duke for months. Meanwhile, Anna is torn between her feelings for Duke and her current lover Luke Spencer (Anthony Geary). Duke gives her space and gets a job working for A. J. Quartermaine (Sean Kanan) at ELQ Industries. Anna finally breaks it off with Luke and reunites with Duke; they plan to attend Felicia's wedding to Mac Scorpio (John J. York) only for Duke to be left comatose after he falls into a trap set for Anna by Liesl Obrecht (Kathleen Gati) – the woman who had helped keep him captive on behalf of Faison. Duke awakens and Anna vows to make her pay. When Tracy Quartermaine (Jane Elliot) regains control of the company ELQ leaving Duke unemployed, he instead goes to work for media mogul, Derek Wells (William deVry). Meanwhile, Duke receives word that Julian Jerome is still alive. Duke worries for Anna when she leaves town to find Faison and when he tries to find her, he is taken captive by Faison. Anna rescues him and reunites Duke with a presumed dead Robin. The happiness is short lived as Duke learns that Wells is actually Julian and Duke immediately quits his job. Duke secretly partners up with mobster Sonny Corinthos (Maurice Benard) to bring down Julian once and for all. The alliance puts a strain on Duke and Anna's relationship and Duke quits Sonny's organization but they remain friends and Duke provides Sonny with a false alibi for the night of A. J.'s murder. However, Anna is forced to arrest Duke when his statement is revealed to be false. Duke refuses to turn on Sonny and is sent to Pentonville to await trial. Impressed by Duke's loyalty, Sonny makes a plea deal that sends him to prison and frees Duke and Duke agrees to run Sonny's organization in his absence. Duke and Anna split when he calls out her hypocrisy as she had also stepped outside the law to deal with Faison. Though he pines for Anna, Duke starts dating Lucy Coe (Lynn Herring). Sonny's enforcer Shawn Butler (Sean Blakemore) convinces Duke to hire former Jerome employee Jordan Ashford (Vinessa Antoine). However, Duke is disappointed to learn Jordan is an undercover cop and makes plans to eliminate her. Meanwhile, Lucy breaks up with Duke and encourages him to reunite with Anna. After they dance the tango at the Nurses Ball, Duke and Anna declare their love for each other and make plans to run away together and Duke calls off the hit on Jordan. However, before Duke and Anna can leave town, he falls victim to a botched hit from former enforcer Carlos Rivera (Jeffrey Vincent Parise). A wounded Duke manages to meet up with Anna only to die in her arms. Anna vows to avenge Duke and bring down Julian once and for all.\n\nParagraph 10: Iris Sellin (Potente) is a world-famous pianist and composer who finds out that she is suffering from multiple sclerosis, a degenerative nerve disorder that will gradually stop her being able to perform. She asks a friend, Dr. Martin Fischer (Thomsen), a revolutionary reproductive researcher, to assist her in creating her clone so that she can pass her music onto her daughter. Even though cloning of humans is illegal, Dr. Fischer agrees so that he will forever be known as the first. The procedure is a success and Iris gives birth to Siri (Potente). Siri closely resembles her mother in both facial features and musical talent.\n\nParagraph 11: Jón Þorláksson (usually transcribed Thorlaksson) was a farmer's son, from Vesturhópshólar in Húnavatnssýsla in the northwest of Iceland. He and his two sisters and one brother were unusually gifted. One of his sisters, Björg Þorláksdóttir, was for example the first Icelandic woman to receive a doctorate, from the Sorbonne in 1926. Jón Þorláksson graduated from Menntaskólinn í Reykjavík in 1897, highest in his class and with the best results ever given to a student at that school. He studied civil engineering at the Polytechnic College in Copenhagen (later the Danish Technical University), graduating in 1903. In 1905, he became Iceland's Chief Engineer, overseeing in the next 12 years the construction of roads and bridges in the country, and advocating (and helping to build) hydroelectric power plants and the use of Iceland's ample resources of thermal power to heat houses. Jón resigned from his office in 1917, starting a company which imported building materials, but also working as an independent engineer on several projects. He was elected to the parliament in 1921, on a list opposed to the nascent socialist party. Respected rather than popular, he soon became the leader of the conservative and libertarian elements in the parliament, founding in 1924 the Conservative Party. Jón Þorláksson became Minister of Finance of Iceland in the government formed by the Conservative Party in 1924, raising the value of the Icelandic crown in 1925, very much as Winston Churchill raised the value of the pound at the same time. Upon the sudden death of Prime Minister Jón Magnússon in 1926, he became Prime Minister as well. After the defeat of the Conservative Party in the parliamentary elections of 1927, Jón Þorláksson became the leader of the opposition. He was the first leader of the Independence Party which was formed by a merger of the Conservative Party and a small Liberal Party in 1929. He became Mayor of Reykjavík in December 1932. Because of failing health he resigned as leader of the Independence Party in 1934 and died one year later. He was married and had two adopted daughters.\n\nParagraph 12: Eyes only is jargon used with regard to classified information. Whereas a classified document is normally intended to be available to anyone with the appropriate security clearance, an \"eyes only\" designation, whether official or informal, indicates that the document is intended only for a specific set of readers. As such the document should not be read by other individuals even if they otherwise possess the appropriate clearance. Another meaning is that the document is under no circumstances to be copied or photographed, \"eyes only\" meaning that it is to be physically read by cleared personnel and nothing more, to ensure that no unauthorized copies of the text are made which might be unaccounted for.\n\nParagraph 13: Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik was also a significant release in the burgeoning \"Hotlanta\" music scene. The scene started as a black music revival in Atlanta during the late 1980s, and developed with the success of LaFace Records and the national attention received by Atlanta-based recording artists and producers such as Toni Braxton, Kris Kross, Jermaine Dupri, and Babyface. With the album, Outkast offered realistic depictions of the city while avoiding Arrested Development's Afrocentric themes and the more mainstream stylings of Dupri. \"Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik was as accessible as Atlanta rap had been up until that point, paving the way for your favorite rappers of the 2000s, from Ludacris to T.I. to Jeezy\", according to Cleveland.com, which later ranked it as the 45th best hip hop album from the 1990s. \"Outkast would make better albums (a few, actually). But, perhaps, none were more important.\" It was also named the third best album of 1994 in ego trips list of \"Hip Hop's 25 Greatest Albums by Year 1980–98\", while Vibe included it as one of the \"150 Essential Albums of the Vibe Era (1992–2007)\". Vibe later included the album on a 2004 list of \"51 Essential Albums\" that represent \"a generation, a sound, and in many cases, a movement\", writing that \"[OutKast] determined the South had something to say, and after emerging form the Dungeon production lab, they said it all, sometimes sang it all—pointedly, funkdafied, and putting on absolutely no East Coast pretense.

{"input": "\"The Man Who Sold the World\" was recorded at Trident Studios in London on May 4, 1970, under the working title \"Saviour Machine\". The lineup featured David Bowie on acoustic guitar, Mick Ronson on electric guitar, Tony Visconti on bass, Woody Woodmansey on drums, and Ralph Mace on Moog synthesizer. Bowie recorded his vocal on May 22 at Advision Studios, coinciding with the final day of mixing the album. The lyrics were written by Bowie in the reception area of the studio while Visconti waited at the mixing console. Visconti added a \"flange\" effect and quickly mixed the track before sending it to the label. However, this last-minute addition frustrated Visconti, leading to his dissatisfaction with the recording sessions. Bowie later expressed his dislike for the album, calling it a \"nightmare\" to make.", "context": "Paragraph 1: The original Montrose lineup, consisting of Ronnie Montrose on guitar, Sammy Hagar (then known as Sam Hagar) on lead vocals, Bill Church on bass, and Denny Carmassi on drums, was formed in early 1973 after Ronnie Montrose decided to leave the Edgar Winter Group. Both Hagar and Carmassi had previously worked together and were recruited from local San Francisco-area cover bands, while Bill Church and Ronnie Montrose were acquainted from their session work with singer Van Morrison and producer Ted Templeman. This prior connection provided the band with access to Templeman who heard their demos and helped the newly formed group secure a deal with Warner Bros. The band, as yet officially unnamed and billed as 'Ronnie Montrose and Friends', made their public debut on April 21, 1973 via a 45-minute radio broadcast aired on KSAN FM's Tom Donahue show. The broadcast featured the band's complete ten song performance recorded at the Record Plant in Sausalito, consisting of their entire first album (excluding \"Space Station No. 5\") as well as the unreleased tracks \"Roll Me Nice\", \"You're Out of Time\", and \"Roll Over Beethoven\". The broadcast was in circulation as a bootleg recording for years before being released in 2017 on the Deluxe Version of their first album.\n\nParagraph 2: As the advance-guard approached Kasai the hills on either side of the Darwazagai Pass were found to be held by small parties of the enemy, who, however, were easily driven off without loss. The hills were then piquetted, so as to cover the march of the main body down the Bohai Dag to Lakai, whilst one section No. 8 Mountain Battery and 4 companies, 59th Rifles, under Lieutenant-Colonel Carruthers were left at Kasai to ensure the junction of the 57th Rifles from the 2nd Brigade, and the detachment left in Nahakki. At 10:30 a.m. the 57th Rifles reached Kasai and passed on towards Lakai, where the main body was then halted and all transport animals unloaded and watered. After a short rest a cavalry reconnaissance was pushed on towards Yakh Dand with orders to report on the nature of the line of advance, and on the water supply at Umra Kalai, where native reports showed the existence of at least one good tank. About noon the cavalry reported that they had reached Umra Kalai after some slight opposition, but that their further advance was barred by a body of about 200 of the enemy, who were occupying a small village about 150 yards north-east of Umra Kalai and the band of the tank, which was situated about 300 yards north-east of the small village, whence they kept up a desultory but accurate fire. An infantry covering party was then sent over to the north bank of the Bohai Dag, whilst the Sappers and Miners prepared two tracks out of the nala on to the table land to the north of it for the passage of the transport. When these were complete and the two detached forces had joined the main body at about 3 p.m., two sections No. 8 Mountain Battery, 53rd Sikhs and 57th Rifles were moved across the nala on to the high table land on the north bank, while the transport was loaded up, and moved down the nala en masse and formed up on a broad front behind the troops. By 4 p.m. all was ready for an advance, and the troops moved forward towards Umra Kalai. The force was now disposed as follows: Front line, 67th Rifles on right, 4 guns No. 8 Mountain Battery in centre, 53rd Sikhs on left, covering a front of about 300 yards on each side of the track to Umra Kalai; right flank guard, 2 guns No. 8 Mountain Battery with an infantry escort and 1 squadron, 21st Cavalry; left flank guard 1 squadron, 21st Cavalry; general reserve, in rear of centre, 59th Rifles and No. 6 Company Sappers and Miners. The massed baggage and supply columns followed the general reserve under escort of the 22nd Punjabis, which regiment also formed the rear-guard.\n\nParagraph 3: Despite a poor start to the WSL season, losing three of their opening five matches and sitting in 9th place, Manchester City opened their League Cup campaign with an emphatic 5–1 win over Everton who were struggling to gel following a heavy offseason of recruiting and investment. Caroline Weir had opened the scoring in the 8th minute and although Everton had equalised through Grace Clinton within a couple of minutes, Khadija Shaw had put City ahead before the halftime break. As Everton pressed forward in the second half in search of way back into the game, City capitalised as Lauren Hemp doubled City's leading before substitute Jess Park added a fourth and Ellen White saw her header fumbled into the goal by goalkeeper Courtney Brosnan in the final minute. The match was Willie Kirk's last game as Everton manager as he was sacked three days later. City once again struck early to open the scoring against Durham, this time through summer signing Filippa Angeldal in the 16th minute. The Championship side surrendered much of the possession to City who were denied a second goal with both Janine Beckie and Angeldal hitting the frame of the goal. Substitute Weir, on her 100th appearance for the club, finally managed to give City the cushion they were pushing for in the 87th minute, firing into the roof of the net from the edge of the Durham box. Beckie also got on the scoresheet in stoppage time as City ran out 3–0 winners. Having played out a thrilling 2–2 draw in the league the previous month, City traveled to Manchester United for the third group game. City's fast starts continue as Hayley Raso latched on to an early turnover, rolling the ball to Vicky Losada who fired the ball past Sophie Baggaley from the edge of the box with fewer than two minutes played. Despite controlling most of the opening exchanges, United managed to level on the half hour mark when goalkeeper Karima Benameur Taieb spilled the ball against her own body under pressure from Kirsty Hanson who knocked it back to Ivana Fuso to fire home from ten yards. With chances few and far between in a tighter second half, United broke the deadlock eight minutes from time when Ona Batlle broke down the wing to feed the ball to Alessia Russo in the box. The forward's shot was parried by Taieb and fell to Demi Stokes who was pickpocketed by Batlle before the Spaniard calmly stroked the ball into the net, sealing a 2–1 derby defeat for City. The final group game against Leicester City scheduled for 15 December 2021 was delayed due to a COVID-19 outbreak in the Manchester City squad. With all other games played, a victory over Everton had put United top of the group on nine points. City were three points behind with the delayed game still to play, although United were assured of a place in the knockout stage either as a group winner or as the best-placed runner up. City knew a win would send them top on goal difference while a win on penalties would send them through as the best second-placed team. However, opponents Leicester were also still alive as they could progress as runner-up if they won outright while a penalty shootout win for Leicester would see both teams miss out and instead send Group C runners-up Charlton Athletic through. The game was eventually played on 12 January 2022. Sitting bottom of the WSL, newly promoted Leicester had made a change of manager the previous month, bringing in Lydia Bedford who had guided the team to their first win of the season in the final game before the winter break. Despite the uptick in form, City blew a youthful Leicester side away as Bedford handed out five debuts including four academy players. For the third time in four group games, City led inside 10 minutes as Jess Park delivered a perfect cross for White to tap in. Hemp and Georgia Stanway both netted braces as City ran riot to punch their ticket to the knockout stage as group winner with a 5–0 win as teenage goalkeeper Khiara Keating kept a cleansheet on her senior debut.\n\nParagraph 4: Annie Devine wasn't very interested in the Civil Rights Movement until Dave Dennis, George Raymond (NAACP) and some others started using C.O. Chinn's motel to hold NAACP meetings. She would pass by their meetings on her way home some nights, and one night she decided to join in after they moved the meetings to a church away from the city center. Annie became interested in Civil Rights after a quick encounter with a cop at that specific meeting. That very next day, Devine started canvassing for votes on the streets of Mississippi; she began meeting with other blacks in Canton to discuss civil rights issues. Eventually, Devine quit her job selling insurance to work full-time for the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE). Quickly realizing that canvassing and asking for votes wasn't making a huge dent in the movement, Annie wanted to be a part of the bigger phase two. In 1964, Devine joined Fannie Lou Hamer and Victoria Gray Adams to become the first black women to speak before the United States House of Representatives. The three were elected state representatives for the progressive Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party. Devine helped found the party, and was a member of its delegation to the 1964 Democratic National Convention in New Jersey.  Upon returning from the convention, Annie decided to accept running for congresswoman of her district. She was declined by the secretary of state to have her name on the ballot. The Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (MFDP) was also denied to run individually in the election even though they had the right number of qualified electors. Annie was then elected by freedom votes. She makes sure to state in her interview, “... very strong feeling there had to be some political force other than civil rights organizations in this state to bring about change” (Devine). Annie also had a very strong opinion about the Voting Rights bill passed by president Lyndon B. Johnson in 1965. She said, “there’s nothing in the voting bill that can really protect you. You can get registered, the federal registrar will register you, there’s some clause in there that says the FBI can see to it that you’re protected when you go down to vote, but before voting day and after voting day there’s no protection provided.. And that’s where the trouble comes in” (Devine). Mrs. Devine was set on the bigger picture of having full rights and not bits and pieces of equality.\n\nParagraph 5: Meanwhile, on the once-verdant planet of Chal (first referenced in The Ashes of Eden), a mysterious stranger walks through the desolation towards a Starfleet medical outpost.  He meets with the commanding officer, Christine McDonald, and requests the location of the burial place of a native woman named Teilani.  He discovers, with Christine's help, that Teilani is not dead, not yet, but will be soon with the virogen quickly working through her body.  He goes to her and prepares an unusual herbal tea with dried leaves and hot water. Commander McDonald and the outpost's doctor, Andrea M'Benga, look on in amazement as Teilani begins to miraculously recover.  The stranger reveals to M'Benga that the leaves are Trannin leaves, native to the Klingon home planet.  Christine determines to send a message to Starfleet, announcing that a way to combat the virogen has been found. Christine's suspicions of the stranger's identity are aroused when Teilani calls the stranger \"James.\"  Her suspicions are further confirmed when she finds a plaque that the stranger had used as a tray for the tea, emblazoned with the name and number of the starship Enterprise from eighty years in the past.  Christine confronts the stranger with her belief that he is actually James T. Kirk, which he does not deny, insisting that she only refer to him as \"Jim,\" and that she reveal his real identity to no one. It is later revealed Kirk was saved by a fortuitous last-minute Borg transporter beam-out. Flung to another galaxy entirely, he materializes on a planet which is used as a dumping ground for the detritus of failed Borg missions. At the verge of death, on a planet near a galactic core, Kirk is discovered by beings who were able to release themselves from Borg assimilation. His body is purged of the Borg nanites which had been killing him, and after two years of working, living, and learning from, and with, the survivors, he discovers a Borg scout ship which he uses to return to the planet Chal.\n\nParagraph 6: During the couple's early years in Gary, Jackson sang together with Joe playing the guitar. Joe and his brother Luther also formed an R&B band in the mid-1950s called the Falcons, for extra income. Joe had a boxing career, but later went on to work as a crane operator at East Chicago's Inland Steel Company to support the family. Jackson a devout Jehovah's Witness began working part-time at Sears in Gary. She played the instruments clarinet and piano on the side. Jackson caught baby Michael dancing to the old, rickety washing machine, a Maytag early on. Jackson knew Michael had rhythm and loved music. Their son, Tito, would sneak to play Joe’s guitar while Joe was not home and one day broke a guitar string. After the guitar was fixed, Tito played for Joe. That sparked the forming of the family group Jackson named “The Jackson Brothers 5”, that later became the Jackson 5.   While Joe led the rehearsals in the living room, Jackson designed and hand sewed the stage outfits for the boys, and visited The Salvation Army for shoes. Jackson also spent time singing harmonies with the boys around the kitchen table. Jackson served as the family's backbone.\n\nParagraph 7: As described in a film magazine, a bothersome neighbor (Stevenson) tries to palm his wife off on professor Alec Dupree (Denny), who has a reputation for being \"safe and dependable,\" for an evening at the Hanging Gardens Cafe. He objects on the grounds that he is writing a book, but the neighbor leaves, assuming his assent. The Dean of Wyndham College, which was founded by an ancestor of Dupree, is distressed over the financial plight of the school, and goes to the young professor for aid. He tells him that Agnes Clevenger, a wealthy widow who makes annual gifts to the college, is being lured away by New York charities and that the college is in danger of being left flat. Dupree is beguiled by a gay party in the next apartment into having a few drinks and meets the widow Clevenger (Fitzgerald), who is in conference with some charitable organizations. Addressing her as Aggie, he drags her into the hall for a private chat, flatters her by calling her beautiful, and makes a date to show her the town in half an hour. His cousin Edith (Greene) tells him that a young woman from the West named Hazel (Nixon) will be arriving, but he wants nothing to do with her until he sees her. He then insists on taking her out, just as soon as he is finished with the widow. He takes the widow around the town using an airplane, and then returns home to change. While he is dressing, a childhood sweetheart who has run away from her husband comes to him for refuge. He tells her to leave his apartment, and then he is dragged to the Hanging Garden by his neighbor's wife Fran (Tashman). As soon as they are seated, he goes to the telephone and meets the widow Clevenger, who insists on being taken to the Hanging Gardens. They are seated and he orders dinner, and then leaves on some pretext, and runs into Fran and her mother, who ask him to join them. He is in love with the young woman so cannot miss this opportunity, so he orders some soup and then excuses himself to go and use the telephone. By instructing a bellboy to page him every five minutes, he is able to spend time with each of the women without letting them know of the other two. The runaway wife's husband Frank (Braham) arrives with murder in his eyes and goes stalking for Dupree. The two younger women leave him in disgust and he gets rid of the widow. He returns home to find the runaway wife Lucille in his bathtub. Angry at her, he leaves her to his apartment and goes in his pajamas to get some sleep at a neighbor's, but is called back to the phone in his apartment just as the angry husband arrives and bangs on his door. He carries Lucille to Fran's apartment and puts her into bed, and then faces the wild husband with a show of innocence. Fran comes in, sees the strange woman in her bed, and rushes to Dupree for sympathy and falls into his arms. She is followed by her husband who sees them in an embrace. To finish it, Hazel and the widow also arrive at the apartment. Faced with two outraged husbands, the professor turns into a cave man, and puts everyone into their place with an iron hand. He then drags Hazel to his apartment and orders her to kiss him. She accepts his proposal of marriage, and the widow decides to give two million dollars to the college.\n\nParagraph 8: Hachiya's diary cover the period from Aug. 6, 1945 to Sept. 30, 1945. He described the effects of the atomic bomb blast from its first flash in the early morning as he rested from his night shift as an air warden at the hospital. The force of the blast stripped all the clothes from his body but he and his wife survived, however they both received serious burns to their bodies and had to journey to the hospital Michihiko worked at. When Michihiko returned to the hospital that he worked in, the Hiroshima Communications Hospital, he spent the night in the care of the hospital staff who were not seriously injured. After his injuries healed, Michihiko started making his daily rounds that he would have normally made as a doctor. The staff and patients at the hospital call the atomic bomb that hit their city \"pikadon\". Pika describes a flash of light and don describes an explosive sound. As time passes an understanding of what hit their city clears up, and historical events such as the surrender of Japan are brought up. The condition of the hospital also drastically improves as more medical supplies are brought into the city, allowing them to better treat patients. After the bombing he wrote the book The Hiroshima Diary. This book describes what happened to him and what he saw.\n\nParagraph 9: The remains of the mediaeval fortified manor of Olveston Court stand on the western outskirts of the village. It was for a while the seat of the Denys family of nearby Siston who had inherited Olveston manor, together with nearby Alveston, Earthcott Green, Siston and a moiety (1/2) of Aust together with the rights of the Hundred Court of Langley, in 1380 on marriage to Margaret Corbet, granddaughter of Sir Peter Corbet(d.1362) Lord of Caus, Shropshire. In addition to these Gloucestershire lands, the manors of Lawrenny in Pembrokeshire and Hope-juxta-Caus in Shropshire were also inherited. Due to the possibility for confusion between Alveston and Olveston, the Inquisition post mortem of Sir Gilbert Denys, taken at Chipping Sodbury on 25 June 1422, is given here:\n\nParagraph 10: The storyline was furthered at Clash of the Champions XVII on November 19, 1991 in Savannah, Georgia. At the beginning of the Clash, which was televised live on TBS, WCW United States Heavyweight Champion (and perennial face) Sting was in the ring doing an interview. Madusa came out dressed as a harem girl and distracted Sting so WCW World Heavyweight Champion Lex Luger could attack him from behind by clipping his knee, the same one Sting injured in February 1990. Luger then bashed the knee against the runway repeatedly to make it seem like Sting had suffered severe damage. Several face wrestlers, including Bobby Eaton, ran out to run the heel Luger off and take Sting to the hospital. Sting, however, had to defend his title against Rude that night and did not want to leave. Eaton kept telling him he would have time, so he left. Bischoff rode in the ambulance with Sting and gave live updates on the condition of Sting from the hospital between matches to announcers Jim Ross and Tony Schiavone. Meanwhile, Dangerously had found a loophole in the match contract that specifically stated that if Sting was not able to defend his title, he would have to forfeit it to Rude. The announcers relayed the message to Bischoff, who in turn passed it along to Sting. Commotion could be heard in the background as Sting tried to leave the hospital and return to defend his title. It turned out that Eaton had been conspiring with Dangerously and Rude to ensure Sting did not make it out in time for his title defense.\n\nParagraph 11: The backing track for \"The Man Who Sold the World\" was recorded at Trident Studios in London on 4 May 1970, along with other album track \"Running Gun Blues\". At this point, the track was recorded under the working title \"Saviour Machine\" and did not contain the title phrase. According to Kevin Cann, the lineup featured Bowie on acoustic guitar, Mick Ronson on electric guitar, producer Tony Visconti on bass, Woody Woodmansey on drums and percussion, and Ralph Mace on Moog synthesiser; Ronson and Woodmansey would later become famous as a part of the Spiders from Mars. According to Visconti, Bowie recorded his vocal on 22 May at Advision Studios, the final day of mixing for the album which, when traveling to Advision, Bowie had intended to name Metrobolist, a homage to Fritz Lang's 1927 film Metropolis. Chris O'Leary writes that Bowie wrote the lyrics in the reception area of the studio while Visconti waited at the mixing console. Once he finished, he quickly recorded his vocal, Visconti added a \"flange\" effect and mixed the track in a few hours, sending the tapes to the label later that night. Bowie's last-minute addition frustrated Visconti, who recalled in 1977: \"This was the beginning of [Bowie's] new style of writing – 'I can't be bothered until I have to'. When it was finished, on the last day of the last mix, I remember telling David, 'I've had it, I can't work like this anymore – I'm through...David was very disappointed.\" This frustration was mostly due in part to his dissatisfaction with the recording sessions: he was mostly in charge of budget and production, as well as maintaining Bowie's interest in the project. Bowie later told BBC Radio 1's Stuart Grundy in 1976: \"It was a nightmare, that album. I hated the actual process of making it.\"", "answers": ["Paragraph 11"], "length": 3999, "dataset": "passage_retrieval_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "316d3826b9288f42d2ef943cebc2d6bbfd98124168b4c555"}
{"input": "Peter Milo Shane is a law professor and writer known for his work in two main areas. Firstly, he focuses on separation of powers law, specifically law and the presidency. His work explores the institutional concept of the rule of law in a separation of powers system, arguing that it is sustained by both formal legal rules and informal norms. He believes that the rule of law depends on an assemblage of norms and cooperative arrangements. Secondly, Shane is interested in cyberdemocracy and the potential for online government initiatives to engage the public in policy-making. He rejects technological determinism and believes that the impact of digital information technologies on democracy depends on human agency. His major work, \"Madison's Nightmare,\" synthesizes his views on separation of powers, describing the period from 1981 to 2009 as a time of aggressive presidentialism. He argues that this operating ethos undermines sound decision making, adherence to the rule of law, and democratic accountability regardless of party affiliation.", "context": "Paragraph 1: On January 5, the Communist forces were surrounded in Maolin Township by a Nationalist force of 80,000 led by Shangguan Yunxiang and attacked days later. After days of fighting, heavy losses – including many civilian workers who staffed the army's political headquarters – were inflicted on the New Fourth Army due to the overwhelming numbers of Nationalist troops. On January 13, Ye Ting, wanting to save his men, went to Shangguan Yunxiang's headquarters to negotiate terms. Upon arrival, Ye was detained. The New Fourth Army's political commissar Xiang Ying was killed, and only 2,000 people, led by Huang Huoxing and Fu Qiutao, were able to break out.\n\nParagraph 2: Peter Milo Shane (born 1952) is a law professor and writer. His best-known scholarly work focuses mainly on two subjects.  The first is separation of powers law, especially law and the presidency.  His work often explores what he calls an institutional conception of the rule of law in a separation of powers regime.  See, e.g., Peter M, Shane, When Inter-branch Norms Break Down: Of Arms-for-Hostages, 'Orderly Shutdowns,' Presidential Impeachments, and Judicial 'Coups,' 12 Cornell Journal of Law and Public Policy 503 (2004). Under Shane's antiformalist conception, the rule of law is sustained not only by formal legal rules, but perhaps most importantly, by informal norms and conventional behaviors designed to maintain interbranch accountability even when public officials could ignore formal rules with impunity.  Peter M. Shane, Madison's Nightmare:  How Executive Power Threatens American Democracy 116 (University of Chicago Press, 2009). Checks and balances in such a system likewise \"depend on an assemblage of norms, cooperative arrangements, and informal coordination activities.\"  Id.  Following political scientist Kenneth Shepsle, Shane thus calls the rule of law \"an unstructured institution.\"  Id.  at 117.Shane's second major focus is cyberdemocracy.  He is particularly interested in the potential of online government initiatives to engage the public more fully in actual policy making. He is a prominent member of the \"cyberrealist school,\" which rejects technological determinism of both the utopian and dystopian kind.  He argues that the democratic potential of digital information technologies depends significantly on human agency, although he perceives the structures of power in society as limiting the impact of any specific initiative.  See, e.g., Peter M. Shane, Democracy Online:  The Prospects for Political Renewal Through the Internet (Routledge, 2004).Madison's Nightmare'' is the major synthesis of Shane's separation of powers views.  It both describes and analyzes the theory and practice of \"presidentialism\" as they unfolded from 1981 to 2009. He describes the period of 1981 to 2009 as a time of aggressive presidentialism.  Presidents Ronald Reagan through George W. Bush made arguments for unilateral presidential authority that Shane characterizes as unprecedented and legally groundless.  These arguments (and the actual assertions of power they supported) went so far beyond the claims of prior presidents as to constitute a new and distinctive phenomenon.  Shane's critique, however, goes beyond his attack on presidentialism as legal doctrine.  He also argues that presidentialism, as an operating ethos of government, undermines sound decision making and the rule of law in executive branch affairs.  He illustrates many of his points through examples from the G. W. Bush administration, but argues that his analysis transcends party.  His view is that, for presidents of either party, presidentialism can subvert the quality of decision making, policy makers' attentiveness to law, and democratic accountability more generally.  \n\nParagraph 3: \"WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY. EXHIBITION AT THE GENERAL POST-OFFICE. MORSE SIGNALS ON TAPE. Yesterday, at the top of the General Post-office building, an exhibition of wireless telegraphy was given by Mr. P. B. Walker, chief electrician and engineer-in-chief of the Postal Department. Ten feet copper wires were run from the sending and receiving instruments respectively, at either end of the building, each wire as it branched out into space being bright and slightly curved — in fact, the two wires might be said to point at one another, the Hertzian waves passing through the air, as in Marconi's experiments. When the apparatus had been set in position, the following message was sent to Mr. Watkin Wynne, who was at the receiving end:— \"Mr. Walker is glad to announce wireless telegraphy as accomplished.\" Mr. Walker operated the ordinary Morse key himself, and the arrangements were perfect enough to bring the signals out in ink on a tape. The apparatus used consisted principally of a large 12in. spark induction coil, capable of radiating through space electric waves of very high pressure, and of a receiver, called a \"coherer.\" The entire success of the experiments depends upon the arrangement of the latter, which consists of a small glass tube about 2in. long, into which two small plugs of silver are tightly fitted and separated from one another by about one-thirtieth of an inch. The space between these plugs is filled with a mixture of very fine iron filings of nickel and silver. The action of the electric waves, as radiated by means of the induction coil, causes these filings to cohere, and there-by makes an electric contact between the two silver plugs. The latter were for the purpose of the experiment connected with an ordinary telegraph (Morse) recording apparatus, and during the exhibition responded to every impulse radiated by the transmitter. The latter was, of course, controlled by an ordinary Morse key, the arrangement being that long and short streams of electric waves were sent out just as dots and dashes are used in the ordinary everyday working of land and cable wires, although, of course, the speed of the key has necessarily to be curtailed. All the instruments used were manufactured by the Government electricians under Mr. Walker's direction, Mr. Nelson being entrusted with the operation. Two months were occupied in their construction, and experiments have been going on during the past three weeks. The Postmaster-General recently placed £150 on the Estimates in order to obtain the necessary Marconi instruments. The latter are expected to arrive in the colony in about a month or six weeks, and upon their arrival it is intended to carry out experiments similar to those effected in Europe, and especially with the object of ascertaining whether our atmospheric conditions in any way influence the working of the machines.\"\n\nParagraph 4: Kayo Dot was formed after the disbanding of maudlin of the Well, a mildly acclaimed progressive heavy metal band in late 2002. Several members of Maudlin went on to form Kayo Dot, with multi-instrumentalist Toby Driver leading the group. In early 2003, Toby Driver (vocals, guitar, electronics), Greg Massi (guitar, vocals), Nicholas Kyte (bass, vocals), Sam Gutterman (drums, vocals) and Terran Olson (keyboards, flute, clarinet, saxophone) carried on and took the metal sound of Maudlin in a more classical direction. Rather than using the same band format as Maudlin of the Well, early performances saw Kayo Dot playing as an orchestra of sorts, with many members playing different instruments on stage. John Zorn's famous avant-garde label Tzadik signed the act in 2003, and Choirs of the Eye was released in late 2003. The album was very well-received, and many regard it as one of the best metal albums of the 2000s. Toby Driver would later go on to say that Choirs of the Eye developed because \"Kayo Dot is just a natural extension of the places MOTW was heading\". After reading online forums in which fans of Opeth and MOTW bickered over compositional styles, Driver decided to make a more \"thoroughly-composed metal album...one without riffs and arbitrarily repeating parts.\" This shift in style became the trademark post-metal or avant-garde metal sound the band is currently known for. Kayo Dot played the album in its entirety in 2010 at The Stone in New York City and again in August 2015.\n\nParagraph 5: Using her friend's marriage as a ruse and with unwitting help of her friend's aunt, Anita escapes her home and travels with Kadhir to a tourist place near Thekkady in Kerala, and they end up in a hotel room. Anita reveals that she has made the biggest decision of her life by deciding to make love to him, as he should not regret falling in love with her when she marries the man her parents chose. Though stunned by her decision, Kadhir goes with her plan and the two consummate their love. The next morning, Kadhir and Anita argue when Kadhir says he wants Anita to live with him, while Anita accuses him of being attracted to her only because of the sex. They continue arguing as they exit the hotel, which culminates in Kadhir slapping Anita in anger, causing her to cross the road alone in tears. While a guilt-ridden Kadhir calls out to Anita, she is knocked down by a truck as a helpless Kadhir watches, then also hit by another speeding vehicle. Anita dies gruesomely on the spot as she is subsequently run over by several vehicles and Kadhir is injured. The following day, he is shocked to find the mere remains of Anita in the hospital mortuary. Though heartbroken, Kadhir tells the police that Anita never accepted his love, and her death was really an accident. This way, he saves her dignity, and her mother blesses him as she leaves. Though the police want to file a murder case on Kadhir, Anita's mother refuses to name him as a murderer. After sadly returning to Chennai, Kadhir tries to commit suicide unsuccessfully, only to end up causing a ruckus in traffic and being assaulted by the crowd, but is saved by a group of nuns. He then hallucinates about Anita's spirit coming to him and advising him to live life to the fullest and that she will always be with him.\n\nParagraph 6: In the financial literature, sterilization is a term commonly used to refer to operations of a central bank that mitigate the potentially undesirable effects of inbound capital: currency appreciation and inflation. Depending on the source, sterilization can mean the relatively straightforward recycling of inbound capital to prevent currency appreciation and/or a range of measures to check the inflationary impact of inbound capital. The classic way to sterilize the inflationary effect of the extra money flowing into the domestic base from the capital account is for the central bank to use open market operations where it sells bonds domestically, thereby soaking up new cash that would otherwise circulate around the home economy. A central bank normally makes a small loss from its overall sterilization operations, as the interest it earns from buying foreign assets to prevent appreciation is usually less than what it has to pay out on the bonds it issues domestically to check inflation. In some cases, however, a profit can be made. In the strict textbook definition, sterilization refers only to measures aimed at keeping the domestic monetary base stable; an intervention to prevent currency appreciation that involved merely buying foreign assets without counteracting the resulting increase of the domestic money supply would not count as sterilization. A textbook sterilization would be, for example, the Federal Reserve's purchase of $1 billion in foreign assets. This would create additional liquidity in foreign hands. At the same time, the Fed would sell $1 billion of debt securities into the US market, draining the domestic economy of $1 billion. With $1 billion added abroad and $1 billion removed from the domestic economy, the net capital inflow that would have influenced the currency's exchange rate has undergone sterilization.\n\nParagraph 7: In 1996, 17 years after the founding of Micro D, Ingram Micro once again became a public company, listing its shares on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). That year, the company’s revenues totaled more than $12 billion. In 1989 Ingram Micro, then called \"Ingram Micro-D\", was a subsidiary of the privately owned Ingram Industries group, took over the Belgian Softinvest and its three Softeurop subsidiaries active on the Belgian, the French and the Dutch markets from Brussels, Lille and Utrecht. This was Ingram's first foray outside the United States other than a few Ingram Industries subsidiaries. The company embarked on an active merge, acquisitions and foundation strategy in the European market.\n\nParagraph 8: The programming of the artificial intelligence for Elizabeth was considered a major technical challenge for Irrational, as they desired to give her as much near-human behavior in contrast to most other games where such companions are either highly scripted or given relatively simplistic pragmas to follow, and had little previous examples from other games to build on; Levine cited Half-Life 2s Alyx as the last \"great AI companion\". Irrational had previously developed AI routines for the Big Daddies and Little Sisters in BioShock that would allow them to roam and interact with the environment if otherwise left alone by the player; these routines were the basis of building out improved behavior for Elizabeth. The developers had spent much time improving these routines to give Elizabeth her own tendencies to look and move around as a real actor instead of a robotic non-player character, as to re-enforce her central role to the player. To this, Levine explained that they looked to the banter between the main characters in the Uncharted series by Naughty Dog.  Levine praised the work that Naughty Dog had done, and felt he would be able to create the same with a more somber period piece. Some of Elizabeth's responses will be driven by a player's action (such as the aforementioned horse recovery scene), but other times, Elizabeth's actions will be on her own in response to the environment. Much of Columbia was seeded \"room by room\" with elements that Elizabeth will be interested in, comment on, and react to. However, as for the player not missing these elements, such actions would only be performed based on a number of factors, including whether the player was near and looking at Elizabeth, and the current tension of the game. This apparent curiosity serendipitously worked with Elizabeth's story, who after having been locked up for twelve years would be eager to see new things. Elizabeth's AI also monitors and tracks the player's behavior over time, such that the AI will attempt to predict when the player is moving and keep Elizabeth out of the line of fire. Programming Elizabeth's AI was a significant challenge to the Irrational team, and at several points during development the suggestion of cutting her from the game was brought up. Levine countered these suggestions, insisting on keeping her in the game. To manage this, a multidisciplinary subgroup called the \"Liz Squad\" reviewed the levels designed by others to assure that the presence of Elizabeth was accounted for across the game and to avoid situations where the level would delegate the character to simply hiding in a closet. On March 15, 2013, the full voice cast was announced by Irrational Games.\n\nParagraph 9: Central Government took a departure from the earlier practice of getting surveys conducted by the rural development machinery of different State Governments, for identification of families below the poverty line. The earlier practice, of identifying a single set of target families for all developmental programmes, has been done away with. This was partly necessitated by an interim stay order given by the Supreme Court for 10th and 11th five year plans. The trend is now increasingly to have development schemes run on the principle of universalisation or saturation or self-selection. This means following a priority list for each scheme, rather than following a single list of identified families for all schemes. For example, the people who put in manual work under Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act need not belong to families below the poverty line. Whoever is within the specified age bracket and is willing to get enrolled, can get covered. Similarly, the beneficiaries under National Food Security Act are identified by the State/UT Governments, with the ceiling/ coverage under TPDS determined for each State/UT by the central Government. This list of families can be different from the priority list used for rural housing programmes under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Grameen), which runs on the basis of whether a person has or does not have a pucca house, based on SECC survey of 2011. Similarly, the rural electrification programme Rajiv Gandhi Grameen Vidyutikaran Yojana had the concept of below poverty line families. But the new approach of Soubhagya scheme is to make no discrimination based on the poverty line, but to go on the basis of households that do not have electricity connection. In the maternity benefit scheme renamed as Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana, there is automatic and universal coverage, without any mention of whether a pregnant woman is below the poverty line or not. ( See Ministry of Women and Child Development at http://www.wcd.nic.in/sites/default/files/PMMVY%20Scheme%20Implemetation%20Guidelines%20._0.pdf) However, there is still lack of clarity on fully integrating SECC data of 2011 with old age pension/ widow pension/ disability pension schemes. This is because the guidelines of National Social Assistance Programme still speak about list of families below the poverty line. (See http://nsap.nic.in/Guidelines/nsap_guidelines_oct2014.pdf) Thus, by and large, the present position is that while SECC database of 2011 provides a basic skeleton, each developmental scheme is now run independently based on the necessity, rather than getting bogged down to one single list of targeted families.\n\nParagraph 10: Upon arrival in Bekabad he worked in the construction of the Farhad hydroelectric station, where he organized a theater ensemble at the construction site. He later attended Central Asia University. Despite living under strict conditions and harsh penalties for defying the Soviet government, he participated in the Crimean Tatar Civil Rights Movement from his early days in exile, meeting in secret with other prominent Crimean Tatars, where they read poetry mourning the loss of their beloved Crimea and founding the National Movement of Crimean Tatars. After working as a cinema director he became an editor at the fiction publisher in Tashkent, where he worked from 1967 to 1972. His works included poems and short stories such as \"Беяз чечеклер\", \"Атешли куньлер\", \"Козьлеринде кедер сездим\", \"Бульбульнинъ эляк олувы\", \"О кузь чечеклерини север эди\", and \"Хатырлав\". Having become a member of the Union of Writers of the USSR in 1967, he was admitted to the Union of Journalists of the USSR in 1968. He continued to write about Crimea in both Russian and Crimean Tatar, but his participation in the Crimean Tatar movement led to him having to leave Central Asia. He resettled in Novorossiysk, which was closer to Crimea, but due to the lack of a sizable Crimean Tatar population, his ability to participate in the Crimean Tatar movement was somewhat stifled and it was harder to get his writings in Crimean Tatar published, since almost nobody in Novorossiysk was fluent in the language. For the next few years most of his writing was in Russian. He later continued his work with the Crimean Tatar movement, becoming one of the organizers for the July 1987 Moscow picket for the right of return, where he gave a speech. He later participated in the march from Taman to Simferopol, resulting in him being condemned by name in the newspaper Pravda Vostoka for his role in organizing the protest despite his membership in the Union of Writers of the USSR. After the publication of the newspaper, he and other participants in the march faced intense persecution for their role in it. Despite ongoing persecution of activists in the Crimean Tatar movement, he continued to support the cause; he eventually got his works published in Crimea in the late 1990s, but he lived in Novorossiysk for the remainder of his life. After he died on 21 March 2004 he was buried there, and in 2014 a monument in his hometown of Albat was erected in his memory. His poetry mourning the loss of his beloved Crimea remain popular today.\n\nParagraph 11: Rulers of the Muhammad Ali Dynasty governed Egypt and Sudan as absolute monarchs until constitutional rule was established in August 1878. Following the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire, the Egyptian and Sudanese monarchy emerged as the most important in the Middle East and the wider Arab world. Finding themselves as mere figureheads during the period of British control, Egypt and Sudan's monarchs saw their powers increased following the recognition of independence, and the subsequent adoption of the 1923 Constitution, the most liberal in the country's history. Although King Fuad I often ruled as an autocrat, partly because he repeatedly overrode some provisions of the Constitution, Egypt and Sudan had the freest parliament in the region. During Fuad's reign and that of his son, Farouk, the country witnessed six free parliamentary elections and enjoyed a free press as well as an independent judiciary. According to historian Philip Mansel, \"the Egyptian monarchy appeared so splendid, powerful and popular that King Farouk's ignominious end seems inexplicable.\" The Muhammad Ali Dynasty's downfall is often regarded as having begun with the Abdeen Palace Incident of 1942, which greatly discredited the King. It accelerated with the growing discontent of Egypt's armed forces following the country's defeat in the First Arab-Israeli War. Disgruntled members of the military formed the Free Officers Movement, which led a coup d'état on 23 July 1952, thereby marking the beginning of the Egyptian Revolution of 1952. The toppling of the monarchy, and the resultant establishment of a revolutionary republican government, was the first of its kind in the modern Arab world, and was a crucial event in the region's history; it accelerated dramatically the rise of Pan-Arabism, and had a domino effect leading to similar military overthrows of the monarchies of Iraq (1958), North Yemen (1962), and Libya (1969). Egypt has had a republican form of government since the end of monarchical rule. Although the establishment of genuine democratic rule was one of the six core principles of the Revolution, political parties were banned in 1953 and the country was turned into a military dictatorship. The thriving pluralism that characterized political life during the latter period of the Muhammad Ali Dynasty's rule was thus brought to an end. Even though a multi-party system was officially restored in Egypt in 1976, the country has never recovered the level of political freedom it had enjoyed during the monarchy. In common with most deposed royal families, the Muhammad Ali Dynasty was initially vilified by the new revolutionary regime. Nonetheless, it has undergone re-evaluation in recent years; nostalgia for the former monarchy has been growing among some in Egypt, largely fuelled by the airing in 2007 of a hugely successful serial about the life of King Farouk I.", "answers": ["Paragraph 2"], "length": 3907, "dataset": "passage_retrieval_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "be43e175180a48abca2fb2fe065596afb06f7e4efc660c65"}

Despite having the graphics that were the most faithful to the arcade version of all the home versions of Mortal Kombat 4, Game Revolution rated it a D and commented that \"the graphics are inexcusably horrible\" and \"it's quite a depressing let-down on Sega's 128-bit masterpiece, especially when compared to Soulcalibur.\" The weapons that characters can use during the game were called \"dull and uninteresting\", often having little relation to the characters, and being \"either a sword, axe, or club\". IGN was less negative toward the game, awarding it a 6.3 out of 10, but was particularly critical regarding the weapon system: \"Readying your weapon is a slow process in which one can be hit any number of times during the attempt\". Although IGN commented on the improvements from previous Mortal Kombat games, the lack of depth was considered inexcusable. Jeff Gerstmann of GameSpot, who gave the game a score of 5.0/10, wrote that \"sitting down and playing MK Gold almost feels like a retrogaming experience - you really feel as though you've pulled out some old game that you haven't played in years - and it hasn't aged gracefully.\" According to a retrospective by IGN, \"the same publications that had once praised it on Nintendo 64 were happy to thrash it as a shallow and campy relic of a past age. Releasing beside Soulcalibur certainly didn't help.\"\n\nParagraph 2: SR 34 begins at the Alabama state line, southwest of Waresville, in Heard County, where the roadway continues to the southwest as Alabama State Route 22 (SR 22). In a curving fashion, it heads northeast to an intersection with the northern terminus of SR 219. It continues to the northeast and enters Franklin. Just inside the city limits, it begins a concurrency with SR 100. Just before the concurrency ends, the two highways cross over the Chattahoochee River on the Pleasant Theodore McCutchen Sr. Bridge. On the eastern side of the river, they diverge, with SR 34 continuing to the northeast and has an interchange with US 27/SR 1. The highway travels through a portion of Bush Head Shoals State Park. Then, it passes Turners Lake and Heard Wesley Cemetery, before entering Coweta County. The highway passes Josephs Lake and Dent Chapel Cemetery, before reaching the Rock Cabin Lake area. Right by the lake, it passes Emory Chapel Cemetery. Farther along, it curves to the east-northeast. Then, it passes Mountain Lake. Less than  later, it meets the western terminus of SR 34 Byp. (Newnan By-Pass Road). The highway enters Newnan, where it intersects US 27 Alt./SR 16 (Temple Avenue). The three highways head concurrent toward the main part of town. They pass Temple Avenue Recreation Complex. In downtown, they intersect US 29/SR 14 (Jackson Street). All five highways head south. At Posey Place, SR 34 departs the concurrency and intersects the northbound lanes, where it rejoins the concurrency to the north. At Clark Street, SR 34 splits off to the northeast. A few miles farther, it meets the eastern terminus of SR 34 Byp. (this time known as Millard Farmer Industrial Boulevard. Then, it has an interchange with Interstate 85 (I-85). After that, it leaves Newnan and travels in a fairly eastern routing. In Thomas Crossroads is an intersection with SR 154 (Sharpsburg–McCollum Road). SR 34 curves to the east-southeast and reaches its eastern terminus, an intersection with SR 54 just west of Peachtree City.\n\nParagraph 3: Inamoto was born in Kagoshima Prefecture. He played for Japanese club Gamba Osaka during his last year of high school, signing with the club in 1997. In April when at the age of 17, he debuted opening match in 1997 J.League season, which made him the youngest player who played J.League (at that time). He played for Gamba until summer 2001 and played 118 matches in J1 League. He was then one of many high-profile transfers of Asian players to Europe, signing with Arsenal of the Premier League. Inamoto scored two goals for the Japanese national team at the 2002 World Cup, but had already been released by Arsenal shortly before the tournament began. He was then signed by Fulham on a long-term loan deal from Gamba Osaka. Initially he settled well at the London club, garnering good notices as a tough-tackling midfielder with an eye for a spectacular goal. He became a cult favourite quickly, scoring four goals over the two legs of Fulham's Intertoto Cup final against Bologna, scoring once in the first leg and a hat trick in the second. Other notable goals he scored in his time for Fulham include goals against Tottenham Hotspur, Sunderland, Middlesbrough and also in the 3–1 win against Manchester United at Old Trafford in October 2003.\n\nParagraph 4: Emine Sevgi Özdamar was born 10 August 1946 in Malatya, Turkey. She grew up with her grandparents and lived in the Turkish cities of Istanbul and Bursa. In 1965, Özdamar travelled to Berlin for the first time and got a job in a factory there. She originally came to Germany to be near her older brother, Ali, who studied in Switzerland at the time. It was not easy to immigrate to Switzerland, hence her move to Germany. Emine Sevgi Özdamar had acted and performed plays since she was twelve years old and originally wanted to do both when she came to Europe: acting and seeing her brother. Özdamar's parents were against their 18-year-old daughter's plan, but gave in eventually. She lived in a residence in West Berlin with 120 other Turkish women. When she came to Germany for the first time, she did not speak a word of German, so she faced the challenges of learning the language as an adult. Özdamar began by memorizing street names and headlines of newspapers without knowing the actual meaning behind them. After seven months, her father finally paid for her to take language classes at the Goethe Institute in order to learn the language properly. Özdamar still wanted to become an actress, so she went back to Istanbul after two years, where she started to take acting lessons and got her first big roles in theatre productions. In 1971, a military coup in Istanbul resulted in persecution of citizens and had a great effect on citizens' freedom of speech. It became suddenly important for those in Turkey to choose their words wisely and to start using language differently. This was when Özdamar started to abalienate with her mother tongue, Turkish. She moved back to Germany and fell in love with the German language and authors like Bertolt Brecht. Özdamar went back in 1976 to work as a director's assistant for the Volksbühne in East Berlin. She lived in West Berlin, but worked in East Berlin at the time. While touring with a play she also lived in France for another two years, before coming back to Germany and working at a theatre in Bochum in 1979. Emine Sevgi Özdamar currently lives Kreuzberg, Berlin with her husband Karl Kneidl.\n\nParagraph 5: Dinsdale has been cited many times for its comments about written reasons in the event of an appellate court finding manifest error in criminal sentencing. Gleeson CJ & Hayne JJ wrote:\"Manifest inadequacy of sentence, like manifest excess, is a conclusion.  A sentence is, or is not, unreasonable or plainly unjust; inadequacy or excess is, or is not, plainly apparent.  It is a conclusion which does not depend upon attribution of identified specific error in the reasoning of the sentencing judge and which frequently does not admit of amplification except by stating the respect in which the sentence is inadequate or excessive.  It may be inadequate or excessive because the wrong type of sentence has been imposed (for example, custodial rather than non‑custodial) or because the sentence imposed is manifestly too long or too short.  But to identify the type of error amounts to no more than a statement of the conclusion that has been reached.  It is not a statement of reasons for arriving at the conclusion.  A Court of Criminal Appeal is not obliged to employ any particular verbal formula so long as the substance of its conclusions and its reasons is made plain.  The degree of elaboration that is appropriate or possible will vary from case to case.\"The case has also been numerously cited for Kirby J's comments regarding crown criminal appeals. He wrote:\"For reasons of legal history and policy, the position of Crown appeals against sentence has long been regarded, in Australia and elsewhere, as being in a class somewhat different from that of an appeal against sentence by a convicted offender. When first introduced, Crown appeals were considered to cut across \"time-honoured concepts\" of the administration of criminal justice in common law legal systems. For this reason, it has sometimes been said that, as a \"matter of principle\", such appeals should be a comparative rarity. The attitude of restraint reflected in such remarks has often been justified on the basis that a Crown appeal against sentence puts the prisoner in jeopardy of punishment for a second time, a feature that is ordinarily missing from an appeal, or application for leave to appeal, brought by those who have been sentenced. The consequence is that where the Crown appeals, it is normally obliged to demonstrate very clearly the error of which it complains. The further consequence is that, where such demonstration succeeds, it is conventional for the appellate court to impose a substituted sentence towards the lower end of the range of available sentences. This convention tends to add an additional restraint upon interference, given the strong resistance that exists against appellate \"tinkering\" with sentences.\"The case is additionally known for the proposition that rehabilitation of an offender is not the only relevant factor when deciding to impose a suspended sentence. Other factors, such as the objective gravity of the offending, may also be relevant.\n\nParagraph 6: On November 20, Ohata combined her two tag teams with Misaki Ohata and Tsukasa Fujimoto to form a trio named Kuros for a 6-Person Tag Tournament. In their first round 20-minute Point Dash match, the three defeated Meat Tech (Hiroyo Matsumoto, Ryo Mizunami and Sawako Shimono) 5–4, following a sudden death round. On November 27, Kuros defeated Classic Gohan (Cherry, Mika Iida and Shuu Shibutani) to advance to the finals of the tournament, a captain's fall match, where they were defeated by Revolucion Yoko Hatanaka (Gami, Kyoko Kimura and Tomoka Nakagawa). Following the tournament, Kuros remained together as a three-woman stable. On December 15, Ohata won her second Zan1 tournament, earning another shot at the Wave Single Championship. Ohata received her title shot on January 26, 2014, but her match with Yumi Ohka ended in a thirty-minute time limit draw. From May 11 to July 4, Ohata took part in the round-robin portion of the 2014 Catch the Wave tournament, finishing with a record of three wins, two draws and one loss, advancing to the knockout stage after a win over Mio Shirai in their final round-robin match. On July 27, Ohata first defeated Tsukasa Fujimoto in the first round and then Yumi Ohka in the semifinals to advance to the finals of the 2014 Catch the Wave, where she was defeated by Hikaru Shida. On September 15, Ohata and Mio Shirai unsuccessfully challenged Sakuragohan (Mika Iida and Kyusei Sakura Hirota) for the Wave Tag Team Championship, which also forced them to start the upcoming 2014 Dual Shock Wave from the first round. On September 23, Ohata and Shirai defeated Tsukasa Fujimoto and Yumi Ohka in the first round of the tournament. On October 1, Ohata and Shirai defeated Dynamite Kansai and Fairy Nipponbashi to advance to the semifinals of the tournament, where, later that same event, they wrestled Kyoko Kimura and Tomoka Nakagawa to a fifteen-minute time limit draw. Ohata was then defeated by Kimura in an overtime singles match and, as a result, both she and Shirai were eliminated from the tournament. On November 26, Kuros won the second annual One Day 6-Person Tag Tournament, defeating Cherry, Meari Naito and Shuu Shibutani in the finals and, as a result, earned the right to produce the December 14 Wave event. In early 2015, Ohata and Shirai received two shots at the Wave Tag Team Championship, but were both times defeated by the defending champions, Ayako Hamada and Yuu Yamagata. Finally, in the third title match between the two teams, Ohata and Shirai defeated Hamada and Yamagata on March 15 to become the new Wave Tag Team Champions. They made their first successful title defense on April 19 against Kaho Kobayashi and Tsukasa Fujimoto. On August 20, Kuros produced their final independent event, before the stable's dissolution, where Ohata, Fujimoto and Shirai defeated Chikayo Nagashima, Kayoko Haruyama and Meiko Satomura in a six-woman tag team main event. On September 13, Ohata and Shirai made their second successful defense of the Wave Tag Team Championship against Hiroyo Matsumoto and Ryo Mizunami. On September 20, Ohata and Shirai relinquished the Wave Tag Team Championship at the end of Shirai's retirement event.\n\nParagraph 7: Boston was described as \"[A] glowing chestnut, with a blazed face and both hind ankles white; his coat being lustrous and satiny in texture. While well-shaped, the expression of his head and neck were such that they were often though coarse and ugly, which actually they were not. The eye was large and full, the ear small and well-placed and carried, the nostril flaring. His neck was of medium length and very clean at the throttle. He rose high on the withers, was deep-breasted and the shoulders obliquely laid. For a horse of his height his carcass was immense. He was slab-sided, flat-bodied and stood over a lot of ground, his back-ribs were wonderful and coupling arched with the power of suspension bridge, while his entire hind quarter was a prodigy of brawn and muscle. Boston was a heavy limbed horse, with knees and hocks let down close the ground and unusually short pasterns that were at the same time extremely flexible. No set of measurements seems ever to have been taken of him, but his forearm was abnormal in its size, as were his stifle and gaskin, his length from point of hip to point of hock superior to any other celebrity since American Eclipse. His fiery temperament alternately flamed and smouldered and from moods of passion he would lapse into inert, sluggish ones, but at all times he had the quickness of a cat when aroused which made his gigantic strength all the more formidable. Led out he usually dropped his head almost on a level with his withers; and at the beginning of a heat carried it so low that he seemed to stretch himself along the ground, but as the miles were put behind him and the climax came, would gradually lift it higher and higher and finish 'looking for horses.'\"\n\nParagraph 8: The inaugural tournament  was organised by the Royal Liverpool Golf Club in 1885. It was played on 20, 21 and 23 April and was \"open to all amateur members of recognised golf clubs\". The format was match-play. All players were included in the draw for each round, any extra player receiving a bye. If a match was halved after the 18 holes both players progressed to the next round, playing each other again. There were 49 entries from 12 different clubs, although only 44 were included in the draw and four of these players did not turn up. Of the 22 first-round matches, 2 were halved, meaning that there were 12 matches in the second round. There were no more halved matches in the following rounds which meant that 3 players reached the semi-final stage. John Ball beat his father, also called John, in the third round. Allan Macfie received a bye at the semi-final stage with Horace Hutchinson beating Ball 2 up in the only semi-final match. After his morning round, Hutchinson played badly in the afternoon and Macfie won 7&6. Each player paid a 1 guinea entry fee. This, together with 25 guineas from the Royal Liverpool club, was used for prizes. The losing finalist received £10 with the remainder being used to buy plate for the winner. The final amount for the winner was about £60 or £70. By comparison the winner of the 1885 Open Championship received £10. For many years the 1885 event was not regarded as the first Amateur Championship. It was only in 1922 that the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews decided \"to place on record the name of Mr. A. F. Macfie as the winner of the Amateur Championship of 1885\".\n\nParagraph 9: At about 03:30 on 6 February, a fire started in the battery compartment. The room was sealed. At 06:57, the room was ventilated. Four minutes later, the battery exploded, and the room was sealed for another four hours. Temporary repairs were soon started, and later that month, she began the trip back to New England. Towed initially to Guantanamo Bay, she was taken to New London and then to Portsmouth, New Hampshire, for yard work. In September, S-50 departed Portsmouth, under her own power, arrived at New London on 23 February; and reported to Commander, SubDiv 2. Three weeks later, she shifted to New York, where, for the next ten months, she was used in experimental engineering work.\n\nParagraph 10: Born in Tehran in 1919 to Habibollah Hoveyda (Ayn ol-Molk), a seasoned diplomat, who was mostly active during the latter years of the Qajar dynasty, and Afsar ol-Moluk, a descendant of the royal family that Hoveyda would serve for much of his adult life. Hoveyda's father was a lapsed adherent of the Baháʼí Faith and Hoveyda himself was not religious. He was the nephew of Abdol Hossein Sardari, also known as \"Schindler of Iran\". Because of the responsibilities borne by diplomats such as Ayn ol-Molk, the Hoveyda family was never fixed in one residence for any prolonged length of time. Studying in various countries gave Hoveyda a unique cosmopolitan flair that would remain being his most enduring characteristic. During the family's stay in Beirut, Lebanon, Hoveyda attended Lycée Français, an institution affiliated with the French government. His love for France and its culture are rooted in his tutelage at the lycée. French literary works by the likes of André Gide, André Malraux, Molière, and Baudelaire, captivated the young Hoveyda and gave way for his intellectual growth. Some pundits suggest that it was Hoveyda's intellectual prowess which initially attracted him into the Shah's folds.", "answers": ["Paragraph 6"], "length": 3239, "dataset": "passage_retrieval_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "b87a17caac9f72707af0dd2218b9a39ca0aeb134d1343e7f"}
{"input": "The text discusses the absence of inclusive conversations about sexual assault among LGBTQ populations, also known as sexual and gender minorities (SGM). It highlights the contextual factors that contribute to this issue, such as misogyny, homophobia, and transphobia. Prejudice and discrimination against SGM populations contribute to minority stress, which leads to health disparities. SGM individuals face barriers to finding refuge from sexual violence and receiving appropriate care due to biases in legislation and domestic violence shelters. The Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) of 1994, although influential, primarily focused on supporting white heterosexual cisgender women and took a carceral approach to funding DV shelters. Research has shown that SGM individuals have been turned away by DV shelters, and compliance with anti-discrimination policies has not been assessed. The VAWA's close link to law enforcement does not align with the needs and desires of survivors from marginalized intersectional identities who mistrust law enforcement. Previous studies have also demonstrated a lack of competence and attunement to servicing SGM survivors in DV shelters. The systemic erasure of SGM individuals denies them services that consider their unique experiences and contributes to their minority stress. Intersectionality plays a role in the nature of sexual assault experiences and access to post-assault services, with African American women, for example, facing high rates of sexual assault but also experiencing stigma that hinders disclosure and seeking support.", "context": "Paragraph 1: In their most modern form, High Commands for the TVDs were first reestablished in February 1979 for the Far East. Harrison wrote in the 2020s that the new command encompassed the Far East Military District and the Transbaikal Military District. An official military encyclopedia published after the Fall of the Soviet Union stated, said Harrison, that the Soviet Pacific Fleet, an air army, and an air defence corps were also operationally subordinated to the new formation; and that the high command \"coordinated\" with the armies of Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, and Mongolia. The headquarters was set up at Ulan-Ude, near Lake Baikal. The RAND Corporation said in 1984 that the Soviet air and ground forces in Mongolia [subordinate to the Transbaikal Military District] and elements of the Mongolian Ground Forces and Mongolian Air Force were also at its disposal. In September 1984 three more High Commands were established: the Western (HQ Legnica), South-Western (HQ Kishinev), and Southern (HQ Baku)\n\nParagraph 2: The absence of inclusive conversations about sexual assault among LGBTQ, often referred to as sexual and gender minorities (SGM), populations ignores key contextual factors. Unlike heterosexual relationships, this form of violence occurs within the context of a misogynous, homophobic and transphobic world. Prejudice and discrimination experienced by SGM populations contribute to their experience of minority stress. Minority stress posits that prejudice and discrimination against SGM populations cause and maintain health disparities. SGM are less likely than heterosexual victims to find formal refuge from sexual violence and receive appropriate care due to historical biases in legislation and domestic violence shelters tailoring their services towards cisgender and heterosexual victims and lack. Despite the influence of group coalitions led by women of color, disabled women, and transgender women survivors in activism against sexual assault, the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) of 1994 centered a monolithic approach to supporting survivors, primarily who were White heterosexual cisgender women, and took a carceral approach to funding DV shelters (i.e., required survivors to report abusers to law enforcement in order to receive shelter).  A systemic review stated that in 2011, 61% of SGM reported being turned away by domestic violence (DV) shelters. Although in 2013 the Violence Against Women Act explicitly barred discrimination on basis of race, gender, sexual orientation, and disability, no follow up research has been done to assess the compliance of DV shelters. The VAWA became so linked to law enforcement involvement, it did not match the approach to accountability and care desired by survivors holding marginalized intersectional identities whom have mistrust of law enforcement. Additionally, older research on DV shelters have demonstrated a lack of competence and attunement to servicing SGM survivors, which often perpetuated harm towards these communities. Systemic erasure of SGM denies victims services that take into account their unique experiences with interpersonal and systemic harm and adds to their minority stress. Minority stress also relates to intersectionality. The theory of intersectionality explores how varied identities held by an individual (i.e., race, SES, gender identity, sexual orientation, etc.) may interact with one another within a given social and political context. The nature of the sexual assault is shaped by the way intersecting identities interact with their social context, often shaping the nature of the sexual assault, the outcomes, and access to services post-assault. For example, African American women experience high rates of sexual assault, often relating to the historic stigmatization and fetishization of African American women sexuality, however, research shows they are less likely to disclose survivorship and seek out support due to stigma.\n\nParagraph 3:  On February 22, 1998, Chanchangi Airlines' chief pilot asked Air Traffic Control (ATC) at Kaduna, Nigeria for permission to conduct flight training within the airport's circuit using a Chanchangi Airlines Boeing 737-2K3 (leased from Aviogenex, registered YU-ANU) which had arrived from Lagos approximately one hour earlier. As visibility had reduced to 600 meters, he was told it was below the minimum allowed for landing and his request was not feasible. Next, the pilot requested he be allowed to conduct rejected take-off training, and permission was subsequently granted by ATC. Several individuals joined the captain for the exercise. He was instructed to begin the training on Runway 05, and once in position permission for \"takeoff\" was given. Normally, any single rejected takeoff at high speed would require a minimum of ten minutes to allow the brakes to cool before the aircraft could be safely operated again, and depending on various factors, this time period could be much longer, something the pilot certainly would have known. However, within the next twelve minutes, the pilot inexplicably conducted no less than four rejected take-offs, at least one of them and possibly all four of them at high speed. The brakes on one of the main landing gears (left side) began to catch fire, exacerbated by leaking hydraulic fluid. The pilot continued to taxi the aircraft until the tires and then the wheels of the left main gear disintegrated, preventing the plane from moving any further. He then called for emergency services. Unfortunately, they were unable to prevent the aircraft from burning to the ground. There were no fatalities. The chief pilot alleged he did not use the brakes for his practice rejected take-offs, however the evidence was unequivocally otherwise.\n\nParagraph 4: Control theory stresses how weak bonds between the individuals and society free people to deviate or go against the norms, or the people who have weak ties would engage in crimes so they could benefit, or gain something that is to their own interest. This is where strong bonds make deviance more costly. Deviant acts appear attractive to individuals but social bonds stop most people from committing the acts. Deviance is a result of extensive exposure to certain social situations where individuals develop behaviors that attract them to avoid conforming to social norms. Social bonds are used in control theory to help individuals from pursuing these attractive deviations.\n\nParagraph 5: The first casualty of the race was Lucas di Grassi, his VR-01 once again crippled by hydraulics failure, while at the front of the pack, Hamilton kept in touch with Webber as they raced on the softer tyre. His teammate Button was able to carve his way through the field, having started fourteenth. The early phase of the race was marked by another minor stewarding controversy as Fernando Alonso attempted to pass the struggling Robert Kubica on the entry to Vale. Alonso was forced off the circuit and recovered to take the second half of Club corner, but passed Kubica in the process. Alonso was given a drive-through penalty for failing to give the place back to Kubica, but problems began when Adrian Sutil made contact with Pedro de la Rosa on the main straight. Although both drivers were able to continue for the time being, de la Rosa's rear wing was damaged and it started to disintegrate as the Sauber took to the Hangar straight. He pitted and was released back into the race, but it was a mortal wound and de la Rosa was forced to retire. The debris on the circuit at the approach to Stowe prompted the deployment of the safety car, bunching the field back up. This was a problem for Alonso because he was unable to serve his drive-through penalty until after the safety car had withdrawn, sending him plummeting back down the order. Reactions from the commentators were unsympathetic, with many feeling that Alonso could have avoided trouble by giving the place back to Kubica at the earliest possible opportunity. Nevertheless, it was still described as a harsh penalty because Kubica had been forced out of the race with driveshaft problems before the de la Rosa-Sutil incident. Charlie Whiting, the FIA's race director, later told reporters that Alonso and Ferrari had been advised to yield to Kubica as soon as the Spaniard had passed the Renault, and twice more after that before the penalty was issued. Ferrari later released a timeline of the Alonso-Kubica pass and following events, showing that Charlie Whiting had told them he \"had to look at pictures\" and did not recommend Alonso return the position until a full two minutes after the controversial pass (critically after Alonso had already passed Alguersuari). The decision not to allow Kubica pass immediately after was a key moment in the championship, the lost points ultimately cost Alonso the championship.\n\nParagraph 6: The Swedish Army left Saxony on August 1707 to march east towards Russian territory. The army was largely newly recruited and well-equipped, numbering about 40,000 men. Rehnskiöld acted as Field Marshal and stood closest to the King at its high command. Rehnskiöld and the army command were unaware of Charles XII's plans for the campaign, which the King kept to himself, but agreed upon a preliminary march towards Russia's capital Moscow, where Peter I had gathered most of his forces. Charles XII ordered the commander of the \"Army of Courland\" in the Baltic provinces, General Adam Ludwig Lewenhaupt, to join the main army in the march against Moscow. Lewenhaupt and the Army of Courland were also tasked with obtaining supplies and wagons for onward transport to the Swedish main army. Awaiting Lewenhaupt's troops, the main army advanced slowly towards the Russian border. At the end of January 1708, they arrived at Grodno, which was occupied by 9,000 men of Peter I's army. Charles XII and Rehnskiöld attacked with 800 cavalry units, and the Russian troops withdrew after a short but fierce battle. Later in the evening, Russian troops sneaked into the city to surprise the Swedes; Rehnskiöld ended up in the middle of the attacking troops, but was not recognized because of the dark sky and managed to get to safety. The attack was repelled, and the Russians were forced to retreat. Later in the year, during the crossing of the Vabitj River at the town of Holowczyn in July 1708, the Swedish vanguard encountered a Russian army in fortified positions on the opposite shore. In the battle of Holowczyn, Charles XII commanded the infantry while Rehnskiöld commanded the cavalry. The Russian troops under Field Marshal Boris Sheremetev and Prince Alexander Danilovich Menshikov were pushed back after eight hours of struggle; however the Russian Army managed to escape mostly intact so the battle was not a decisive strategic victory.\n\nParagraph 7: Point Lonsdale has a large 100-year-old Norfolk Pine 'The Christmas Tree' that is lit up on the first Saturday in December at the end of an evening of A Community Celebration of Christmas. The Community Celebration of Christmas is run by a committee of volunteers assisted by the local service clubs, Lions and Rotary. The focus of the event is the community and children and each year the lights are turned on by a special guest (or guests) of honour chosen for their contribution to the Community. The Borough of Queenscliffe has a high percentage of volunteers and it is usually volunteers that are chosen as the special guest/guests of honour in recognition of their contribution to the community. Santa arrives at 7:25pm in the local Fire Brigade Truck, whilst throwing lollies to the children, to start an evening of entertainment by local performers. Glowcandles are sold as a fundraiser for maintaining equipment on the tree with all profits supporting the ongoing lighting of the tree. The tree itself is decorated by community volunteers and service club members coordinated by The Christmas Tree Committee. Festooning is hauled up by hand and manually secured into the tree. This tree can be found at the corner of Grimes Road and Point Lonsdale Rd, Point Lonsdale, Victoria. When lit up this tree can be seen for miles out to sea and is a Queenscliffe Borough icon, having been lit since about 1952–1953. When the lights are on you know Christmas is getting close.\n\nParagraph 8: Carl Daniel Peterson was born on May 26, 1943, in the Swedish Hospital in Minneapolis, Minnesota. He was the third of four sons born to Louise and Eric Peterson. His father worked heavy construction jobs throughout the Midwest, helping to build various military sites in the throes of World War II. When Carl was not yet four years old, the family moved to Long Beach, California, where Eric began a construction business with his brother-in-law. Carl attended Woodrow Wilson Classical High School in Long Beach, participating in football and baseball for the Wilson Bruins. It was there that the first steps on his future were written with the help of football coach Skip Rowland. Peterson played end, doing more blocking than catching, and also kicked extra points in a straight-on style. He was part of the graduating class of 1961 at Wilson and went on to earn three degrees from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA): a bachelor's degree in 1966, a master's degree in 1967, and a doctorate in 1970. His football playing career ended during a practice at UCLA (where he was a walk-on participant), when he suffered three torn knee ligaments. His coaching career began soon afterwards, at his alma mater, where he helped Rowland with the varsity and coached the junior-varsity team. He moved on to Loyola High School in Los Angeles, where he coached the offensive line for head coach Mario DiMuro, and also taught classes in math, geometry, trigonometry and health sciences. In 1969, he applied for and was hired at a new college - California State Sonoma—now known as Sonoma State University—in the Santa Rosa/Rohnert Park, California area. It was one of 18 California state universities. He was hired as the head baseball coach and an assistant under head football coach Lloyd Helgeson. Sonoma State competed the junior varsity level in 1969. Peterson succeeded Helgeson as head coach in 1970 when Sonoma State moved up to varsity status, competing at the NCAA College Division level. He led Sonoma State to a record of 6–12–1 in two seasons, 1970 and 1971, before the school disbanded its football program in 1972. Peterson left Sonoma State in February 1973 to become an assistant football coach at UCLA under head coach Pepper Rodgers. When Dick Vermeil took over as head coach of the UCLA Bruins in 1974, he retained Peterson on his coaching staff that eventually led UCLA to a Rose Bowl upset over head coach Woody Hayes' No. 1-ranked Ohio State Buckeyes on January 1, 1976.\n\nParagraph 9: The brotherhood originated in the 15th century, but it is not known when exactly it was founded. Hans Talhoffer may have been an early member, or even one of the founders (the lion of St Mark appears in his coat of arms in a manuscript of 1459). The earliest certain attestation dates to 1474. The group held an annual meeting in Frankfurt, where they elected their captain (Hauptmann). In 1487, Frederick III granted them the monopoly on the title \"master of the long sword\" (Meister des langen Schwerts), effectively making them a fencers' guild. This title was relevant for the Landsknechts, because a certified \"master of the long sword\" wielding the Zweihänder was entitled to twice the pay of a normal soldier (Doppelsöldner).\n\nParagraph 10: He also became an \"Azionista\", part of a broadly based political association, with some of the features of a political party, and a shared focus on antifascist resistance.   Another prominent activist member was Leone Ginzburg.   During 1942/;43 the two men helped to set up \"L'Italia Libera\", an underground (at this stage) monthly newssheet presented as the party newspaper of the \"Partito d'Azione\" and produced in various places.   Despite its being printed, initially, in tiny numbers, the circulation of L'Italia Libera grew, while its repute grew still more rapidly:  it became an important source of encouragement and intellectual nurture for anti-government groupings and organisations throughout Italy.   At a \"Partito d'Azione conference\" held in Florence in September 1943. it was determined that \"L'Italia Libera\" needed to become single nationally produced publication, produced in Rome.   Various premises were used, including  the basement at \"Via Basento 55\", a couple of hundred meters from the Villa Borghese in central Rome.   This was where, by November 1943, the printing press had been installed.   Following the arrest of Mussolini at the end of July 1943, relations between the replacement Italian government became increasingly fractious.   It was only in September 1943, after the Italian government entered into an armistice with representatives of the Anglo-American armies advancing from the south, that the German army moved quickly to overwhelm the Italian army and install a German puppet state covering northern and central Italy.   Rome therefore remained under something close to German military occupation between September 1943 and June 1944.   That was the situation during the night of 18/19 November or 19/20 November 1943 (sources differ as to the date) when a substantial police detachment broke into the basement premises at \"Via Basento 55\", where another edition of L'Italia Libera was being produced.   Those arrested included the newspaper's printers, contributing editors and distribution personnel, Muscetta and Ginzburg among them.   Those arrested were all taken to the political offices of the \"Questore\" and subjected to the usual interrogation procedures.  They were then transferred to Rome's celebrated/infamous Regina Coeli prison, while remaining available to their political interrogators.   Their situation appeared grim, but all was not blackness:  many years later a fellow inmate, Sandro Pertini would confide that whenever he came across Muscetta during the post-war decades he would think back to the image he retained in his mind of the literary critic from the Irpinia sitting on an upturned bucket robustly declaiming the stanzas of Orlando Furioso for the entertainment of fellow inmates in cell 339.\n\nParagraph 11: Hill rajas and Mughal forces had laid seize to Anandgarh Fort, Anandpur Sahib for about 8 months, in 1704. The Mughals and Hilly Rajas wanted Guru Gobind Singh to leave the fort they swore on Quran and Bhagwat Gita/Gauo Mata to give a safe passage to Guru. The Guru decided to leave the fort on request of panj piaras. Guru Sahib, four Sahibzadas, Mata Gujar kaur, Guru's Mahil (Court and Palace officials including Mata Jeeto Ji, his only wife), five Panj Piaras and a few hundred Sikhs left Anandpur Sahib on the chilly night of 20 December 1704 towards Ropar.  In the intervening night of 20–21 December, the enemy breached the vows and attacked Guru's entourage at a site on Sarsa rivulet some 25 km from Anandpur Sahib. Guru's family separated. This spot is now known as Pariwar Vichhora. Mata Gujar Kaur Ji with two younger grandsons, accompanied Guru family cook, Gangoo, a Kashmiri pandit, to his village, Saheri near Morinda.  Guru's Mahil left with Bhai Mani Singh, towards Delhi. Guru Gobind Singh with two elder Sahibzadas, 5 Panj Piaras and 40 Sikhs proceeded towards Chamkaur and reached there, in the afternoon of 21 December. Both are in Ropar Distt.(Pb.). The famous Chamkaur battle, took place on 22 and 23 December 1704, where two elder Sahibzadas, 3 Panj Piaras and 40 Sikhs laid down their lives fighting 10 lakh Mughal army. Mata Gujar Kaur ji and the two younger Sahibzadas were betrayed by gangoo brahman(kasmiri pandit) for some gold mohurs and were arrested by Morinda Mughals sent by Wazir Khan at Saheri village. From there, they were handed over to Suba Sirhind. They were imprisoned, in the Thanda Burj (Cold Tower). A farcical Trial began, in the Kacheri, (Court) of Suba Sirhind. It lasted for three days. On 26 December 1704, a heinous and cold-blooded crime was committed in the Sarzameen of Sirhind. Guru Gobind Singh's two younger sons, Baba Zorawar Singh and Baba Fateh Singh aged 9 and 6 years were bricked alive and later killed in the presence of the Assembly of Shaitans, presided over by Suba Sirhind, that bloody Wazir Khan. Two younger Sahibzadas and Mata Gujar Kaur (mother of Guru Gobind Singh Ji) were cremated by a merchant Diwan Todar Mal who covered the cremation grounds in gold coins as their final rites couldn't be done on Mughal ground (land), this place is now known as Jyoti Swaroop Gurudwara Sahib at Fatehgarh Sahib Punjab, India.", "answers": ["Paragraph 2"], "length": 3565, "dataset": "passage_retrieval_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "760463707ecc7878b6bce579b11979852925136277fecc79"}

Whose sins you will remit, they are remitted to them, and whose sins you will retain, they shall be retained.”  Now, our Master, through Your holy apostles, You have also deigned to give grace to their successors in the priestly ministry in the bosom of your Holy Church, the faculty of remitting sins on earth, of binding and to loosing every bond of iniquity.

Initially called the High Institute of Health, it developed into a medical school in 1950. In 1953, the Namazi School of Nursing and the Colleges of Agriculture and Arts and Sciences were established. With the addition of the College of Engineering and College of Veterinary Medicine in 1954, the school was elevated to university-status and named after the reigning Pahlavi dynasty.  Other units that were subsequently added were the Dental School in 1969, the Graduate School and College of Electronics in 1969, Dentistry in 1970, and the Colleges of Law and Education in 1977.\n\nParagraph 3: The film revolves around Nita (played by Supriya Choudhury), a young girl who lives with her family, refugees from East Pakistan, in the suburbs of Calcutta. Nita is a self-sacrificing person who is constantly exploited by everyone around her, even her own family, who take her goodness for granted. Her father has an accident and is unable to make a living. Her elder brother Shankar (played by Anil Chatterjee) believes that his craft (singing) needs to be perfected before he can make any income from it and therefore the burden of taking care of the family falls on Nita. Her life is ridden with personal tragedy: her lover Sanat leaves her for her sister Geeta, her younger brother is injured while working in a factory and finally she herself becomes a burden for her family by contracting tuberculosis. Her mostly absent would-be singer brother is the only person who cares about her in the end. At the end of the film, she screams out her agony, throwing herself into her brother's arms. She utters her last words: \"Brother, I want to survive (দাদা, আমি বাঁচতে চাই।).\"\n\nParagraph 4: By 1883, the tradition of England-Australia tours was well established, that year having concluded the first Ashes series.  When England lost at home for the first time in 1882, The Sporting Times lamented the death of cricket in the mother country and declared that \"the body will be cremated and the ashes taken to Australia\".  England captain Ivo Bligh promised that on the tour to Australia in 1882–83 he would regain \"the ashes\" and the term began to be established. During that tour a small terracotta urn was presented to Bligh by a group of Melbourne women. The urn is commonly, but erroneously, believed to be the trophy of the Ashes series, but it has never been formally adopted as such and Bligh always considered it to be a personal gift.\n\nParagraph 5: In early 2007, Walter had a supporting role as Mabel the bartender in the MyNetworkTV soap opera Watch Over Me. Later that May she served as a judge on the ABC reality TV show The Next Best Thing, which searched for the best celebrity impersonators in America. In early 2008, Walter was in the comedy film Drillbit Taylor, and also starred on the VH1 reality series Celebracadabra, in which celebrities competed to see who was the best magician among them. She made it to the final three but was eliminated in the sixth episode. She has developed a series for the Oxygen network called Dance Your Ass Off. On December 19, 2011, she appeared on Rizzoli & Isles as a ballet coach, J.J. It was far from her usual role, as she played a very serious character in a drama.\n\nParagraph 6: After Hydra's takeover of America was thwarted, Hornet was seen active in Las Vegas, prompting Ricochet and Dusk to travel there to confront their apparently resurrected ally, even as the Hornet steals from a casino on the part of his employer Silas Thorne and is confronted by Scarlet Spider. After the initial confrontation, Ricochet learns that the new Hornet is not only working with Prodigy, but received his costume from the Black Marvel and is thus convinced to join the other Slingers in forcing the Scarlet Spider to turn himself over to the police for beating Silas Thorne so badly that he was sent to hospital (the various Slingers unconcerned about Thorne's reported role in the theft of food supplies from a planned charity drive). After they take Cassandra Mercury hostage, she is found thanks to Ben Reilly and Kaine Parker tracking her hidden mobile phone, where they discover that the Slingers are being led by the Black Marvel. However, Dusk realizes that the Black Marvel has no soul, and damage to the Hornet's gauntlets reveal his true identity as Cyber who was revived by the as-yet-unidentified entity that was posing as Black Marvel. Although the Black Marvel taunts them that they were poor heroes due to their lack of coordination as a team, the other three Slingers join forces with the two Spiders to defeat Cyber and the demon possessing the Black Marvel, the Slingers defeating Cyber while Reilly and Kaine exorcise the demon. With the battle concluded, the Slingers accept that Reilly regrets his earlier beating of Thorne, acknowledging the shades of grey.\n\nParagraph 7: Wangan Midnight is a 2007 Japanese anime television series based on Michiharu Kusunoki's award winning manga series of the same name. OB Planning (Initial D) announced the production of the animated series during the Tokyo Anime Fair in March 2007. Aired on a pay-per-view channel of Animax in June 2007, the series was co-produced by OB Planning, A.C.G.T., and Pastel under the direction of Tsuneo Tominaga and consists of twenty-six episodes. The series was released on DVD with the thirteenth volume reaching 29th on the Oricon sales chart for Japanese animation DVDs in November 2008. With 26 episodes, the series is split into four arcs. The first arc is the \"Return of the Devil Z\" arc, which focuses on Akio Asakura as he gets a rusty blue Nissan Fairlady Z (S30) after losing a race to a mysterious Porsche 911 driven by Tatsuya Shima, and dubbed \"Blackbird\". Nicknamed the \"Devil Z\" due to suffering from numerous accidents, Akio starts a rivalry with Blackbird for Wangan superiority, but tries to keep the car from crashing and also must deal with a young woman who is revealed to be the sister of the original owner of the Devil Z, who died in a crash while racing with Blackbird. Meanwhile, other racers are seeking to start a rivalry with the resurrected Devil Z and Blackbird such as Reina Akikawa, a fashion model and television host who drives a Nissan Skyline GT-R R32 and Yoshiaki Ishida, a photographer who drives a white Ferrari Testarossa. It also introduces Jun Kitami, the creator of the Devil Z and Blackbird who is now a bike shop owner. The \"Perfect GT-R\" arc focuses on Koichi Hiramoto, a young man who gave up on street racing to focus on his family, but comes out of retirement to face the Devil Z and Blackbird. Meanwhile, the Devil Z is destroyed after it crashes into a truck, but gets rebuilt and races again afterward. The \"Monster Machine\" arc focuses on Kei Aizawa, a host club worker and driver of the Toyota Supra who also seeks to defeat the Devil Z and Blackbird. The \"R200 Club\" arc focuses on a group of tuners who drive Nissan Skyline GT-R R33 cars that seek to outrun the Devil Z and Blackbird, alongside Reina's R32. Following this, Takayuki Kuroki, owner of FLAT racing and a former R200 Club before their disbandment, is also seeking to outrun the Devil Z and Blackbird as well. \"The Hanshin Circular Line\" arc focuses on Eiji and Maki Kamiya, two half-brothers from Osaka who both drive Mitsubishi Lancer Evolutions, while the final arc \"The Legendary FC\" arc focuses on Koichi Kijima, a writer, car enthusiast, and TV show host who drives a Mazda RX7 FC3S and also seeks to oust the Devil Z and Blackbird. The arc missing from the series is the \"Akasaka Straight\" arc, that focused on Masaki.\n\nParagraph 8: Duncan's early life was steeped in West Texas music. He picked this up naturally as a boy listening to his mother play rhythm guitar in his uncle's country band. Later, he began sharpening his vocal skills, influenced by his early idols Eddy Arnold, Perry Como, Jim Reeves, and Frank Sinatra. He was born into a musical family. He was proud of his talented cousins, including Eddie Seals, Jimmy Seals of Seals & Crofts, and country singer Dan Seals. \"He knew when he was 12 years old that playing music and singing songs was going to be his life\", said his wife, Connie Duncan.\n\nParagraph 9: Jay Kenneth Katzen (August 23, 1936 – April 9, 2020) was an American diplomat, business consultant, state legislator, and government agency administrator, and former President of the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation. He graduated from Princeton University (1958) and Yale University (1959) and served United States presidents Dwight D. Eisenhower through George H. W. Bush. His positions included White House translator and U.S. representative to the United Nations. From 1977 to 1979 he served chargé d'affairs ad interim to Congo (Brazzaville). He became active in Virginia politics when elected in 1993 to represent the 31st legislative district of the Virginia House of Delegates. In 2001, he was the Republican Party's nominee for Lieutenant Governor of Virginia.\n\nParagraph 10: A third push for the bridge occurred in 1936. Although the Great Depression in the United States was improving, there was a significant effort being made to balance the federal budget. (This budget-tightening would significantly contribute to the Recession of 1937–38.) City commissioners submitted a budget of $47.9 million to the Bureau of the Budget, but saw $4.3 million cut from it. However, a request for $25,000 for a bridge study was retained. On January 21, the Southeast Businessmen's Association and several citizen associations in the area sent a letter to the Subcommittee of the House Committee on Appropriations and to the Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Appropriations asking for appropriation of the study funds. In addition to underscoring the dangerous nature of the traffic problems and the deleterious economic effect the out-of-date bridge created, they pointed out that the 67,337 people living east of the river paid 15.5 percent of all city tax revenues but received just 3 percent of its expenditures. On April 6, the Federation of Citizens Association (an umbrella group representing all citizens associations in the city) endorsed the study request in a hearing before the Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Appropriations. The fate of the District's budget was placed in jeopardy on May 21, 1936, when Representative Thomas L. Blanton (D-Texas) refused to compromise with Senate conference committee members on a wide range of issues (including the \"federal payment\" to the city's budget). The city was faced with the prospect of having no budget, and all its funding directly approved by President Roosevelt as \"relief\". With Congress racing to a June 20 adjournment, Roosevelt threw his weight behind the Senate. Although the House initially resisted, the final bill (with only minor changes from the Senate version) passed on June 19 and was signed into law by President Roosevelt on June 23. It included the hard-won $25,000 appropriation for a Pennsylvania Avenue Bridge study.\n\nParagraph 11: Since December 16, 2002, she was one of the news presenters at Noticias Caracol (at the time Caracol Noticias) newscast.

Corzo left Noticias Caracol for five weeks, but returned on March 12, 2008 at the 22:00 newscast.

{"input": "The text discusses the activities of a Russian businessman named Anton Bakov, who in 2014 proposed that Prince Karl Emich take up the Russian Throne and form a new and independent state. Bakov purchased a plot of land in Montenegro to give the new state a location and aimed to establish an offshore zone there to provide financial intermediation to Russian companies. He also had talks with authorities in neighboring Macedonia and Albania for collaboration and state recognition. Bakov also held discussions with several political leaders and religious figures, including the Prime Minister of Antigua and Barbuda, the President of Gambia, and the Eastern Orthodox clergy of Macedonia and Montenegro.", "context": "Paragraph 1: A utility tunnel, the inside of a boiler (only accessible when the boiler is off), the inside of a fluid storage tank, a septic tank that has contained sewage, and a small underground electrical vault are all examples of confined spaces. Ships and other vessels commonly have confined spaces due to the need for compartmentalized watertight construction. The exact definition of a confined space varies depending on the type of industry. Until recently confined spaces on a construction site were defined differently than confined spaces in General Industry such as a paper mill. That changed due to a new confined space regulation for construction.  Confined spaces that present special hazards to workers, including risks of toxic or asphyxiant gas accumulation, fires, falls, flooding, and entrapment may be classified as permit-required confined spaces depending on the nature and severity of the hazard.\n\nParagraph 2: As soon as a vehicle is purchased, the dealer of the vehicle issues a temporary license sticker known colloquially as a TR (To Register) number. In Maharashtra (TC test certificate no.is given). This is valid for one month, during which the owner must register the vehicle in the controlling RTO of the area in which the owner is residing to get a standard license plate. Some states like Tamil Nadu do not allow vehicles with TR numbers on the road, the dealer will hand over the vehicle to the purchaser only after the registration process is done. To register a vehicle, it has to be presented to the RTO's office, where a Motor Vehicle Inspector will verify the applicant's address and other details, confirm that the engine and chassis numbers are identical to what is written in the application and issues a permanent registration certificate which is usually valid for 20 years. The permanent registration certificate is one of the four important documents a vehicle plying on the road should always have; the others being a valid insurance certificate, a pollution under control (PUC) certificate and the driver's license. For public utility vehicles like buses, trucks, taxis and pick-up vans, there are a number of additional documents like a road-worthiness certificate and a transportation permit.\n\nParagraph 3: On 16 June 2000, he set fire to three light trucks at Romania Chevrolet dealership suspectedly via the use of bombs, in Eugene as a protest against excessive consumption and global warming, along with Craig \"Critter\" Marshall, who was sentenced to five and a half years in prison. The arson destroyed three pickup trucks including a 2000 Silverado. Luers might have received a comparable sentence if he had not been convicted of an earlier attempted arson as well.  Luers was initially sentenced to 22 years, 8 months in prison. Supporters argued that his sentence was excessive, because no one was injured and property damage was estimated at only $40,000\n\nParagraph 4: In 2011, Werribee Zoo gained three male western lowland gorillas from Melbourne Zoo. These consist of an adult silverback and his two sons. The new public display gorilla habitat is a  sanctuary that features wide-open spaces, climbing structures and indoor facilities. This new facility enable Zoos Victoria to provide best-practice care for the bachelor gorillas and confirm the organisation's reputation as a world leader in gorilla management.  The Victorian Government recently gave $1.5 million to support the construction of this $2.2 million facility. Zoos Victoria Foundation is seeking public support to help raise the remaining $700,000 through the West Gorillas in the West campaign.\n\nParagraph 5: The Cold Food Festival is first mentioned in Huan Tan's New Discussions, composed around the beginning of the 1st century. It records that the commoners of Taiyuan Commandery avoided using fire in preparing their food for five days around midwinter, upholding this taboo even when they are gravely ill. This was done in Jie Zhitui's honor. A biography in the Book of the Later Han relates how the magistrate for Bingzhou (i.e., Taiyuan) found people rich and poor observing a \"dragon taboo\" against lighting a fire during the month of Jie's death in midwinter, lest they anger his spirit. Many of the old and young died every year because of the hardship this brought. The magistrate Zhou Ju  wrote an oration around AD130 praising Jie but admonishing the people for a tradition that harmed so many that it could not have been what the sage intended. He then had the oration displayed at Jie's temple and distributed among the poor. This did not end the Cold Food Festival, but the biography notes that local superstitions did improve \"to a certain extent\". The improvement is not explained but, at some point over the next century, it moved from the middle of winter to late spring, 105 days after the dongzhi solar term. Since it also spread from Taiyuan to the surrounding commanderies of Shangdang, Xihe, and Yanmen and was still causing some hardship, Cao Cao attempted to outlaw the Cold Food Festival in AD206. The heads of offending families were liable for 6 months' hard labor, their local official was liable for one month himself, and their magistrate was to lose one month's salary. Cao Cao's effort was a failure, with observance of the Cold Food Festival on Qingming and for up to a month around it being reported by the mid-3rd century. Shi Le, the Jie emperor of the Later Zhao in the early 4th century, again tried to forbid it. The next year a massive hailstorm devastated crops and forests throughout Shanxi. On the advice of his ministers, he again approved the festival in the region around Taiyuan. The Northern Wei similarly banned the festival in 478 and 496, but were also compelled to approve its observance around . These prohibitions failed to such an extent that, by the time of Jia Sixie's  Qimin Yaoshu, a day-long Cold Food Festival had spread across most of China, moved to the day before the Qingming solar term.\n\nParagraph 6: In early 2014, Bakov announced he views the Russian Throne (See), from the point of international law, as matters of state sovereignty (regardless of any other attributes, referring to analogues with The Holy See). He outlined that Karl Emich, upon accepting the Orthodox religion, received the right to take up this See according to the pre-Revolution Fundamental Laws of the Russian Empire. Bakov proposed that the Prince should accept the Throne to form a new and independent state, and incorporate it into Bakov's promotional projects such as the Monarchist Party, virtual state of Russian Empire among others. In April 2014, Bakov and Karl Emich appeared in a newspaper report declaring the Prince accepted the proposals as well as the title of Emperor Nicholas III (successor to Nicholas II). In the report, Bakov emphasized that Karl Emich has been an entrepreneur for a long time, but that from now on, he is barred from performing all non-Throne related activity. The report contained a \"Manifesto of granting the Constitution to the State\", signed by Nicholas III, proclaiming the formation of the sovereign state \"Imperial See\" aimed at consolidating all the people around the world devoted to Christian Monarchism. The See in the documents is viewed as the legacy of the first-ever Christian Roman Imperial Throne of Constantine the Great, passed through the Byzantine Empire to the Russian Empire and the House of Romanov by religious procedures. Later Bakov announced that he had purchased a plot of land in Montenegro to give the new state a location (80 ha, \"twice as big as Vatican\"), and was in negotiations with Montenegro's authorities on the state's recognition. He also said that Russian President Vladimir Putin refused to grant such a plot in Yekaterinburg (Bakov's residence and place of 1918 Romanov assassination) in response to Karl Emich's request passed to Putin by Bakov, a former MP. In early 2015, as a follow-up to the International sanctions during the Ukrainian crisis, Bakov told the press there are talks with Montenegro authorities to establish an offshore zone at this plot, aimed at providing financial intermediation to Russian companies. Also in early 2015, Imperial Throne representatives were in talks with the authorities of the neighboring Republic of Macedonia and Albania on possible collaboration and future state recognition. In particular, Bakov held a meeting with Macedonian Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski. Later there were the also talks with then President of Gambia Yahya Jammeh at the 70th UN General Assembly session in USA. Also, talks were held with Macedonian and Montenegro Eastern Orthodox clergy — Bakov discussed the creation of churches associated with the Imperial Throne and proposed the canonization of Russian ancient ruler Ivan III and his wife Sophia Palaiologina. Talks with Gaston Browne, Prime Minister of Antigua and Barbuda, also took place, as well as extended talks with authorities of Gambia and Kiribati.\n\nParagraph 7: Upon relocating, Kulich found himself struggling financially. After repeatedly being sent to audition for roles as Nazis and terrorists he had grown so dissatisfied with his agent that he fired him without bothering to arrange for other representation first. Shortly thereafter, as Kulich was considering his options, his ex-agent contacted him.  Though Kulich was technically no longer his client, a Viking-themed film had just come to his attention for which he felt the actor might be perfect. The project was called Eaters of the Dead, though the title would later be changed to The 13th Warrior. Kulich was told very little about the production and the audition was similarly low-key.  Two months passed before he was informed that the director, John McTiernan, wished to meet with him. By the time of his screen test, Kulich had recognized the potential of the high-profile project and had hopes that it would provide him with the \"big break\" he needed.  Filming was lengthy and arduous at times, taking place amongst the familiar landscapes of British Columbia. Despite having never ridden a horse prior to portraying Buliwyf, a character based loosely upon the mythical hero Beowulf, Kulich naturally took to the role. When the movie finally hit theaters in the summer of 1999, his contributions did not go unnoticed by audiences and critics alike.  Unfortunately, the film never lived up to its initial promise due in part to creative differences between producer/author Michael Crichton and McTiernan, the eventual departure of the latter from the project, and the studio's resultant hesitancy to promote the finished product. Still, the experience was a favorable one for Kulich, earning him newfound recognition and a larger, more pronounced fan base. In subsequent years, his performance would prove to be a veritable stepping stone on the path to other significant roles as well.\n\nParagraph 8: Sabrina is depicted from the middle of high school through all the way to marriage. On her 16th birthday, she learned that she was a half-witch (through her father's side) and had magical powers. She also learned that her two aunts were witches themselves and that their black cat Salem was a witch who had been turned into a talking household pet as a punishment for attempting worldwide domination. At Westbridge High, she befriended Jenny Kelley (and later Valerie Birkhead in seasons 2 and 3) and had an on-again, off-again relationship with Harvey Kinkle. She also has to deal with her Vice Principal Kraft who dates her aunt Zelda and then in season 4 becomes principal and stops dating Zelda and then goes back on and again not due to car crashes. In the finale they finally stop dating due to Salem driving a car into him. In season 4, Harvey believes Sabrina is cheating on him. They get back together later in Season 4 and then break up again when Harvey discovers she's a witch. She also had to deal with the snobby and headstrong cheerleader Libby Chessler, who became Sabrina's rival for school activities as well as Harvey's affections. Sabrina also at some points transforms herself into Libby to gain popularity (Libby is the queen of the school) for her \"dorky\" activities. In later seasons, Sabrina was enrolled at the fictional Adams College in Boston. Her roommates are gloomy Roxie, fashion-glamour Morgan, and paranormal activist Miles, who, at one point almost got Sabrina exposed as a witch. After getting her degree in journalism she moved back to her aunts' house with Morgan and Roxie. She took a job with the fictitious ScorchMagazine, a music theme magazine where she interviewed famous artists. Later on, she met a man named Aaron, who also worked in the music industry and the two began dating. Before long, Aaron proposed and in the finale, the two were set to wed when unforeseen events take place. She started to suspect that Aaron was not the one and after Sabrina had tried to connect her soul stone with his, she was sure of it. While it mostly fit, it was not a perfect fit. She tried to ignore it, but followed her heart and canceled the marriage at the altar. When she ran out of the church, she found Harvey waiting for her outside on his motorcycle, holding his soul stone that Amanda, her cousin, had left him. After both Harvey and Sabrina's soul stones were tossed to the side and fit together perfectly, it proved that those two are destined to be together and they rode off together into the distance in true finale fashion at 12:36 on the dot, the same hour they first met. Sabrina's magic takes the form of yellow sparks.\n\nParagraph 9: The Licensing Order was allowed to lapse on 17 April 1695, when the House of Commons declined to renew it and stated its reasons, beginning with \"Because it revives, and re-enacts, a Law which in no-wise answered the End for which it was made\".  One historian observes that the act was allowed to lapse \"not because it infringed on the liberties of Englishmen but because it conferred a monopoly on the crown and a very limited number of booksellers\" and that the reasons for allowing the lapse \"were commercial, not constitutional.\"    Although most accounts stipulate that \"the Licensing act expired in 1695\", the \"expiration\" was not the result of a simple lapse of attention on the part of the government.  Instead, the freedoms established by the Declaration of Rights created a more open society, and an explosion of print was the result.  The number of printing houses in England grew in thirty years from 20 in 1695 to 103 (75 in London alone) by 1724.  In England, the emergence of publications like the Tatler and the Spectator are given credit for creating a 'bourgeois public sphere' that allowed for a free exchange of ideas and information.  In the American colonies, the end of the Licensing Act also sparked the creation of new publications and set the stage for the battle of words that would lead to the American Revolution in the second half of the eighteenth century.\n\nParagraph 10: Other scholars point to historical and linguistic evidence that suggests that Idoma have ties with the Igala people to the west, concluding that the two nations came from a common ancestor. Angulu(1981) note that Igala and Igbo have important historical, ancestral and cultural relationships. Eri is said to be the original legendary cultural head of the Umu-eri, a subgroup of the Igbo people. Eri migrated from the Igala area and established a community in the middle of Anambra river valley (at Eri-aka) in Aguleri where he married two wives. The first wife, Nneamakụ, bore him five children. The first was Agulu, the founder of Aguleri (The ancestral head of Eri Kingdom clans) (the Ezeora dynasty that has produced 34 kings till date in Enugwu Aguleri), the second was Menri, the founder of Umunri / Kingdom of Nri, followed by Onugu, the founder of Igbariam and Ogbodulu, the founder of Amanuke. The fifth one was a daughter called Iguedo, who is said to have borne the founders of Nteje, and Awkuzu, Ogbunike, Umuleri, Nando and Ogboli in Onitsha. As one of the children of Eri, Menri migrated from Aguleri, which was and still is, the ancestral temple of the entire Umu-Eri (Umu-Eri and Umu-Nri). His second wife Oboli begot Ọnọja, the only son who founded the Igala Kingdom in Kogi State. Among this group, there are those who believe both ethnic groups fled the same kingdom at some point in history. Many traditional Idoma spiritual chants and “secret” tongues spoken during traditional ceremonies are actually Igala dialects and there are some Idoma themselves who assert their Igala ancestry. There are yet other Idoma groups notably in the southern regions, which claim their ancestors arrived at their present location from the Northern fringes of Igboland as a result of land disputes. Scholars believe these people had most likely fled Apa too, settled and resettled.\n\nParagraph 11: For the first half of the season, Robson is mainly seen as a supporter of Schillinger and the rest of his Aryan brothers, aiding in whatever plot he could. In the latter half, however, he slowly evolves into a more significant character. When Schillinger begins to spend more time with Christian leader Jeremiah Cloutier, Robson temporarily runs the Aryan Brotherhood's business, gradually becoming disillusioned with his former mentor. He is thrown into The Hole after getting in a fight over a joke that the Muslims overheard. Robson blames Muslim leader Kareem Said, and forms an alliance with black inmate Leroy Tidd, who also hated Said for killing his friend, Simon Adebisi. The two plot to kill Said. Tidd pretends to convert to Islam to get close to Said. However, when Tidd's conversion becomes genuine, he pulls out of the plan. Robson then bullies a younger inmate named Carl Jenkins into killing Said by promising to initiate him into the Brotherhood, as well as threatening to sell him as a sex slave (i.e. a prag) to the black inmates if he fails. Jenkins kills Tidd instead when Tidd protects Said, and is thrown into solitary confinement. Cloutier, on Said's behalf, approaches Jenkins and convinces him to give up Robson as the man who ordered the murder. Jenkins does so, but later commits suicide for fear of the Aryans' retaliation. Since prison authorities have no testimony against Robson; he is released from solitary and cleared of the charge. He then enrages Said by taunting him about the deaths of Tidd and Jenkins. Said beats Robson unconscious, further escalating the war between the Aryans and the Muslims. By this time, Schillinger has resumed running the Brotherhood, much to Robson's relief. The war worsens when the Muslims protect Beecher, Schillinger's longtime enemy, when he comes up for parole. When Robson and Schillinger taunt Beecher for losing his parole, Said shanks both of them. They both end up in the hospital with severe stab wounds and deepened rancor toward Beecher and Said.\n\nParagraph 12: \"Bleed American\" was released to radio on June 5, 2001 as the album's lead single, coinciding with Jimmy Eat World's tours of Australia and Japan (the latter supporting Eastern Youth). After appearing on the East Coast dates of the Warped Tour, the band supported Blink-182 and Weezer. \"The Middle\" was released as a single on November 19, 2001. The band went on a headlining European tour in early 2002, followed by a Japanese tour, leading up to a two-month support slot for Blink-182 and Green Day on their Pop Disaster Tour. \"Sweetness\" was released as the third single on June 3, 2002. The band supported Incubus in Australia, before embarking on headlining tours of the UK and the US. \"A Praise Chorus\" was released as a promotional single during 2002.\n\nParagraph 13: In a 1990 biography of Vrubel, the Soviet art historian  considered his life and art as a three-act drama with prologue and epilogue, while the transition between acts was rapid and unexpected. The \"Prologue\" refers to his earlier years of studying and choosing a career path. The \"first act\" peaked in the 1880s when Vrubel was studying at the Imperial Academy of Arts and then moved to Kiev to study Byzantine and Christian art. The \"second act\" corresponded to the so-called \"Moscow period\" that started with The Demon Seated of 1890, followed by Vrubel's 1896 marriage to the opera singer Nadezhda Zabela-Vrubel, his longtime sitter, and ended in 1902 with The Demon Downcast and the subsequent hospitalization of the artist. The \"third act\" lasted from 1903 to 1906 when Vrubel was suffering from his mental illness that gradually undermined his physical and intellectual capabilities. For the last four years of his life, already being blind, Vrubel lived only physically.", "answers": ["Paragraph 6"], "length": 3535, "dataset": "passage_retrieval_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "31426afc717058adc13fce3a7307c5bdad89bc5be71735b1"}

The Fury tracks Captain Britain and disables him, then confronts Earth-616's version of Mad Jim Jaspers.

Studebaker advertised as \"the compact with Performability,\" and this was abetted by the addition of the  V8 from the Hawk family sports car as an option, although this was mainly for Larks intended for police pursuit packages. The bigger news, as far as the general public was concerned, involved the six-cylinder engine. Studebaker's engineers had long known that their little flathead mill, which dated in its basic form to 1939, was falling farther and farther behind the competition in both power and fuel economy. Lacking the budget to design a completely new engine, the engineering staff converted the 170 engine to overhead valves while retaining much of the basic design. The \"new\" six, which displaced the same 170 cu. in. as before, went from  to , all without a loss in fuel economy. Indeed, most road testers of the day found the new engine to be easier on fuel than the flathead, and cars so equipped were able to shave nearly four seconds off the all-important 0-60 mph time. The redesigned six, known as the \"Skybolt Six,\" was marketed by Studebaker extensively in 1961.\n\nParagraph 2: In international law, the right by which property taken by an enemy and recaptured or rescued from him by the fellow-subjects or allies of the original owner is restored to the latter upon certain terms. 1 Kent, Cornm. 108.Ius praesens.

They have sex, but she is angry to learn that he is still married. However, she decides that she wants to stay in Summer Bay and begins an affair with Brody. Ziggy discovers Simone is back and Brody explains that her city job fell through and he is rehiring her for a while. Brody tells Simone that he loves Ziggy, but he wants to be with her. Justin learns of the affair and asks Simone to quit her job and leave. Simone struggles to see Brody and Ziggy together and quits the restaurant. She gets a job at the local high school as a learning support teacher to Bella Nixon (Courtney Miller) and Raffy Morrison (Olivia Deeble). Ziggy confronts Simone about her agenda for staying in the Bay, leading to Simone asking Brody to stay away from her. Brody later declares his love for Simone and vows to leave Ziggy after her 21st birthday for her. However, Ziggy catches them together in Simone's caravan, which leads to the end of Brody's marriage. Simone continues working at the school alongside Ziggy's mother Maggie Astoni (Kestie Morassi), but Raffy refuses to have her as a tutor. Simone and Brody face anger from the Astonis, Raffy and Mason when they go public with their relationship. The Morgans also disapprove when she stays the night with Brody at the cottage where he lived with Ziggy. Brody suggests they move in together somewhere else. After they are rejected for a rental agreement due to Brody's criminal record, he tells Simone about his past drug addiction. She asks that they slow things down and get to know one another. Simone is embarrassed when her office door is graffitied with the word \"homewrecker\", and is upset to learn that it was Bella, who apologises. Simone resigns and she and Brody decide to leave the Bay together. Brody puts Salt up for sale, while Simone finds a new job. Simone helps organise Raffy's 16th birthday party, but she is upset when Ziggy's sister, Coco Astoni (Anna Cocquerel) tells her and Brody that they do not deserve happiness. She plans to leave the Bay without Brody, who has been having doubts about selling Salt. Simone and Brody sell Salt and they move to Yarra Valley together. Two years later, Simone and Brody call Tori and Justin to let them know that they are expecting their first child.\n\nParagraph 4: Tang Sauce was born and raised in Hartford, CT.  He is the son of noted cartoonist, author, and filmmaker Joe Young and Leslie Manselle.  He has two brothers and one sister.  He learned to play the cornet at the age of eleven and eventually picked up the guitar and piano in high school.  He attended the Artist Collective in Hartford to study Jazz and tap dance, becoming a member of the Youth Jazz Ensemble, and attended and graduated from Manchester High School, where he also was a member of the schools' Jazz ensemble.  While a student at Capital Community College, he continued to build on his talents in dancing, rapping, and acting, citing as his inspiration Lil Wayne, LL Cool J, Will Smith and Nick Cannon for his early hip-hop influences, as well as Lee Morgan, Kenny Dorham, Kid David, Meghus, and Sidney Poitier for performance.  A chance viewing of the dance film You Got Served compelled him to take dancing seriously, which he immersed himself in the fundamentals of breakdancing, eventually getting cast as a dancer in a production of The Wiz.  Further appearances in Hartford Stage and Neighborhood Studios collaborations of A Midsummer Night's Dream and A Raisin In the Sun helped fuel his confidence, but he preferred to pursue hip-hop, first touring around Hartford performing his blend of old-school, positive hip-hop, often cited as a throwback to early rap artists KRS-One and Wu-Tang Clan, where he would eventually acquire his moniker.  He made appearances at the annual Trinity International Hip Hop Festival, eventually hosting the event, the Springfield Jazz Roots Festival, and the Shrine World Music Venue.  After a brief appearance in a Jidenna music video \"Knickers\" as a trumpeter and a collaborative effort with the collective OflowShow and artist Bill Blacks entitled Azanto America, Tang Sauce went into the studio to record what would be his debut mixtape Maturity.  Released February 27, 2016, it received positive reviews and spawned the singles and music videos \"One Time For Your Mind\", \"Good Ol' Days\", and \"Ego-Trippin'\".  Following those releases, Tang Sauce kicked off the New England leg of his MaTourity and appeared in AfroPunk 2017 as part of the battle of the bands, and will appear on August 11, 2017 as a Top 4 finalist.  In 2018, Tang Sauce released his next project \"Seniority\", which was accompanied by a one-act play starring Tang Sauces' title character.  In 2020 he starred in a tv show streaming on Amazon Prime produced by his father entitled All In: The Family where he plays the role of Kevin.\n\nParagraph 5: The son of János Schlosser and Maria Kettner, he had two brothers, (John and Joseph), who were members of the Ferencvárosi TC, and thus, he followed their footsteps and made his debut at the age of 17, on 25 February 1906, against the Postás ellen (0-1), but his game was not yet appropriate, so he returned to the second team to strengthen for 3 months. He was on the first team again in the fall and this time he showed the potential of his talent, so he soon became a regular member of the team. Schlosser played eight seasons in green and white (1906-1915), of which he was champion six times and the top goal scorer of the league six times in a row, scoring a total of 258 league goals in 155 league matches. He also won one Hungarian Cup in 1912-13, in which he scored the winning goal in the final. Remarkably, he also topped the European top scoring list four times in a row, in the 1910-11(42), 1911-12(40) and 1912-13(42) and 1913-14(36) seasons, making him the first-ever player to be Europe's top scorer four times, a record that was later equalled only by the great Josef Bican and Lionel Messi. After an argument with the FTC management team, he signed with the club's biggest rival MTK, and with them he was the champion of Hungary a further 6 times. He then spent a season at Wiener AC in Austria before returning to Ferencvárosi, to help them to a double, winning both the league and cup.\n\nParagraph 6: The Captain was retrieved by Merlyn and revived in the alien magician's home dimension, Otherworld. The Fury detected that its prey again lived, and began to adapt itself to interdimensional travel in order to hunt him down. Meanwhile, the temporal overseer Mandragon destroyed Earth-238 in order to kill Jaspers; the Fury barely escaped to Captain Britain's native world, Earth-616.  There, the Fury killed several more of Captain Britain's allies, growing ever more powerful as it did so.  Tracking Captain Britain and disabling him, it finally confronted Earth-616's counterpart of Mad Jim Jaspers, who was beginning to organize a program against his own world's superhumans. The Fury determined that this Jaspers was not its creator and therefore was not exempt from its directive to kill superhumans. The two fought on equal footing, but the Fury won when it transported the pair to the empty void that had been Earth-238. Jaspers was unable to use his powers of reality manipulation in a universe where reality had been destroyed, and the Fury swiftly incinerated his brain. The weakened Fury returned to Earth-616, where it was ambushed and destroyed by Captain Britain and Captain UK, sustaining more damage in the process than it could regenerate.\n\nParagraph 7: A flyway is a flight path used by large numbers of birds while migrating between their breeding grounds and their overwintering quarters. Flyways generally span continents and often pass over oceans. Although applying to any species of migrating bird, the concept was first conceived and applied to waterfowl and shore birds. The flyways can be thought of as wide arterial highways to which the migratory routes of different species are tributaries. An alternative definition is that a flyway is the entire range of a migratory bird, encompassing both its breeding and non-breeding grounds, and the resting and feeding locations it uses while migrating. There are four major north–south flyways in North America and six covering Eurasia, Africa, and Australasia.\n\nParagraph 8: Magnus, son of Muirchertach Muimnech (from the Annals of Connacht), wrote in 1244: <blockquote>Fedlimid mac Cathail Chrobdeirg made an immense hosting eastwards into Brefne against O Raigillig, to avenge his fosterson and kinsman, Tadc O Conchobair. They encamped for a night at Fenagh. At that time there was no roof on the church of Fenagh, and the coarb was away that night. And as he was not present, the common soldiers of the host burned the huts and tents which were inside the church, without permission of their leaders, and the coarb's foster-child, God's gift, was suffocated. Now learned men relate that the coarb received this foster-child by finding him on a large stone which stood in that place, and [the people] never knew of his having either mother or father; and the coarb loved him and gave him, as it is said, milk from his own breasts. Next day he came to them in anger and indignation at the death of the boy, requiring O Conchobair to pay the blood-fine for his foster-child, and O Conchobair said he could choose what fine he pleased. 'I choose' said he 'the best man among you, as compensation for the child of God whom you have burnt.' 'That' said O Conchobair 'is Magnus, the son of Muirchertach Muimnech.' 'Nay, not so,' said Magnus 'but he who is leader of the host.' 'I will not go from you so' said the coarb 'until I get the fine for my foster-child.' After this the host departed from that place, and the coarb followed them to Ath na Cuirre on the Yellow River, which was flowing over its banks, so that they could not cross it till they broke up the spital-house of John the Baptist, which stood beside the ford,{{refn|group=n|Ath na Cuirre on the Yellow River and the spital-house of John the Baptist, which stood beside the ford' refer to Ballinamore|abbr=ath-an-cuirre-is-ballinamore}} and used its materials to bridge the river for the host to pass across. Magnus son of Muirchertach Muimnech and Conchobar son of Cormac Mac Diarmata went into the house, and Magnus spoke to a man who was above him, at work on the house-breaking; 'That' said he, pointing upwards with the chape of his sword, 'is the nail which keeps the house from falling.' As he spoke, a rafter(?) fell on his head and smashed it to pieces on the spot. He was buried outside the doorway of the church of Fenagh, and thrice the capacity of the Bell of the Kings of silver and thirty horses were given as an offering with him. Thus, then, did the coarb of St. Caillin at last recover compensation for his fosterling of God from them. A beautiful monument of carved stone with an excellently wrought stone cross was afterwards made [and set up] over him, but after a while the Ui Ruairc in their enmity demolished it.</blockquote>\n\nParagraph 9: Airline transport pilots (ATP) must be at least 18 years old and have a minimum of 1,500 hours of flight time, including 500 hours of cross-country flight time, 100 hours of night flying, and 75 hours in actual or simulated instrument flight conditions. ATPs must also have a commercial certificate and an instrument rating. ATPs may instruct other pilots in air transportation service in aircraft in which they are rated. ATPs must have a current Class I medical exam (which is more stringent than Class II or Class III), which must be renewed every six months or one year (depending on age). Like all pilots, they must re-validate their certificates every 24 months with a flight review but U.S. airlines require training at least once every 12 months, at which time a test is conducted that satisfies this bi-annual flight review.  After the 2009 crash of Colgan Air Flight 3407, Congress passed legislation, subsequently signed into law, requiring any pilot flying for a Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) Part 121 airline (all United States major airlines and their regional affiliates), that requires three or more pilots to include new-hire first officers, must have had at least an \"ATP certificate with restricted privileges\" license except if you were licensed after July 31, 2013, then you must have an ATP certificate.\n\nParagraph 10: Anticipating an Ottoman attack, the rebels asked for help from Transylvania and the Austrians. Rebel requirements were sent from Vršac and Zrenjanin, which points to that there were two independent centres of the rebels. In early June, Bathory summoned a meeting at Gyulafehérvár of his magnates regarding whether to support the Serb rebels; on 11 June the outcome was that they were not to break their subordinance to the Ottomans. The Transylvanian connection did however not stop; Đorđe Palotić stole armament which he sent to the rebels, and encouraged them to continue to fight; he subsequently promised that Báthory would soon appear to them. On 13 June from Vršac, Bishop Teodor, Ban Sava, and Velja Mironić promised, in the name of all their sipahi, knezes, and \"all of Serbdom\", to faithfully serve the Transylvanian ruler, in a letter to Mózes Székely, who held the frontier at that time. Meanwhile, the Zrenjanin group sought protection from the Viennese court, their envoy Đorđe Rac arrived at Hatvan on 10 June, meeting with general Teuffenbach, and then also Archduke Matthias at Esztergom. The Austrians sent two small detachments, one of which was killed off by Crimean Tatars on the way, while Transylvania's support came down to continued support in the form of officers and moral support. Meanwhile, the war on the front switched noticeably in the favour of the Ottomans. The arrival of Crimean Tatars led by Khan Ğazı II Giray forced the Christian armies to raise the sieges of Esztergom and Hatvan and retreat into Upper Hungary. This led the Grand Vizier Koca Sinan Pasha to devote attention to Banat. He appointed Mehmed Pasha, the Beylerbey of Anatolia, the commander of an army (consisting of troops from the eyalets of Anatolia and Karaman, and also 3,000 Janissaries) that was planned to deal with the rebels in Zrenjanin. As news arrived of spreading of the uprising in the Temeşvar (Timișoara) area, Mustafa Pasha, the Beylerbey of Temeşvar, was ordered to immediately head from Buda for Banat. No serious resistance was given by the rebels, defeated by 10 July 1594.\n\nParagraph 11: In his memorandum, \"The Irish Question in 1945\", addressed to the Secretary of State for the Dominions, Maffey expressed his view: \"To-day, after six years' detachment, Eire is more than ever a foreign country. It is so dominated by the National Catholic Church as to be almost a theocratic State. Gaelic is enforced in order to show that Eire is not one of the English-speaking nations; foreign games are frowned upon, the war censorship has been misapplied for anti-British purposes, anti-British feeling is fostered in school and by Church and State by a system of hereditary enemy indoctrination. There is probably more widespread anti-British sentiment in Eire to-day than ever before.\" Commenting on a recent attack by Churchill on de Valera, Maffey reported \"Nothing helped Mr. de Valera more than Mr. Churchill's personal attack.... The Irish are a very distinct race, and their marked characteristics persist strongly.... There still persist the dark Milesian strain, the tribal vendetta spirit, hatred and blarney, religious fanaticism, swift alternations between cruelty and laughter. A knowledge of the North-West Frontier tribes of India is a good introduction to an understanding of the Irish. They are both very remarkable and in many ways attractive people, with the same mental kinks. We were wise enough not to attempt to bring the Afridis under our direct rule.\" He continued \"Mr. de Valera is not himself a hater of England, as Mr. Frank Aiken, the Finance Minister, is.... There is very little of the Irishman in Mr. de Valera. He is trusted because of his austerity and his cold mathematical approach to Anglo-Irish problems. He understands the narrowness of the Irish mind and does not venture on to broader paths, though he might certainly have led his people out of spiritual bondage in 1941, when America came into the war.\"\n\nParagraph 12: Some jurisdictions including Bermuda, South Africa, China (in the case of Utility Models), Germany (in the case of Gebrauchsmusters (Utility Model)) and by option Spain, go one step further, in that an application is passed to issue and publication as an enforceable patent in short order, with no substantive examination. Questions of novelty and non-obviousness/inventive step are not reviewed until litigation may arise concerning the issues.  Obviously, such a patent does not carry the same presumption of validity as a patent that has been fully examined.  Such systems are known as \"invention registration\" regimes, and have the benefit of reduced costs, because applicants may postpone or completely forego the expensive process of examination for inventions that are of small or speculative value in the applicant's field of endeavor.  Another advantage is that a patent is granted relatively fast. A patent in South Africa, for example, is granted approximately 8 months after the date of filing, whereas in examining countries, it is highly unusual for a patent to be granted in less than 3 years.  At the same time, simply filing an application usually preserves the applicant's right to subsequently seek full examination and protection for his invention, if a competitor or a pirate is later discovered to infringe the invention.", "answers": ["Paragraph 6"], "length": 3910, "dataset": "passage_retrieval_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "738adf7528d9ff85f5bc4dfeaf51eefa1e5a3d98599496f4"}
{"input": "Movin' Out is a jukebox musical that premiered in 2002 and features the songs of Billy Joel. Created by Twyla Tharp, the musical follows a group of American youth growing up on Long Island in the 1960s and their experiences with the Vietnam War. The main characters are based on various Joel songs, and the show differs from traditional musicals as it primarily consists of dance numbers linked by a thin plot. The dancers do not sing, and instead, the vocals are performed by a pianist and band representing Billy Joel. This unique approach gives the show a rock ballet feel.", "context": "Paragraph 1: The story of how the tail section survivors cope during their first forty-eight days on the Island is shown in \"The Other 48 Days\". After landing in the ocean, Ana Lucia does her best to help everyone in need. That night, some of the survivors are kidnapped by the Others, the mysterious inhabitants of the Island, then a few nights later, nine more are taken. During the second raid, Ana Lucia kills one of the Others and finds a list on him, which has descriptions of the victims. Suspecting fellow survivor Nathan (Josh Randall) as a traitor, she moves everyone inland, digs a pit and throws him in it until he confesses. 4 nights later, Goodwin (Brett Cullen) tricks Nathan and kills him. The small group heads further inland, discovering a bunker known as the Arrow. Ana Lucia and Goodwin trek atop a hill, where she tells Goodwin she has worked out he is the real traitor. After a struggle, she impales him on a broken stick, then returns to the group and tells them they are safe. Fellow tail section survivors Libby (Cynthia Watros) and Cindy (Kimberley Joseph) bring Jin (Daniel Dae Kim) to her after discovering him washed up on shore. He breaks free, so Ana Lucia follows and finds Michael (Harold Perrineau) and Sawyer (Josh Holloway). Jin, Michael and Sawyer are thrown into the pit, and Ana Lucia follows, pretending to have also been captured. Once she believes they are fellow 815 survivors she releases them, and they travel to the camp of the other survivors. When they near the camp, Ana Lucia mistakes Shannon (Maggie Grace) for an Other and fatally shoots her. The on-island events of \"Collision\" show her guilt after Shannon's death. She has Shannon's lover Sayid (Naveen Andrews) tied up and refuses to let the group move on. After some reasoning from Libby, she reluctantly lets them go. She is invited into a bunker the fuselage survivors found to interrogate a man claiming to be Henry Gale (Michael Emerson), and manages to receive a map to his crashed balloon. She takes Sayid and Charlie (Dominic Monaghan) with her, and eventually discovers the crash site, and the body of the real Henry Gale. In her second centric episode, \"Two for the Road\", Ana Lucia attempts to speak to Henry again, but she is assaulted by him and nearly killed. Seeking revenge, she seduces Sawyer and steals his gun. She returns to the hatch and attempts to kill Henry, but is unable to bring herself to do it. She confides in Michael, who offers to kill him on her behalf.\n\nParagraph 2: Among the personalities who resisted the fusion of the Lutheran and Calvinist Churches was Rev. Friedrich Meischel, who arrived in South Australia in 1860.  He had earlier been in contact with Neuendettelsau's founder, Wilhelm Löhe, and is thought by some to have been inspired by him. After Stuart's epic overland crossing from Adelaide to what later became Darwin and back again in 1862, Meischel promoted the idea of missionary work among the inland tribes, in particular the Dieri, who had helped Burke and Wills after their ill-fated attempted crossing of the continent. Meischel's dealings were largely with Revs. Christian Auricht and G.J. Rechner of the Immanuel Synod, formed after a split between the first Lutheran clergy to come to Australia, Kavel and Fritsche. A mission supported by both the Immanuel and Australian Synods was duly set up at Killalpaninna on the Cooper's Creek north-east of Marree, staffed by personnel from Harms' mission school at Hermannsburg Mission in Germany. By the time of Strehlow's graduation, missionaries were recruited from Neuendettelsau after the Immanuel and Australian Synods decided they could no longer work together, and neither could work with Hermannsburg in Germany, which had aligned itself with the state church and become \"unionist\".  A staffing crisis in 1891, in part due to disagreements between the missionaries themselves, but also conflict with the state governments where Lutheran missions were operating, resulted in Deinzer being asked for a further missionary. Strehlow was as yet unplaced with an American congregation, so was approached to fill the position of teacher at Killalpaninna, which he duly accepted, arriving in South Australia on 30 May 1892 where he was ordained at Light Pass, South Australia., reaching the outstation Etadunna on 11 July 1892, and Killalpaninna itself a day or so after.  Being split between several sites, the mission settlements here were known collectively as Bethesda Mission and within six months of arrival at the mission Strehlow learnt Dieri.\n\nParagraph 3: the -t suffix is added to verbs in order to change the case of the verb. The allomorphs -t or -it are added to make a verb retaliative, meaning to do in retaliation for a previous action. For example, lata (meaning ‘kick’) adds the allomorph -it to become lat-it-o (meaning ‘kick back’). The allomorphs -t, -it or -ut  are added to a verb to make it reversive, meaning to do the opposite of the original verb. For example, taara (meaning ‘wind’) becomes taar-t-a (meaning ‘unwind’). The same allomorphs apply for the repetitive case, meaning the repeating of an action. There are no means of distinguishing between a reversive and a repetitious case other than by observing the context of the sentence. The allomorphs -t and -it are used to make a verb reflexive, which means to make the object of the action the same as the subject. For example, ndaara (meaning ‘look at’) becomes ndaar-t-o (meaning ‘look at oneself’). The allomorphs -t, -ut and -it are used to show that a verb is completed with intensity. For example, yana (meaning ‘fall’) becomes yan-t-a (meaning ‘fall heavily’). For words such as ‘yama (meaning ‘ask’), the intensive form becomes yam-t-a (meaning ‘interrogate’) which is also the same form the repetitive case (meaning ‘ask again’). Therefore, yam-t-a is either one of those cases and therefore cannot be distinguished without taking into account the context of the sentence it is used in.\n\nParagraph 4: After Pailan Arrows disbanded and before the 2013–14 season, Kotal signed with Mohun Bagan. He made his debut for the club on 23 October 2013 against Salgaocar. He came on as an 85th-minute substitute for Aiborlang Khongjee as Mohun Bagan won 2–1. Kotal scored his first goal for the club on 7 February 2015 against Pune. His 77th-minute goal was the only one in a 1–0 victory for Mohun Bagan. He scored his second goal of his career, and second of the season on 20 May against Royal Wahingdoh. His goal was the first of two as Mohun Bagan won 2–0. As well as by providing two goals, Kotal also helped Mohun Bagan to win their first ever I-League title, and thus Mohun Bagan became the first side from Kolkata to win the title, since the inception of league in 2007. Kotal played the 2015-16 I-League campaign, and played his first match of the season against Aizawl on 9 January 2016.  Kotal scored an own goal in that match, thereby Aizawl getting an equalizer. But after the final whistle, Mohun Bagan went on to win the match 3–1. Kotal played his first continental match on 27 January, when he played the East zone preliminary round 1 match of the 2016 AFC Champions League's qualifying play-off match against Tampines Rovers FC on 27 January 2016, which they won 3–1 after final whistle. Mohun Bagan after was redirected to 2016 AFC Cup, when they failed to make it to the group stages of the 2016 AFC Champions League. Kotal played his first AFC Cup match against South China AA on 9 March, where they won the match on a big margin of 0–4. Kotal later that season left the club on loan for his second spell at FC Pune City, and from there, he went on to play for Atletico de Kolkata in the 2016 ISL season. He returned to the club after winning the 2016 Indian Super League title with Atlético de Kolkata for the 2016-17 I-League season in early 2017. He scored his first goal for the club that season against Mumbai FC on 8 March 2017, where he opened the scored sheet in the 12th minute of the match, which concluded in a 2–2 draw after the final whistle. Kotal played his last match for the club against Chennai City FC on 30 April, which ended 2–1 with Mohun Bagan taking the three points of the match. Kotal then left the club to join Delhi Dynamos on a permanent deal.\n\nParagraph 5: Later Hermann von Helmholtz and Ewald Hering worked out the exact shape of the horopter almost at the same time. Their descriptions identified two components for the horopter for symmetrical fixation closer than infinity. The first is in the plane which contains the fixation point (wherever it is) and the two nodal points of the eye. Historically the geometric locus of horopteric points in this plane was taken to be a circle (the Vieth-Müller circle) going from one nodal point to the other in space and passing through the fixation point, until Howarth (2011)  noted that it was only the portion of the circle containing the fixation point that made the same angle at the two eyes.  The second component is a line (the Prévost–Burckhardt line) which is perpendicular to this arc in the median plane, cutting it at the point midway between the two eyes (which may, or may not, be the fixation point). This horopter geometry of an arc in the fixation plane and a perpendicular line remains approximately fixed relative to the eye centers as long as the eyes are fixating somewhere on these two lines. When the eyes are fixated anywhere off these two lines, the theoretical horopter takes the form of a twisted cubic passing through the fixation point and asymptoting to the two lines at their extremes. (Under no conditions does the horopter become either a cylinder through the Vieth-Müller circle or a torus centered on the nodal points of the two eyes, as is often popularly assumed.) If the eyes are fixating anywhere at infinity, the Vieth-Müller circle has infinite radius and the horopter becomes the two-dimensional plane through the two straight horopter lines.\n\nParagraph 6: Drew is captured by the Mendez-Ochoa Cartel. It's revealed Drew started the fire at Southfork but news arrives that Sue Ellen has taken responsibility for starting the fire. Drew learns that Nicolas has been using Elena to repay his debt to the Cartel and confronts Nicolas. Nicolas agrees when the Cartel kills Drew and disguises it as a suicide. Luis and Nicolas dispose of Drew's body on the oil field where his father died years ago. The detective and fire investigator later concluded that Drew committed suicide where he was the prime suspect of setting the fire. The fire investigator reveals Drew committed arson where he sprayed rocket fuel on a window curtain and used an IED to set the fire in the guise of a plug-in an air freshener. Elena and her mother confront the Ewings with the proof for J.R. stealing the oil-rich land that belonged to Elena's father. Nicolas’ plan to take over Ewing Global in the upcoming IPO for the Cartel moves forward. John Ross learns from Bum that Nicolas sent Pamela the video of John Ross and Emma having sex. In front of Elena, John Ross reveals to Nicolas that Elena only obtained J.R.'s letter because she had sex with John Ross. As Ewing Global goes public, the man in charge of the IPO, Calvin Hannah is removed from the IPO at the last minute and replaced with Nicolas' man. Hunter McKay buys all of the shares with money from the Mendez-Ochoa cartel on orders of Nicolas but Hunter is killed shortly afterward and Nicolas takes his shares in Ewing Global. It's revealed that Cliff gave Nicolas 3% of Ewing Global and combined with the 48% they acquired gives them control of Ewing Global. Christopher meets with Nicolas' wife Lucia and informs her that Nicolas and Elena are having an affair. She tells Nicolas that Christopher knows his real identity and his debt to the Cartel. It is revealed that Lucia hired the photographer to spy on Nicolas and Elena. Later after Lucia learns of Nicolas' affair with Elena, she again meets Christopher and agrees to help him find Nicolas. Nicolas confesses to Elena the truth about his past and that he used her to pay off his debt. Elena is angry that Nicolas used her but he warns her that until the Cartel has enough money to buy the next Mexican presidential election Nicolas, Elena, Lucia, and his sons are all in danger.\n\nParagraph 7: The 4 silver coins of Sinope in the 4th century BC century. located at the British Museum in London, all show the eagle with his head facing the right wing (as shown in the show we are publishing). The silver coins of Sinope in the 4th century BC, located in the Numismatic Museum in Athens, show the eagle looking to his right wing. In DH's book. Economet \"Pontus and his Dikaia in this Hellenism\", printed in Athens in 1920, and on page 146, the eagle of Sinopi's coin in the 4th century BC, has the eagle to look to his right feather. In David Talbot Rice's book \"The Church of Hagia Sophia at Trebizond\" published in 1968 in England, and on page 118, there is the full fresco painting of Emperor Manuel I who founded Hagia Sophia in Trebizond around 1250. This fresco, in normal size, was located in Hagia Sophia until 1850. Since then it has disappeared. In this fresco and the royal garments of the Emperor Manuel I there are over 15 eagles with their heads facing their right wing. All volumes of the Pontus archive have on the cover a coin of Sinope in the 4th century BC, showing the eagle's head tilted to the right of the wing. In 1961, titled \"1461–1961 Memory of Empire of Great Komnenos\" of the Pontian Studies Committee of Athens, the eagles are inclined to their right shoulders. The seal and the briefcases of the Pontian Studies Committee of Athens, since its foundation (1927), have the eagle facing the right wing. The Eagle of the Komnenoi of Trebizond at the Pontian Hero in Kallithea, Athens, looks towards its right wing.\n\nParagraph 8: The group's debut single \"Sailor Fuku o Nugasanai de\" was premiered on Yūyake Nyan Nyan on 3 June. Lead vocalists (hereinafter referred to as \"front vocals\") for the single were Eri Nitta (number 4), Miharu Nakajima (number 5), Satomi Fukunaga and Kazuko Utsumi (number 13). Released by Canyon Records on 5 July, the single debuted at number 34 on the Oricon's Japanese single chart (the national single chart) and peaked at number five in its sixth week of release in August. A day before the single's release date, a release and handshake event was scheduled at Sunshine City in Ikebukuro, Tokyo. The event was expected to have an attendance of about 500 people. However, over 4,000 people showed up at the site. As a result of reported injury and concerns over possible stampede, the event was canceled at the last minute before a scheduled start time. In the same month, the group's member Sonoko Kawai (number 12) made her appearance as a supporting character in the episodes 11 and 12 of Fuji TV's live-action TV series Sukeban Deka. Subsequently, it was announced on Yūyake Nyan Nyan that Kawai's first solo single would be released in September. The single \"Namida no Jasmine LOVE\" and its B-side \"Koi no Chapter A to Z\" were premiered on Yūyake Nyan Nyan on August 12 and August 19, respectively. The B-side features four Onyanko Club members as backing vocals: Sayuri Kokusho, Mika Nagoya (number 9), Mamiko Takai (number 16) and Sanae Jōnouchi (number 17). In late August, producers of the show Yūyake Nyan Nyan teamed up with producers of the live-action TV series Sukeban Deka and held a special audition on Yūyake Nyan Nyan to look for a new Onyanko Club member who would play a main character in a sequel to the TV series. The winner of the audition was Akie Yoshizawa, who was assigned number 25. A day before the release of Kawai's first single, a release event entitled \"Nyan Touch Love Party\" for the single was held at Yomiuri Land EAST in Inagi, Tokyo on August 31.\n\nParagraph 9: Matuszak was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, to Audrey and Marvin Matuszak. He had two brothers, but both died of cystic fibrosis at young ages. His one sister also had the disease. The family moved from downtown Milwaukee to Oak Creek, Wisconsin, where Matuszak's classmates ridiculed him as a gawky beanpole. Their disrespect motivated him to develop into a muscular young man, and he became the Wisconsin Class A state champion in the shot put with a throw of . Matuszak was always big for his age, which became an advantage as a defensive lineman in football. He attended Oak Creek High School.\n\nParagraph 10: The presence of metamorphic gneisses and schists lying apparently stratigraphically above sedimentary rocks of lower Paleozoic age in the Northwest Highlands had been known since the early 19th century, convincing Roderick Murchison that the change was a purely metamorphic effect and that the upper gneiss was younger than the sediments beneath. Initially he was supported in this interpretation by Archibald Geikie and James Nicol. After further fieldwork, Nicol changed his mind and advocated instead that the contact at the base of the upper gneisses was tectonic, starting what was known as the Highlands Controversy. A tectonic interpretation was supported by, amongst others, Charles Lapworth who had corresponded with Albert Heim on similar structures in the Alps. In 1883 and 1884 the survey geologists Ben Peach and John Horne were sent into the area by the survey's director Archibald Geikie to carry out detailed mapping. The results of the mapping proved conclusively to Peach and Horne that the contact was tectonic and they were eventually able to persuade Geikie when he visited them briefly in the field in October 1884. In November that year Peach and Horne's preliminary results were published and Geikie published a paper in the same issue of Nature in which he coined the term \"thrust-plane\" for these low-angle faults, although the term was probably already in use before then. By 1888 the term \"Moine Thrust\" was being used for the tectonic break at the base of Moine schists (what is now called the Moine Supergroup). The recognition of the Moine Thrust Belt in the early 1880s was a milestone in the history of geology as it was one of the first thrust belts discovered and where the importance of large scale horizontal rather than vertical movements became apparent. Detailed mapping of the Moine Thrust Belt by the survey continued for another two decades, culminating in the classic survey memoir The Geological Structure of the North-West Highlands of Scotland, published in 1907.\n\nParagraph 11: According to Robert Chambers, writing in 1824, Leith Walk, as its name suggests, was a gravel-surfaced footway, only opened to wheeled traffic after the completion of North Bridge in 1772. Before that Easter Road had been the route taken by coaches running between Edinburgh and Leith. The Edinburgh article in the Statistical Account of Scotland (1791–99) contains evidence from the publisher William Creech that coach traffic between Edinburgh and Leith increased from hourly to half-hourly between 1763 and 1783.Most of the area comprises tenement housing built for the artisan and working classes in the second half of the 19th century on mainly nursery ground feued on the south-eastern side by Baron Norton's Estate, (formerly belonging to the Logans of Restalrig), on the south-western side by the George Heriot's Trust and further north, on both sides of the road, Trinity Hospital. These tenements remain almost wholly intact, except at the northern, Leith end of the road where streets between Thorntree Street and Leith Central railway station were subject to slum clearance in the 1970s and replaced with new housing. The station has since been demolished and replaced by a supermarket and a leisure centre. New housing has also appeared since the 1970s in several locations on and just off Easter Road, for example opposite Thorntree Street, in Albion Road and in Brunswick Road. About a third of the road at the southern, London Road, end is the older retail area, comprising residential tenements with, at ground-floor level, small shops typical of a high street. There are a few corner shops and public houses on the northern two-thirds of the road particularly at the junction with Lorne Street. The southward view along the road focuses upon Salisbury Crags. Easter Road was the last major road in Scotland to be paved with granite setts replacing tarmac in 1955. After a fatality on the road in the late 1990s the road was re-tarmacked, saving the costly expense of maintaining the setts.\n\nParagraph 12: Movin' Out is a 2002 jukebox musical featuring the songs of Billy Joel. Conceived and created by Twyla Tharp, the musical tells the story of a generation of American youth growing up on Long Island during the 1960s and their experiences with the Vietnam War. The principal characters are drawn from those who appeared in various Joel tunes: high school sweethearts Brenda and Eddie (\"Scenes from an Italian Restaurant\"), James (\"James\"), Judy (\"Why Judy Why\"), and Tony (Anthony in \"Movin' Out\"). The show diverts from the traditional musical in that it essentially is a series of dances linked by a thin plot, and none of the dancers sing. Instead, all the vocals are performed by a pianist (the \"Piano Man\", representing Billy Joel) and band suspended on a platform above the stage while the dancers act out the songs' lyrics, basically making the show a rock ballet.\n\nParagraph 13: In 1971, Kenneth Macksey wrote that the 10th Army suffered   and  against a British loss of \"but forty men...and little equipment\". In 1993, Harold Raugh wrote of about  casualties against less than fifty British. In 1995, the writers of the informal German official history, Germany and the Second World War, noted that equipment losses for both sides had not been accurately tabulated. In 1997, Giorgio Bocca wrote that the Western Desert Force suffered casualties of forty men killed, ten tanks, eleven armoured cars and four lorries destroyed. In his 1999 MA thesis, Howard Christie wrote that from 9 to 16 September, the 10th Army suffered casualties of                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  killed and  Several tanks and lorries broke down and six aircraft were lost, two to accidents.\n\nParagraph 14:  Johar                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     ", "answers": ["Paragraph 12"], "length": 3883, "dataset": "passage_retrieval_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "0913c23df6327ee89b13d666f5fff0196a565240ce6e0bf4"}
{"input": "In 1985, the team formed by brothers Leo and Richard Jackson entered two cars in the Daytona 500, sponsored by U.S. Smokeless Tobacco. Both cars suffered engine failure, with Benny Parsons finishing 31st and his brother Phil finishing 29th. Phil ran in 14 races that year, posting three top 10 finishes, while Benny had six top 10 finishes in his 14 races. In 1986, Benny had four top 10 finishes and won the team's first pole position, while Phil had five top 10 finishes.

John Samson, is about to record a video message to his friend Mark Caramat, who is also a theater actor. However, John has been diagnosed with cancer and has only one to two years to live. He tried several treatments, but to no avail. When John told Mark about his condition, he became devastated. John then suggests to fake his death and have a played wake and funeral. Mark refused to help him, but in the end he decided to help him. The plan is that John and Mark would go on a vacation in a resort. On the night of the vacation, John would die in his sleep. But, they would use a dead body to look like John really died. He doesn't want to be buried, but to be cremated. But he doesn't want his ashes to be buried, but rather scatter his ashes in the sea. In the wake, he wanted to have a different funeral decorations daily. As John's condition worsen, they decided to go with their plan. He also told Mark that when he dies, he will give to him his laundromat business and water refilling station. At the day 1 of his mock wake, John disguised himself as Yolly Redgrave, a transgender woman. In his wake, different people gave their eulogies to John. On the second day, John's older sister Mary came unexpectedly. She attempted to open the casket, but Mark tried to stop her until he fainted. They decided to lock the casket to prevent it from opening. On the third day, John's bestfriend Luke came and said his eulogy. He said that he's thankful to John because he'd became a good friend to him. As a reward, John gave Mark a trip for two to Maldives. On the fourth and final day, Mark gave his eulogy to John. Joseph, visits the wake. Joseph met Mark at a bathhouse. But it was raided and he sought help of John. John then met Joseph. Six months after, Joseph and Mark broke up. There, Joseph told Mark that he and John had an affair. But, John broke up with him because he didn't want to hurt his friend. Because of what happened, their friendship ended.

This left John devastated and mourning. Mary and John who is disguised as Yolly visit the wake of Mark. She then gave a video message for Mark. The message is a farewell message of John to Mark. \n\nParagraph 2: In the Neolithic period Epirus was populated by seafarers along the coast and by shepherds and hunters from the southwestern Balkans who brought with them the Proto-Greek language. These people buried their leaders in large mounds containing shaft graves. Similar burial chambers were subsequently used by the Mycenaean civilization, suggesting that the founders of Mycenae may have come from Epirus and central Albania. Epirus itself remained culturally backward during this time, but Mycenaean remains have been found at two religious shrines of great antiquity in the region: the Oracle of the Dead on the Acheron River, familiar to the heroes of Homer's Odyssey, and the Oracle of Zeus at Dodona, to whom Achilles prayed in the Iliad.\n\nParagraph 3: Frank Carden (Morgan Freeman) is a professional assassin who has been hired to kill a reclusive billionaire named Lydell Hammond, Sr., a vocal opponent of stem cell research. Carden's plan goes awry when he gets injured in a car accident and ends up in the hospital. When hospital staff see his gun, they call the police. They are able to peel away his false identity and federal marshals are called in to pick him up. Widower Ray Keene (John Cusack), a high school gym teacher, ex-cop and well-intentioned but not very able dad to Chris (Jamie Anderson), belatedly realizes the need to bond with his son when the latter gets caught smoking marijuana and takes him hiking in the wilderness. Carden is being driven through that same wilderness by the marshals but his men stage a rescue attempt. The car is crashed and most of the marshals end up dead. The surviving marshal asks Keene to take the prisoner to the authorities and then dies of his injuries. Ray and Chris have to get Carden out of the wilderness and hand him over to the authorities. Carden's men, highly skilled ex-military thugs, track them down to rescue Carden and kill the Keenes.  The pursuit brings a couple, Sandra and Lochlan (Megan Dodds and Ryan McCluskey) into the crossfire, with Lochlan being killed by Carden's men.  In a tense standoff in a cabin in the woods, Carden's friends turn up and Keene agrees to let Carden go. Just at that moment, one of Carden's thugs bursts in and punches Chris, causing Keene to panic and kill him, while Sandra shoots the other as he enters firing. Carden escapes, taking Chris as a hostage, while Sandra and Keene are rescued by the local police. Miles (Alice Krige), Carden's mission handler, tells Davis (Corey Johnson), Carden's recent recruit, to kill Carden and Chris and to make it look like Carden did it. She also tells him to kill Keene in case Carden told him anything about his job. Feeling defeated and resting at home, a televised news report echoes an earlier conversation about Carden's job description with the key phrase \"exterminating obstacles to progress\" which makes Keene aware of Carden's intended target. Keene heads to the funeral of Hammond, Jr., to intercept Carden inadvertently saving Carden from Davis. Carden gets the upper hand on Davis, killing him with his own sniper rifle. However, the battle forces Carden to miss his own window of opportunity to assassinate Hammond, Sr. Carden relents in giving Keene a set of keys to a hotel room where Carden locked up Chris, letting father and son reunite while he disappears. In Washington, D.C., Carden intercepts Miles, aware of her role in hiring Davis to kill him. Carden threatens to \"come after her\" if any harm were to come to the Keene family. Two weeks after the incident, Keene enters into a relationship with Sandra and holds a family barbecue, expressing disbelief in hearing a radio news report about Hammond, Sr., dying in a \"boating accident\", realizing that Carden finished his contract killing.\n\nParagraph 4: Local groups in Calontir, as in other SCA kingdoms, host local and kingdom-level events throughout the year, which include SCA combat tournaments, Arts and Sciences competitions, seasonal feasts, etc. The Kingdom of Calontir annually hosts the War of the Lilies, a nine-day camping event each June, which in recent years has attracted about a thousand SCA members for combat and other activities. The first Lilies War was held in 1987 at Perry Lake in Kansas.  Since 1992, the event has been held at Smithville Lake in Missouri. Unlike most SCA wars, which exploit inter-kingdom rivalries, Lilies War is a themed event, the contending groups based upon the theme of the year. According to the Lilies War Committee charter, \"the theme may not place the Kingdom of Calontir against another group\".  Some of the events that take place are armored combat, archery, Arts and Sciences demonstrations and competitions, classes, feasting, games, youth activities, and shopping in the period markets and food court. Kingdom-level events in Calontir include the Kingdom Arts and Sciences Competition, the Queen's Prize Arts and Sciences Tournament, various symposia (Clothier's Seminar, Cooking Symposium, etc.), and combat tournaments such as the semi-annual Crown Tournament (which decide the future heirs to the crown).\n\nParagraph 5: On July 19, 2019, Caslen was selected as the 29th president of the University of South Carolina. He was initially among a group of four finalists for the position. While Caslen was reported to be the front-runner, there was significant controversy about his nomination, given that he does not possess an earned doctorate and because of comments made during open campus sessions regarding binge drinking and sexual assault; among faculty and students, 82% opposed Caslen's candidacy. It was later discovered by the Post and Courier that Mr. Caslen's name was added to the finalist list only after the intervention of the Chairman of the Board of Trustees as Caslen was not originally a finalist or an agreed upon alternate nominated by the presidential search committee. On April 26, the university Board of Trustees decided to reopen the search. Caslen sent a letter to the Board withdrawing himself from consideration in the new search, stating, \"“I am sorry that my record and my reputation had caused such a clamor at your university and were so polarizing to your faculty and student body . . . If I had known the environment of your campus, I would have withdrawn my nomination right away.\". However, it was revealed on July 8, that South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster was urging members of the board to meet by the end of the week to vote on Caslen's candidacy for president. This caused more controversy, with the university's faculty senate unanimously passing motions to formally criticize the lack of transparency in the search process and to issue a vote of no confidence in Caslen to lead the university. Several alumni and donors also opposed the intervention of the governor in the presidential search; notably businesswoman Darla Moore, writing as \"the largest donor to the university and the namesake of one of the largest schools,\" urged the board to abide by the April 26 decision to continue the search. and the SACS Commission on Colleges opening an inquiry into the search to determine if there was undue outside influence. One trustee, Egerton Burroughs, believed that the opposition to Caslen was entirely political, stating, without evidence, \"A lot of the people that are demonstrating are from out of town. I heard some of that Kamala Harris crowd is there … got this thing all tied into the Democratic primary,\" though Burroughs was unaware his comments were being broadcast. Despite the opposition of faculty and students, on July 19, Caslen was elected as the 29th president of the University by the Board of Trustees by a vote of 11–8, with one member voting \"present\".\n\nParagraph 6: The son of Shoshenq I and his chief consort Karomat A, Osorkon I was the second king of ancient Egypt's 22nd Dynasty and ruled around 922 BC – 887 BC. He succeeded his father Shoshenq I, who probably died within a year of his successful 923 BC campaign against the Pilistines and the kingdom of Israel. Osorkon I's reign is known for many temple building projects and was a long and prosperous period of Egypt's history. His highest known date is a \"Year 33\" date found on the bandage of Nakhtefmut's mummy, which held a menat-tab necklace inscribed with Osorkon I's nomen and prenomen: Osorkon Sekhemkheperre. This date can only belong to Osorkon I since no other early Dynasty 22 king ruled for close to 30 years until Osorkon II. Other mummy linens, which belong to his reign, include three separate bandages dating to his regnal years 11, 12, and 23 on the mummy of Khonsmaakheru in Berlin. The bandages are anonymously dated but definitely belong to his reign because Khonsmaakheru wore leather bands that contained a menat-tab naming Osorkon I. Secondly, no other king who ruled around Osorkon I's reign had a 23rd regnal year including Shoshenq I who died just before the beginning of his 22nd.\n\nParagraph 7: The team was formed in 1985 by brothers Leo and Richard Jackson. At the Daytona 500 that year, the team entered the No. 55 and No. 66 cars, sponsored by U.S. Smokeless Tobacco through its Copenhagen and Skoal brands and driven by another pair of brothers, Benny Parsons and his brother Phil. Benny finished 31st and Phil finished 29th, both suffering engine failure. Phil ran fourteen races with the team that year and posted three top 10s while splitting time with another ride, and Benny ran fourteen races as well and had six top 10 finishes running a limited schedule. The two returned for 1986, when BP had four top tens and won the team's first pole position. Phil ran a limited schedule himself and had five top-tens. After Benny left at the end of the year, his brother moved from the No. 66 to the No. 55. In his first year with the No. 55, Phil Parsons finished a then career-high fourth at Martinsville and finished 14th in points. The No. 66 ran only one race that year, with IndyCar driver Tom Sneva running at Daytona before dropping out with engine failure. In 1988, Parsons improved to a ninth-place finish in points, with the highlight of his year coming with his victory at the Winston 500 despite running out of fuel earlier in the race. In 1989 the team returned to a two-car operation, signing Harry Gant away from Mach 1 Racing with the Skoal sponsorship coming with him. The Jacksons also traded numbers with Mach 1 owner Hal Needham and ran the No. 33 alongside the No. 55. Gant won early in the season at Darlington Speedway and finished seventh in points, while Parsons, despite additional sponsorship from Crown Petroleum, only had three top-tens and dropped to 21st in points. At the end of the year, Parsons left for Morgan-McClure Motorsports.\n\nParagraph 8: Shinoda later opened an independent design firm and did work for GM, Ford, and aftermarket companies. In 1985, he was competing with an American Motors Corporation (AMC) internal team, and two fellow contractors (Giorgetto Giugiaro and Alain Clénet) to style a planned vehicle then known as XJC, which later became the Jeep ZJ (Jeep Grand Cherokee) after Chrysler's buyout of AMC in 1987. The contract included creating designs for four different versions of the vehicle (a 4-door, 2-door, and two pickup trucks). Under the terms of the contract, Shinoda was to be paid $354,000, but AMC only paid $135,000. According to Shinoda, AMC product design executives entered his rented design studio without him and said his \"design was 'terrible, brutal; they ordered him to destroy the clay model and return AMC's wheels and tires. However, the next day, AMC sent a crew of workers to the design studio to confiscate his drawings and wood templates, and Shinoda was later told privately that AMC was proceeding with his design. Under a non-disclosure agreement, he was not allowed to speak publicly about the contract for five years and did not protest the theft of his design until 1992, when the Grand Cherokee made its debut at Cobo Hall. Shortly before his death in 1997, Chrysler, the successor of AMC, settled with Shinoda for more than $200,000. \n\nParagraph 9: In 1875, banknotes were issued by the National Bank of Haiti in denominations of 25c, 1 and 5 piastres (equal to the gourde). Following this, banknotes were issued in denominations ranging from 10c to G 5 by the various Haitian governments until 1916, when the National Bank of the Republic of Haiti (BNRH) began issuing notes. In 1920, G 1, G 2, G 5, G 10 and G 20 notes were issued, with G 50 and G 100 added in 1925. In the 1970s, G 25, G 250, and G 500 notes were introduced. In 1979, the Bank of the Republic of Haiti replaced the BNRH as the paper money issuing body. A 1,000 gourde note was introduced in 1999, to commemorate the 250th anniversary of the founding of Port-au-Prince. A G 20 note was released into circulation in 2001, both as a commemorative (to celebrate the bicentennial of the Constitution of Toussaint L'Ouverture) and as a regular issue. In 2004, the Bank of the Republic of Haiti issued a series of notes to commemorate the bicentennial of Haiti.\n\nParagraph 10: The value of audio commentaries as a marketing tool was revealed during the heyday of Laserdisc, the laser-based video format produced before the introduction of DVDs. The Criterion Collection company, for example, produced high-quality \"deluxe\" editions of classic films on Laserdisc, using the best available prints and re-edited versions. These were often very expensive compared to today's DVDs and included bonus material such as trailers, deleted scenes, production stills, behind-the-scenes information, and audio commentaries from the directors, producers, cast, cinematographers, editors, and production designers. They were marketed to movie professionals, fans and scholars who were seen as an elite niche of consumers who could afford to pay more for definitive, quality editions. The audio commentaries on laserdiscs were typically encoded on secondary analog tracks which had become redundant, as modern Laserdiscs had stereo audio encoded digitally alongside. This is why certain older videodisc players, which pre-date the digital audio standard, are only able to play back analog tracks with audio commentary.", "answers": ["Paragraph 7"], "length": 3095, "dataset": "passage_retrieval_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "be1a0259ffec8e9179a935bc326d893db1ceacc80042b881"}

Fredrick Brennan, founder of the online community 8chan, wrote an article on The Daily Stormer encouraging eugenics, based on his own experiences of having brittle bone disease. Florida-based Jewish troll Joshua Ryne Goldberg, who encouraged a 2015 attack on a free speech exhibition in Garland, Texas, under the alias of a Muslim extremist, wrote white supremacist articles for The Daily Stormer under the pseudonym Michael Slay. The Daily Stormer accepts freelance work and pays $14.88 (a reference to David Lane's Fourteen Words and the Nazi slogan \"Heil Hitler\") per article. The second-most prolific writer on the website goes by the pseudonym \"Zeiger\" and was unmasked in 2018 by the Montreal Gazette as Gabriel Sohier Chaput, an IT consultant from Rosemont–La Petite-Patrie, Quebec. Gabriel Sohier-Chaput was also a member of the now-defunct neo-Nazi online forum Iron March and was a supporter of the terrorist organization Atomwaffen Division writing articles promoting the group. In January 2023, Sohier-Chaput was found guilty of criminally promoting hatred against Jews as a result of an article he wrote for the site in 2017, an offense that could result in a sentence of up to two years in prison. Another notable prolific writer was Robert Warren \"Azzmador\" Ray, an East Texas-based neo-Nazi who gained national prominence from an appearance on a Vice News documentary by Elle Reeve about the Charlottesville riots where he complained that Charlottesville was run by \"Jewish communists and criminal niggers\". Ray is also the creator of The Krypto Report, the main podcast show of the Daily Stormer. A more recently-known associate/member of The Daily Stormer was Daniel Kenneth Jeffries from Granbury, Texas who goes by the nickname of \"Grandpa Lampshade\" (a reference to the World War II rumour that the Nazis made lampshades out of executed Holocaust prisoners) and hosts the \"Thoughts on the Day\" segment on the United Kingdom-based neo-Nazi radio network Radio Aryan founded by Steve \"Sven Longshanks\" Stone, Laurence \"Max Musson\" Nunn, and Jeremiah \"Jez\" Bedford-Turner of which the radio is prominently featured on The Daily Stormer.

Afterwards, the vehicles hit the first launch which accelerates from 0 to  in 1.2 seconds. It moves through an s-curve slope and makes a right turn and hit the second launch, accelerating from  to  in 1.5 seconds. Hagrid says he will meet up with the Muggles at an abandoned hut at the edge of the Forbidden Forest. Once the bikes reach Hagrid's hut, a Blast-Ended Skrewt sprays smoke at the riders as the giant himself tells them they'll pick up the rest of the lesson later. The vehicles exit the hut by turning right, which leads into the third launch from 0 to  in 3.5 seconds. The vehicles head up an airtime hill, passing by the abandoned castle and making a left-handed dive into a tunnel. Following a series of turns, The vehicles  approach the fourth launch, accelerating from  to  in 2.3 seconds. While going through a double right turn, Hagrid warns that the bikes are out of his control and are flying into the Forbidden Forest. The vehicles then make a right turn and slow down on the mid-course brake run. Fluffy, the three-headed dog can be found on the left side. The vehicle turns left past a switchtrack and accelerate from  to  in 2.1 seconds. They speed into a tunnel with a group of Cornish Pixies that have taken over Arthur Weasley's broken-down flying Ford Anglia on top. After the tunnel, they rise up a  tall 70-degree vertical spike before losing power and dropping backwards. Now accelerating from  to  in 1.7 seconds, It speeds through another tunnel and a helix. The vehicles slow down into the darkest part of the Forbidden Forest as the Muggles pass a centaur, stopping in the tentacles of Devil's Snare. Hagrid encourages Muggles to say the incantation \"Lumos Solem\" and then free-fall  into a cave filled with glowing Blast-Ended Skrewts around riders, which Hagrid congratulates for finding them. The vehicles exit the building and approach the final launch, accelerating from 0 to  in 4 seconds. During this launch, Muggles are told to push the button in front of them to expel dragon fire-breath. Fog effects begin to appear in a straight line near the tracks. The vehicles hit a left banked turn and pass the on-ride camera, which takes photos of the guests. After this, the vehicles make a right turn before stopping at the abandoned castle, where a unicorn and her baby are spotted, thus ending the ride. As the vehicles slow down into the unloading area, Hagrid thanks and asks them not to tell anyone at Hogwarts about the experience.\n\nParagraph 7: \"Much of Cleary Gottlieb's success in sovereign debt,\" according to Reuters, \"is based on the work of partner Lee Buchheit, who has led restructuring negotiations for 20 countries.\" Buchheit’s \"academic papers, books and legal briefs over the past three decades fill much of the void where no formal law exists.\" For example, in 2002, \"Buchheit developed a collective action clause, which says that if a supermajority of bondholders votes in favor of a restructuring, it becomes legally binding for everyone, even for those who voted against it.\" Buchheit was a lead author of a 2013 Brookings committee report that proposed changes in the approach to sovereign debt, including the collective action clause.\n\nParagraph 8: Although most of the Palestinian guerrillas were expelled during the 1982 Israeli invasion, Palestinian militias began to regain their footing after the Israeli withdrawal from first Beirut, then Sidon and Tyre. Syria viewed this revival with some anxiety: though in the same ideological camp, Damascus had little control over most Palestinians organizations and was afraid that the build-up of Palestinian forces could lead to a new Israeli invasion. In Lebanon, Shia–Palestinian relations had been very tense since the late 1960s. After the multinational force withdrew from Beirut in February 1984, Amal and the PSP took control of west Beirut and Amal built a number of outposts around the camps (in Beirut but also in the south). On April 15, 1985, Amal and the PSP attacked Al-Murabitun, the main Lebanese Sunni militia and the closest ally of the PLO in Lebanon. Al-Murabitun were vanquished and their leader, Ibrahim Kulaylat was sent into exile. On May 19, 1985, heavy fighting erupted between Amal and the Palestinians for the control of the Sabra, Shatila and Burj el-Barajneh camps (all in Beirut). On May 28, 1985, Amal suffered a suicide attack by four young female Palestinian suicide bombers in Shatila. Despite its efforts, Amal could not take the control of the camps. The death toll remains unknown, with estimates ranging from a few hundreds to a few thousands. This and heavy Arab pressure led to a cease-fire on June 17.\n\nParagraph 9: Agri-Mark dates back to 1916 with the formation of its predecessor, the New England Milk Producers Association. The cooperative flourished during the twentieth century and in 1980 became Agri-Mark. A dozen years later Agri-Mark merged with Cabot Creamery Cooperative, thereby ensuring that Northeast dairy farmers would continue their ownership of a valuable, time-honored consumer brand -- Cabot. Naturally aged Vermont cheddar cheese and fresh creamery butter top the list of Cabot's best known products. In 2003, Agri-Mark merged with the Chateaugay Cooperative in Upstate New York and acquired the assets of McCadam Cheese, including a plant located in Chateaugay. McCadam manufactures award-winning New York Cheddar, Muenster and European-type cheeses.\n\nParagraph 10: On this occasion was slain O'Shaughnessy, i.e. John, the son of Gilla-Duv, son of Dermot, son of William, who had been banished from his patrimony, as indeed had been all those plunderers who were along with the sons of John Burke. John Oge, the son of John Burke, was taken prisoner, and conveyed to Kilkenny, to be confined. Redmond Burke, and William, together with a party of their people, escaped from this affray; and they went from thence into Ely, but they did not remain long in that territory, when they proceeded into Ulster, leaving the castles which until then they had possessed in East Munster under slender guard. On their arrival among the Irish of the North, namely, O'Neill and O'Donnell, Redmond proceeded to hire soldiers, to march into Clanrickard; and, as soon as he had mustered a sufficient number of these, he led them, during the first days of spring, across the Erne, and passed along the borders of Breifny O'Rourke, through the counties of Sligo and Roscommon, and across the River Suck, into Clann-Conway. He made a prisoner of the lord of this territory, namely, Mac David (Fiach, son of Hubert Boy, son of William, son of Thomas); and he afterwards proceeded to Tuath-an-Chalaidh, in the upper part of Hy-Many, in the county of Galway. When the Earl of Clanrickard, i.e. Ulick Burke, heard of this thing, he went to the eastern extremity of his country, to await and watch Redmond; but, notwithstanding all his vigilance, Redmond, on the thirteenth night of the month of March, without being heard or noticed by the Earl or his sentinels, passed by them into Clanrickard, until he arrived in the district of Kinel-Feichin, in the south of the barony of Leitrim, in the county of Galway. Towards the end of that night, and by the dawning of day, Redmond sent forth his marauding parties through every town of that district, from Magh-glass to Crannog-Meg-Cnaimhin, and from Coill-bhreac to the mountain; and before the noon of that day Redmond had in his power the greater part of the property, and all the moveable effects, of that territory. He afterwards went to take up his abode in the woods situated in the upper part of that district, and continued for four or five days moving about in this manner, plundering his neighbours, and strengthening the ramparts around himself, until the Earl of Clanrickard, accompanied by all the troops he had been able to muster in the district, arrived, and pitched his camp at the monastery of Kinel-Fheichin. Thus they remained for four or five days, during which time some persons not illustrious were slain between them, until Teige, the son of Brian-na-Murtha, son of Brian Ballagh, son of Owen O'Rourke, arrived with bold companies of sharp-armed soldiers to assist Redmond. When these two parties combined overtook the Earl, he left the camp in which he was, and proceeded through the passes into Clanrickard. The others pursued him to Loughrea; and, the Earl and his people escaping from them on this occasion, they traversed, plundered, and burned the country from Leitrim to Ard-Maeldubhain and as far as the gate of Feadán, in the west of Kinelea. At this time they lost a Munster lord of a territory, i.e. MacDonough, i.e. Donough, the son of Cormac Oge, son of Cormac. What brought him on this expedition was this, he had been carried off as a hostage by O'Neill in the spring of the preceding year, and had remained in Ulster until having regained his liberty he set out with those sons of John Burke, and so fell in this war of the Clann-William.", "answers": ["Paragraph 3"], "length": 3208, "dataset": "passage_retrieval_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "78824d6a6e98a0e1e2ae5e37b4e333652aefacc1b13098c0"}
{"input": "The German East Africa Company, also known as DOAG, was a colonial organization that played a significant role in the establishment of German East Africa, which encompassed modern-day Tanzania, Burundi, and Rwanda. Originally founded in 1884 as the Society for German Colonisation, the company aimed to engage in trade within Africa. It obtained a separate German sphere of influence in Wituland, within present-day Kenya, in 1885. The company leased a coastal strip opposite Zanzibar from Sultan Khalifa bin Said for 50 years, but its attempt to take over administration led to a revolt along the coast of Tanzania. With the assistance of the German navy, the company managed to maintain control of Dar es Salaam and Bagamoyo, but in 1889, it had to seek help from the German government to suppress the rebellion. Unable to effectively govern its dominions, the company sold out to the German government in 1891, which then assumed direct rule over German East Africa. The company continued to operate various activities, such as mines, plantations, railways, banking, and minting, until it relinquished them to the German colonial administration and other organizations. During World War I, British forces occupied German East Africa, bringing an end to the operations of the German East Africa Company.", "context": "Paragraph 1: Levy's philanthropy began in the 1950s, when he established the Jerome Levy Foundation, which still exists, giving grants to human rights and land preservation organizations. His donations grew steadily, and during his lifetime, Levy and his wife, Shelby White, gave away more than $200 million, becoming well known for their philanthropic efforts. They donated $20 million to the Metropolitan Museum of Art for the construction of the Leon Levy and Shelby White Court, a gallery hosting the largest selection of Hellenistic and Roman artwork ever exhibited at that museum. The gallery included a number of pieces from Levy and White's substantial art collection, which also includes art from the Near East. Between 1997 and 2003, Levy and White donated nearly $5 million to 107 scholars for the publication of archaeological excavations that had been completed but never published. The projects funded by their program, the Shelby White-Leon Levy Program for Archaeological Publications, include excavations at some of the highest profile archaeological sites throughout Greece and the Middle East, including Knossos, Aphrodisias, Kition, Ras Shamra, Sarepta, Mount Gerizim, Ekron, Lachish, Megiddo, Jerusalem, Pella, Jerash, the Dead Sea Scrolls, Assur, Nineveh, Nuzi, and Tepe Hissar.\n\nParagraph 2: The German East Africa Company (, abbreviated DOAG) was a chartered colonial organization which brought about the establishment of German East Africa, a territory which eventually comprised the areas of modern Tanzania, Burundi, and Rwanda. The company originated in 1884 as the  (Society for German Colonisation) with the aim of trading in Africa. The German protectorate of Wituland (within modern Kenya) originated as a separate German sphere of influence in 1885. In April of the same year, the company leased the coastal strip opposite Zanzibar from Sultan Khalifa bin Said for 50 years. Its attempt to take over the administration led to a general revolt along the coast of what is now Tanzania. The company could only hold Dar es Salaam and Bagamoyo with the help of the German navy. In 1889 it had to request the assistance of the German government to put down the rebellion. In 1891, after it became apparent that the company could not handle its dominions, it sold out to the German government, which began to rule German East Africa directly. The company initially continued to operate its many activities, including mines, plantations, railways, banking, minting, etc., before it consented to relinquish them to the German colonial administration and other organizations. It subsequently operated as a land company within the German territory until Britain occupied German East Africa during World War I.\n\nParagraph 3: On October 25, 2017, Robinson released a new single titled \"Eon Break\" under the alias Virtual Self, announced via his Twitter page. A music video was also released on Robinson's YouTube channel, containing abstract three-dimensional art and cryptic messages seemingly focusing on the words \"angel\", \"virtual\", \"void\", and \"utopia\". His follow up single was released on November 8, 2017, which is titled \"Ghost Voices\". An accompanying music video for the track was released on February 28, 2018, via Robinson's YouTube channel. In January 2019, it was announced that \"Ghost Voices\" was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Dance Recording, marking Robinson's first nomination. Robinson celebrated the accomplishment by playing three Virtual Self sets in Los Angeles before the awards ceremony. In a statement to Billboard Dance, Robinson says he discovered the nomination through Twitter \"of all places\". At the time, he hadn't even realized \"Ghost Voices\" was submitted for consideration.Virtual Self released a self-titled EP on November 29, 2017. He held a debut live performance on December 8, 2017, in Brooklyn, New York City. Virtual Self shows continued in 2018, with appearances at multiple festivals including Ultra Music Festival, Electric Daisy Carnival, and Bonnaroo, followed by three Europe shows and a two-month North American \"UTOPiA SySTEM\" tour. Robinson also released \"Angel Voices\" on July 20, 2018, a happy-hardcore infused remix of \"Ghost Voices\". On March 4, 2019, Robinson announced Multiverse Music Festival, a one-day festival in Oakland, California featuring a self-curated lineup and co-presented by Goldenvoice, slated for June 15 in Middle Harbor Shoreline Park. The name of the festival was changed to Second Sky Music Festival four days later due to complaints from local promoters that had organized a fest in Oakland with a similar name the previous year. A second day was added during presale due to tickets for the original date selling out rapidly, sharing all but one act from the first day's lineup. Robinson stated in an interview with Pollstar that \"The main reason I wanted to do an artist-curated festival is I have this fantasy of there being a place where all of my favorite music can coexist.\" Shortly after announcing Second Sky's lineup, Robinson announced another Virtual Self show, a series of six DJ sets under his own name, and later, two more Virtual Self appearances. In June 2019, Robinson's organization, The Robinson Malawi Fund, donated $154,000 to patients with Burkitt Lymphoma in Malawi using money raised by the Second Sky Music Festival and matched donations from Robinson.  Robinson, in June 2019, started the Robinson Malawi Fund after his brother Mark beat cancer. On May 9, 2020, Robinson teamed up with the Recording Academy, donated $115,000 to MusiCares COVID-19 Relief Fund using money raised by the Secret Sky Online Music Festival. During the event, he unveiled a new song from his upcoming album, \"Look at the Sky\". The song was later announced to be the fourth single from Nurture.\n\nParagraph 4: Nakahara's concept for the Biennale can be understood through his formulation of the museum as a ‘matrix’. The matrix was a place or a situation for man's encounter with art, or matter, rather than just being a nondescript space that surrounds the artwork. The matrix was not neutral, and should be regarded integral aspect of the relationship between man and matter. This is best evidenced through Nakahara's essay in the exhibition catalogue: As opposed to the work’s basic quality as something closed in and as a totality of form and density, ‘stressing’ the relationship between human and matter, or works as something to be ‘experienced,’ these emphasize circumstance, placement, place, distribution, process, and time. These are necessary in order to produce a situation where humans and matter come in contact. And these are not works that participants simply make in their studios and exhibit it, but directly scout the area and produce work based on what they see. Location too is no longer something abstract but an undeniable ingredient in this contact of human and matter. This is further explicated by Nakahara's commentary on the Biennale in Bijutsu Techô after its initial showing, focusing specifically on the concept of a life space that does not privilege the art object as sacrosanct material. It is widely known that a phenomenon that appears to be an integration of art and life became conspicuous in the works exhibited in museum spaces. In other words, by making the non-everyday space of the museum more everyday-like, they let the alienation of “space” happen. . . . I have repeatedly talked about the shift from the work as “thing (mono)” to the work as “space.” Instead of regarding a work-as-object as something that transcends the [surrounding] space, what I have suggested is equating objects with space and granting significance to the relationships between objects and space. Our real lives are like that. In the life space (seikatsu kûkan) in which we live, it is not that various objects exist transcendentally. Our life space where we act exists as their aggregate. In this sense, one can say that the work as “space” is the same as life space in their “structures.” Kenichi Yoshida has even characterised Nakahara's concept of the matrix to bear affinities to the notion of the total work of art, which could be reflected by how the organizers tracked the process of putting the exhibit together through their own paper documentation. Minemura recorded the trials of the exhibit, as the museum resisted certain works of art because of the space and how some works were refused due the museum’s reluctance to accommodate the request. Since Mainichi's international biennials was usually accompanied by two volumes of catalogue, one for the introduction of artists, the other for the documentation of the exhibited work, Minemura took advantage of it by publishing  process documentation and the final installed exhibition. In the first volume, each artist was given free rein to include as many biographical details and images within their assigned pages, resulting in a broad spectrum of plans (be it in actual diagrams, manifestos, inspiration images, sketches and renderings, xerox scans, etc). These details of the construction of the exhibition are meant to be as critically considered as the presence of the artworks in the space themselves.\n\nParagraph 5: The book is set in the huge castle of Gormenghast, a vast landscape of crumbling towers and ivy-filled quadrangles that has for centuries been the hereditary residence of the Groan family and with them a legion of servants. The Groan family is headed by Lord Sepulchrave, the seventy-sixth Earl of Groan. He is a melancholy man who feels shackled by his duties as Earl, although he never questions them. His only escape is reading in his library. His wife is the Countess Gertrude. Large and imposing, with dark red hair, she pays no attention to her family or to the rest of Gormenghast. Instead, she spends her time either in her bedroom or in walking selected areas, in the company of a legion of birds and her white cats that alone command her affections. Their daughter is 15-year-old Fuchsia Groan, attended to by the easily upset Nannie Slagg. Self-absorbed, childish and thoughtless, she is also impulsive, imaginative and at times fiercely affectionate. Sequestered in the south wing of the castle are Sepulchrave's identical twin sisters Cora and Clarice Groan, notable for always being dressed in purple. Both suffered from epileptic fits in their youth, as a result of which their left arms and legs are \"rather starved\". They have the same vague and vacant personalities, lacking intelligence to the point of mental impairment. Both crave political power and bitterly resent Gertrude, believing that she robbed them of their rightful place in the hierarchy of Gormenghast and of any involvement in its affairs. This desire for power, along with their general ignorance, allows for them to be easily manipulated by Steerpike in his quest for authority. Also important to the life of the castle is Lord Sepulchrave's personal servant, Mr. Flay, who believes in strictly adhering to the rules of Gormenghast.\n\nParagraph 6: New episodes of Consolevania were released online on an irregular basis, and, in response to much critical acclaim, a second run of videoGaiden, featuring lengthier episodes, was commissioned by BBC Scotland and aired in late 2006. The third series however, has hugely focused on internet-only episodes of which 18 were made and released over a six-month period.  The only material that was made specifically for broadcast were just three \"TV Specials\". The decision to focus so heavily on internet output seems to be in line with a soapbox piece from the second series. In this segment, Robert Florence stated that television is a dying medium and that the BBC needed to accept this and embrace internet programming, an area they currently do not understand.\n\nParagraph 7: Male, female.

At round 4, they were first place, more than the other participating historic clubs of the island, two more than Juventude, three more than Académico do Aeroporto and five more than Académica do Sal. Santa Maria was one position ahead of Juventude. three ahead of Académico do Aeroporto and six ahead of Académica do Sal. Santa Maria is still first at the seventh round, midway in the Premier Division, as they did last season and has 19 points and has scored 24 goals, at that round, an unheard number over 17 last season.

Built in the early 1970s, it remains one of two freeways (the other being the N1) linking Pretoria with Johannesburg, via the R24. As the eastern of the two freeways, it links the Pretoria city centre with OR Tambo International Airport, the N12 freeway, and Boksburg. Between the Solomon Mahlangu Drive on-ramp in Monument Park, Pretoria, and the N12 in Boksburg, the R21 / P157 is an 8 lane highway and motorway (freeway), with 4 lanes in each direction. It has off-ramps leading to Irene, Olifantsfontein, Benoni, and Kempton Park, including a partial offramp to Atlas Road. The route intersects the N1 Highway (Eastern Pretoria Bypass; Danie Joubert Freeway) near Centurion, the R24 near the airport, the N12 and N17 in Boksburg, and the N3 near Vosloorus on the East Rand, where it ends. The section from the N12 to the N3 is not a freeway. As early as the 1970s there were proposals to extend the R21 / P157 freeway further south and the freeway may be linked with the current eastern terminus of the M2 in Germiston in future.\n\nParagraph 10: During the war, an incident occurred involving the Prince George's County jail, when local resident Dr. William Beanes, (1775–1824) captured several marauding British Army deserters from the passing army of General General Robert Ross (1766–1814) and Vice Admiral, Sir George Cockburn, (1772–1853), and held them in the County Jail, after he had treated several wounded \"Redcoat\" soldiers in their march on to Washington and the disastrous Battle of Bladensburg on the Eastern Branch stream of the Anacostia River in August 1814. Later he was arrested along with several others including Robert Bowie, former 11th Governor of Maryland (1803–06, 1811–12) by retreating British cavalry on orders from Ross who had stayed in his home as headquarters. Later Francis Scott Key (1779–1843), a Georgetown and Frederick lawyer with Col. John S. Skinner, U.S. Prisoner-of-War and Parole Agent went to Baltimore secured a small sailing ship, the Minden, and sailed down the Patapsco River and the Chesapeake Bay to find the British Royal Navy fleet after leaving the Patuxent River, beating up the Bay from their base on Tangier Island, Virginia heading for their attack on the hated \"nest of pirates\" - Baltimore. After being received and negotiating with General Ross, Admiral Cockburn and their superior, Admiral Sir Alexander Cochrane, (1758–1832), and showing him some letters written by captured British wounded soldiers testifying to  the fair treatment Beanes had given them and tended to them, they agreed to free him but that would be held up until they could celebrate after the Burning of Baltimore following their attack on Fort McHenry and landing troops to the east at North Point. Well, the famous story has been told, how the general was killed prior to the skirmishing at the Battle of North Point on September 12, how the advancing British under successor, Colonel Arthur Brooke led the British regiments to face the 20,000 drafted and volunteer citizens and militia under the command of Major General Samuel Smith, (1752–1839), of the Maryland Militia on the eastern heights of \"Loudenschlager's Hill\" (later known as \"Hampstead Hill\" in modern Patterson Park, between Highlandtown and Canton neighborhoods) whose dug-in fortifications and dragged cannon were so numerous that the \"Redcoats\" halted in their tracks and decided to await the shelling of the fort which guarded the entrances to the Harbor to pass into the inner port and the waterfront of Fells Point. Following the failure of the fort to fall to two days of \"the rockets' red glare and the bombs bursting in air\" and their flanking troop-loaded barge attack around the west end but driven back by alert artillery seamen at Forts Covington and Babcock in a driving night rainstorm, the British fleet turned about and set sail. Key and his companions Beanes and Skinner who were startled, amazed and emotionally overcome  to see a huge 30 by 42 foot banner being raised in the light of the early morning with the distant booming of the morning's gun salute, knew that the fort and the city had held. When they landed at \"The Basin\" (modern \"Inner Harbor\") and Key finished up his draft of a new poem \"The Defence of Fort McHenry\" at the Indian Queen Hotel at West Baltimore and Hanover Streets, (later to be set to music in a few days) and sung lustily through the city, performed on the stage at the famed Holliday Street Theatre, and then soon throughout the state and soon the nation as \"The Star Spangled Banner\".", "answers": ["Paragraph 2"], "length": 3937, "dataset": "passage_retrieval_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "4cd0cbfbaa33938fc02e2da2ea0825caa6c729cdfa00b495"}
{"input": "The text discusses Ralph Waldo Emerson's letter to Martin Van Buren, in which Emerson expresses his transcendentalist attitude and critiques the American government's treatment of Native Americans. Emerson believes that the Cherokee tribe is innocent and untainted by society's \"atrocities,\" and he tries to convince Van Buren of their growing civility. However, Emerson questions whether the American government, which calls itself \"civilized,\" is capable of committing such injustices. He challenges the morals and ethics of the government and argues that immorality toward any member of the community affects the entire nation. This letter was meant to burden Van Buren's conscience and make him consider the consequences of his actions on the Cherokee and the perception of the government's morality.", "context": "Paragraph 1: Inside the prop warehouse, guests watch a film that shows the Muppets preparing for the upcoming show. The pre-show begins with a construction crew attempting to hang a series of Kodak signs (after Kodak left the sponsorship, the signs were also turned into MuppetVision 3D title cards) and a MuppetVision 3D title card, with comical results. The preparations for the show are being supervised by Scooter, who first has to deal with a series of technical difficulties. As Scooter attempts to get the show in order, he is constantly interrupted by the cast. Fozzie Bear is the first to interrupt, as while it initially appears that he is trying to get the penguins ready in the orchestra, it eventually becomes clear that he is also  trying to present his new musical act, The Three Ds. The group then performs a disastrous version of \"By the Light of the Silvery Moon\". Bean Bunny is prepping for Miss Piggy’s musical number. Ignoring Scooter's warnings not to interrupt her, Bean is eventually karate chopped across the room by her. Next, Gonzo takes center stage in the film when he sends Scooter away to answer the telephone (despite the fact that Muppets do not have one). Gonzo then tries to tap dance with a vase of flowers on his head. After Bean once again attempts to help Miss Piggy, Sam Eagle gives guests a safety spiel. Gonzo then tells Sam that Mickey Mouse is in the building. An excited Sam introduces Mickey, only to see that it is just Rizzo the Rat wearing Mickey Mouse ears. Sam then tells guests to move all the way down the rows in the theater. Finally, a stampede of Muppets run over Sam and enter the theater and guests follow them in.\n\nParagraph 2: Besides Routes 101 and 102, there were also two other, now defunct, Red Arrow trolley lines. The direct ancestor of the SEPTA Route 104 bus line went to West Chester, splitting off from the rest of the system right after 69th Street Transportation Center onto West Chester Pike. The tracks continued all the way up West Chester Pike. West Chester trolleys were replaced by buses in 1954 due to widening of West Chester Pike; rush-hour trips to Westgate Hills lasted until 1958. Tracks remained in use for access to the Red Arrow's carbarn in Llanerch until SEPTA closed the barn in 1971; all tracks were soon removed except for a portion near 69th Street that SEPTA occasionally uses to store out-of service trolleys. The other now-defunct Red Arrow trolley line went to Ardmore until December 1966. It split from the West Chester line at Llanerch and continued on its own exclusive right-of-way. Much of the right-of-way still remains between Schauffele Plaza in Ardmore (the former terminus of the line) and Eagle Road in Havertown, although the tracks were removed and the right-of-way paved for dedicated use by the replacement bus line, now SEPTA Route 103. The 103 still uses this private right-of-way, although much of its other street routing has changed.\n\nParagraph 3: NK cells can also directly target the transplanted tissue. It depends on the balance of activating and inhibitory NK cell receptors and on their ligands expressed by the graft. Receptors of KIR (Killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptor) family bind concrete MHC class I molecules. If the graft has these ligands on its surface, NK cell cannot be activated (KIR receptors provide inhibitory signal). So if these ligands are missing, there is no inhibitory signal and NK cell becomes activated. It recognizes target cells by \"missing-self strategy\"  and induces their apoptosis by enzymes perforin and granzymes released from its cytotoxic granules. Alloreactive NK cells also secrete proinflammatory cytokines IFN-γ and TNF-α to increase expression of MHC molecules and costimulatory receptors on the surface of APCs (antigen-presenting cells). This promotes APC maturation  which leads to amplification of T-cell alloreactivity by means of direct and also indirect pathway of alloantigen recognition (as described below). NK cells are able to kill Foxp3+ regulatory T-lymphocytes as well  and shift the immune response from graft tolerance toward its rejection. Besides the ability of NK cells to influence APC maturation and T cell development, they can probably reduce or even prevent alloimmune response to transplanted tissue – either by killing the Donor APCs  or by anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 and TGF-β secretion. However it is important to note that NK cell sub-populations differ in alloreactivity rate and in their immunomodulatory potential.\n\nParagraph 4: However, of all his articles, the one that earned him death threats was \"Into the Endzone for a Touchdown\", an exploration via psychoanalysis of what he contended was the homoerotic subtext inherent in the terminology and rituals surrounding American football. In 1980, Dundes was invited to give the presidential address at the American Folklore Society annual meeting. His presentation, later published as a monograph titled Life is Like a Chicken Coop Ladder, uses folkspeech, customs, material culture, and so forth seeking to demonstrate an anal-erotic fixation in German national character. Reaction to this paper was incredibly strong. Dundes did not participate in the American Folklore Society annual conference for many years. When he finally participated again, in 2004, he again gave a plenary address, this time taking his fellow folklorists to task for being weak on theory. In his opinion, the presentation of data, no matter how thorough, is useless without the development and application of theory to that data. It is not enough to simply collect, one must do something with what one has collected. In 2012, linguist Anatol Stefanowitsch credited Dundes with having given rise to a still prevalent \"stereotype about Germany as a culture enamored with excretion\", but called Life is Like a Chicken Coop Ladder, \"unstructured, poorly argued and flimsily sourced\" and \"methodologically flawed because he only looked for evidence supporting his theory, and not – as even a folklorist should – for evidence against his theory\".\n\nParagraph 5: Battery Potter was the prototype battery for the steam-hydraulic gun lift carriage. The Endicott Program centered on disappearing guns, which would remain concealed behind a concrete-and-earth parapet until raised to fire. Most of the weapons in the program were mounted on Buffington-Crozier disappearing carriages. However, early on there was doubt that this carriage could successfully raise and lower a 12-inch (305 mm) gun. The alternative developed for this was the gun lift carriage, essentially a barbette carriage mounted on a hydraulic elevator. A steam plant powered the hydraulic system. One advantage of the gun lift carriage not found in most US disappearing gun installations was 360° all-around fire. Battery Potter (known as \"Gun Lift Battery No. 1\" until named in 1903) received its first gun in 1892 (a  gun M1888, Watervliet serial no. 11, the first operational gun of the Endicott Program) and was completed in 1894, but for some reason was not accepted for service until 1898, possibly due to extensive testing. The gun lift system proved expensive to build and operate, as the steam plant had to be running continuously to provide pressure for elevator operation. Other early 12-inch gun installations were on simple non-disappearing barbette carriages until the M1896 Buffington-Crozier carriage was developed for the 12-inch gun.  Although a few installations such as Battery Torbert at Fort Delaware were begun as gun lift batteries, these were completed with disappearing guns, and Battery Potter was the only gun lift battery completed. In 1903 Battery Potter was named for Joseph H. Potter, a Civil War general. By 1907 several additional batteries were completed at Fort Hancock, and with the construction of Battery Arrowsmith under way to cover its sector, Battery Potter was disarmed. Three spare gun lift carriages were modified as barbette carriages, designated Altered Gun Lift Carriage M1897, and emplaced at Fort Flagler (2) and Fort Worden (1) in the Puget Sound area of Washington state.\n\nParagraph 6: Slade began his career on the Broadway stage appearing in the Josh Logan-directed play, There Was a Little Girl, Jane Fonda's first Broadway play.  He then earned a role in the 1961 film Splendor in the Grass, directed by Elia Kazan and filmed in upstate New York. In the early 1960s, he moved to the West Coast, where he was cast as Seaman Jimmy \"Red\" Smith in the feature film Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea (1961). Despite his character being killed in the movie version, Irwin Allen brought Slade back for the Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea (TV series) on ABC. He was cast in 1964 as a new character, Seaman Malone. He was hence the only one of six actors to have been cast in both the film and television versions of Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea. He appeared only in the first half of the first season because he departed to become a semi-regular, Eddie, in the CBS sitcom, Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C., starring Jim Nabors. Slade appeared in eight episodes of Gomer Pyle, all of which were aired during the first half of the first season. He was cast in three episodes of the NBC education drama, Mr. Novak, starring James Franciscus in the title role. His first television role was as Stu Walters in the 1961 episode \"Deadline\" of the ABC sitcom, My Three Sons, starring Fred MacMurray. In 1963, he was cast in the episode \"A Girl Named Amy\" of Jack Lord's ABC series, Stoney Burke, a rodeo adventure series. In 1964, he guest-starred in \"The Enormous Fist\" episode of \"Rawhide\" opposite Eric Fleming and Clint Eastwood. That year, he also appeared as the title character Michael Manning, alias Michael Da Vinci, in the Perry Mason episode, \"The Case of the Careless Kidnapper\".\n\nParagraph 7: The Great Orchestra of Christmas Charity (GOCC, Polish Wielka Orkiestra Świątecznej Pomocy, WOŚP) is the biggest, non-governmental, non-profit, charity organization in Poland raising money for pediatric and elderly care. The GOCC Foundation holds American Heart Association certification to provide courses in CPR and AED, and for the use of high technology for medical lifesaving. The GOCC aims to support health care in Poland by purchase of state of the art medical equipment for Polish hospitals and clinics and by establishing and running six medical programmes and one educational programme. The foundation supports pediatric and geriatric wards, furnishing them in both complex medical devices such as MRI scanners, and providing long-term care units with anti-bedsore mattresses and beds.\n\nParagraph 8: Through reading Emerson's letter to Martin Van Buren, readers can discover Emerson's emotions that convey his transcendentalist attitude. At the time, transcendentalism was a growing movement that focused on pinpointing the discrepancies of society. This led to a growing desire to get involved in politics and the actions of the American government. Primary topics for those recognized with the Transcendentalist Movement included the War with Mexico, the treatment of Native Americans, and the ongoing practice of slavery. Emerson saw the Cherokee as innocent people still left untainted by the \"atrocities\" of society. He is trying to convince President Van Buren of their growing civility, and show support for the Cherokee tribe. However, Emerson explains in his essay, Nature, that once one is born and bred in nature, they will never forget its influence. Emerson believed that all mankind was ultimately good. Therefore, he begins to question whether he could say the same about the American government. He proclaims,\"it is the chirping of grasshoppers beside the immortal question whether justice shall be done by the race of civilized, to the race of savage man; whether all the attributes of reason, of civility, of justice, and even of mercy, shall be put off by the American people, and so vast an outrage upon the Cherokee nation, and upon human nature, shall be consummated (Emerson, 1270-1271).\" He questions how a nation that calls itself \"civilized\" is capable of sending thousands of Indians away from their native land just so the Americans can have the land for themselves. He continues, \"On the broaching of this question, a general expression of despondency,-of disbelief that any good will accrue from a remonstrance on an act of fraud and robbery-appeared in those men to whom we naturally turn for aid and counsel. Will the American Government steal? Will it lie? Will it kill?-we ask triumphantly. Our wise men shake their heads dubiously (Emerson, 1271).\" Emerson proposed the question as to whether or not the American government has morals and, if so, he is challenging its ethics and core values. This letter was meant to burden the conscience of Van Buren and question whether the president’s actions would represent the will of the American people. Not only was Martin Van Buren challenged to consider how his actions would affect the Cherokee Indians, he was also made aware that such an action might make the entire nation start to question the morality of the government. In the words of Emerson scholar Kenneth Sacks, \"Especially important is an argument that immorality toward any member of the community is immorality toward all: 'a crime that really deprives us as well as the Cherokees of a country'\".\n\nParagraph 9: In February 1998, Kanyon (still in his guise as Mortis) asked Raven if he could join Raven's stable The Flock but was told that he could only become a member if he defeated Diamond Dallas Page for the United States Heavyweight Championship. Mortis failed to defeat Page for the title on the February 12 episode of Thunder, and he was DDT'ed on the entrance ramp by Raven as a result. This event led to Kanyon discarding the \"Mortis\" persona and beginning a feud with Raven, in the course of which he was dubbed \"The Innovator of Offense\" by play-by-play commentator Mike Tenay due to his unique wrestling technique, which included multiple moves performed from a fireman's carry position. His matches almost always began with him asking the rhetorical question, \"Who Better than Kanyon\"? as the crowd would respond, \"Everybody\" (or \"Nobody\", if he was a face.) He formed an uneasy alliance with Perry Saturn in order to fight against The Flock, but eventually turned on Saturn and joined forces with Raven. After Saturn forced The Flock to disband by defeating Raven at Fall Brawl, Kanyon and Raven continued to team together until Raven, in storyline, was sidelined with depression and Kanyon took time away from his wrestling career to work as stunt coordinator and stuntman on The Jesse Ventura Story.\n\nParagraph 10: In June 2018, MassDOT's North South Rail Link Feasibility Reassessment described the costs and benefits of several alternatives, including adding tunnels in various configurations or doing nothing. The tunnel options included a $21.5 billion four-track maximum-service plan and three double-track routes ranging in cost from $12.3 billion to $14.7 billion. (These costs are in 2028 dollars and include purchasing additional rolling stock, other required infrastructure improvements, and a 3.5% annual inflation.) The presentation noted that a planned expansion of South Station would cost an estimated $4.7 billion, not including the purchase of rolling stock, electrifying the system, and renovating Tower 1.\n\nParagraph 11: Richard Margison (born 1953) is an operatic tenor who was named an Officer of the Order of Canada in 2001 and lives in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Gino Quilico (born 1955) is a lyric baritone of Italian descent and the son of Canadian baritone Louis Quilico and Lina Pizzolongo. Ben Heppner (born 1956) is a tenor, specializing in opera and classical symphonic works for voice. performs frequently with major opera companies in the United States and Europe, as well as concert appearances with major symphony orchestras. Gerald Finley (born 1960) is a bass-baritone opera singer.  renowned for his interpretations of Mozart roles Michael Schade (born 1965) is a Canadian operatic tenor, who was born in Geneva and raised in Germany and Canada; he is known as a \"Mozart tenor\". Russell Braun (born 1965) is an operatic lyric baritone, who is the son of baritone Victor Braun. Isabel Bayrakdarian (born 1974) is an Armenian-Canadian opera singer who moved to Canada as a teenager. James Westman (born 1972) is an operatic baritone, in his youth he was the first boy soprano to perform Gustav Mahler, 4th symphony with Leonard Bernstein.  Joni Henson (born 1977 in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario) and Measha Brueggergosman (born 1977 in Fredericton, New Brunswick) are both Sopranos that perform regularly both in concert and in fully staged Operas.\n\nParagraph 12: Godfather's Pizza was founded in Omaha, Nebraska, in 1973. Willy Theisen bought out the pizza parlor and the name in 1974 from Gregg Johnson (who later started the Minsky's Pizza restaurants), and sold his first franchise. Theisen sold the company to Pillsbury in 1985 and stepped down from actively managing the company. In 1986, Pillsbury named Herman Cain CEO and president of the brand. Cain and Ronald B. Gartlan, the company's executive vice president, led a group to purchase the Godfather's brand from Pillsbury, which they did by the beginning of 1990 in a leveraged buyout for what was reported to be $100 million. It was reported to be the fifth largest pizza chain in the United States at the time, down from third place in 1985. About this time, many Godfather's locations in the St. Louis area were bought out by Pantera's Pizza. Under Cain's leadership, Godfather's closed approximately 200 restaurants and eliminated several thousand jobs, and by doing so returned to profitability. Cain stepped down from his position as CEO and president in 1996 and Gartlan became CEO. Cain stayed on as chairman until 2002. In 2009 Gartlan bought out Cain. According to the company's official website, as of August 2016, the chain had 453 locations in the U.S. Godfather's Pizza also operates in some Speedway locations, as well as most Minit Mart locations in Kentucky and northern Tennessee, as of 2007.\n\nParagraph 13: As a result of his frequent traveling, Abdullah the Butcher usually served as more of a special attraction than as a consistent championship contender. Accordingly, Abdullah never did win a world heavyweight championship, though he would capture several regional titles during his career. He won his first major championship on October 23, 1967, when he teamed with Dr. Jerry Graham to defeat John & Carlos Tolos for the NWA's Canadian Tag Team Titles in Vancouver. A few years later, he ventured to the Montreal region, where he had three reigns as the IWA International Heavyweight Champion between 1969 and 1972, feuding against Ivan Koloff and Johnny Rougeau. He later served as one of the premier rule breakers in Calgary's Stampede territory, capturing the NWA Canadian Championship, as well as having six North American Heavyweight Title reigns during the early 1970s. On June 24, 1972, he defeated Ernie Ladd in Akron, Ohio, to capture his first of two NWF Heavyweight Championships. In 1972, he wrestled a few matches for World Wide Wrestling Federation. Also he worked for Stampede Wrestling from 1970 to 1974. During the mid-1970s, he frequently performed in Detroit, Michigan's Big-Time Wrestling territory, where he engaged in a rivalry against The Sheik. He teamed with Killer Tim Brooks to win the region's version of the NWA World Tag Team Titles before defeating Bobo Brazil on February 8, 1975, for the NWA United States Championship.\n\nParagraph 14: A serious eruption began on 9 September 1946, beginning with a series of tremors and then a lava flow which destroyed the village of Angaha, including the government buildings and the wireless station. The village of Aleleuta was also destroyed, and lava flows had left only one third of the island still habitable. When radio contact was lost, an RNZAF aircraft on a flight to Samoa was requested to investigate, and reported the eruption to the outside world. The eruption was followed by a series of violent earthquakes. While the inhabitants initially planned to stay, in mid-October the Tongan government issued a compulsory evacuation order. An initial attempt to evacuate the island using the New Zealand vessel Matua failed, as the ship arrived before the inhabitants were ready. The island was finally evacuated on December 21. The inhabitants were resettled in Nukualofa, where land had been provided by Queen Salote. In 1948 they were resettled in ʻEua. When they resettled, they named various places in ʻEua after the places they’d known in Niuafoʻou. As a result, the two islands now have many of the same place names, and a comparison of names on the two islands shows where each group of settled.

According to Gernian religious practice, firstborn noble sons are heir to the family fortunes, second sons bear swords as soldiers, and third sons are consecrated to the priesthood. Holy Writ specifies other roles as well for subsequent sons.  Nevare will follow his father – newly made a lord by the King – into the Cavalla (cavalry); to the frontier and thence to an advantageous marriage to carry on the Burvelle name. It is a golden future, and Nevare looks forward to it with relish.  From the age of eight, Nevare is schooled daily in math, physics, engineering, and of course combat and military strategy.  With the help of Sergeant Duril, a man who once served under Nevare's father, he learns to live off the land and survive in the harsh plains environment.\n\nParagraph 2: Lauren gets Spencer drunk and tells him they slept together. She lies to him that she is pregnant with his child and that he has to give her £2000 to have an abortion to con him out of his inheritance so that she and Gaz can run away together. However Spencer, in a state of panic, tells Sasha about the situation. When Calvin finds out after lodger Cheryl Brady eavesdrop the family argument, he grabs Gaz and throws him out, leading everyone to believe that Gaz is the father, when in fact Lauren's actually not pregnant at all. Calvin's friend arrests Gaz after an argument which Lauren blames Calvin for. Gaz is released and makes plans with Lauren to run away that day however their plans are cut short when Calvin is shot dead by Theresa. Lauren later lies to Sasha and Leo, telling them that she has had a miscarriage before running away with Gaz. Gaz is arrested for Calvin's murder and when he is later released he asks Lauren to run away with him again however she can't when she sees her dad needs her. Lauren and Gaz's relationship later deteriorates, she then starts to reconcile with Anita and accepts to go to Paris with her to visit her sister Leila Roy. Gaz is furious about this and gives Lauren an ultimatum to choose between him and Anita. Lauren then decides to choose Anita and they make a proper reconciliation and sh breaks up with Gaz. Lauren then later hears that Gaz has been arrested. She is then told by Anita that he held a gun, in which Lauren didn't believe and angrily thought she was lying. However she realises this when Gaz was actually arrested and goes to apologise to Anita. Lauren doubts that Gaz would actually shoot Anita with a real gun, but Anita convinces her that he probably would. Gaz is charged with Calvins murder Lauren believes him when he says he didn't but still wants nothing to do with him. Sasha finds out about the scam to fleece Spencer and argues with Lauren, during the argument Lauren falls down the stairs of the Loft. Lauren is hospitalised but discharges herself so she can go to Calvin's funeral. During the funeral Lauren shouts horrible things about Calvin then knocks his casket over. Valerie returns and reveals she wants to take Lauren back to Spain. Lauren visits Gaz in prison. He assumes that she cares about him, but she realises that she doesn't love Gaz anymore and leaves him. She then reveals to both Leo and Valerie that she wants to go to Spain with Valerie to reconnect with her. Out of guilt, Lauren then apologises to Spencer about her scheme and then is being forgiven by him. She later finds out that Valerie isn't going to Spain after all, but is then shocked to hear the rest of the family are joining them and that Spencer is going with them too. They attend the opening launch of the Chez Chez bar that replaces The Loft and they are cheered on as they leave the village.\n\nParagraph 3: Haldane was persuaded by Octavia Hill to apply to the system of property administration which Hill had developed in London to the situation in Edinburgh and in 1884, at the age of 21, she became convener of the Housing Committee of the Edinburgh Social Union. She took nursing courses in the 1880s and subsequently became involved in establishing the Voluntary Aid Detachment (VAD) from 1908 onwards. She became a manager of Edinburgh Royal Infirmary around 1901 onwards. Her autobiography, From One Century to Another covers the period from 1862 to 1914. It lacks precise detail but gives a graphic picture of what it was like to be a well-to-do lady in the Victorian and Edwardian periods. She was intimate with royalty such as Queen Alexandra and was a personal friend of literary figures such as Matthew Arnold and George Meredith. She was taken out to dinner by Matthew Arnold who astonished her \"by his knowledge of the neighbouring fishing streams, since he did not personally know the neighbourhood.\" She adds that: \"I enjoyed his talk very much, as I had always had a great admiration for his work and felt it an honour to meet him. He had the stiff rather highbrow Victorian face one knew so well from pictures, but he was delightful to me.\"  George Meredith visited Cloan House in September 1890. She recalls that \"It was quite unnecessary to entertain him, for the wonderful sentences poured from his mouth and we had but to listen.\"\n\nParagraph 4: Their first job is to kill Walter Sage (Morey Amsterdam), a resort owner who has been holding back slot machine profits from Lepke. To get close to Sage, Reles forces singer Joey Collins (Stuart Whitman), an old crony of Sage who owes Reles money, to help him. Reles and his henchman kill Sage. Reles visits Joey and threatens to kill him and his dancer wife Eadie (May Britt) if they tell anyone about the murder. Eadie throws Reles out. Reles later returns to the apartment when Joey is gone and brutally rapes her. Despite her urging, Joey refuses to run away, and this causes him and Eadie to split.\n\nParagraph 5: The Indian Army made a huge contribution to the Great War. Their involvement on the Western Front was limited in the main to the years 1914 and 1915 and after this, in recognition of the difficulties for Indians to live and operate in the grim climatic conditions of Northern Europe, they were moved to the Egyptian Theatre of War and other warmer places. India, in the context of the 1914-1918 war, was pre-partition India; the Indian Sub-Continent in 1914 would have embraced present day India, Pakistan, Kashmir, Nepal and Bangladesh. Only days after the British government had declared war on Germany on 4 August 1914, two infantry divisions and a cavalry brigade of the Indian Army were ordered to mobilise and prepare for overseas service. Units began arriving in France in September 1914, and by late October they were involved in heavy fighting on the Messines Ridge in Belgium. It was at Messines on 31 October 1914 that Khudadad Khan performed the act of gallantry for which he was later awarded the Victoria Cross, becoming the first Indian born soldier to be so honoured. The Indian Corps, which was composed of the 3rd (Lahore) and 7th (Meerut) divisions, went on to fight in some of the bloodiest battles of the first year of the war, and at the Battle of Neuve Chapelle which ran from 10 to 13 March 1915. Indian soldiers made up half of the attacking force and, despite suffering very heavy casualties, succeeded in capturing important sections of the German line. The officers and men of the Corps further distinguished themselves at St. Julien in the Ypres Salient in April 1915, at Aubers Ridge and Festubert in May of that year, and at Loos in September 1915, before they were redeployed to the Middle East in December. The Indian Cavalry Corps remained on the Western Front until the spring of 1918 and Indian labour companies, which had begun arriving in France in 1917, performed vital and often dangerous logistical work behind the lines until after the Armistice. India sent over 140,000 men to the Western Front – 90,000 serving in the infantry and cavalry and as many as 50,000 non-combatant labourers. They hailed from the length and breadth of British India: from the Punjab, Garwahl, the Frontiers, Bengal, Nepal, Madras, and Burma, and represented an extremely diverse range of religious, linguistic, and ethnic cultures. The officer corps was composed mostly of men of European descent. Of the combatants, over 8,550 were killed and as many as 50,000 more were wounded. Almost 5,000 of the dead have no known grave and are commemorated both on the Menin Gate at Ypres and here at Neuve Chapelle.\n\nParagraph 6: The line where the ball is placed for kickoff varies among the rule books. It is placed on the kicking team's 30-yard line in six-man football, 35-yard line in college and professional outdoor football, 40-yard line in American high school football, 45-yard line in amateur Canadian football, and the goal line in indoor and arena football. For the 2016 season only, the Ivy League placed the ball on the 40-yard line in conference games. All players on the kicking team except the kicker (and, if used, a holder) must not cross the line at which the ball is placed until the ball is kicked. The receiving team must stay behind the line that is 10 yards from where the ball is placed. The ball can be fielded by the receiving team at any point after it has been kicked, or by the kicking team after it has traveled 10 yards or has been touched by a member of the receiving team. In American football (but not Canadian) touchback and fair catch rules apply to the kicked ball. If it is fielded by the kicking team, it is called an onside kick. A low, bouncing kick is called a squib kick. Although a squib kick typically gives the receiving team better field position than they would if a normal kick had been used, a squib kick is sometimes used to avoid giving up a long return, as well as use up a valuable amount of time on the clock, as it is impossible to fair catch such a kick. It is usually done when a team takes the lead in the final seconds, and is done to safely run out the remainder of the clock. Squib kicking with more than 20 seconds remaining has had unfortunate results (a line drive kick is more common when there are 20 to 50 seconds remaining; the typical hurry-up offense drive takes over a minute), but has been done by some teams.\n\nParagraph 7: Dollz are generally created by taking a base body (a drawing of a bald and naked body created for this purpose), and then drawing hair, clothes and accessories onto it. The creators are usually women. Dollz were first created to be used as avatars on The Palace Chat Program in 1995. The invention of dollz is attributed to Melicia Greenwood (also known as artgrrl, or shatteredInnocents), mainly because of her detailed web publishing on the history of dollz. Her new avatars were freely distributed on the main Palace server, the \"Mansion\".  Within weeks thousands of creatively modified dollz were redistributed around the many Palace servers, replacing the default smiley face avatars that were previously used. Many teenagers adopted dollz avatars as a sign of rebellion against older Palace users.\n\nParagraph 8: Winds of  reached as far west as San Antonio. Crops across half of Texas were damaged by the storm as it pressed inland, including the loss of all open cotton and most late-season corn and rice. Many partly grown cotton bolls failed to open due to bruising from the storm, and roughly a quarter of all field cotton was lost. However, open ranges and forage crops benefited from rainfall. Several interior cities reported damage from the hurricane. Property damage was relatively minor in Angleton, where winds peaked at . Minor structures, including awnings, barns, and outhouses, were damaged. The hurricane wrought extensive damage to Brazos County, with strong winds destroying the chimneys and windows of numerous homes; the ruined façades resulted in widespread flooding of homes. Small houses and thousands of trees were toppled, as well as a -high oil derrick. Awnings were pulled apart from storefronts throughout the Main Street area, and the county courthouse was badly damaged. Two halls and small buildings were damaged at Texas A&M University, amounting to a damage toll of $5,000–$10,000. The Bryan Weekly Eagle reported that the storm had \"no equal in the history of the county\". Widespread damage also occurred in Rockdale and Caldwell. At Rockdale, the winds caused leaks in almost every house and tore down power lines, while store awnings and a church steeple were blown away in Caldwell. Telegraph and train service were out in Rosenberg, where business signage, trees, and wires were blown down by strong winds; the city incurred a $3,000 damage toll. A church and warehouse in Elgin were destroyed. Seven other towns reported major cotton losses and minor property damage. Lockhart lost 75–80 percent of their cotton and many of their shade trees. The cotton crop was entirely destroyed in Bastrop, Hallettsvile, Sealy, Shiner, and Smithville. About 15–25 percent of cotton across Central Texas was damaged, amounting to several millions of dollars in losses. In Travis County, more cotton bolls were open compared to other areas prior to the storm, making the county susceptible to greater losses. All unharvested corn was blown down in Lexington. In Williamson County, the storm was more destructive than the 1900 hurricane, damaging outhouses, windmills, and buildings on the Southwestern University campus. The county also lost 15,000–20,000 bales of cotton. Heavy rains and winds of  were reported across the Dallas–Fort Worth area.\n\nParagraph 9: females in which the band is pale ochreous instead of orange are ab. fisoni Wheeler, while the band is separated into several spots by the heavily black veins in ab. lineata Tutt. A very remarkable form is ab. cuneata Tutt, which bears a broad orange submarginal band on the hindwing. On the underside the white lines are sometimes more or less obsolete, or distorted (= ab. nucilinea). Or they may be strongly developed and modified into a kind of white-edged dark band in consequence of the interspace between the white lines being dark ; this is ab. virgata Tutt. — Of the geographical races ongodai Tutt is the one nearest to the European form. The male has distinct discal lunules at the apex of the cell on the forewing but no pale patch beyond the same, the orange spots on the anal lobe of the hindwing and near the base of the tail being larger and more distinct. The orange spot of the female is very narrow, being traversed by the black veins. — crassa Leech (74 g) is much larger even than large European specimens (ab. major Tutt the tail being longer, and sometimes, not always,  the colour of the underside darker. West China. — elwesi Leech (74 g) has the upperside of the  (here figured) entirely orange except for the distal margin of the forewing and the sooty base of the hindwing, the male bearing brownish orange spots beyond the cell of the forewing. Central and West China. — Egg white, depressed, rough. Larva adult in June, clothed with short thin hairs, green with a yellow line on back and sides, yellow subdorsal oblique spots and a brown retractile head; on certain Prunus and Amygdalus, more rarely on birch, hazel and cherry. Pupa very smooth, rounded everywhere, pale brown, with thin lighter and darker markings; although fastened only by the cremaster, not by a girth, it is closely applied with its underside to its support The butterfliesoccur from July until late in October near woods, in avenues and gardens. They rest concealed among the foliage, and can fly rather fast and without interruption. They visit flowers, particularly umbellifers, and have also been observed at bait. They are plentiful wherever they occur, being very abundant in some years. In opposition to other observers I have sometimes seen 3 or 4 males resting together on a leaf.\n\nParagraph 10: This takes place on Easter Monday, the opening day of the Easter Rising. Peter, Mrs Gogan and the Covey discuss the fighting that is going on and the Covey informs Mrs Gogan that Patrick Pearse came out of the General Post Office with his men to read out the Proclamation of Irish Independence. Bessie gloats about the Rebels' imminent defeat but is ignored by the others. Nora shows up with Fluther after having searched for Jack in the midst of the fighting unsuccessfully. As Mrs Gogan leads her inside to lie down Bessie leaves to get some bread and comes back shortly informing the others that looting has broken out everywhere. A fashionably dressed middle-aged woman enters and asks the men to show her a safe route back to her home in Rathmines because the fighting has made it impossible to find a taxi or tram to take her back. Fluther tells her that any route is as safe as the others and leaves with the Covey to loot a nearby pub without helping her. Peter refuses to help her on the grounds that he might be shot and left with a limp and leaves her alone outside the tenement. Mrs Gogan attempts to leave the house pushing a pram until Bessie rushes after her claiming that the pram's owner left her in charge of it. The argument concludes with the two women agreeing to split the spoils. Brennan and Jack appear with a wounded rebel and Nora rushes to meet with them. She attempts to convince Jack to leave the fight and stay with her, telling him that she had gone out asking for his whereabouts when she hadn't gotten any news. Angered by her actions and the shame they brought upon him Jack ignores Nora's pleas and pushes her away roughly before leaving with his comrades. Nora then goes into labour.\n\nParagraph 11: The August 29, 2014 Super Viernes professional wrestling show hosted the finals of Mexican wrestling promotion Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre's (CMLL) annual Universal Championship tournament. In previous weeks Último Guerrero and La Sombra had both won their qualifying round to head to the finals of the tournament. Guerrero had previously won the 2009 Universal Championship tournament and La Sombra had won the 2011 tournament, which meant that for the first time ever there would be a two time winner of the Universal Championship. Both Guerrero and La Sombra had been involved in separate storylines up until this point, Último Guerrero continued his several-years long feud with Atlantis while La Sombra had been part of an emerging group known as Los Ingobernables that had headlined a large number of CMLL shows in 2014. The tournament finals was the only tournament match to be contested under \"best two-out-of-three falls\" rules and saw Último Guerrero win the first and third fall to become the first ever two time Universal Championship tournament winner. In the second to last match of the night long time rivals Negro Casas and Rush found themselves on opposite sides of a Six-man tag team match as they clashed to carry on the feud that had seen Negro Casas shaved bald less than a month ago and Casas and partner Shocker defeat Rush and La Máscara to win the CMLL World Tag Team Championship. Another issue in the semi-main event was the ongoing storyline between former partners Rey Escorpión and Dragón Rojo Jr. that began when Dragón Rojo Jr. decided to leave the Rey Escorpión led Los Revolucionarios del Terror (\"The Revolutionaries of Terror\") a few months prior. The betrayal led to an ongoing rivalry between the two, a rivalry that had already seen Dragón Rojo Jr. successfully defend the CMLL World Middleweight Championship against his Rey Escorpión on the August 8 Super Viernes show. Casas and Rey Escorpión were joined by Niebla Roja as they took on Rush, Dragón Rojo Jr. and Atlantis, defeating the trio by disqualification when Rush caused his team to lose after a low blow on Casas. The fourth match of the night was used to showcase a quickly developing feud between Rey Cometa and Cavernario, a storyline that would lead to a featured match on the CMLL 81st Anniversary Show only a few weeks later. Rey Cometa, Máscara Dorada and Valiente took on the group known as La Peste Negra (\"The Black Plague\"; Cavernario, El Felino and Mr. Niebla). In the third and deciding fall La Peste Negra's disregard for the rules got the team disqualified for excessive violence on Rey Cometa.", "answers": ["Paragraph 11"], "length": 3622, "dataset": "passage_retrieval_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "b02043e458708e181adaab89d3f5353bdf341fc9f59a81b1"}

The recommended and usual depth of the filter is 0.9 to 1.5 meters. Microbial layer is formed within 10–20 days from the start of the operation. During the process of filtration, raw water can percolate through the porous sand medium, stopping and trapping organic material, bacteria, viruses and cysts such as Giardia and Cryptosporidium. The regeneration procedure for slow sand filters is called scraping and is used to mechanically remove the dried out particles on the filter. However, this process can also be done under water, depending on the individual system. Another limiting factor for the water being treated is turbidity, which is for slow sand filters defined to be 10 NTU (Nephelometric Turbidity Units). Slow sand filters are a good option for limited budget operations as the filtration is not using any chemicals and requires little or no mechanical assistance. However, because of a continuous growing population in communities, slow sand filters are being replaced for rapid sand filters, mostly due to the running period length.\n\nParagraph 2: The landing appears to have begun most casually. To quote Hall's own book, \"As we had nothing better on our hands, it was resolved to make an exploring expedition to visit this little islet. Two boats were accordingly manned for the purpose; ... the artists prepared their sketch books and the geologists their hammers, for a grand scientific field day.\" Whilst indicating the impromptu nature of the landing, this also signifies that science was a deliberate aim from the first. The sea on this \"fine autumnal morning\" was unusually smooth, but a swell of many feet made landing difficult and required a great deal of confidence when leaping ashore. Observations and measurements were made until a fog was observed. Concern over the Endymions continuing visibility caused them to begin their return. The increasing swell made embarking difficult and it took half an hour to gain the boats. By this time Endymion was lost in the fog. One of the party was landed back on the rock, in an attempt to scale it in search of a fog-free look-out. His first view was of an approaching fog bank, which in this area could last for some days. The ship was sighted though, and after another delay to retrieve their \"shivering scout\" they rowed off in chase. Unfortunately the ship didn't see them before the fog returned and they were forced to return yet again to Rockall. At this point planning began for a long stay on the island, despite their lack of provisions or fresh water. It was resolved to abandon the heavier of the two boats and to drag the other ashore to improvise an overnight shelter. Fortunately they were saved by the fog suddenly rising, revealing the ship once more. On finally returning to the ship, some five or six hours after the fog, it was almost dark.\n\nParagraph 3: Most people claimed Crawford was easy to work with, always professional, generous, patient and kind. Issues between Crawford and McCambridge cropped up early on, but Ray was not alarmed – at first. He found it \"heaven sent\" that they disliked each other and felt it added greatly to the dramatic conflict. The reasons for the feud appear to date back to a time when Crawford had once dated McCambridge's husband, Fletcher Markle. According to some of the other co-stars, McCambridge needled Crawford about it. McCambridge also appears to have disliked that Crawford and Ray were in the midst of an affair. Crawford, on the other hand, disliked what she perceived to be \"special attention\" that Ray was giving to McCambridge.\n\nParagraph 4: Ragnar, now king, wants to return to Wessex to claim the land promised by King Ecbert. His relationship with Aslaug has soured. When Lagertha announces she intends to raid with Ragnar, Kalf, her right-hand man, offers to remain and take care of Hedeby. When they arrive in Wessex, King Ecbert informs Ragnar that to receive their land, the Vikings must fight for Princess Kwenthrith to appease King Ecbert's nobles. Lagertha is unsure about joining, so King Ecbert offers her the job of leading the Viking settlers in Wessex. The settlers go to the land to farm, while the warriors defeat Kwenthrith's uncle's army. Floki resents Ragnar's fighting for the Christians. The Vikings begin climbing the mountain to fight Kwenthrith's brother and his army. She asks Ragnar to spare her brother. While Ragnar and his men fight their way up the hill, Aethelwulf's archers surround Kwenthrith's brother, killing many and forcing him to surrender. Ragnar finds out that Þórunn is pregnant. The Vikings arrives back. Aethelwulf learns that Judith is pregnant with Athelstan's child, and he is sent to the settlement. A messenger arrives to tell Lagertha that her earldom has been usurped by Kalf; she asks Ragnar to help win it back. Ragnar tells the men that they will raid Paris in the spring. Ragnar returns with Lagertha to speak with Kalf, although he decides not to help fight for Lagertha, and instead asks him to join the raid on Paris. Floki tells Ragnar that Aslaug slept with Harbard and that Harbard is another name for Odin. Þórunn gives birth to a girl that Bjorn names Siggy. A farmer returns from Wessex and tells Ragnar about Aethelwulf's massacre. Athelstan has a sign from God and tells Ragnar that he has been born again as a Christian.  Earl Kalf leads a fleet to Kattegat to join the raid on Paris, along with Erlendur and Torvi. Floki kills Athelstan while he is praying. Ragnar, heartbroken by Athelstan's death, carries his body up the side of the mountain for burial and asks Athelstan for forgiveness. Ragnar's Viking fleet, also reinforced by Earl Siegfried, arrives in Francia and prepares for battle. Emperor Charles is asked by count Odo to evacuate Paris, but he refuses. Ragnar shocks them when he decides to leave Floki in charge of the attack. Both Vikings and Franks prepare for the siege as the Christians pray for protection from the pagans. Queen Kwenthrith has killed the Wessex nobles and has broken her ties with King Ecbert. The king sends his son, Aethelwulf, to Mercia to force her back into submission. She informs Aethelwulf that her son, Magnus, was fathered by Ragnar. She eventually submits once Aethelwulf tells her about the massacre of the Viking settlement.\n\nParagraph 5: His next tournament was the BNP Paribas Open. He defeated Kei Nishikori in the first round, and fellow Croatian Mario Ančić in the second when Ančić retired with illness at 3–3. He then upset eighth seeded Gilles Simon 6–3, 7–6, in the third, and outlasted Igor Andreev 4–6, 7–6, 7–6, in the fourth to reach the quarterfinals, where he was at last beaten by fourth seeded Andy Murray 5–7, 6–7. Ljubičić received a wild card into the Monte Carlo Masters and in the second round defeated Juan Martín del Potro 4–6, 6–1, 6–4. He proceeded to the quarterfinals, where he was defeated by four-time defending champion Rafael Nadal 3–6, 3–6. Due to his strong play at Monte Carlo, he received a wild card into the Madrid Masters. He again defeated a top-10 player in the second round, beating ninth seed Jo-Wilfried Tsonga 6–4, 7–5. He then defeated eighth seed Gilles Simon 3–6, 6–4, 6–3, to reach his third quarterfinal at a Masters 1000 event. He was defeated by Novak Djokovic 4–6, 4–6, in the quarterfinals. His performances during the clay-court season have helped his ranking improve to No. 43, his highest since August 2008. His clay-court form did not carry into the French Open, as he suffered a disappointing defeat by Juan Carlos Ferrero 6–2, 4–6, 4–6, 6–3, 3–6, in the first round. Ljubičić didn't compete at Wimbledon due to an injury. \n\nParagraph 6: David returns the following month after hearing that Pat is ill. He is later stunned to discover that Pat is in fact dying of pancreatic cancer. They argue and David resolves to leave, but Carol persuades him to stay. Derek arrives and provokes David, and a fight breaks out. David tells Derek he is staying and returns to Pat, where he forgives her for her past mistakes and she dies in his arms. David decides to stay in Walford to plan Pat's funeral. He flirts with Roxy Mitchell (Rita Simons) and goes to have sex with her, but has second thoughts and nothing happens. David then declares his love for Carol. She reciprocates, and the pair reunite. David tries to settle his differences with Derek, but Derek threatens him. Michael Moon (Steve John Shepherd) suggests to David that they should team up to bring Derek down and get him arrested. David agrees after Derek upsets Carol. They attempt to set Derek up by having Michael plant stolen goods in Derek's home. However, Derek catches Michael in the act, and Michael blames the entire scheme on David. When David learns of this he begs Carol to leave with him. Carol agrees, but after Pat's funeral, David is confronted by Derek and his brothers Jack (Scott Maslen) and Max (Jake Wood). Derek threatens to kill David, but Jack and Max restrain Derek as they let David go. As he returns to his car to meet Carol, he sees her saying an emotional goodbye to Bianca and her family, so realises her family needs her and leaves without her. David sends a letter to Carol but it is intercepted and locked away by Derek. After Derek dies, the letter is found and Carol tries to contact David but discovers his phone number has been disconnected.\n\nParagraph 7: As the trees became established and were approximately 20 feet high all side shoots up to six feet were removed. This process called brashing ensured easy access, less risk of fire and the first six feet of the tree had a reduced knotty core. The next stage after brashing was pre-thinning this process was carried out after 15 to 16 years. It involved the removal of diseased trees. Larger trees known as wolves were also removed as they suppressed their smaller and straighter more valuable neighbours. Thinning began when the trees were 18 to 20 years old, coinciding with the start of World War 2. At this time there was much debate about how the work would be carried out. It was decided that racks or access ways 18 to 20 feet in width would be cut and then dividing the compartments into blocks covering 5 acres. Next, two rows of trees were removed to create a rack some 10 feet wide. The thinnings were graded and the straighter poles used as pit props in the coal industry. Other thinnings had a wide range of uses including fencing posts, pea poles in gardens and into netting stakes for the local rabbit warrens. Curved or irregular shaped cuttings was sold as firewood. In 1946, a central processing depot was established at Brandon to process poles into pit-props destined for the East Midlands coalfields.  Large amounts of waste material was generated and this attracted a secondary industry of charcoal burning. As the forest matured the quantity of the thinnings increased with the disposal of them continued to be a problem. By 1950, demand from the National Coal Board for the timber decreased and the commission had to find new outlets, these included many of the smaller poles being cut up and converted into wallboard and some 60 tons of pine transported each week to a wood wool factory in Manchester. Large numbers of thinnings were taken to the Commission's own creosote plant at Santon Downham which was established in 1958 before closing in 1970. As the forest matured the size of the material being removed increased and clear felling of mature areas began with felled timber being sold directly to timber merchants. By the mid 1960s chainsaws had been introduced and by the early 1980s specially adapted tractors and trailers known as forwarders came into widespread operation. With the arrival of the harvester in 1991 full mechanization had reached the forest. Some 2500 trees were being extracted each day producing 180,000 cubic metres of timber annually by 1997. Much of this is sold to local saw mills and used in the building industry with the remainder producing fence posts, pallets and pit props.\n\nParagraph 8: In 1930 Womersely left Imperial College to take up a position as a junior research officer at the Shirley Institute (British Cotton Industry Research Institute), Manchester. There he applied mathematical techniques to problems in textile manufacture, including research on cotton spinning, drafting fibrous materials, and, through L. H. C. Tippett, the use of mathematical statistics in industrial production and quality control. While at the Shirley Institute he also met Leslie Comrie and became interested in computational techniques.  As a result, he spent a month at HM Nautical Almanac Office, London learning Comrie's numerical approaches. In 1936 he collaborated with Douglas Hartree who had built a Differential Analyser at the University of Manchester; together they devised a much cited method for the numerical integration of partial differential equations. In 1937, with war looming, he joined the armaments research department at Woolwich as a scientific officer, and worked on using statistical techniques applied to ballistics and ammunition proofing.  In 1942, after the outbreak of World War II, he was appointed assistant director of scientific research at the Ministry of Supply and asked to set up and head the Advisory Service on Statistical Methods (later known as SR17). This organization was responsible for advice and research into ammunition supply, engineering factories and the investigations of a range of Government Inspectorates. It was particularly important in ensuring quality control and promoting sample inspection methods to British industry during wartime. In 1944 he joined the British Association mathematical tables committee and in the same year he was appointed as the first superintendent of the Mathematics Division of the National Physical Laboratory (NPL). In addition to being responsible for statistical quality control, NPL was tasked with building an electronic computer, for which Womersley coined the name Automatic Computing Engine (ACE), echoing Babbage's Analytical Engine.  Womersely was therefore responsible for the set up and operation of the first national computing centre in UK. One of his first actions was to visit the US for a fact-finding tour, where he learned about ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer), Howard Aitken's Harvard machine, George Stibitz's machines and von Neumann's plans for the binary computer, EDVAC (Electronic Discrete Variable Automatic Computer). On his return, he recruited Alan Turing to work on the ACE section and backed him strongly. Womersley also recruited Donald Davies in 1947. However, progress on the ACE project was delayed and Turing developed a dislike of Womersley and disdain for his abilities and left the project in 1948. Davies then took over from Turing and a small experimental model, pilot ACE was produced in 1950. Whether Womersely led NPL successfully has been questioned, although the consensus seems to be that he did a good job in difficult circumstances. He himself left the project in 1950, before the prototype pilot ACE was completed, to join the British Tabulating Machine Company (BTM), a forerunner of International Computers Limited (ICL). There he recognised that the computers previously developed by academia or governments were too large and expensive to be commercially viable and he recruited Andrew Booth who had developed the All Purpose Electronic Computer at Birbeck University, as a consultant to develop a smaller inexpensive computer. The computer copied from Booth's original design by Ray Bird was named the Hollerith Electronic Computer (HEC1), and was Britain's first mass-produced business computer.\n\nParagraph 9: In , Lieberthal hit 31 home runs and 96 RBIs for the Phillies, while hitting .300 with a career-best .551 slugging percentage. He was an All Star for the first time, only the third Phillie catcher ever to receive the honor (joining Darren Daulton and Bob Boone). He also won a Gold Glove Award, after posting a .997 fielding percentage—a new Phillie record at catcher.  He joined Johnny Bench, Lance Parrish, and Iván Rodríguez as the only catchers to have hit 30 home runs in the same season that they won the Gold Glove Award. He also became the eighth major league catcher to bat .300 and hit 30 homers in the same season. He also became the first Phillie to bat .300 and hit 30 home runs since Greg Luzinski, in 1977.\n\nParagraph 10: In 416, Yao Xing went to the vacation palace at Huayin (), and he had Yao Hong formally serve as regent at Chang'an and stay in the palace.  Yao Xing grew gravely ill at Huayin, however, and was on the way back to Chang'an when his attendant Yin Chong (), a conspirator with Yao Bi, planned to assassinate Yao Hong when he comes out of the palace to welcome his father.  Yao Hong's associates, however, heard rumors of the plot and persuaded him not to come out of the palace.  Yin Chong's assistant Yao Shami () then suggested to Yin that they deliver Yao Xing to Yao Bi's home and start a rebellion there, but Yin hesitated and did not carry this suggestion out.  As soon as Yao Xing returned to the palace, he ordered that Yao Bi's home be searched and that all weapons be seized.  When Yao Yin () the Duke of Nanyang, another brother who was in alliance with Yao Bi, then attacked the palace with Yin Chong, planning to put Yao Bi on the throne, Yao Xing publicly ordered that Yao Bi be forced to commit suicide, causing Yao Yin's force to collapse.  The next day, Yao Xing, after entrusting Yao Hong to his brother Yao Shao () the Duke of Dongping, Liang Xi, Yin Zhao, and Lian Manwei (), died.  Yao Hong initially did not announce news of Yao Xing's death, but did so only after executing Yao Yin and Yao Bi's other associates—including Lü Long the Duke of Jiankang and the former prince of Later Liang, and Yin Yuan ().  Yao Hong then took the throne and, not using the secondary imperial title that his father had used (\"Heavenly Prince\" (Tian Wang)), directly claimed imperial title.\n\nParagraph 11: Sixteen civilians were taken by coach to a military training facility in Florida, and were quickly subjected to the four drill instructors' aggressive induction processing. After receiving haircuts more suitable for the military, the recruits were taken to their Barracks where they would sleep and eat for the rest of the process. Within five hours of arrival, Katherine was already having doubts about being in Boot Camp and after feigning illness, decided to quit the game. Meyer immediately became seen as a troublemaker, finding it hard to take the process seriously, and was soon disliked by the most of the squad, but after encouragement from Thomson, prepared a damage limitation speech, apologizing and asking the others for a second chance over breakfast. Although many of the female recruits were convinced by the speech, the males were more skeptical. After a random selection process, Wolf was named as the first Squad Leader. On a 1.5-mile run, Haar's physical limitations became clear to the others, but despite a struggle she pushed through and completed the run. During the mission, the core group of strong males – Wolf, Moretti, Jackson and Park - upset Brown, who felt that they were treating the females as inferiors, and along with Meyer, she rallied the women to vote out Park in order to prevent themselves from being picked off by the stronger members of the squad. Park confronted Meyer, leading to the men agreeing to target him. At Dismissal Hill, the vote was close, but eventually Meyer and Brown's campaigning paid off, and Park became the first to be dismissed in a vote of 7-6-1-1. Due to Katherine leaving the game, Park was not given the chance to discharge any of the remaining members of the squad.\n\nParagraph 12: Florence Mills (Florence Winfrey) was born a daughter of formerly enslaved parents Nellie (Simon) and John Winfrey in 1896 in Washington, D.C. She began performing as a child. At the age of six she sang duets with her two older sisters, Olivia and Maude. They eventually formed a vaudeville act, calling themselves the Mills Sisters. The act did well, appearing in theaters along the Atlantic seaboard. Florence's sisters eventually quit performing, but Florence stayed with it, determined to pursue a career in show business. She joined Ada Smith, Cora Green, and Carolyn Williams in the Panama Four, which had some success. She then joined a traveling Black show, the Tennessee Ten, and in 1917 she met the dance director and acrobatic dancer Ulysses \"Slow Kid\" Thompson (1888–1990), to whom she would be married from 1921 until her death.\n\nParagraph 13: As attacks on merchantmen continued, the United States government eventually authorized the United States Navy to send a second squadron to blockade Tripoli and attack their ships. In May 1802 Captain Daniel McNeill in USS Boston assisted two Swedish frigates in a battle while blockading Tripoli. In the action several Barbary vessels sortied and the Americans and Swedish frigates fought off the attack which then forced the Tripolitans back into harbor. In June 1803, USS John Adams and USS Enterprise defeated nine enemy gunboats and a polacre near Tripoli. The polacre was sunk and the gunboats forced to flee, the Americans suffered no casualties. The second squadron returned to the United States in 1803 and that same year another force was sent and operated until 1804. On October 31, 1803, USS Philadelphia grounded on a reef just off Tripoli Harbor. Under heavy fire from enemy shore batteries the Americans attempted to refloat their ship but she was hard aground. When Tripolitan gunboats approached for her capture, her commander surrendered his ship and was made a slave along with the crew. Philadelphia was then manned by the Tripolitans as a sort of harbor defence until February 16, 1804. On that night Lieutenant Stephen Decatur in the ketch  boarded and recaptured Philadelphia and scuttled her by fire. This was the most remembered action in the battle for Tripoli. Decatur became famous immediately after this and had a long career of serving the American navy with distinction. He later commanded American forces during the Second Barbary War in 1815.", "answers": ["Paragraph 8"], "length": 3925, "dataset": "passage_retrieval_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "14401d92671b49bad0f04dd9f6b18106b13f9d2bed624f1a"}

Walton sprained his left ankle in the first half of the game. Michigan defeated Houston Baptist 82–57 on December 5. With Walton sidelined, LeVert started at point guard. On December 8, Michigan lost 82–58 to (19/-) SMU as LeVert slumped on 1–13 field goal shooting. On December 11, Albrecht announced he was ending his college basketball career due to injuries. On December 12, Michigan defeated Delaware State 80–33, as six Wolverines scored in double figures. The last time Michigan had six players in double figures was January 26, 2002, when the 2001–02 Wolverines did so against . The 33 points allowed by the Wolverines are the lowest since the 2011–12 Wolverines allowed 33 to  in its season opener on November 11, 2011. Michigan held Delaware State to just 24-percent shooting from the field, the lowest shooting percentage by any Michigan opponent since  shot 22.2 percent on November 13, 2010 against the 2010–11 Wolverines. Robinson made his first start of his career, and Andrew Dakich made his season debut. On December 15, Michigan defeated Northern Kentucky 77–62. LeVert finished with 13 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists, becoming the fourth player in Michigan program history to record a triple-double, and the 49th Wolverine to eclipse 1,000 career points. Walton returned from an ankle injury that sidelined him for three games, and posted 16 points, one rebound, one assist and one steal. On December 19, Michigan defeated Youngstown State 105–46. Walton finished with 10 points, 11 rebounds and 13 assists, becoming the fifth player in Michigan program history to record a triple-double. This was the first time in program history two players recorded triple-doubles in consecutive games. The win was the second largest in school history, behind only the 67–7 victory over Detroit Naval Station in 1919 and the game marked the second time since at least the 1996–97 season that any team had posted back-to-back triple doubles and the first time by different players. Based on his triple double against Northern Kentucky and a 19-point effort against Youngstown State, LeVert earned Co-Big Ten Player of the Week honors (along with Malcolm Hill) on December 21. On December 23, Michigan completed its preconference schedule with a 96–60 victory over Bryant. Michigan surpassed the single-game school record for three-point field goals made with 17, surpassing the previous record of 16 that the 2010–11 Wolverines had last achieved 5 years before to the day against the . On December 30, Michigan defeated Illinois 78–68 in its Big Ten Conference opener. LeVert posted a 22-point, 10-assist double-double and Mark Donnal had a career night with new career highs in points (26), rebounds (9), blocks (3), and minutes (28).\n\nParagraph 2: On 1 January 1989, at the group's annual New Year's Day meeting, Terraplane was disbanded by vocalist Danny Bowes and guitarist Luke Morley, who decided to form a new band under the name Thunder. Later in the month, the pair recorded a number of demos at Great Linford Manor Studios in Milton Keynes with producer Andy Taylor and engineer Ben Matthews, as well as Terraplane drummer Gary \"Harry\" James, who was brought in after the initially planned drummer failed to attend. According to Morley, the band name was chosen as a combination of two elements: a song he had written called \"Distant Thunder\", and Taylor's debut solo album. Enlisting Bad Company's Steve Price to play bass temporarily (Morley played bass as well as guitar on the Linford Manor demos), the group invited a number of record labels to their rehearsals in London, and later signed with EMI in April. Mark \"Snake\" Luckhurst joined Thunder as the group's original bassist on 2 May 1989, having been recommended by James after the two had performed together in Hellfire Corner. The band's lineup was completed with the addition of Matthews, who had earlier played keyboards for Terraplane's last two shows and engineered Thunder's January demos.\n\nParagraph 3: Often, either by choice or to conform with local regulations, cars are parked in driveways in order to leave streets clear for traffic. Moreover, some jurisdictions prohibit parking or leaving standing any motor vehicle upon any residential lawn area (defined as the property from the front of a residential house, condominium, or cooperative to the street line other than a driveway, walkway, concrete or blacktopped surface parking space). Other examples include the city of Berkeley, California that forbids \"any person to park or leave standing, or cause to be parked or left standing any vehicle upon any public street in the City for seventy-two or more consecutive hours.\" Other areas may prohibit leaving vehicles on residential streets during certain times (for instance, to accommodate regular street cleaning), necessitating the use of driveways.\n\nParagraph 4: Disston stood to gain up to  with his drainage contract, although it would displace numerous squatters. Florida's Armed Occupation Act of 1842 had granted land to squatters in order to force the local Seminole Indians off the land, but Disston's contract would force the squatters off any land that Disston could show was submerged. The drainage contract, however, was in jeopardy because it did not affect the massive debt bearing down on the Internal Improvement Fund. Court orders related to the debt threatened to derail the contract so Governor William D. Bloxham visited Disston in Philadelphia to persuade him to relieve the debt. During the visit, Disston tentatively agreed to purchase four million acres (16,000 km²) of Internal Improvement Fund land for 25 cents per acre, an agreement which became a formal contract on June 1, 1881. Disston signed the contract on June 14, and The New York Times described the transaction with, \"What is claimed to be the largest purchase of land ever made by a single person in the world\". It made him the largest landowner in the United States. On December 17, 1881, Disston sold two million acres (8,000 km²) of his land to English Member of Parliament, Sir Edward James Reed, for $600,000.\n\nParagraph 5: By the early 2000s, the genre began to decline in popularity with viewers, and certain hosts either saw their shows cancelled due to low ratings (such as Jenny Jones and Sally Jessy Raphaël), died (such as Wally George) or voluntarily ended their shows to pursue other interests (such as Ricki Lake). Many media analysts have attributed the decline in popularity of tabloid talk shows and daytime talk in general to competition from cable television and satellite television, and an increased number of women in the workforce (resulting in a corresponding decline in potential viewers for daytime television, a phenomenon that had also mostly killed off the tabloid talk show's predecessor in daytime lineups, the daytime game show, and would later force cutbacks in soap operas, another daytime staple, as well). Common presumptions indicated that viewers were tiring of the constant recycling of subjects that are often shown on such programs. Another explanation would be that the same audience shifted directly over to the new reality television and court show genre that rose to prominence at around the same time; most reality television and many court shows featured conflicts and raunchy material that would be normally seen in a tabloid talk show. (When Springer's show was canceled in 2018, it was replaced with a court show hosted by Springer.) As early as the late 1990s, hosts such as Oprah Winfrey, and to a lesser extent Montel Williams, began to distance their programs from the genre by refocusing them to incorporate more serious subject matter or staying on stage in the manner of more traditional talk shows. Another example of this trend was Geraldo Rivera ending his show in 1998 to focus on his CNBC talk show Rivera Live full-time. New talk shows also followed the trend of emphasizing less bawdy themes; The Ananda Lewis Show (which ran from 2001 to 2002) made a point of being an alternative to the tabloid style talk shows still airing at the time.\n\nParagraph 6: Beyond the Belle Vernon Bridge, the route enters Westmoreland County within Rostraver Township. Here, it has a partial cloverleaf interchange with PA 906, before it crosses into the borough of North Belle Vernon and interchanges with Fayette Street, to the northeast of the borough center. From this point, the expressway heads back into Rostraver Township where it meets PA 201 at a partial cloverleaf interchange northeast of the community of Lynnwood-Pricedale that also provides access to PA 837. I-70 continues through wooded areas with nearby development, reaching an interchange with SR 3011 north of the hamlet of Arnold City in adjacent Washington Township, Fayette County, before coming to a cloverleaf interchange with PA 51 as the route begins to enter the valley of the Youghiogheny River. Past PA 51, the route crosses the Smithton High-Level Bridge over the Youghiogheny River and CSX Transportation's Keystone Subdivision, where it enters South Huntingdon Township. From here, I-70 interchanges with SR 3031 north of the borough of Smithton, PA 31 at cloverleaf to the northwest of the Pittsburgh Renaissance Festival grounds, and SR 3010 to the southeast of the unincorporated village of Yukon, before it comes into Sewickley Township. In this area, the expressway has an interchange with Waltz Mill Road to the south of the borough of Madison, before it passes through Hempfield Township prior to entering New Stanton. Within the borough limits, I-70 has a dumbbell interchange with SR 3089, before it exits the mainline expressway at a trumpet interchange, to come to a toll plaza for the New Stanton interchange on the Pennsylvania Turnpike (I-76). At this point, the mainline expressway continues east to a cloverleaf junction between US 119 and the southern terminus of PA 66. I-70 itself passes through the toll plaza and comes to another trumpet interchange, where the Interstate merges onto the eastbound turnpike that heads toward the city of Harrisburg, the state capital of Pennsylvania. In the opposite direction, the Pennsylvania Turnpike heads northwest toward Pittsburgh, then becomes the Ohio Turnpike, which continues towards Cleveland.\n\nParagraph 7: Roughly once a month, a screening for Channel 101 occurs at the Downtown Independent theater in Los Angeles, with usually ten shorts being screened. At the screening, the audience votes on which pilots they would like to see return. The top five shows are entered into the \"prime time\" slots on the Channel 101 website, and get to make a follow-up episode for the next screening. This process continues with new \"episodes\" being shown at each screening until one fails to make the top five, at which point the series is cancelled. Some successful shows can choose to be cancelled voluntarily by running over five minutes, disqualifying the show from continuing and leaving one last un-voted episode. Shows that fail to make the prime time spot are known as \"failed pilots\". An added benefit of having a prime time series is that prime time directors are part of the panel that decides which five new pilots will be shown alongside the five established shows from the previous screening. Shows that fail to make the screenings are known as \"rejected pilots\". Each calendar year of the festival is referred to as a \"season\", comprising 10 screenings, due to there being no December screening, plus month break \"to allow the creators to rest\" between spring/summer and the November screening, which is the yearly awards show, called the Incredibly Prestigious Achievement Award or \"Channy\", so named as a parody of Emmy). The Channy Awards have been held 8 times as of 2012.\n\nParagraph 8: Mechanical self-steering units are made by a number of manufacturers, but most systems produced today share the same principle (servo pendulum rudder, see below). As well as their requirement for electric power, many long-distance cruisers observe that electronic self-steering machinery is complex and unlikely to be repairable without spare parts in remote areas. By contrast the vane gear offers at least the possibility of an improvised repair at sea, and can usually be rebuilt on land using non-specific parts (sometimes plumbing parts) by a local welder or machinist. To minimize the speed loss by the self steering gear it is essential to have the vessel's sails balanced with little load on the rudder before any attempt is made to engage the self steering. With the sails are trimmed correctly, the force-balance of the servo oar and the main or auxiliary rudder is minimized that way, that the lowest angles of attack of rudder and servo oar towards the water flow are achieved. Some experimentation and judgement is usually needed, however, to determine the proper settings for a given vessel and steering mechanism. A popular source on contemporary windvane technology is The Windvane Self-Steering Handbook. One particularly valuable contribution of Morris's book is his coverage of the variety of alloys used in vane gear manufacturing. Morris admits to his practice of setting a kitchen timer for a half-hour at a time and sleeping while the windvane steering device controls the helm, even in head winds of 25 to 35 knots. In a recent interview, he said he once narrowly missed being hit by a huge freighter while sleeping on his sail up the Red Sea. Morris points out, \"An autopilot wouldn't have made any difference in this case. If I had been using an electronic autopilot, that freighter still would have been there. I made a choice to sail two-thirds of my circumnavigation single-handed, and I accepted the risks that came with that decision. I guess fate was on my side.\"\n\nParagraph 9: The penetration of the Joos matriclan of Sine in the Wolof Kingdom of Waalo came via Lingeer Ndoye Demba. The Kingdom of Waalo was ruled by the Mbooj paternal family who went by the royal title Brak (title for the kings of Waalo). As well as this patrilineal mode of succession, a Brak had to belong to one of the main three royal matriclans before being eligible to succeed to the throne. These three maternal clans were the reigning maternal dynasties of Waalo and included: the Joos Maternal Dynasty (of Serer origin), Tedyek (of Fula origin although other sources suggests a Mende origin) and Loggar (of Moor origin). In Wolof, matriclans are called meen or mène, in Serer, they are called tim.  Succession was patrilineal (kurcala in Serer, meaning paternal inheritance or simanGol meaning paternal lineage) as well as matrilineal (ƭeen yaay or den yaay in Serer). Lingeer Ndoye Demba (princess of Sine) was given in marriage to the king of Waalo (Brak Caaka Mbooj) when he visited the Sine. The royal wedding took place in Sine, and after the marriage, the princess accompanied her husband to his country (Waalo). The Joos Maternal Dynasty although long established in Sine, and just one of the many Serer matriclans, it was the newest addition to the medieval maternal dynasties of Waalo. The other maternal dynasties of Waalo (Tedyek and Loggar) were already established.  The mother of Brak Caaka Mbodj was a Loggar and his first wife (Lingeer Isa Tanor) a Tedyek. Isa Tanor descended from the maternal line of Guet May Beut (the matriarch of the Tedyeks). For the next six hundred years since its foundation to the dissolution of Waalo in 1855, royal princes from these three maternal dynasties engaged in dynastic civil wars in order to secure their succession to the throne. In the 18th century, the prince Mö Mbôdy Kumba Khedy Mbooj (later – Brak Mö Mbôdy Kumba Khedy Mbooj, reigned c. 1734 – 1735, according to Amadou Wade), who was then the head of the Joos Dynasty galvanised the support of his maternal clan and led a massacre of the other maternal dynasties of Waalo, particularly the Tedyeks, the biggest rivals to the Joos. Many prominent members of the Tedyek clan were killed by the Joos including the reigning king at the time Brak Yerim Ndateh Boubou (Tedyek),  as well as his family. This historical event precipitated the Battle of Nder more commonly referred to as Talaata-i-Ndeer by the Senegambian people. The phrase \"Talaata-i-Ndeer\"  (or Talaata i Ndeer / Nder) means \"Tuesday of Ndeer\", signifying the fact the event took place on a Tuesday at the then capital of Waalo (Ndeer or Nder).\n\nParagraph 10: In 307 BC King Wuling of Zhao (born 356 BC, reigned 325-299 BC), a contemporary of Alexander the Great (356-323 BC), instituted a military reform called \"Hu clothes, Cavalry archery\" after having been repeatedly harassed earlier in his reign by Donghu horse-archers. In 300 BCE Qin Kai, a general taken hostage from the state of Yan (whose capital \"Ji\" is now Beijing), defeated the Donghu after having gained the esteem of the Donghu and learning their battle tactics. In 273 BC (26th year of King Huiwen) Zhao defeated the Donghu. In 265 BC Li Mu of the Zhao state, one of the four most prominent generals of the Warring States period, defeated the Donghu after stopping a major Xiongnu invasion. By the time of the rule of the Xiongnu Chanyu Touman (c. 220 BCE to 209 BCE), \"the Donghu were very powerful and the Yuezhi were likewise flourishing.\" When the Xiongnu crown prince Modu Chanyu killed his father Touman (in 209 BCE) and took the title of Chanyu, the Donghu thought that Modu feared them, and they started to ask for tribute from the Xiongnu, his best horses and even a consort of Modu's. Modu conceded. Not satisfied with this they asked for some of the Xiongnu territories. This enraged Modu who attacked and soundly defeated them, killing their ruler, taking his subjects prisoner, and seizing their livestock, before turning west to attack and defeat the Yuezhi (c. 177 BCE). This caused disintegration in the Donghu federation. Thereafter, the Wuhuan moved to Mt. Wuhuan and engaged in continuous warfare with the Xiongnu on the west and China on the south. As they came to be worn out from the lengthy battles, the Xianbei preserved their strengths by moving northward to Mt. Xianbei. When the Han dynasty vassal king Lu Wan defected to the Xiongnu in 195 BC he was created King of Donghu (東胡王) by the Xiongnu. This Kingdom of Donghu fiefdom lasted until 144 BC when Lu Wan's grandson Lu Tazhi defected back to the Han Dynasty. The Wuhuan (southern Donghu) inhabitants of the fiefdom continued as vassals of the Xiongnu until 121 BC. Gradually the name Donghu stopped being used. In the 1st century, the Xianbei (northern Donghu) defeated the Wuhuan and northern Xiongnu, and developed into a powerful state under the leadership of their elected Khan, Tanshihuai.Liu (1994)Lü (2002) \n\nParagraph 11: Madame Hydra's transport approaches Leviathan's base Long Winter. The Leviathan commander allows her to land. However, Leviathan wants something valuable in return: the box that Madame Hydra had procured from the Yashidas. Madame Hydra presents the Japanese box to Leviathan leader Magadan, much to the dismay of Viper. However, it is not intended for trade, but a gift. Viper frantically ask how she could betray everything she believes in. Madame Hydra responds that she had done this more than more and shoots her. Magadan shows glee at the death of one of Hydra's leaders. Madame Hydra then takes off her headdress to return to her identity as Valentina Allegra de Fontaine. Valentina has gotten back into her old clothing, before detailing to Magadan about Hydra. She explains that while Hydra is technologically advanced, they are struggling with recruitment and divided interests. Magadan's lieutenants then hook up the box and defrost one of the containers awakening its occupant Orion. As Orion clothes himself, Valentina and Magadan update him on the state of Russia. Orion then declares that they she \"taunt the Baron, tempt the Fury.\" Hydra arrives at Long Winter only to find it deserted except for a few squads left behind and the corpse of Viper. One Hydra agent brings to Baron Strucker a holographic recorder which projects an image of Orion (whom Strucker recognizes as Viktor Uvarov). When the device recognizes his voiceprint, Orion's message plays that despite the unfortunate mishaps between their two organizations during his sleep, they should meet at the Crown in three days. Ten days ago, the Leviathan delegation has arrived at the Hydra base called the Crown in Kyoto. Kraken tells Baron Strucker that there are three arriving. Among them is Magadan, Orion, and obviously their traitor. Orion, Magadan, and Valentina Allegra de Fontaine have arrived to meet with the leaders of Hydra. Valentina is more shocked to see Viper alive with tentacles on her head and having regained her status as Madame Hydra. As the meetings begins, Orion gives out an offer of subservience from Hydra. Baron Strucker refuses to and orders Gorgon to kill him. However, Orion survives a stab to the shoulder from Gorgon as Magadan whacks him away with his hammer. It is then that a Leviathan squadron attacks. It is now all-out war between Hydra and Leviathan. Both terrorist organizations have gone extreme in their methods taking out entire bases without regard for civilians. Eventually, the Leviathan thought to make a ceasefire only for Magadan to get assassinated. In retaliation, Leviathan took out a Hydra recruitment center in Seattle.", "answers": ["Paragraph 3"], "length": 3611, "dataset": "passage_retrieval_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "cc3afdddf51c3def11af4ba5df8c9718becd1ebb4fa3ca4f"}

Lacey accompanies Jacobs in his matches and often gets involved by throwing powder, stomping opponents, or interfering. There are also instances where Haze fights with Lacey and vice versa. The matches result in wins and losses for different individuals, ultimately culminating in Jacobs winning his feud with Whitmer despite getting injured in a Steel Cage Match.", "context": "Paragraph 1: During the 16th century, the long-running feud continued.  Edward Cunningham of Auchenharvie was slain in 1526 and Archibald Cunningham of Waterstoun in 1528; the Montgomery's Eglinton Castle was burned down by the Cunninghams in the same year.  In April 1586, Hugh Montgomery, 4th Earl of Eglinton, aged twenty-four, was traveling to Stirling to join the Court having been commanded to attend by the King, accompanied only by a few domestic servants. He stopped at Lainshaw Castle to dine with his close relative, a Montgomery, the Lord of Lainshaw, whose Lady was a Margaret Cunningham of Aiket Castle, with sisters married to John Cunningham of Corsehill and David Cunninghame of Robertland. It seems that a plot to kill the Earl had been organized and the Lady or some say a servant girl who was also a Cunningham, climbed to the battlements after the meal to hang out a white table napkin and thereby sprung the trap. Thirty Cunninghames attacked the Earl as he crossed Annick Ford and cut his servants to pieces; the Earl himself was dispatched with a single shot from the pistol of John Cunningham of Clonbeith Castle. His horse carried his dead body along the side of the river, still known as the 'Weeping', 'Mourning', or 'Widows' path. A wave of bloody revenge swept over Cunninghame and elsewhere. Cunningham relatives, friends, and supporters were killed without mercy. Aiket was killed near his home; Robertland and Corsehill escaped to Denmark. Clonbeith was traced to a house in Hamilton, possibly Hamilton Palace and hacked to pieces by Robert Montgomery and John Pollock. Robert also killed the Earl of Glencairn's brother the Commendator of Kilwinning Abbey, Alexander of Montgreenan, thought to have instigated Hugh's murder. He rode to Montgreenan and shot the Commendator at his own gate. The government of King James VI of Scotland eventually managed to make the chiefs of the two clans shake hands. In 1661 Lord High Chancellor William Cunningham, 9th Earl of Glencairn, married Margaret Montgomery, daughter of Alexander, 6th Earl of Eglinton, drawing a line under the feud.\n\nParagraph 2: The Fiesta Bowl scandal in particular was the catalyst that opened the BCS up to Federal interest for the first time, largely because the government is concerned not only about the BCS's stifling of fair competition, but more importantly for the Federal Government about the possibility of fraud and tax evasion, if the BCS has violated the rules governing tax exempt organizations and groups that control tax exempt organizations. If the BCS Bowls, who are each separate entities yet also part of the BCS as a whole as well were to lose their tax exempt status, they could be liable for back taxes totaling hundreds of millions of dollars. The Fiesta Bowl abuses – especially those regarding alleged illegal and improper political contributions,  excessive executive compensation and unjustified reimbursement payments, and the making of excessive, interest free and un-repaid loans – are precisely the types of abuses that would justify the Internal Revenue Service in stripping the BCS, and each BCS Bowl and possibly even each BCS Conference school (although that is highly unlikely) of their tax exempt status. In the worst-case scenario the BCS could also be subject to forfeiture and seizure proceedings. While the worst penalties are unlikely to be enforced, even the milder penalties, such as a determination of a cartel and trust, would have devastating consequences for the BCS and the current system. The court could also order a resolution of the current unfair competition inherent in the structure of the BCS, including ordering a playoff system and ordering the Bowls to participate as the court directs rather than as the bowls had planned in the case of the BCS's demise. Despite Big 10 Commissioner Delaney's assertion that if the BCS were to fold they would \"go back to the old system\" if a court ordered a solution such as a playoff the Conferences would have no choice in the matter, and would be required – especially if a determination is made that the BCS is an illegal trust or cartel – to do whatever the court says, including submitting to federal oversight of the Bowl's and Bowl teams' finances and administration, and conducting a 4, 8 or 16 team playoff, or whatever other remedy the court ordered in their holding. The structure, timing and participants in such a system would be completely out of the hands of the individuals and groups who now control those decisions, and those same individuals and groups would, in all likelihood, not be given the choice of not participating. A court ruling could require them to participate just as they are now, but they would be required to do so based on the court's rules rather than the BCS rules. This is one of the main reasons that the BCS is fighting against government intervention so strongly. The Department of Justice inquiry is far and away the most potentially dangerous legal situation that the BCS has faced to date.\n\nParagraph 3: However, by the early 1970s, crime was increasing in Harvey, a poverty-stricken and blighted suburb  south of Chicago, and several significant criminal incidents occurred at or near the mall, including three murders in one year alone. In November 1972, a young woman was fatally shot near the mall in a botched robbery attempt. On April 20, 1973, another person was shot and killed in a robbery on the mall property itself. On July 17, 1973, a teenage girl was lured away from the mall by three other teenage girls, and strangled to death. From 1973 to 1978, Dixie lost many stores, including the Montgomery Ward anchor, which closed on October 4, 1976 and Turn Style which closed in January 1978. In a last-ditch effort to bring back shoppers and tenants, the mall changed its name to simply Dixie Mall in late July 1975, and soon after underwent a renovation, re-opening on October 9 of that same year. These efforts failed, as by 1978, it was down to its final twenty stores. The mall officially closed its doors in November 1978, with JCPenney closing in January 1979. A 1978 article in the Chicago Tribune indicated that two major factors in the mall's closure were shoplifting and theft of merchandise by employees.\n\nParagraph 4: When Deng Xiaoping took over as the paramount leader of the People's Republic of China (PRC), he presented himself as a pragmatic contrast to his predecessor Mao, who was more of a theorist and an ideologist. Deng's main goal was to lift people out of poverty and significantly improve the lives of ordinary Chinese people. In justifying opening up and the series of economic reforms that ensued, Deng referred to Marx and his theories, which predicted that nations need to undergo urbanization and a stage of capitalism for a natural socialist transition. One of the most renowned reforms under Deng was establishing four \"special economic zones\" along the Southeastern coast of China, with Shenzhen, Shantou, and Zhuhai located in Guangdong province and Xiamen located in Fujian province. Special economic zones (SEZs) in mainland China are granted more free market-oriented economic policies and flexible governmental measures by the government of China, compared to the planned economy elsewhere. This allows SEZs to utilize economic management which is more attractive to foreign and domestic businesses. In SEZs, \"...foreign and domestic trade and investment are conducted without the authorization of the Chinese central government in Beijing\" with \"tax and business incentives to attract foreign investment and technology\".Trade was originally controlled by China's centralized government. However, these special zones are where market-driven capitalist polices are implemented to entice foreign investments in China. In 1986, China then added 14 additional cities to the list of special economic zones.\n\nParagraph 5: The sections 2 and 3 offences are intended to deter the more serious criminals from using a computer to assist in the commission of a criminal offence or from impairing or hindering access to data stored in a computer. The basic section 1 offence is to attempt or achieve access to a computer or the data it stores, by inducing a computer to perform any function with intent to secure access. Hackers who program their computers to search through password permutations are therefore liable, even if their attempts to log on are rejected by the target computer. The only precondition to liability is that the hacker should be aware that the access attempted is unauthorised. Thus, using another person's username or identifier (ID) and password without proper authority to access data or a program, or to alter, delete, copy or move a program or data, or simply to output a program or data to a screen or printer, or to impersonate that other person using e-mail, online chat, web or other services, constitute the offence. Even if the initial access is authorised, subsequent exploration, if there is a hierarchy of privileges in the system, may lead to entry to parts of the system for which the requisite privileges are lacking and the offence will be committed. Looking over a user's shoulder or using sophisticated electronic equipment to monitor the electromagnetic radiation emitted by VDUs (\"electronic eavesdropping\") is outside the scope of this offence.\n\nParagraph 6: Rocha e Silva was the son of a psychiatrist, João Olavo da Rocha e Silva. He studied at the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Brazil (later Federal University of Rio de Janeiro), lecturing in high schools while he was a student in order to support himself. Shortly after graduation he moved in 1937 to São Paulo, and was hired by the Instituto Biológico (Biological Institute), a state research institution. From 1940 to 1941, Rocha e Silva won a fellowship from the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation to go to London, England, where he studied and worked with Heinz Schild at the University College London. In 1942 he returned to the Instituto Biológico and continued his research line on the role of histamine in the effects of animal venoms. At the Institute, he was soon appointed as the chairman of the Section of Biochemistry and Pharmacodynamics, a position he held until 1957. In that year, Rocha e Silva was invited to be the chairman of the Department of Pharmacology of the recently created Faculty of Medicine of Ribeirão Preto of the University of São Paulo, in the city of Ribeirão Preto, state of São Paulo, a position he held until his mandatory retirement in 1980. His health condition worsened shortly thereafter, and he died on 19 December 1983, at the age of 73.\n\nParagraph 7: Brian Goodwin was born in Montreal, Quebec, Canada in 1931. He studied biology at McGill University and then emigrated to the UK, under a Rhodes Scholarship for studying mathematics at Oxford. He got his PhD at the University of Edinburgh presenting the thesis \"Studies in the general theory of development and evolution\" under the supervision of Conrad Hal Waddington. He then moved to Sussex University until 1983 when he became a full professor at the Open University in Milton Keynes until retirement in 1992. He became a major figure in the early development of mathematical biology, along with other researchers. He was one of the attendants to the famous meetings that took place between 1965 and 1968 in Villa Serbelloni, hosted by the Rockefeller Foundation, under the topic \"Towards a theoretical Biology\". The workshop involved, among other key scientists, Conrad Waddington, Jack Cowan, Michael Conrad, Jim Burns, Christopher Zeeman, Richard Lewontin, Robert Rosen, Stuart Kauffman, John Maynard Smith, René Thom and Lewis Wolpert. As a result of the conference talks and discussions, a four-volume proceedings of the event came out, becoming at the time a major reference in the area.\n\nParagraph 8: Despite wanting to host another Mediterranean Cup in 2005, Lebanon did not play another international until November 2006. With a place in the 2008 World Cup up for grabs, Lebanon were drawn in a group with Russia and Ireland. In Darren Maroon's first match as head coach, Lebanon beat Russia 22–8 in a tight and tense match at the New River Stadium in North London. Ireland however had already thrashed Russia beforehand and so Lebanon needed to beat Ireland in Dublin to go top of the table. Centre Daniel Chiha crossed over the line after 13 minutes, but the conversion was missed. John Koborsi then extended the lead for Lebanon and the team went into half time 0–10 up. However within 6 minutes after half-time, Ireland had scored two tries and they were now in front. A little later Chris Salem then intercepted a ball near his own line and ran the whole length of the pitch to score a spectacular try. This lead didn't last though and in the last minutes of the game Ireland scored a try to end the game 18–18. In 2007 the World Cup qualifying matches continued. In October the team travelled to Moscow and put nine-tries past Russia to win 0–48. This meant that their last match against Ireland was crucial. Because Ireland had a significantly better points difference then Lebanon, The Cedars needed a win to qualify, a draw or a narrow defeat was simply not good enough. At the end of the Russia match, despite the easy victory, Darren Maroon said that the team must make big improvements if they were to beat the Irish. Due to the volatile situation in Lebanon, The Cedars had to play their \"home tie\" in Dewsbury, England. A George Ndaira try in the first half meant that Lebanon went into half time on the wrong end of a 12–4 scoreline. Chris Salem immediately scored a try after the interval though and Lebanon were back in the game. In the 63rd minute prop Charlie Nohra was sent off, leaving Lebanon with 12 men and a huge upward struggle. Frank Samia scored a converted try near the end of the match and so Lebanon were ahead for the first time in the match. In the last minute the two points were taken away as a high-tackle gave Ireland a penalty which they scored to end the game 16–16. Lebanon had not done enough to secure a place in the World Cup.\n\nParagraph 9: The hills rise to a height of  on Walton Hill, with views over the Malvern Hills, Kinver Edge, The Wrekin, Wenlock Edge, Shatterford Hill, Clee Hills and back round to Kidderminster, Stourbridge, Dudley, Halesowen and Turners Hill. On a clear day observers can see as far as the Black Mountains of Wales, the northern Cotswolds, the southern Peak District and Charnwood Forest. A toposcope indicates the mountains visible. Landmarks visible from the hills include Dudley Castle, the large Droitwich AM transmitters near Bromsgrove, the large silos (now demolished for housing) on the Ex British Sugar Corporation land in Kidderminster, Ironbridge Power Station, near Telford and the nearby Wychbury Obelisk. It is because of this that the hills are very popular with hillwalking visitors and local ramblers groups. The hills are criss-crossed with many public footpaths.  A popular means of access to Clent Hill is from Nimmings car park, off Hagley Wood Lane.  From this an easy access walk route leads to the ridge.  Another popular access is from the public car park on Adams Hill. Adams Hill is not a separate hill, but the name for the hamlet (part of the parish of Clent) and the slope that form the south west flank of Clent Hill.\n\nParagraph 10: The events of Startling Odyssey II begin with the mad scientist Dr. Killbait attempting to resurrect one of the 8 \"Demon Dragons\" in an underground laboratory in the Hyneld Continent.  Dr. Killbait ultimately succeeds; however, the dragon escapes, destroying the laboratory in the process as well as destroying half of a town.  Elsewhere, the protagonist of the game, Knight Captain Robin Solford, and his two cohorts, Balmor Roatlette, and Harold Norman, are patrolling the Feidan Forest as a result of the recent reports of a chimera threatening the area.  Robin quickly senses the presence of the chimera and the three are subsequently attacked by the enormous beast.  Balmor and Harold draw their blades and attack it, but only to be thwarted by the chimera's massive natural armor, their swords shattering into pieces in the process.  As Balmor comments how it's invulnerable to their weapons, Robin proceeds to attack the chimera and fells it in one swing, slicing the great beast in two, much to the chagrin of Balmor and Harold.  Returning to Hyneld Castle, Robin meets with King Hyneld and is informed of the strange happenings in the neighboring town south of the Hyneld Kingdom (which so happens to be the same town from which the dragon escaped).  Robin then sees his adoptive sister, Patricia Hyneld, who professes her concern over his journeys.  Promptly he reassures her he will be alright and quickly leaves with Balmor and Harold.  As Robin and his friends investigate the underground laboratory they find an odd magical amulet which Harold attempts to read, but can't since the characters are too difficult. Presently, Hyneld Castle is attacked by the same dragon that had escaped.  Having never anticipated the attack of a dragon, the castle's guards are no match for the terrific onslaught and many are slain.  In an effort to avoid capture, several guards escape with Princess Patricia Hyneld via an underground passage.  As Robin, Balmor, and Harold continue to follow, the same dragon that attacked the castle appears and threatens to kill them.  Just as the dragon is about to attack, Balmor shoves Robin out of the room and collapses the entrance with a bomb he took prior to leaving the castle.  Estranged from his friends, Robin carries on, regretfully leaving Balmor and Harold to their inevitable fates.  Continuing on his new odyssey, Robin gets wind of the Princess being spotted in the Canary Continent.  As he heads there through a mountain pass, he encounters an old man who cautions him of the dangers of the area.  Without heeding his warning, Robin attempts to cross a bridge and subsequently an earthquake starts, collapsing the bridge and causing Robin to fall from the summit.\n\nParagraph 11: On December 8, Lacey accompanied Jacobs for his match against Colt Cabana. Lacey threw a handful of powder in Cabana's face when he had Jacobs in a submission causing a disqualification. Daizee Haze fought with Lacey until Jacobs speared Haze hard. Brent Albright ran down to the ring and, he held Cabana down while Lacey stomped him the groin. Whitmer then ran down to make the save. The next night, December 9, Lacey accompanied Jacobs to the ring as part the main event, pitting Delirious, Whitmer (accompanied by Haze), Cabana, and McGuinness against Bryan Danielson, Jacobs, Rave and Shingo. During the match, Whitmer inadvertently hit Lacey with a railroad spike. On January 27, Lacey accompanied Jacobs for his Last Man Standing Match against Whitmer which Jacobs won thanks to Albright. Later in the evening, Albright and Lacey lost to Cabana and Sara Del Rey who substituted for an injured Haze. But post-match, Haze attacked Lacey. On February 23, Lacey accompanied Jacobs and Albright to the ring for their losing effort against Nigel McGuinness and Cabana. Later in the evening Lacey defeated Haze after Jacobs interfered and speared Haze. The following night, February 24, Lacey accompanied Jacobs for his \"Windy City Death match\" against Cabana. Early on Lacey tried to interfere, but Haze ran out and brawled with her to the back. Later in the match Lacey returned to attack Cabana again, only to be taken out before he laid out Jacobs and put Lacey face down on top of him as he pinned him. On March 30, Lacey and Jacobs defeated Whitmer and Haze. Post-match Lacey said Jacobs finally won her over and she gave him a hug to reward him for a job well done. The following night, March 31, Lacey accompanied Jacobs to the ring for his Steel Cage Match against Whitmer (accompanied by Haze). During the match Lacey tried to interfere but was taken out by a tombstone pile-driver from Whitmer. Jacobs won the match, winning their feud despite injuring himself in the match.\n\nParagraph 12: Professor Franz Mueller is the proud owner of his self-built advanced scientific laboratory set in an old castle in the middle of the dry Arizona desert. Mueller specializes in research on the human brain and obsessively conducts experiments on brain tissue, believing that a human brain can be maintained even after a man's death. He also believes that the knowledge contained in a deceased person's brain can be transferred to another person. Mueller is assisted in his attempts to prove his theory by another scientist, Patrick Cory, and his young Czechoslovakian-American ward, Janice Farrell. Mueller is painfully aware of the fact that his assistants are attracted to each other, but since Mueller himself is in love with Janice he does everything in his power, including abusing his position as a boss, to assign Cory to additional late night work and use the fact that the young man is far too devoted to his work, to keep the two love-birds apart and improve his own chances. When a plane crashes in the desert close to the laboratory one night, Mueller is asked by the rangers investigating the cause of the crash to take care of the only surviving man until a physician arrives. The man dies before the doctor gets there and is declared dead. The physician, Dr. Martin, reassures Mueller that someone will come to take care of the body the next day, but while waiting for that person, Mueller decides to test his theory about brain maintenance. With the help of his instruments Mueller is able to detect that the man's brain is still alive enough to use. Before the body is reclaimed he and Cory remove the brain. They are also able to determine, from searching through the dead man's clothes, that the body belongs to an infamous investment banker named William H. Donovan.\n\nParagraph 13: According to the legend of \"O-shizu, Hitobashira\" the castle was constructed with a human pillar. During construction the stone base of the tenshu kept collapsing no matter how many times it was piled up. There was one vassal who suggested that they should make someone a human sacrifice (hitobashira) to appease the gods. O-shizu, a one-eyed woman who had two children and lived a poor life, was selected as the Hitobashira. She resolved to become one on the condition that one of her children was taken in by Katsutoyo and made a samurai. Standing in position the base stones were positioned around her, until they eventually crushed her to death. Her sacrifice allowed the construction to be successfully completed.", "answers": ["Paragraph 11"], "length": 3875, "dataset": "passage_retrieval_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "45287f8324f3b5dd565eaa3bd76efb753646da77fcbff46e"}

Lizzie upset Marlon when she preyed on his gullibility by pretending to be a psychic, causing Marlon to spend a fortune on phone bills pouring his heart out to her. He got his revenge by tricking her into paying back his money. His life was going smoothly until Moira Barton (Natalie J. Robb) began to work in The Woolpack. Marlon had a previous confrontation with Moira when she criticised his cooking. The two argued furiously at work as Marlon felt that she was invading his domain and finding fault with his food on purpose. It reached boiling point and Moira quit, which led to an angry Diane giving Marlon the cold-shoulder until he apologised. Marlon did so and Moira returned to work, as Marlon explained that since Donna left him, his job was the one area in his life where he felt in control and Moira had threatened that. They reached an understanding and became friends. When Marlon received a letter from Donna, saying that she had met someone else and wanted him to file for divorce, a devastated Marlon found himself turning to Moira as a shoulder to cry on. Because of this, he developed romantic feelings for her and convinced himself that she felt the same way. Going against Paddy's advice, Marlon finally confessed to Moira that he thought he was falling in love with her, leaving her shocked. She let him down and Marlon was left feeling humiliated. After a long heart-to-heart, she convinced him that she was flattered and that he would one day meet the right woman. Alongside this, Marlon also took in Charity and her young son, Noah (Jack Downham) after the family turned against her for trying to steal Cain's money. When Zak and Cain found out, they were angry and Cain punched Marlon in the stomach.\n\nParagraph 3: Sameera's mother questions the 3 of them about Sameera's whereabouts when they return home. Warda informs the mother that Sameera was kidnapped. Sameera's mother begins to shout and cry, she tells her husband and Hamza to report it to the police and find Sameera as soon as possible. Hamza and his father arrive at the police station to file a missing complaint but Sameera father freaks out and refuses to file a complaint. Once they arrive home Hamza informs his mother that their father refused to file a complaint. An argument breaks out between both parents as the father reveals he feels ashamed filing a complaint, he doesn't want his daughter's face all over the media and the whole world to know whats happened to her. He says to the mother we should just leave our faith in God and wait for the night to end, Sameera's mother is disgusted by her husband's words. Salmans parents arrive to comfort Sameerahs family. Salman's mother tells Warda privately that she thinks its best if Sameerah dies as Sameera has lost all her respect. Warda is shocked at the harshness of her mother's words & scolds her for being so insensitive. Salman returns from his job as a pilot and is informed by a crying Warda that Sameera is missing, he walks off to his room in anger. The next morning we see Sameera waking up in a field with her clothes ripped as strangers surround her. A woman stood nearby recognises Sameera, she quickly covers Sameera's body with a scarf and brings her home. Sameera younger sister Rohina is stood in the living room with Hamza and her mother when the woman enters with a half conscious Sameera. The next few days are difficult for Sameera as she struggles to recover from the trauma she has faced. Salman's parents & Warda come to visit Sameera but Salman refuses to see her. Both families gather in Sameerahs room. Warda asks Sameera how are you feeling prompting Sameera to lash out and reveal that her father chose to protect Warda instead of her. She accuses her father of presenting her to the rapists, she tells Hamza the rapists didn't take me, my father handed me to them. Sameera's father begins to cry and defend his actions, he claims he had no choice but to save  Warda as she is his daughter in law and his best friends daughter. He asks Sameera can't you forgive your father to which Sameera replies fathers are not like this, the Sameera you knew is dead. The scene ends with the father walking out the room in tears.\n\nParagraph 4: Panzer Lehr's panzer regiment had a battalion each of Panther and Panzer IV available. Moreover, all the battalions in both panzergrenadier regiments were transported by tracked, armored vehicles, such as the Sd.Kfz. 251 halftrack. This is in contrast to ordinary Wehrmacht panzer divisions, where only the first battalion in the first panzergrenadier regiment was equipped with halftracks, with the remaining battalions equipped with trucks. The division's engineer and reconnaissance formations were also equipped with armored vehicles, the armored reconnaissance battalion having a company of the new Sd.Kfz 234/2 Puma armored cars. The division's panzer regiment also had the 316. Funklenk-Panzerkompanie (abbreviated 1./s.Pz. Kp. 'Funklenk' 316) (\"316th Remote Control Panzer company\") attached while in Normandy; this company was originally equipped with ten Tiger I tanks, and was allocated the first five of the new Tiger II tanks that are not used in Normandy since it broke down en route and been replaced by 9 Sturmgeschütz self-propelled guns, which fought at Tilly and St. Lo until destroyed, at which point the 316th Company was disbanded. The division's panzer regiment had a total complement of 208 operating tanks and assault guns (10 Panzer III, 9 StuG III, 97 Panzer IV, 86 Panthers and 6 Tigers) as of 6 June 1944 plus nine tanks and assault guns under repair (1 Panzer III, 1 StuG III, 2 Panzer IV, 3 Panthers and 2 Tigers). It also had 31 Jagdpanzer IV in its Panzerjäger battalion. Another unique feature of this formation was that its panzergrenadiers were, for a large part, dressed in the double-breasted Sturmgeschütz jacket, instead of the standard field blouse worn by other German Army (Heer) units.\n\nParagraph 5: famous international Motorsport newspaper ) for sporting and competitive merits. Following is successes in 1984, he remained in the same team as well in 1985, spending a large part of the season testing and developing the electronic injection system on the VW Brabham-Judd factory engine and also a system of special air shock absorbers on the flat-bottomed Ralt RT30, devoid of coil springs, but another serious accident put an end to his season. Shortly supported by sponsors he participated in a partial season of Formula 3000 in 1986 with little success. In 1987, he came back to Italian F3 with Automotor, Coloni and Euroteam and also became a test driver for Minardi in F1. In 1988 he made one more Formula 3000 start as well as making his only American Racing Series appearance.  In 1989 he returned to F3000 for 2 more starts and also drove the Mussato Lancia LC2-Ferrari in the World Sport Prototype Championship. In 1990 he signed on as the official test and reserve driver for the Life team in Formula One, however, as the team only had a single chassis, he reportedly only drove in few practice sessions. The Life team and car was a colossal failure and failed to pre-qualify for the first 14 events of the 1990 Formula One season before the team shut down. In 1991 he has the American experience in the IndyCar Championship with the Euromotorsport Lola-Cosworth DFS. Later he decided to prepare a Ferrari F355 for the GT3 category and he did it independently with his own company, the Supertech Racing team. He deserves credit for having brought Ferrari cars back to compete in international GT championships and endurance races such as the 24 Hours of Daytona. And this has probably convinced Ferrari to reconsider the importance of GT racing for sporting customers. At the wheel of the Ferrari F355 GT3 he raced in the French, Spanish and Italian GT Championships, with some good results in the top three and 2 wins, before retiring to become a racing instructor and F1 Powerboat team manager for the D.A.C. Racing team winning 2 European Championships, 8 World Championships and 2 World speed records. He is currently involved in motorsport management and collaborates as a motorsport technical commentator with a major European pay per view network. He also manages a small executive flight company owned by him and he often personally flies planes of this company\n\nParagraph 6: As E. H. Gifford puts it, \"The fact that Jeremiah had written one such letter to the captives seems to have suggested the idea of dignifying by his name another letter not written in reality till many ages after his death.\" Against the traditional view, most contemporary scholars agree that the author was not Jeremiah: one exception is the Roman Catholic commentator F. H. Reusch. The chief arguments put forward are literary quality, as well as the religious depth and sensitivity. J. T. Marshall adds that the use of \"seven generations\" (v. 3) rather than \"seventy years\" (Jer 29:10) for the duration of the exile \"points away from Jeremiah towards one who deplored the long exile\". The author may have been a Hellenistic Jew who lived in Alexandria, but it is difficult to say with certainty. The earliest manuscripts containing the Epistle of Jeremiah are all in Greek. The earliest Greek fragment (1st century BC) was discovered in Qumran. Gifford reports that in his time \"the great majority of competent and impartial critics\" considered Greek to be the original language.  As one of these critics O. F. Fritzsche put it, \"If any one of the Apocryphal books was composed in Greek, this certainly was.\"  The strongest dissenter from this majority view was C. J. Ball, who marshalled the most compelling argument for a Hebrew original. However, Yale Semitic scholar C. C. Torrey was not persuaded: \"If the examination by a scholar of Ball's thoroughness and wide learning can produce nothing better than this, it can be said with little hesitation that the language was probably not Hebrew.\"  Torrey's own conclusion was that the work was originally composed in Aramaic.  In recent years the tide of opinion has shifted and now the consensus is that the \"letter\" was originally composed in Hebrew (or Aramaic).\n\nParagraph 7: Bichurin was born in Akulevo to a Russian half-Chuvash priest named Iakov and Russian mother Akulina Stepanova. He studied at a church choir school in Sviiazhsk and later at the Kazan Theological Seminary. He also studied Latin, Greek and French and his abilities were noticed by Archbishop Amvrosij Podobedov of the Russian Orthodox Church.  He taught in Kazan Theological Seminary from 1799 and was anointed a monk in 1800 with the name of Iakinf  or Hyacinth and tonsured, sent to promote Christianity in Beijing, where he spent the next 14 years. The genuine objects of his interest were Chinese history and language. He was forthwith accused of lacking religious zeal, and when he appeared in Irkutsk with his lover Natalia Petrova, some of his students reported him. Complaints over other behaviours considered inappropriate for a priest kept coming.  After several changes in the Russian orthodox mission, the Synod declared Bichurin guilty on 4 September 1823, stripped him of his  archimandrite monk rank and incarcerated him for life in the Valaam Monastery. Here he translated a number of ancient and medieval Chinese manuscripts, which had previously been unknown in Europe. In succeeding decades he published many volumes on Chinese and Mongolian history, geography, religion (including pioneering the study of Chinese Islam), statistics, and agriculture. After the death of Tsar Alexander I and the rise of Nikolai I in 1825, some of Bichurin's friends helped obtain a royal pardon. They also suggested a position for him as an interpreter in the Foreign Ministry. Bichurin then moved to take up a position in St Petersburg. He was elected as a corresponding member of the Academy of Sciences in 1828 and also became an emeritus librarian at the Petersburg Public Library. In the same year he published a \"Description of Tibet in the Modern Age\". He continued to clash with the church authorities and refused promotions. Tsar Nikolai I intervened in 1832 and forbade him from refusing promotions and ordered him to live in the Alexander Nevskii monastery.\n\nParagraph 8: His novels include The Fuck-up, Manhattan Loverboy, Dogrun, Chinese Takeout, Suicide Casanova and Unlubricated. He has also published a collection of plays, East Village Tetralogy. He has written three books of poems and one book of plays. In 2005, Nersesian received the Anahid Literary Prize for Armenian Literature for his novel Unlubricated. Nersesian is the managing editor of the literary magazine, The Portable Lower East Side, and was an English teacher at Hostos Community College, City University of New York, in the South Bronx. His novel Dogrun was adapted into the 2016 feature film My Dead Boyfriend. His novel The Five Books of (Robert) Moses is 1,506 pages long, took him more than 25 years to write, and was published on July 28, 2020.\n\nParagraph 9: After losing older players to the London clubs for years, the club decided to launch a men's EBL Division 3 team in 2004. In their first season the club finished third in Division 3 South East. The initial season saw a number of the club's former junior players return to the Crusaders to be joined by a number of local players. In their second season the team quickly progressed, winning the 2005/06 EBL Division 3 South East and making the finals of the National Shield. The club also signed their first foreign player, 6'10 Canadian Walter Moyse and foreign coach assistant, Dane Mads Olesen. The 2005/06 team was led by Walter Moyse, Paul Jessop and Robbie Parker, and featured 14-year old Ryan Richards, a 2007 Nike Hoop Summit World Team Player and a 2008 Euroleague Final Four: Nike International Junior Tournament player with Real Madrid. The Crusaders got promoted to EBL Division 2 and were renamed the Kent Crusaders in summer 2006. While the club signed a number of new players it also lost Moyse, Parker and Richards to contracts in Europe. Initially the remaining players and new signings London Towers players Sam Betts and James Acres, Reading Rockets guard Damion Lyons, former Crusaders junior Angelo Irving and East London's Gary Davison and JP Dontoni, fared well, winning the first three league games, before fading down the stretch and only being assured another season in Division 2 in the last round of games. On 2 April 2007, Jesse Sazant stepped down as head coach to concentrate on a role as chairman and director of basketball, passing the coaching reins to Mads Olesen. The 2007 offseason season saw the Crusaders lose team leaders captain Paul Jessop, leading scorer and starting point guard Gary Davidson, big man Angelo Irving, guard James Parker, forward JP Dontoni, and forward James Acres, but in his new role as Director of Basketball Jesse Sazant managed to recruit young talented players to make up for the losses. Two young Barking Abbey Basketball Academy players, 6'0 18-year-old guard Rikki Broadmore (Under 18's Reading Rockets National League and Cup champion) and 6'6 forward, 18-year-old former England Under 16's player Dan Garrad. Additionally 20-year-old JP Dimandja, a 6’6 forward with untapped potential and athleticism joined from Eastside Eagles. The team struggled early in the season as the young players adjusted to the physicality of men's basketball while the returning players adjusted to their new roles as team leaders, crashing out of the Patrons Cup and losing twelve of the first sixteen league games. The team was able to secure another season in Division 3 with three games to go with a key away win at Team Northumbria. The 2007/08 season also saw the start of the Kent Crusaders and Canterbury High School Basketball Sixth Form Academy. The academy accepted 12 players in its first year and was coached by Damian Lyons and Sam Bets. The academy focuses on developing player fundamentals and academy player Adam Brown managed to play in two games for the Crusaders men's team.\n\nParagraph 10: By the latter half of the decade, the majority of her screen roles were in obscure European films made in exotic locations as well as numerous British television dramas. In the 1986 German film, , which was shot in Thailand and loosely based on Joseph Conrad's 1915 novel Victory, Hamilton was cast as a saxophonist in an all-woman band touring seedy hotels and nightclubs in Southeast Asia. Her character, Julie, escapes a life of sexual slavery by fleeing with an eccentric German adventurer, played by Jürgen Prochnow, and the two of them take refuge on an island near Indonesia, which is already populated by a savage native warrior tribe. Also in 1986, Hamilton starred in the well-received television drama Johnny Bull, a film developed at the National Playwrights' Conference of the Eugene O'Neill Theatre Center and filmed in Tennessee. In this film, a period piece set in the mid-1940s just after VE Day, she was cast as Iris Kovacs, a lighthearted Cockney bride who travels to rural Pennsylvania to live with her new American G.I. husband (Peter MacNicol) and his working class Hungarian-immigrant coal-mining family; Colleen Dewhurst and Kathy Bates starred in supporting roles. That same year, Hamilton appeared as Emily Barkstone in Hold the Dream, the second of the three BBC miniseries based on Barbara Taylor Bradford's popular \"Emma Harte\" novels about the fortunes of a retail empire and the machinations of the business élite across three generations.\n\nParagraph 11: Scott Thomas Reeder was born in Pomona, California. In 1990 when Scott \"Wino\" Weinrich reformed The Obsessed, Reeder joined on bass and recorded two albums with the band including the landmark 1991 album Lunar Womb. Reeder left The Obsessed in 1992, and joined stoner rock band Kyuss who were without a bassist after the departure of Nick Oliveri. Reeder remained with Kyuss until they disbanded in 1995. After the breakup of Kyuss, Reeder auditioned for Tool but lost out to Justin Chancellor.

It states that prior to this period, farms were the dominant feature in the area, but with the construction of new homes and the opening of the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, there was a significant rise in population and urban development. These changes initially occurred more prominently on the East Shore before spreading inland towards the end of the decade. It also highlights demographic differences between the Mid-Island and East Shore areas, with the Mid-Island experiencing a larger Jewish transplant population, while the East Shore saw a heavy influx of Italian-Americans. However, it notes that these demographic differences are not present in the area today, with Italian-Americans now predominating the Mid-Island region.", "context": "Paragraph 1: On 27 June 1949, coal miners went out on strike, supported by the Communist Party and various unions. Bargaining quickly broke down between the unions and government and on 1 August, Prime Minister Chifley sent in troops from the Australian Armed Forces to run the mines until the dispute was resolved. By its fourth day, the Sydney docks were congested with coal ships unable to leave the port, the loading of ships being severely delayed by restricted transport. By 1 July the government was examining the possibility of importing coal from Britain. The strike lasted another 2 weeks, until 15 August. Later that year, PM Chifley also brought in legislation to begin the rationing of petrol. Both of these events became key issues in the 1949 federal election campaign.\n\nParagraph 2: On August 2, 2010, Ring of Honor announced that Haas and Benjamin would reform as a tag team, at Glory By Honor IX on September 11, 2010, to wrestle the ROH World Tag Team Champions The Kings of Wrestling (Chris Hero and Claudio Castagnoli). The duo later stated that they would collectively be known as Wrestling's Greatest Tag Team. At Glory By Honor IX Haas and Benjamin were defeated by Hero and Castagnoli in a non–title match. On December 8, 2010, Haas and Benjamin returned to Ohio Valley Wrestling, more than seven years after their previous match for the promotion. In their return match they defeated The Elite (Adam Revolver and Ted McNaler). The following day they took part in their first Ring of Honor Wrestling tapings, defeating the Bravado Brothers (Harlem and Lance). The following day, at the second set of television tapings, Haas and Benjamin defeated the All Night Express of Kenny King and Rhett Titus, before participating in an eight-man tag team match, in which Haas and Benjmain teamed with the Briscoe Brothers against the Kings of Wrestling and the All-Night Xpress. The match ended in a no contest. On December 18 at the Final Battle 2010 pay-per-view, Haas and Benjamin announced that in 2011 they would be wrestling regularly for Ring of Honor. At the following pay-per-view, 9th Anniversary Show, on February 26, 2011, Haas and Benjamin defeated the Briscoe Brothers in the main event of the evening to earn another shot at the Kings of Wrestling and the ROH World Tag Team Championship.\n\nParagraph 3: In 2012, Duke is happily reunited with Anna who pushes him away still shaken by her experience with Faison—as he'd been masquerading as Duke for months. Meanwhile, Anna is torn between her feelings for Duke and her current lover Luke Spencer (Anthony Geary). Duke gives her space and gets a job working for A. J. Quartermaine (Sean Kanan) at ELQ Industries. Anna finally breaks it off with Luke and reunites with Duke; they plan to attend Felicia's wedding to Mac Scorpio (John J. York) only for Duke to be left comatose after he falls into a trap set for Anna by Liesl Obrecht (Kathleen Gati) – the woman who had helped keep him captive on behalf of Faison. Duke awakens and Anna vows to make her pay. When Tracy Quartermaine (Jane Elliot) regains control of the company ELQ leaving Duke unemployed, he instead goes to work for media mogul, Derek Wells (William deVry). Meanwhile, Duke receives word that Julian Jerome is still alive. Duke worries for Anna when she leaves town to find Faison and when he tries to find her, he is taken captive by Faison. Anna rescues him and reunites Duke with a presumed dead Robin. The happiness is short lived as Duke learns that Wells is actually Julian and Duke immediately quits his job. Duke secretly partners up with mobster Sonny Corinthos (Maurice Benard) to bring down Julian once and for all. The alliance puts a strain on Duke and Anna's relationship and Duke quits Sonny's organization but they remain friends and Duke provides Sonny with a false alibi for the night of A. J.'s murder. However, Anna is forced to arrest Duke when his statement is revealed to be false. Duke refuses to turn on Sonny and is sent to Pentonville to await trial. Impressed by Duke's loyalty, Sonny makes a plea deal that sends him to prison and frees Duke and Duke agrees to run Sonny's organization in his absence. Duke and Anna split when he calls out her hypocrisy as she had also stepped outside the law to deal with Faison. Though he pines for Anna, Duke starts dating Lucy Coe (Lynn Herring). Sonny's enforcer Shawn Butler (Sean Blakemore) convinces Duke to hire former Jerome employee Jordan Ashford (Vinessa Antoine). However, Duke is disappointed to learn Jordan is an undercover cop and makes plans to eliminate her. Meanwhile, Lucy breaks up with Duke and encourages him to reunite with Anna. After they dance the tango at the Nurses Ball, Duke and Anna declare their love for each other and make plans to run away together and Duke calls off the hit on Jordan. However, before Duke and Anna can leave town, he falls victim to a botched hit from former enforcer Carlos Rivera (Jeffrey Vincent Parise). A wounded Duke manages to meet up with Anna only to die in her arms. Anna vows to avenge Duke and bring down Julian once and for all.\n\nParagraph 4: Brian announces that he is staying in the Gulf, extending his contract by two months. Lonely, Gail agrees to go for a drink with truck driver, Les Charlton, (Graham Fellows) but Nicky goes missing and is eventually found in the newly rebuilt number seven. A distressed Gail thinks about giving up her job and loses interest in Les. But Les's last visit coincides with Brian's return and he makes it very clear to Les that he is not welcome. Brian decides not to return to Qatar and admits having \"had a drink\" with a nurse and Gail realizes that his friendship with her was a lot closer than he is admitting. In August 1982, using the money he made in Qatar, Brian opens a garage in partnership with Ron Sykes and for a while, the Tilsleys are happy. In March 1983, things seem to be going so well that Brian takes out a bank loan and buys Ron Sykes's share of the garage. However, there is a change in fortunes – Brian's father, Bert (Peter Dudley), is seriously injured while overinflating a tyre at the garage and dies soon afterwards, and the business starts losing money – forcing Brian to put it up for sale. He is talked out of selling by Gail and Mike Baldwin, deciding to sell the house in Buxton Close instead, and move back in with Ivy. The Tilsleys' marriage now begins to crumble as living under the same roof irritates Ivy and Gail and when in August 1984, Gail is offered the job of manager at Jim's Cafe, she takes it – annoying Brian and Ivy. A couple of months later, there is more friction when Brian finds that Audrey's latest boyfriend, George Hepworth (Richard Moore), made a pass at Gail. By April 1985, Gail has had enough and leaves Brian, moving her and Nicky into a bedsit. This finally makes Brian get a council house so Gail and Nicky move in there with him.\n\nParagraph 5: Throughout its run as Kiss FM, the station was known in the community for the Kiss FM Sunday Night Dance Parties held in Conneaut Lake held during the summer months. With studios originally in Franklin, later moving to Meadville, the sense of community the station fostered was second to none. Weekly live broadcasts brought station personalities and community members together. The station had a very large staff of on air personalities with names such as \"Ted Bear\" (who was legendary Northwest Pennsylvania broadcaster Todd Adkins in disguise),\"Billy Valentine\",\"Drew Love\" and \"Cupid.\" All airshifts were live and local, and many radio personalities got their start at this once legendary station. Callers dedicated \"Goodnight Kisses\" each evening at 10pm, and overnight host \"Jason Valentine\" connected with many listeners with outrageous radio games and stunts. It was local small market radio at is absolute best, and was a textbook training ground for new talent. Program Director Todd Adkins took pride in his station and was always a caring man to his staff, encouraging them to grow and develop their on air talent. Mascot Tookie the Toucan greeted Northwest Pennsylvanians at numerous public and community events and appearances. The 24-hour live, local airstaff provided great local radio and content from 2000-2006. The final year and a half of the station brought the loss of 24/7 live disc jockeys, automation, and what would eventually be the beginning of the end of the golden era of Kiss FM. This coincided with the move of the studio from Franklin to Meadville, where it joined the other stations in the Forever cluster. General Manager Jim Shields did not see a need to staff the station as much, as he saw more money being spent on a staff who cared deeply for local radio an unnecessary burden. In late 2006, legendary Program Director Todd Adkins was let go after more than 20 years with the station, and the writing was then on the wall. Personalities such as Tyrel and Brett Hart took on air positions in a different market and were replaced by voicetracking and glitchy automation that rarely worked. From March 2006 to October 2007, the station went from a 24/7 live and local airstaff made up of 8 local on air personalities (including the then program director) and one off-air board operator to one off-air program director who had other duties within the company. A true sign of the sad state of corporate radio and a sad reminder of the once great station that Northwest Pennsylvanians no longer have in their community.\n\nParagraph 6: His younger son Henry Lutcher Brown served as active Vice President of the Yellow Pine Paper Mill Company of Orange, Texas.  This was the first mill in the world to make commercial paper from pine.  Mr. Brown also had the distinction of being the youngest National Bank President in the United States in the mid-1920's.  In 1924, Lutcher Brown opened the Brown Paper Company plant in West Monroe, Louisiana.  Built at a cost of more than two million dollars at that time, it was designed by architect James Gamble Rogers of New York, who also designed the Harkness Memorial Quadrangle at Yale University.  In 1935, Mr. Brown and his wife, Emily Wells Brown, moved to San Antonio, Texas, and built one of the most grand homes in the country.  Known as Oak Court, the home was designed by Atlee B. Ayers and his son Robert Ayers, and located in the Terrell Hills neighborhood of San Antonio.  The Brown family gave the home to the University of Texas System in 1965 for use as a conference center.  UTSA operated the Lutcher Center, named in honor of Mr. Brown's grandfather Henry Jacob Lutcher, in the 1970s and 1980s until it was sold to private owners in 1988.  The Lutcher Brown Endowment for Academic Excellence, created in 1983 through the sale of Oak Court, has long supported a broad range of activities at the University of Texas at San Antonio, and continues to fund several Distinguished Chairs.  The Brown family were very active in San Antonio society and the arts, and their generosity was responsible for the opening in 1970 of the Emily Wells Brown Wing of the Marion Koogler McNay Art Museum, which had an auditorium, several offices, a sculture pavilion, as well as a library.\n\nParagraph 7: Like all of Staten Island except for the North Shore, farms dominated the Mid-Island region until the 1960s, when new home construction began to rise sharply.  The opening of the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge in 1964 did much to stimulate this construction, but the effects of this phenomenon were first seen most profoundly on the East Shore, not spreading inland until nearly the end of the decade.  In addition to starting somewhat later, the population boom experienced in Mid-Island also exhibited some important demographic differences from that which took place to the east, as in Mid-Island Jewish transplants (from Queens as well as Brooklyn) tended to predominate, in contrast to the heavily Italian-American influx experienced on the East Shore.  These demographic differences are not present today with mostly Italian-Americans dominating the area.\n\nParagraph 8: Trained to business by his father, Henry Christy became a partner in the house of Christy & Co. in Gracechurch Street, and succeeded his father as a director of the London Joint-Stock Bank. He was still a board member of the bank at the end of his life, despite other activities. Henry contributed to the success of the family firm, known as W. M. Christy & Sons Ltd. once his father took it over. Samples of textiles he brought home from the Ottoman Empire provided the idea for looped cotton towelling, taken up by his brother Richard, and amenable to mechanical manufacture with a technique devised by an employee, Samuel Holt. Christy also innovated with woven silk rather than beaver for the manufacture of top hats.\n\nParagraph 9: Some scholars state that the fustanella was derived from a series of ancient Greek garments such as the chiton (or tunic) and the  (or short military tunic). Although the pleated skirt has been linked to an ancient statue (3rd century BC) located in the area around the Acropolis in Athens, no ancient Greek clothing has survived to confirm that the origins of the fustanella are in the pleated garments or chitons worn by men in ancient Athens. However, a 5th-century BC relief statue was discovered in Vari Cave, Attica, by Charles Heald Weller of the American School of Classical Studies at Athens, depicting a stonecutter, Archedemus the Nympholept, wearing a fustanella-like garment; the short tunic he wears is tied in folds in the waist like a fustanella, which was a common practice during agricultural or other manual labor. \n\nParagraph 10: The song's distinctive guitar riff is described by rock journalist Kris Needs as \"a classic stick-in-the-head like the Stones' 'Satisfaction'\". The riff's chords are D, E, and A and were created by Bowie and enhanced by Parker, who, according to Doggett, added the \"downward trail\" at the end of each line. Paul Trynka writes that Parker added \"a particular chord shape rather than the original single note just before the chord change and a distinctive 'beeeoonng' in the last line of the chorus just as [Bowie] sings 'I love you so'.\" Bowie later said, \"It's a fabulous riff! Just fabulous! When I stumbled onto it, it was 'Oh, thank you!\" Parker later said Bowie came up with the Stones-like riff to \"piss off\" Mick Jagger. Parker was upset upon learning he was uncredited on the final version. He stated: \"I can tell my own playing, and my own sound, and I know it's me.\" Flowers further recalled: \"David played the riff to Alan, Alan made sure it was good enough to record, then [Alan] played it.\" Although O'Leary compliments the riff, he notes that with Ronson's absence, it gets \"run into the ground\"; throughout the song's over four-minute runtime, the riff is solely absent in the two bridges and the \"hot tramp\" lines.\n\nParagraph 11:  PD1/3: In Autumn 1946, the Construction and Use regulations were revised, allowing a maximum width for buses of , rather than the previous , provided the Traffic Commissioners approved the use of wider buses on routes, in the same way as they already had the power to approve double-deck buses on a route-by-route basis. Also, the gross vehicle weight for a double-deck bus was increased to 12 tons, from the wartime figure of 11 tons. The PD1/3 differed from the PD1 in that it had wider axles, being designed for the 8-foot width. Oldham Corporation quickly obtained clearance for all their routes and in 1947 DBU244 with Charles H. Roe H31/25R body became the first 8-foot-wide motorbus built for service in the UK. Oldham took in total 50 similar buses in 1947/8. Manchester Corporation were also early customers for the wider bus, following up their initial 1946 batch of fifty PD1s with a 1947/8 order for 100 PD1/3 with 58-seat (H32/26R) bodies to their standard outline by Metro-Cammell. During 1948 Ribble Motor Services, who had obtained permission to use full-width double-deck coaches on their express services from East Lancashire to Blackpool, received 30 such bodies by H. V. Burlingham of Blackpool, which had full-width cabs, electrically powered folding doors to the rear platform, which itself was built-up to saloon level, allowing a small luggage boot. The body design, with additional luggage stowage over the rear wheel arches, had generously radial windows, two sunroofs on the upper deck and, although of lowbridge layout (the Leyland patent on this expired in 1937), were fitted out to full coach standards for 49 passengers (FCL27/22RD). Liberal use was made of chromium-plated steel trim and they carried the cream coach livery, with red relief, rather than the bus livery of red with cream relief, they soon became famous as the \"White Ladies\" was so successful that a further twenty similar vehicles on PD2/3 chassis with East Lancashire Coachbuilders bodies, were added in 1951.", "answers": ["Paragraph 7"], "length": 3010, "dataset": "passage_retrieval_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "f49faf714e393b121cde34594203f150390524a8ba41d294"}

He played for Gloucester for most of his career, but also had short stints at Cardiff RFC and Stroud RFC. He played a total of 291 games for Gloucester and won the John Player Cup in 1982. He also had a successful season in 1981-82, scoring 21 tries, which remains a record for the club. Teague was sent off three times, including twice against Bath. He retired from playing in 1995 and became the team manager for Gloucester.", "context": "Paragraph 1: Rouvoet applied at the Free University Amsterdam in June 1982 majoring in Philosophy of law and obtaining a Bachelor of Laws degree in July 1984 and worked as a student researcher before graduating with a Master of Laws degree in July 1986. Rouvoet worked as a political consultant for the Reformatory Political Federation (RPF) from September 1986 until November 1987 and for the Marnix van St. Aldegonde Foundation from November 1987 until May 1994 as a researcher from November 1987 until January 1989 and as director from January 1989 until May 1994. Rouvoet also worked as a political science teacher at an Evangelical School for Journalism in Amersfoort from September 1989 until July 1993. Rouvoet was elected as a Member of the House of Representatives after the election of 1994, taking office on 17 May 1994. On 22 January 2000 the Reformatory Political Federation and the Reformed Political League (GVP) choose to merge in a political alliance to form the Christian Union. Member of the Senate Kars Veling of the Reformed Political League was choose as the first Leader of the Christian Union and became the Lijsttrekker (top candidate) of the Christian Union for the election of 2002. The Christian Union had 5 seats in the House of House of Representatives previously held by the Reformed Political League and the Reformatory Political Federation and suffered a small loss, losing 1 seat and now had 4 seats in the House of Representatives with Veling being partially blamed for the defeat. Veling took responsibility for the defeat and subsequently announced his retirement from national politics and that he was stepping down as Leader and Parliamentary leader of the Christian Union in the House of House of Representatives in November 2002. Rouvoet soon there after announced his candidacy for the Christian Union leadership and won unopposed and succeeded Veling as Leader and Parliamentary leader in the House of House of Representatives on 12 November 2002.\n\nParagraph 2: The late antique order on Greece was irrevocably shattered with the Slavic incursions that began after 578. The first large-scale raid was in 581, and the Slavs appear to have remained in Greece until 584. Byzantium, confronted by long and bloody wars with Sassanid Persia in the east, and with the Avar Khaganate in the north, was largely unable to stop these raids. After the murder of Emperor Maurice in 602 and the outbreak of the great Byzantine–Sasanian War of 602–628, the Danube frontier, somewhat stabilized under Maurice, collapsed entirely, leaving the Balkans defenceless for the Slavs to raid and settle. The Slavic settlement that followed the raids in the late 6th and early 7th centuries affected the Peloponnese in the south and Macedonia in the north far more than Thessaly or Central Greece, with the fortified towns largely remaining in the hands of the native Greek population. Nevertheless, in the first decades of the 7th century the Slavs were free to raid Thessaly and further south relatively unhindered; according to the Miracles of Saint Demetrius, in  the Slavic tribes even built monoxyla and raided the coasts of Thessaly and many Aegean islands, depopulating many of them. Five of Thessaly's cities disappear from the sources during the 7th century, and Slavs settled in the northern and northeastern parts of the country. Emperor Constans II () undertook in 658 the first attempt to restore imperial rule, and although his campaign was mostly carried out in the northern Aegean coast, it seems to have led to a relative pacification of the Slavic tribes in southern Greece as well, at least for a few years. Thus during the great Slavic siege of Thessalonica in  the tribe of the Belegezitai, who according to the Miracles of Saint Demetrius were settled around Demetrias and Phthiotic Thebes, provided the besieged city with grain.\n\nParagraph 3: Teague spent his youth in The Shed watching Gloucester. After cutting his teeth with the local All Blues club, Teague joined the Cherry and Whites during the 1978–79 season aged 18 making 4 appearances, his debut coming at Kingsholm against Exeter University on 15 November 1978 in which he scored a try in a comfortable victory. He combined his rugby with his career as a fitter for the local water authority before becoming a builder in what was the amateur era, eventually setting up his own building firm with his brother-in-law. Known to Gloucester fans as 'Iron Mike' he played the majority of his club rugby for his home town club, but also had brief spells at Cardiff RFC for half a season and Stroud RFC with his close friend and Gloucester back row colleague John Gadd, before re-joining Gloucester on both occasions. During the later years of his senior rugby career he played for Moseley, before re-joining Gloucester once again to see out his playing days. Teague made a total of 291 appearances for Gloucester, winning the John Player Cup in 1982 (although they had to share the title with Moseley after a 12–12 draw in extra time – the only time the cup has ever been shared) and the John Smith's Merit Table in the 1985–1986 season. He was twice a runner up with Gloucester in National Courage League 1 (now the Premiership) in both the 1988–89 and 1989–90 seasons. He also played in the 1990 Pilkington Cup final defeat to Bath, scoring a try in both the 26–16 quarter final away win over Nottingham and the 17–12 semi final away win over Northampton that secured Gloucesters spot in the Twickenham showpiece. During the 1981–82 season he scored 21 tries, which remains the club's record for most tries scored by a forward in one season. He was sent off 3 times during his playing career, two of those red cards coming against local rivals Bath. His last game for Gloucester was against Harlequins at Kingsholm at the end of the 1994/95 season aged 34. At the start of the 1995–96 season Teague was appointed to the newly created post of team manager of the Gloucester first team.\n\nParagraph 4: Miller then began a minor feud with Kaz Hayashi, as Onoo has been previously Hayashi's manager and had left him to manage Miller. Ernest won several matches over Hayashi with Onoo's help, and also enlisted Perry Saturn as his ally. However, Saturn suffered many losses against inferior opponents due to Miller's botched interference, so the two faced off at Starrcade, where Saturn won. Miller continued coming out and challenging the fans, the wrestlers, and anyone else to try and take him out, feuding with Scott Norton. For a time, he started coming out with the snow machine and music of Glacier, which Onoo had \"purchased\", but it was short-lived, and he soon returned to his James Brown music. In March 1999, Miller and Onoo attacked fellow martial artist Jerry Flynn, with Ernest cutting off Flynn's ponytail as a sign of disrespect. They all faced off in Uncensored in a handicap match, but Flyinn defeated them both. Miller bounced back after some time, getting a win over Scott Norton after hitting him with a crowbar. He and Norton were scheduled to wrestle in The Great American Bash, but Norton was pulled out for health problems and replaced with Horace Hogan, who Miller defeated after kicking him with a steel-tipped red dancing shoe.\n\nParagraph 5: Quality management is a recent phenomenon but important for an organization. Civilizations that supported the arts and crafts allowed clients to choose goods meeting higher quality standards than normal goods. In societies where arts and crafts were the responsibility of master craftsmen or artists, these masters would lead studios and train and supervise others. However, the importance of craftsmen diminished as mass production and repetitive work practices were instituted. This approach’s aim was to produce large numbers of the same goods. The first proponent in the US for this approach was Eli Whitney, who proposed (interchangeable) parts manufacture for muskets, hence producing the identical components and creating a musket assembly line. The next step forward was promoted by several people including Frederick Winslow Taylor, a mechanical engineer who sought to improve industrial efficiency. He is sometimes called \"the father of scientific management.\" He was one of the intellectual leaders of the Efficiency Movement and part of his approach laid a further foundation for quality management, including aspects like standardization and adopting improved practices. Henry Ford was also important in bringing process and quality management practices into operation in his assembly lines. In Germany, Karl Benz, often called the inventor of the motor car, was pursuing similar assembly and production practices, although real mass production was only properly initiated in Volkswagen after World War II. From this period onwards, North American companies focused predominantly upon production against lower cost with increased efficiency.\n\nParagraph 6: Immediately after the start of the German invasion of the Soviet Union, Arkhipenko entered combat on the front lines of the Second World War with the rest of his regiment. On 15 October 1941 he made a dangerous landing on German-controlled territory to save a fellow pilot who had been shot down; however, during the landing, he broke the landing gear, forcing the two of them to make their way through the front lines to return to their regiment. For four days they hiked through enemy territory, and it wasn't until the end of the month that they made it back to their regiment. Despite being a flight commander he did not gain his first aerial victory until mid 1942 when he shared in the downing of a Dornier Do 215 on 28 June 1942 while flying a LaGG-3; it was not until after shooting down a Bf 109 on 8 August that year that he gained his first solo shootdown. Later in November he gained another shared kill of a Do 215, but the next month he was transferred to the 508th Fighter Aviation Regiment. Initially posted as a deputy squadron commander, he added several additional shootdowns to his tally and eventually gained a promotion to squadron commander before being reassigned to the 508th Fighter Aviation Regiment in October 1943. Earlier that year he had been wounded twice, first during an aerial battle in January and later in June during a bombing. Not long transferring to the 129th Guards Fighter Aviation Regiment in October 1943 as a squadron commander, he went on to rapidly increase his tally of shootdowns throughout 1944, having switched to flying the P-39 Airacobra. His last shootdown in the war and only shootdown in 1945 was a Fw 190 and took place on 17 January 1945 on the outskirts of Częstochowa. During the war he participated the battles of Kovel, Lutsk, Kiev, Kursk, Belgorod, Stalingrad, Kharkhov, the Dnieper, Kirovgrad, Yassko-Kishinev, Lvov-Sandomierz, and Silesia. By the end of the war he reached the rank of major and had been promoted to the position of deputy commander of the air rifle service within his unit; his tally stood at 28 solo and 15 shared shootdowns gained over the course of 467 sorties flown on I-153, LaGG-3, Yak-1, Yak-7B, and P-39 aircraft, engaging in 102 dogfights throughout the process. For his actions in the war he was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union on 27 June 1945.\n\nParagraph 7: At Afragola the regiment received 18 Sherman tanks and then loaded all tanks onto trains to be taken across country to Foggia and from there moved into a brigade harbour area near the village of Lucera. By now, Lord O'Neill had been given command of the regiment, with Colonel Dawnay moving on to brigade staff. After a week in harbour, the regiment was sent on tank transporters to Mignano near Monte Cassino, which had fallen some days earlier along with the rest of the Gustav Line. The fighting was not over, however, as the Adolf Hitler Line, now renamed the Senger Line, lay just six miles north, and it would be the next objective. The Horse was briefed for Operation Chesterfield, which was an assault by the 1st Canadian Division supported by tanks of the North Irish Horse and the 51st Royal Tanks. H Hour was to be at 6 am on 23 May. The plan required the 2nd and 3rd Canadian Infantry Brigades, supported by the two tank regiments, to break through the Hitler Line on a 3,000-yard front. The assaulting troops came under a withering hail of fire on the well-prepared killing grounds of the heavily defended German positions. The Horse took heavy casualties and had to regroup by merging depleted squadrons together. One tank slipped off a track and fell 50 feet into a ravine, rolling over on its turret and then back onto its tracks. The crew were shaken but unhurt, and the incident gave them another chance to display the marvellous climbing skills of the Churchill as they crawled slowly up the almost sheer walls of the ravine to re-enter the battle. During this battle, Major Griffiths again displayed great heroism and was later awarded the only bar to the MC that an officer of the regiment received. The total cost to the Horse in the engagement was 36 men killed in action and 32 tanks lost. This represented 60% of the regimental strength. The date of 23 May was later chosen as a \"Regimental Day\" to commemorate the bloodiest day in the history of the North Irish Horse, which lost more men than on any other day in two world wars. The breakthrough happened, however, and the German defenders began evacuating the position on the night of 23 May. Meanwhile, the allied advance continued.\n\nParagraph 8: On November 8, 1948, the Huaihai Campaign was about to start, so the nationalist department of defense decided to withdraw the 7th army and the 6th army from northern Jiangsu province to the nationalist military headquarters in Xuzhou.  Huang was ordered to wait for another KMT corps (44th corps) to arrive from the 9th pacification zone in Haizhou (海州) before he can travel across the Grand Canal, precious time of 2 days were wasted. He also made the crucial mistake of not securing a bridgehead on the grand canal, and the 320,000 communist soldiers of the  Eastern China Field Army under Su Yu caught up with him, and the 63rd corps under his command were wiped out of the 7th army's order of battle while trying route to cross the grand canal at Yaowan (窑湾) after finishing the rearguard duties. On the same day (November 8, 1948), as Huang continued to retreat toward Xuzhou, Communist underground members of the 3rd pacification zone suddenly revolted on the battlefield, surrendering 23,000 troops to the communist forces.  The nationalist headquarters in Xuzhou under Liu Zhi panicked and ordered the 13th army under Lieutenant General Li Mi, which was defending the east side of Xuzhou, to retreat to back to Xuzhou. Those developments allowed the communist forces to completely cut off Huang's 7th army from the rest of the nationalist forces by taking Caobaji (曹八集) and Daxujia (大许家) vacated by Li Mi's 13th army.  Chiang Kai-shek ordered the KMT 2nd army and 13th army to relieve the 7th army; But Lieutenant General Qiu Qingquan, commander of the 2nd army, was not eager to save his beleaguered colleague because of their previous feuds and feared the Communists might encircle his unit as well. Li Mi did try but his relief efforts were beaten back by the communist forces, despite the support of planes and tanks. After 15 days of brutal fighting, the 7th army was destroyed in Nianzhuang (碾庄) village, only 20 miles from Xuzhou. On the night of November 22, 1948, Huang Baitao committed suicide after he successfully broke out from his army headquarters with his deputy commander of the 25th corps, who smuggled his body and personal belongings through the communist security checkpoints.  Since Huang Baitao was one of the few KMT army commanders who chose death rather than being taken prisoner by the Communists, President Chiang Kai-shek personally arranged a state funeral for him. The Nationalist Government posthumously promoted him to four-star general and awarded him with his second Order of Blue Sky and White Sun. When the People's Liberation Army approached on Nanjing in the summer of 1949, the survivors of the 7th army transferred his remains to Taiwan.\n\nParagraph 9: When Alfonso XI died from the Black Death, during a siege of Gibraltar. The sons of Dona Eleanor Guzman rebelled after the king's death, refusing to acknowledge the new heir, Pedro I of Castile, who was fifteen years-old at the time. During the reign of King Alfonso XI, Dona Eleanor de Guzman (the king's favorite concubine) had taken Queen Maria of Portugal's place at many important events, thus causing bad feelings between the two. Queen Maria of Portugal was regent for one year after her husband's death.  When Dona Eleanor's sons' rebelled Count Jao de Albuquerque easily convinced the Queen Mother that Eleanor de Guzman had played a part in the rebellion, and not needing much prodding, Dona Eleanor was executed. The subsequent execution of Eleanor in Talavera in 1351, added more fuel to the fire of the rebellion by Guzman's sons, in particular her fourth born, Count Henry of Trastamara, who through marriage, ruled the northeastern portion of the kingdom. The future Henry II of Castile and Leon, had several brothers: Fadrique, Tello of Castile, and Sancho of Castile. Through a combination of threats and diplomacy, Peter I of Castile was able to elicit fealty and a temporary reconciliation with his half-brothers. But this was not to last. Master Fadrique of The Order of Santiago, a religious knight, was named royal emissary to Bourbon, France, when he went to escort Pedro's bride-to-be, Blanche of Bourbon.  There were rumors he had slept with his brother's bride. “Just what had happened, it is somewhat difficult to discover, and the story is told that the king, listening to scandalous talk, was made to believe that his royal messenger and half-brother, Fadrique, had played the role of Sir Tristan as he had brought the lady back and that she had been a somewhat willing Isolde.” Women of Romance Countries, John Effinger (2021). The subsequent turmoil of this marriage and Pedro's entanglement with his concubine, María de Padilla, who King Pedro later swore he had married in a secret ceremony, was unlikely to have help cement a relationship between King Pedro and Master Fadrique.\n\nParagraph 10: In late 1971, Zeke Sheppard moved on to other things and the band, again by newspaper advertisement, hired Ted Purdy to take over the mantle of bass player for the otherwise intact band. In February 1972, the band recorded a live album featuring striptease artists at the run-down Victory Theatre, a vintage Toronto burlesque venue. The resulting album, \"The Mainline Bump and Grind Review\" was mixed at Moses Znaimer's Thunder Sound studios, long before Znaimer gained notoriety as the founder of CITY-TV. The album was recorded by Jay Messina and Jack Douglas on the Record Plant mobile studio out of New York City. Messina and Douglas later engineered the likes of John Lennon, Aerosmith and Lou Reed. The Record Plant mobile encountered difficulties crossing the border due to customs officers' unfamiliarity with high-tech equipment of such nature being packed into a truck, with the result that there were only a couple of hours to do a complete sound check prior to the performance. This difficulty was compounded by the fact that the band was in an advanced state of inebriation from drugs and alcohol, and consequently played at much higher volume during the performance than they had during the sound check. As a result, most of the individual instrument and vocal tracks were too distorted to be useful, which left only the house stereo pair for mixing. The mixing sessions at Thunder Sound were therefore quite protracted, and studio back-up vocal and horn tracks were added to buttress the live tracks. Mick Jagger dropped in one afternoon and enjoyed a convivial visit with the band while listening to the tracks. Despite the technical shortcomings of the recording, the concert became the stuff of minor legend with its combination of hard-driving covers of blues classics and the estimable performances of talented striptease performers. The tribute to vaudevillian burlesque form was completed by the use of a comedian as opening act and MC and the formal dinner-jacketed, tuxedoed attire of the band members. The critical acclaim that the \"Mainline Bump n' Grind Revue\" garnered was unfortunately not followed by commercial success. The 1972 Bump n Grind Revue is sometimes confused with a later burlesque show that the band performed at the Victory Theatre on New Year's Eve, 1974. That concert was recorded on video by TV Ontario, a public broadcaster, but was not the subject of a major label album release. The other main distinguishing feature of that show was that band members appeared in drag.", "answers": ["Paragraph 3"], "length": 3578, "dataset": "passage_retrieval_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "531d85162bd54a203fabe5eb30c244f3fe52cf9a5c7786a9"}

The emails were provided to Taibbi by Twitter CEO Elon Musk and documented parts of the discussions among Twitter's communication team about how Twitter should handle a New York Post article about a laptop computer that had been owned by Hunter Biden. The documents, dubbed the \"Twitter Files\" and retweeted by CEO [Elon Musk], were selected from \"thousands of internal documents obtained by sources at Twitter\". Taibbi's report was in the form of a Twitter thread with screen shots of email exchanges between Twitter executives. Taibbi noted that \"in exchange for the opportunity to cover a unique and explosive story, I had to agree to certain conditions\" that he did not specify. Taibbi's presentation largely confirmed what was already known and did not contain any significant new revelations. Jeffrey Blehar, writing for National Review, said that Taibbi's reporting \"contained few, if any, explosive revelations for people who have been tuned in to the debacle surrounding Twitter's suppression of the New York Post story on Hunter Biden's laptop\". The Wall Street Journal editorial board wrote that the Twitter Files are \"confirmation of the central role that former spies played in October 2020 in framing the Hunter Biden story in a way that made it easier for Twitter and Facebook to justify their censorship.\" Taibbi's thread included emails from Ro Khanna to former Twitter executive Vijaya Gadde, in which Khanna expressed concern about Twitter's decision to limit the circulation of the New York Post article about Hunter Biden. Khanna wrote that Twitter's actions violated \"1st Amendment principles\".\n\nParagraph 2: La Raza metro station opened on 25 August 1978 with service on Line 3 southward toward Hospital General station. Southeasterly service on Line 5 toward Pantitlán station began on 1 July 1982. The station facilities are partially accessible for people with disabilities as there are braille signage plates; inside, there is an Internet café, a library, and a mural titled Monstruos de fin de milenio, painted by Ariosto Otero Reyes. Outside, there is a bicycle parking station and a bus terminal. The transfer tunnel has an approximate length of , the second-longest in the system. Inside the tunnel, there is a permanent science exhibition called El Túnel de la Ciencia (\"The Tunnel of Science\"), installed by the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) to provide scientific information to passengers, which was opened on 30 November 1988. The exposition features information about science and astronomy using pictures.\n\nParagraph 3: Bleach (stylized in all caps) is a Japanese anime television series based on Tite Kubo's original manga series of the same name. It was produced by Studio Pierrot and directed by Noriyuki Abe. The series aired on TV Tokyo from October 2004 to March 2012, spanning 366 episodes. The story follows the adventures of Ichigo Kurosaki after he obtains the powers of a Soul Reaper—a death personification similar to the Grim Reaper—from another Soul Reaper, Rukia Kuchiki. His newfound powers force him to take on the duties of defending humans from evil spirits and guiding departed souls to the afterlife. In addition to adapting the manga series it is based on, the anime periodically includes original self-contained storylines and characters not found in the manga.\n\nParagraph 4: Student clubs and societies have always played an important role in the life of the college, and are seen as vital to student development. Each academic subject has a society which sponsors lectures and discussions. The popular extra-curricular societies and clubs engage in activities concerned with debating, dramatics, wall climbing and trekking, film, social service, photography, quizzing and astronomy. The social service league is the largest and most active society of St. Stephen's College which follows the mantra \"Service above Self\". It works for the betterment of the underprivileged sections of the society. In continuance of a long tradition, the Planning Forum regularly invites distinguished visitors to address and join issue with students on various topical issues. The college also publishes department newsletters, college magazines and yearbooks. Several departments also publish their annual journals aside from the college publications. The college English dramatics society, the Shakespeare Society, is amongst the most famous clubs in the institution, with a history dating back to the turn of the 20th century. The Shakespeare Society has had a long tradition of performing at least one Shakespeare play annually, a tradition that has started to change with time.  Many celebrities started out in this society including Konkana Sen and Kabir Bedi.\n\nParagraph 5: The Arctic shrew is most distinctive in its tricolored fur. It is dark brown or black on its back from its head to the base of its tail, while its flanks are a lighter brown, and its underside is lighter still grayish brown. Even its tail is bi-colored, dark brown on the dorsal side, and gradually fading to a lighter brown on the ventral side. The fur is grayer in winter time, and its tricolor is most marked during the winter months from October to June, for the fur is thicker and brighter. Arctic shrews molt twice a year, and the tricolor bands in the fur are less prominent in younger shrews.\n\nParagraph 6: A ruling hegumen is formally installed in a ceremony by the bishop, during which he is presented with his pastoral staff (Greek: paterissa, Slavonic: палица, palitza). Among the Russians, the pastoral staff for a Hegumen tends to be of wood (usually ebony), rather than metal. The hegumen is awarded the gold pectoral cross by the bishop, as for an archpriest. During divine services the hegumen wears a simple black monastic mantle, while the higher ranking archimandrite wears a mantle similar to one worn by a bishop (though without the white \"rivers\" along the sides, and decorated with unadorned \"tablets\" at the neck and feet). An archimandrite also wears a mitre similar to one worn by a bishop; a hegumen does not (however, in the Russian tradition, a bishop may grant an hegumen the privilege of wearing the mitre as an ecclesiastical award). A hegumen may carry his pastoral staff in processions and when giving blessings in the church (though it is never carried into the sanctuary), although it usually stands upright next to his kathisma (monastic choir stall). When outside the church, a hegumen may use a wooden walking stick similar to that used by a bishop or archimandrite, only not adorned with a silver knob.\n\nParagraph 7: Ultimate X-Men was the second comic to debut as part of the Ultimate Marvel line, predated a few months by Ultimate Spider-Man.  Mark Millar reinvented the X-Men with the first X-Men film (which debuted seven months before) as his only reference.  The plot of \"The Tomorrow People\" was what Millar had in mind for the first X-Men film, and \"Return to Weapon X\" would have been the plot to the sequel. As in the film, Millar's original X-Men consisted of telepath Professor X, Cyclops (whose eyes shoot concussive beams) telepath/telekinetic Jean Grey, weather-manipulating Storm, simian genius Beast, metal-skinned Colossus, and cryokinetic Iceman. In its first year, the series was the best-selling comic book of 2001.\n\nParagraph 8: With a No. 9 seed in the 2017 Big East tournament at Madison Square Garden, Georgetown faced eighth-seeded St. John's in the first round. Both schools were charter members of the original Big East Conference when it was created in 1979, and it was their seventh meeting in the tournament since it began in 1980. Former Georgetown head coach John Thompson Jr., and former Georgetown great Allen Iverson, both members of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, attended the game. In the original Big East's heyday in the mid-1980s, when St. John's head coach Chris Mullin had played for the Red Storm and John Thompson III's father, John Thompson Jr., had coached the Hoyas, the two schools had been national powers and great rivals, and both teams entered the game aware of this history. St. John's made only five of its first 21 shots from the field, but led 38–34 at halftime, and also led for most of the second half. With 8:35 left to play and St. John's ahead 59–55, the game briefly took on the character of the very physical games of the original Big East in the 1980s when Red Storm junior forward Amar Alibegović fouled L. J. Peak hard under the basket and a shoving match ensued between several players, resulting in the officials calling a flagrant foul against Alibegović and technical fouls against both Chris Mullin and Georgetown assistant coach Patrick Ewing Jr., a former Georgetown player whose father, Patrick Ewing, had played against Mullin as Georgetown's center at the peak of the 1980s rivalry between the teams. After the scuffle, Peak made one free throw to cut the Red Storm's lead to 59–56. After that, the Hoyas got within one point of St. John's three times but could never take the lead. The Red Storm led 74–68 with three minutes to play, but did not score again. In Georgetown's final possession, which began with 6.6 seconds remaining and St. John's clinging to a 74–73 lead, both Peak and Marcus Derrickson missed close-in shots, allowing St. John's to hang on for a 74–73 win. Georgetown's season came to an end, while St. John's snapped a six-year losing streak in the Big East tournament and moved on to face Villanova in the quarterfinals the following day. The Red Storm finished shooting 37.7 percent from the field overall, including 5-for-20 (25 percent) from three-point range, while the Hoyas shot 45.8 percent from the field overall and made five of their 21 three-point shots (23.8 percent). Playing in their last game for Georgetown, Peak scored a game-high 24 points, 22 of them in the second half, and Rodney Pryor contributed 17. Derrickson scored 11 points.\n\nParagraph 9: The Vaupés river, where it is principally the Tukanoan who are present, is where most of the outside resources are found, in exchange for work. These are commercial relationships. For the Hupda, this is where the illnesses and curses (of society) come from. The behavior of a Hupda in this environment is, almost always, one of total submission to any and all order. In this environment, where the two apparently contrary tribes interact, age is irrelevant, the setting is defined and dialogue is short and decorous on all parts. It is rare for Hupda to go to Tukanoan villages without being invited or contracted for a job. The reverse is not true. The Tukanoan go to Hupda villages whenever they feel like it, sometimes simply for a walk or to collect things such as cured meat or fish.  The relationships between the Hupda and a specific Tukanoan village are enduring if not permanent. It is an employment relationship and can be seen as a boss/employee relationship. These relationships can be individual or may include the whole hearth group. For this reason, the Hupda do not feel comfortable in the Tukanoan village and will not remain there any longer than they have to; they are also afraid of catching diseases. The Hupda perceive the land on the banks of the rivers as belonging to the Tukanoan and their existence is based around this assumption. The Hupda feel most at home and comfortable in the forests. It is where they feel safest from outside threats and find the resources to allow them to survive for long periods of time, without having to move to the banks of the river. In the clearings, where their houses are found, behavior is governed by a different set of rules. The clearing is the  special place for ceremonies and socializing with other Hupda.\n\nParagraph 10: Neutrino oscillation is a function of the ratio , where L is the distance traveled and E is the neutrino's energy. (Details in  below.) Neutrino sources and detectors are far too large to move, but all available sources produce a range of energies, and oscillation can be measured with a fixed distance and neutrinos of varying energy. The preferred distance depends on the most common energy, but the exact distance is not critical as long as it is known. The limiting factor in measurements is the accuracy with which the energy of each observed neutrino can be measured. Because current detectors have energy uncertainties of a few percent, it is satisfactory to know the distance to within 1%.\n\nParagraph 11: Fukuyama posits that two fundamental principles of neoconservatism may collide in the area of political and economic development: on the one hand, neoconservatives are concerned about the internal character of a regime, thus democracy-promotion and human rights are important considerations in foreign policy (unlike for political realists); on the other hand, there is a danger in large-scale social engineering which could have unintended consequences as a result. On the domestic front, neocons like James Q. Wilson had warned about extensive social programs and the Bush Administration should have put this principle into practice in foreign policy as well, Fukuyama asserts. Fukuyama cites an interview by Dick Cheney in which the Vice President said: \"to suggest we need several 100.000 troops there, after the conflict ends, I don't think it's accurate... I really do believe we will be greeted as liberators.\" President George W. Bush remarked at a speech that democratic desires are a human universal, but Fukuyama contrasts this to his own thesis of \"The End of History\" and caution: \"One can argue that there is a universal human desire to be free of tyranny and a universalism to the appeal of life in a prosperous liberal democracy. The problem is one of time frame involved. It is one thing to say that there is a broad, centuries-long trend towards the spread of liberal democracy - something that I myself have strongly argued in the past- and another to say that either democracy or prosperity can emerge in a given society at a given time. There are certain critical intervening variables known as institutions (...). And if there is one thing that the study of democratic transition and political development teaches, is that institutions are very difficult to establish.\" Neoconservatives ignored by and large development and put too much emphasis on defense.\n\nParagraph 12: A larger campus was created out of four converted brownstones beginning at 157 East 74th Street, in Manhattan's Upper East Side. After 1938, the school was known as the Mannes Music School in recognition of the broader course of study that expanded the school well beyond that of a community music school, including the three-year Artist Diploma. When Clara died in 1948, their son Leopold Mannes became president, endowing the school with his fortune from co-inventing Kodachrome film. In 1953 the school began offering a bachelor of science degree and changed its name to the Mannes College of Music. In 1960 it merged with the Chatham Square Music School. In 1984 the school moved to larger quarters on West 85th Street.  In 1989 Mannes joined The New School. In 2005, the New School administration changed the name to Mannes College: the New School for Music. In 2015, the university renamed it Mannes School of Music, and moved it to Arnhold Hall in the West Village. It is now part of the College of Performing Arts at The New School, which also includes the School of Drama and the School of Jazz and Contemporary Music. The College of Performing Arts, including Mannes Prep, has a total of 1,450 students. The students in any of the three schools of the College of Performing Arts can take courses in the three schools (Drama, Jazz, Mannes), no matter which school they are directly enrolled in, expanding the opportunities for self-directed study.", "answers": ["Paragraph 5"], "length": 2721, "dataset": "passage_retrieval_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "e13d21137403ad4098329587af936a642e3f40a6dc99b2d0"}
{"input": "The band released their fifth album, Negativity, on September 24, 2013. The album had a slicker polished sound than previous releases, as producer Steve Berlin changed the structure of every song during the recording sessions. The album featured a fair bit of layering, especially with keyboards. The lead single, \"The Dream's In The Ditch,\" was originally intended for Ian O'Neil's solo project but ended up on the album. The band performed the song on Conan. Many of the songs on the album were written on piano while the band was on vacation in Namibia and Johannesburg in 2012. They demoed around 30 songs, and Berlin chose 12 to work on for the album. One of the tracks, \"In Our Time,\" featured a duet with pop singer Vanessa Carlton. McCauley later married Carlton in December 2013. The album was influenced by recent events in McCauley's life, including his father's legal troubles, the death of his uncle, and his own struggles with drug use and addiction. Some of the songs on the album, such as \"Mr. Sticks\" and \"Pot of Gold,\" were about these personal struggles. In 2013, some members of the band also played shows with Rafay Rashid in a side project called Happiness.", "context": "Paragraph 1: Clinton specifically pointed to the death of Muammar Gaddafi and the conclusion of the Libyan intervention. She had been active during the final stages of the Libyan rebellion, and via Sheik Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani, had urged the rebels forces to unify and avoid factional conflicts with each other. She visited Tripoli in October 2011 and, in private, was somewhat guarded about Libya's future following the rebel success. (A video of her exclaiming \"Wow\" upon first reading on her BlackBerry of Gaddafi's capture achieved wide circulation.) Over the next few years, the aftermath of the Libyan Civil War became characterized by instability, two rival governments, and a slide into status as a failed state; it became a refuge for extremists and terrorist groups, such as ISIL, and spurred a massive refugee crisis as immigrants crossed the Mediterranean to southern Europe. The wisdom of the intervention would continue to be debated, with President Obama maintaining that the intervention had been worthwhile but that the United States and Europe underestimated the ongoing effort needed to rebuild Libyan society afterward; former U.S. Representative to NATO Ivo Daalder stating that the limited goals of the intervention had all been met but that the Libyan people had not seized their opportunity to form a better future and that post-intervention military involvement by the West would have been counterproductive; and scholar Alan J. Kuperman (along with some other scholars and human rights groups) writing that the intervention had been based on the faulty notion that Libya had been headed towards humanitarian disaster when in fact it was not and was thus the intervention was \"an abject failure, judged even by its own standards\". Kuperman's view that Gaddafi son Saif al-Islam Gaddafi held promise as a Western-style political reformer was in turn disputed by former Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs Derek Chollet, who stated that such faith was misplaced and that Libyans were resistant to any post-intervention security mechanism and to many rebuilding programs. Clinton said in her 2014 memoir that she had been \"worried that the challenges ahead would prove overwhelming for even the most well-meaning transitional leaders. If the new government could consolidate its authority, provide security, use oil revenues to rebuild, disarm the militias, and keep extremists out, then Libya would have a fighting chance at building a stable democracy. If not, then the country would face very difficult challenges translating the hopes of a revolution into a free, secure, and prosperous future.\"\n\nParagraph 2: The period of rule of the Chalukyas of Badami, whose kingdom stretched from modern Karnataka to Maharashtra and Gujarat, was a highlight of Bagalkot's history. Chalukya king Pulakeshin II further consolidated the empire by battling with the Kadambas, Gangas, Mauryas of the Konkan, Gurjaras and Emperor Harshavardhana, whom he vanquished on the banks of the Narmada river Accounts of war were inscribed on stone structures in the town of Aihole, now located in the taluk of Hungund. The Kalyani Chalukyas, descendants of the Badami Chalukyas, conquered the area before the dawn of the 10th century CE. Their rule was interspersed with wars against the Cholas and Hoysalas. The Kalyani Chalukyas moved their capital from Badami to Kalyani, in the present day district of Bidar. Akkadevi, sister of the Kalyani Chalukya Jayasimha II ruled in the area for more than 40 years from 1024 CE. During the course of her rule of the area, then known as Kisukadu, seventy villages from Bagalkot district were added to her administration. The Chola king Vīrarajendra seized the area by defeating Someshvara I at Koodalasangama. By the 11th century CE, all of Karnataka including Bagalkot fell into the dominion of the Hoysala Empire, first consolidated by Veera Ballala and later subordinated to the Sinda kings.\n\nParagraph 3: On September 24, 2013, the band released their fifth album Negativity. The album was produced by Steve Berlin and displayed a slicker polished sound than previous releases, with McCauley revealing that Berlin changed the structure of every song he took to the sessions and \"doesn’t settle for any of that kind of raggedy, kind of charming, first take kind of sound.\" Crowell added that \"Steve had a really large hand in shaping this album\" and that \"there is a fair bit of layering on the album, but I like it as the keyboardist, because there is more keyboards.\" The album was preceded by the Ian O'Neil song \"The Dream's In The Ditch,\" which was originally intended for his Dirt Naps project. The band performed the song on Conan on September 25, 2013. Many of McCauley's songs on the album were written on piano instead of guitar and were put together while on vacation in Namibia and Johannesburg in 2012. The band demoed close to 30 songs for the album, with Berlin picking 12 to work on including a duet with pop singer Vanessa Carlton on \"In Our Time.\" McCauley later married Carlton in December 2013 in a ceremony officiated by former Fleetwood Mac singer Stevie Nicks. The album was influenced by recent events in McCauley's life including his father, a Democrat who represented Providence, pleading guilty to filing false tax returns and conspiring to defraud the federal government of more than $500,000 resulting in a 27-month prison sentence and a $10,000 fine, the death of his uncle, his wedding engagement to Nikki Kvarnes of Nashville band Those Darlins collapsing due to his drug use and drinking and subsequently getting clean from drugs. The song \"Mr. Sticks\" is about family struggles with the title being his father's childhood nickname and \"Pot Of Gold\" is a \"stream of consciousness recollection of what went through my head and what kinds of misadventures I got myself into when I was doing crack.\" Throughout 2013, O'Neil and the Ryan brothers played several shows with Ravi Shavi frontman Rafay Rashid in their new side project Happiness.\n\nParagraph 4: Body shells are painted in a semi-clean environment using solvent-based paint. Shells are dipped in chemical tanks to cleanse them of any oils picked up on the panels during their manufacture in Body Shop. Once bodies have been dipped and cleansed, they are then immersed in an anti-corrosion paint dip called ED (Electrocoat Dip). This 'dip' coats the entire body, both inside and outside, and is the first paint coating it will receive. Once the 'dipped' body has been stoved in the ED oven, the body progresses to the 'Sealing' Booth. In this booth, the body has its interior panel joints, floor, tailgate, hood and door edges sealed with a PVC based sealant to prevent water ingress and corrosion as the car is driven on the road. Also within this zone, sound pads are added to the floor and boot to reduce road noise (standard practice in the motor industry). The next booth it enters is the 'Underbody' Booth. In this booth, similar to 'Sealing' Booth, the body's wheel arches are sealed using the same PVC based sealant. Robots then apply the underseal to the underfloor and wheel arches. Also robots are used to apply the SGC (Stone Guard Coat) layer to the sills: this coating is designed for abrasion resistance, i.e. preventing stone chips, scuffs, etc. From here, the body proceeds into the Undercoat Oven. The next zone is 'ED Sanding' booth where the body is inspected for any minor imperfections received in the ED Coat. The next zone is the 'Surfacer' Booth, where the body receives its second coat of paint, this being the Surfacer Coat, then into the Surfacer Oven. Next is 'Surfacer Sanding' Booth: the same as ED Sanding, this zone inspects the body for any imperfections picked up within the Surfacer coating. Next comes the 'Topcoat' Booth, where the body receives its final coats of paint, these being Topcoat and Clearcoat layers. After being stoved in the Topcoat oven, the body then enters the 'Touch-up' Booth where the body has its final inspection for any imperfections picked up in the Topcoat process. Once the body leaves here, it then moves on to the PBS (Painted Body Store) above Trim and Chassis to await the next step in the production process.\n\nParagraph 5: As war raged in Europe, Fanning intensified her preparations for any eventuality. When two German auxiliary cruisers visited Norfolk in September 1916, Fanning acted as part of their escort while they sailed in United States territorial waters. On 8 October, Fanning put out of Newport, Rhode Island, to search for the crews of ships sunk not far from Nantucket Light Ship by the German submarine . The destroyer recovered six survivors and landed them at Newport, Rhode Island the next day. The presence of U-58 led to the speculation that a secret German submarine base might exist in the Long Island Sound—Block Island Sound area; Fanning searched from 12 to 14 October for evidence of such a base but found nothing, and returned to her regular operating schedule.\n\nParagraph 6: An early example of Italian literature is the tradition of vernacular lyric poetry performed in Occitan, which reached Italy by the end of the 12th century. In 1230, the Sicilian School became notable for being the first style in standard Italian. Dante Alighieri, one of the greatest of Italian poets, is notable for being the author of La Divina Commedia (The Divine Comedy,  1308–1320). Renaissance humanism developed during the 14th and the beginning of the 15th centuries; Italian humanists sought to create a citizenry able to speak and write with eloquence and clarity. Early Italian humanists, such as the lyric poet Francesco Petrarca and the Neoplatonist philosopher Marsilio Ficino, were erudite Classical scholars and great collectors of antique manuscripts. The Italian nobleman, statesman, and mecenate Lorenzo de Medici is regarded as the standard bearer of the influence of Florence on the Renaissance in the Italian states. The Italian polymath, scientist, and artist Leonardo da Vinci wrote a treatise on painting. The development of the drama in the 15th century was very great. In the 16th century, the fundamental characteristic of the era following the end of the Renaissance is that it perfected the Italian character of its language. Niccolò Machiavelli and Francesco Guicciardini were the chief originators of the science of history. Pietro Bembo was an influential figure in the development of the Italian language and an influence on the 16th-century revival of interest in the works of Petrarca.\n\nParagraph 7: While he never became one of the leading stars of global golf, and did not win a major championship, Coles was remarkable for his consistency, and even more for his durability. He was five times a top-ten finisher in the Open Championship, finishing third in 1961 and second in 1973, although arguably his closest chances came in 1970 (when he led after a first-round 65 and was only 3 off the lead going into the final round) and 1975 (where he followed second and third rounds of 69 and 67 with a 74 at Carnoustie, when a 70 would have earned him the Claret Jug). He led the British Order of Merit in both 1963 and 1970, and maintained a top-ten position in the Merit List for almost every year of the 1960s and 1970s. He was ranked 7th in the world on the inaugural Mark McCormack's world golf rankings in December 1968, a position he regained at the end of 1970. In 1982 at the age of 48 he won the Sanyo Open in Spain and held the distinction of being the oldest winner of a European Tour event for nearly 20 years. Even at the peak of his career, he made few appearances in the United States because of his fear of flying.\n\nParagraph 8: Verinag spring which is in Verinag town, issues from a high scarp of a mountain spur, and is considered the source of the Jhelum river. It is situated at the bottom of a hill covered by pine trees and evergreen plants. Verinag spring was originally an irregular and shapeless pond, and water, oozing out from different places in it and spread about and formed a little marsh. Emperor Jahangir, whose artistic taste for polishing the beauty of nature is well known, saw this and at once determined to improve it. He built the octagonal tank of sculptured stones round it, so that all water was collected therein, for which carvers were brought from Iran. A garden was also built by Jahangir next to this natural spring which is of pre-Islamic religious significance. The construction date of the octagonal tank and the garden is 1029 Hijri or 1620 A.D, during the 15th year of the Jahangir's reign, which is duly inscribed on a stone slab built into the southern wall of the spring. Seven years later, Jahangir's son Shah Jahan, who was no less a lover of natural beauty, constructed cascades and aqueducts in straight lines through and around the fine garden which he, in order to enhance further the beauty of the place laid out in front of the spring. He also built hot and cold baths to the east of this garden, just outside it, of which little trace is now left. The water contained in an octagonal spring has crystal blue water in which a variety of big fishes live. History and the carvings on stones in Persian on the walls surrounding the spring tell about how this great source of underwater spring is contained without revealing its architecture. The water is collected in a pool surrounded by arched recesses, and then flows down a 300-yard canal to the Bihat river.  Jahangir wished to be buried at Verinag gardens, but his wife, Nur Jahan, disobeyed his wishes.  Today nothing remains of the pavilions which once decorated the area.\n\nParagraph 9: In the story, two scientists and a navy ship investigate two massive pillars of water in the Pacific to discover if they are a natural phenomenon or, as one of the scientists conjectures, created by intelligent beings. His belief is based on another strange recent occurrence in the Pacific: \"Lagrange fireballs\", spheres of energy which move in a seemingly intelligent manner and appear to be responsible for the disappearance of people in Hawaii. While on the naval ship, more is learned about the pillars: one shoots water far up into the sky, where it enters a cloud-like formation which cannot be successfully entered and studied by aircraft or rockets, because their engines shut off when they try to enter the cloud. After an experiment, they confirm the other water pillar is linked to the first and returns the water back to the ocean. While one of the scientists is on deck preparing to ride up the water column in a bathysphere, an energy sphere appears; it engulfs him, and he disappears. The other scientist, still believing that there is an intelligence behind these phenomena, decides to take the other's place and ride in the bathysphere up the water column in hopes of finding his colleague and/or further insight. The two men find themselves in an utterly featureless (and inescapable) environment where they are provided solely with bland food and water. Eventually they are placed together, and they conclude that they are in the hands of other intelligences, possibly alien or possibly a much higher form of Earth life. From the complete lack of communicative contact, they decide that they are not even being studied but are merely being kept as pets, similar to the pet goldfish kept by one of the men. They may even have been put together in the hope that they will breed, suggesting that their captors know nothing of human biology.\n\nParagraph 10: At the conclusion of her 25th New York City Marathon on November 4, 2013, Zoe addressed the crowd which had gathered to see and cheer her finish.  \"It makes you understand that life is not happen stance or random all the time.  That there is a plan, and it's a good plan.  When we do things like the marathon, we get an opportunity to see how the pieces fit, and life no longer becomes this random series of crazy events.  There was a lovely young woman with multiple sclerosis who waited hours in the street for me to come by.  On one side of her sign she had my name in big bold letters.  On the other side of her sign, she had something that reduced me to tears.  It said 'Because you run every year, the rest of us continue to walk.'  I thought that was really profound.  I think the thing is that, the marathon is not just an adventure to me.  It's a matter of living resources; it's not just stories to tell, it's what those stories teach you and how close you hold them to your heart through the year, and how strong and how brave and much a part of the running community they make you.  It has been a truly amazing honor. I've done 25 of these, and it never grows old.  There is life after disability.  You can either go through life like this [arms closed], or you can go through life like that [arms open].  And for me, New York City is that.  It's arms out reaching for possibility and hope every single year.  I love this city.  I love its strength, I love its diversity, I love its personality, and thank God it loves me back because I wouldn't know what to do if it was a one-sided love.\"\n\nParagraph 11: The \"Music City Miracle\" was, like The Play, a kickoff return with a controversial lateral that resulted in a game-winning touchdown. In an NFL wild-card playoff game between the Tennessee Titans and the Buffalo Bills at the venue now known as Nissan Stadium in Nashville, Tennessee, the Bills took a 16–15 lead on a 41-yard field goal by Steve Christie with 16 seconds remaining. The ensuing kickoff was fielded by the Titans' Lorenzo Neal, who handed the ball off to Frank Wycheck. Faced with oncoming defenders, Wycheck turned to his left and passed the ball across the field to Kevin Dyson, who was protected by a wall of blockers.  Dyson ran untouched 75 yards down the sideline to score a touchdown. Unlike The Play, NFL rules in 2000 allowed for a replay official to call for video review of any questionable on-field call in the final two minutes of a game, and such a review was immediately declared to determine if Wycheck's pass to Dyson was an illegal forward pass. After a lengthy delay, officials determined that video evidence was inconclusive to overturn the ruling on the field, and the play was upheld as a touchdown. Although there were 3 seconds left on the clock when Dyson scored, nothing came of the Bills' ensuing kickoff return and the Titans went on to win the game 22–16. Later, computer analysis established that Dyson caught the ball on the same yard marker that Wycheck threw it from, confirming that the pass was indeed a lateral.\n\nParagraph 12: The full text of Mythlore from 2002 onward is available in Expanded Academic ASAP.

{"input": "In this text, the Doctor and Romana find themselves in a time-locked universe where they are reunited with Biroc. Biroc reveals that they were once slave masters who traveled through time to conquer planets and enslave their inhabitants. The Doctor and Romana are then returned to the null space where they are captured by Rorvik. Rorvik's crew realizes that the null space is shrinking and attempts to blast through the mirrors in the gateway to escape. However, their attacks are unsuccessful. With the gateway and the ship now within visible distance of each other, Rorvik decides to use the ship's engines to break the mirrors. The Doctor warns against this, but Romana, Lazlo, and Adric work together to free the remaining Tharils on the ship. As Rorvik initiates his plan, the blast from the engines is reflected back onto the ship, causing its destruction.", "context": "Paragraph 1: \"Long Black Song\" begins with Sarah, a young Black woman, caring for her baby as she waits for her husband Silas to return from selling cotton.  Lonely, and tired by baby Ruth's needs, Sarah fantasizes about Tom, a man she knew before he was sent to war.  As the sun goes down, a white salesman arrives and tries to sell her a graphophone.  They make conversation, and as she gets him some water, he attempts to seduce Sarah.  She protests, and runs to the bedroom where he rapes her.  He leaves the graphophone, and says that he will return in the morning to convince her husband to buy it.  When Silas returns, he sees the graphophone and suspects that Sarah has been unfaithful.  Silas hates white people, and is livid when he figures out that Sarah slept with a white man.  In a fit of rage, he drives her from the house, whipping her as she tries to escape.  She eventually gets away from him, coming back to the house only to retrieve Ruth.  She sleeps outside, away from Silas' grasp, and resolves to stop the white man from confronting him the next day.  She is unable to head the salesman off, however, and when he arrives at the house, Silas whips and then shoots him.  Sarah returns to Silas and tries to convince him to escape with her, but he relents that he can never be free in a white man's world despite all his effort.  Sarah takes Ruth back into the hills, where she watches a white mob descend on Silas, attempting to kill him first with bullets and then by lighting the house on fire.  The house burns down around Silas, who does not attempt to escape after having killed as many white men as he could.\n\nParagraph 2: In October 2011, several news outlets reported that the original line-up of the Sugababes would reform. In January 2012, further circulations that the group would reunite were sparked, after both Buena and Buchanan tweeted that they were in the studio with \"two other females\" and British rapper Professor Green. However, Buena later denied this on Twitter, saying: \"No track [with] keisha or professor G he was around tha studio. im jus workin on my stuff @ tha moment. (sic)\" Despite this, Scottish singer-songwriter Emeli Sandé confirmed to MTV UK that she had written new songs for Buena, Buchanan and Donaghy, saying: \"Yes, that is true. I've written for the original line-up of the Sugababes, which I'm very happy about because I just loved them when they first came out. I loved their sound, it was so cool. It was very different, so I'm happy to kind of be involved in what started the whole Sugababes journey. It sounds amazing.\" In April 2012, it was reported that the line-up had signed a £1 million record real with Polydor Records. In June 2012, Donaghy confirmed on Twitter that new music would be released, saying: \"the soonest it'll be is in 2 weeks. The latest is 10 weeks.\"\n\nParagraph 3: McCallum has released 18 solo CDs, and her recordings of the music of Liszt and her CDs of French piano music have recently been re-released as boxed sets. Her recording of all of Beethoven's bagatelles for piano contains the published sets of Bagatelles, Opp. 33, 119 and 126, Bagatelle No. 25, WoO 59 (\"Für Elise\"), and also the first recording of what is believed to be the last piano piece that Beethoven wrote, never before published or even catalogued (the piece was edited by Stephanie's husband, the musicologist Peter McCallum). She has specialized in virtuosic nineteenth-century music, particularly of Alkan and of contemporary solo and ensemble music. She made the first recording of Alkan's Studies in all the Major Keys, Op. 35, and subsequently recorded Alkan's Studies in all the Minor Keys, Op. 39, being the first pianist to record both sets. In 2013, during the centenary of Alkan's birth, she released recordings of all five Books of Alkan's Chants, along with other previously unrecorded music by this composer. Her performances of Xenakis's Herma, and Brian Ferneyhough's Lemma Icon Epigram have received critical acclaim. She has released CDs of the music of Liszt, Weber, Alkan, Schumann, Magnard, Pierre Boulez, Xenakis and of contemporary Australian composers. In addition to Alkan and Boulez, she has recorded much other music by French composers: Satie, Magnard, Vincent d'Indy, Maurice Ravel and Guy Ropartz. McCallum records on a number of period pianos by Anton Walter and Sébastien Érard.\n\nParagraph 4: On the other side of the mirror, the Doctor and Romana are reunited with Biroc in a stable, time-locked universe. A repentant Biroc explains they were the slave masters, travelling on the winds of time in order to ravage other planets and subjugate their populations as slaves until the Gundan revolt. The Doctor and Romana are returned to the null space, and are immediately captured by Rorvik. Rorvik's crew realise that the null space is shrinking as the distances between the gateway, the TARDIS, and slaver ship continue to decrease. Rorvik has ordered the crew to try to blast through the mirrors in gateway, believing it to be the way out, but the mirrors resist all attacks.  With the gateway and ship in visible distance of each other, Rorvik resorts to one last attempt to break the mirrors by using the exhaust of the ship's engines against them. While the Doctor warns that this action will be as doomed as the previous ones, Romana regroups with Lazlo and Adric, and together they free the remaining Tharils on the slaver ship. The TARDIS crew flee to the TARDIS as Rorvik initiates his plan—the blast from the engines is reflected by the mirrors back onto the ship, destroying it and its crew.\n\nParagraph 5: A few features of the map call for special mention. The scale to which the map purports to be drawn is 16⅞ inches to the Dutch mile, or 3⅝ inches to the English mile. This makes the distance from Beeren Island to Moenemin's Castle, which on the original map is equal to 67½ inches, exactly 4 Dutch miles, or the extent of territory allowed on one side of a navigable river by the fifth article of the Charter of Freedoms and Exemptions. As a matter of fact, however, the distance between these two points is not 4 Dutch miles, or 18.44 English miles, but about 22½ miles, so that the actual scale of the map is only 3 inches to the mile. The central and lower portions of the river are fairly accurately drawn, but the upper part is wrong. Especially puzzling is the wide creek designated as Renselaers Kill, which would seem to represent the Mohawk River but does not occupy the right position. Perhaps the most plausible explanation of this error is that the compiler, at about that point, joined two separate maps and, from his unfamiliarity with the topography of the locality, failed to connect the south branch of the Mohawk, indicated on the one map at the falls, with the outlet marked on the other map, and then, from some statement regarding the direction of the river, continued this outlet straight into the country. It will be noticed that of most creeks only the mouths are indicated and that of others, which are traced for some distance into the country, the direction bears as a rule no relation to the configuration of the ground, which was probably sketched in from some high point after the survey of the shore line and the islands had been completed. Up to 1636, but three farms existed in the colony. The castles faintly shown near the names of Godijns Burg, Renselaers Burg, De Laets Burg, etc. represent therefore no actual settlements, but merely indicate the places where the patroon intended that farms should be established. At the time the map was drawn, the land bought for the colony of Rensselaerswyck was almost entirely limited to that on the west side of the river; all that was owned on the east side was a small tract opposite Fort Orange. Curiously enough, the name Rensselaerswyck has been so placed as to cover exactly this territory belonging to the colony.\n\nParagraph 6: In January 2006, he filled in  for two shows for Anthrax drummer Charlie Benante, who could not tour due to family obligations. He also made a surprise guest appearance at a show in Clifton Park, New York in November 2011. He also filled in for Benante for a few shows throughout early 2012, after Gene Hoglan had helped Anthrax out, after the passing of Benante's mother. He returned once again in late June 2012 filling in for Charlie after he hurt his wrist, continuing to perform with Anthrax through October 2012. Hudson Music released a joint DVD with Bittner and Chris Adler of the American metal band Lamb of God, Pro-Mark introduced the Jason Bittner Signature model 5BX drumstick, and Meinl introduced the Bell Blast ride, designed in conjunction with Jason. He was the cover feature of the UK drum publications, DRUMMER and Rhythm, the cover feature of DRUM!, and participated on Magna Carta's Drum Nation 3 record. Shadows Fall released \"Fallout From the War\" on Century Media Records in 2006 and spent the remainder of the year writing and recording Threads of Life at Studio 606 in L.A. with Producer Nick Raskulinecz (Foo Fighters, Rush). Bittner also won the Modern Drummer Reader's poll for #1 Metal drummer for the second year in a row.\n\nParagraph 7: On 1 June 1967, the US Ambassador Ellsworth Bunker presented the 20 F-5As of the 10th Fighter Squadron (Commando) to Vice-President Kỳ at Bien Hoa AB. These aircraft would be used by the RVNAF to form the 522nd Fighter Squadron, their first jet squadron with training support provided by the USAF Air Training Command. This was the first step in the unfolding of the program that would see four of the six RVNAF fighter squadrons gradually convert from A-1s to jets. Besides the F-5s for the 522nd, three of the other squadrons were to receive A-37 Dragonflys as soon as the planes were tested in South Vietnam. The two remaining squadrons would continue to fly the A-1s. United States Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara had been convinced to allow the RVNAF to have the F-5s on the grounds that the jets had proved themselves to be good close air support vehicles, that they posed no threat to North Vietnam and therefore did not signal escalation, and that they would permit the RVNAF to defend the country against air attacks when the USAF finally withdrew. The impact of the move was as much psychological as it was military. The South Vietnamese were sensitive to taunts from North Vietnam that the US would not trust them with jets, and the activation of the jet squadron was an important status symbol for the southerners. The 33 pilots chosen for the 522nd Fighter Squadron, were hand picked by Premier Ky and had trained in the US and the Philippines. They were assisted at Bien Hoa AB by a mobile team sent by the Air Training Command to teach the squadron to maintain the planes. 522nd Fighter Squadron logged 388 combat sorties in June and 436 in July. In December, they flew 527 sorties, striking enemy supply routes and supporting ground troops in South Vietnam. Their safety record during the first 6 months was excellent, with only one plane lost.\n\nParagraph 8: Roadshows had a number of features that distinguished them from normal releases. There would be an intermission between the two \"acts\" of the film, with the first act usually somewhat longer than the second. Films selected for roadshow treatment were typically longer than the usual motion picture, lasting anywhere from slightly more than two hours to four hours or more, counting the intermission. There would be no short subjects accompanying the film, and rarely any promotional trailers. Screenings would be limited to one or two a day, sold on a reserved seat basis, and admission prices were higher than those of regular screenings. Souvenir programs containing photos from the film, photos and biographies of its cast and principal crew, and information on the film's production would be sold, occasionally along with other merchandise. Similar to touring theater productions, films would be presented in a city for a limited number of weeks before the physical filmstock was moved to another city. Finally, while not every roadshow was intended for this, roadshows would sometimes act as a predecessor to modern focus groups to measure audience reception. When this was done, audience members would be encouraged to write their thoughts and feedback on cards, and producers would use the feedback as well as monitoring the audience to gauge which parts of the \"long\" version of a film should be cut for shorter runtimes during the wide release.\n\nParagraph 9: Għaxaq's main church is dedicated to the Assumption of Our Lady and it is known for its baroque architecture. The present church was consecrated on 2 May 1784, after around fifty years of hard work by the villagers, which gave a helping hand in building their religious shrine. One could find a large number of artistic and valuable items in this church which were made by renowned Maltese and foreign artists. Of these one could find a number of highly artistic statues which all seek great devotion in a way or another. The titular statue which depicts the Assumption in heaven of our Lady was carved in wood by Mariano Gerada in 1808. Another statue which could be found in this church is that of the Main Secondary Feast of Saint Joseph, which was made by Fratelli Bertarelli of Milan in Italy in 1932 and is also carved in wood. Other statues are those of Our Lady of the Rosary carved in wood by Alessandro Farrugia, Our Lady of Fátima, and a set of traditional eight statues depicting the passion of Jesus Christ. These were made throughout the years with statues of Maltese artists Peppi Vella, Carlo Darmanin and family Camilleri Cauchi, namely Alfred and Aaron Camilleri Cauchi. The statue of dead Christ known as Il-Monument was brought to Għaxaq from Rome in the 18th century. The paintings which decorate the church's ceiling were painted by Emvin Cremona during the 1960s while other works of art date back to the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries mostly painted by Maltese artists; Gio Nicola Buhagiar, Francesco Zahra, Rokku Buhagiar and Gianni Vella among others. Apart from the Titular feast of Saint Mary, which is celebrated annually on August 15th, other feasts are celebrated throughout the year. These are; the commemoration of the Passion of Jesus Christ and his rise from death- with the traditional Good Friday procession, which in Għaxaq is held on Palm Sunday evening, celebrated a Sunday before Easter, the Main Secondary feast of Saint Joseph celebrated on the first Sunday of June, Corpus Christi on the second Sunday of June, and Our Lady of the Rosary on the second Sunday of October. These are all organized by their respective confraternities. On the night between the 24th and 25th of December, a solemn mass is held to celebrate Christmas.\n\nParagraph 10: The Stadtpark (City Park) in Vienna, Austria is a large municipal park that extends from the Ringstraße in the Innere Stadt first district up to the Heumarkt (Hay Market) in the Landstraße third district. The park is divided in two sections by the Wienfluss (Vienna River), and has a total surface area of 65,000 square metres (28 acres). Scattered throughout the park are statues of famous Viennese artists, writers, and composers, including Hans Canon, Emil Jakob Schindler, Johann Strauss II, Franz Schubert, and Anton Bruckner. The opulent Kursalon building on Johannesgasse, with its broad terrace that reaches into the park, is the site of popular waltz concerts.\n\nParagraph 11: Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ is a novel by Lew Wallace, published by Harper and Brothers on November 12, 1880, and considered \"the most influential Christian book of the nineteenth century\". It became a best-selling American novel, surpassing Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin (1852) in sales. The book also inspired other novels with biblical settings and was adapted for the stage and motion picture productions. Ben-Hur remained at the top of the U.S. all-time bestseller list until the 1936 publication of Margaret Mitchell's Gone with the Wind. The 1959 MGM film adaptation of Ben-Hur is considered one of the greatest films ever made and was seen by tens of millions, going on to win a record 11 Academy Awards in 1960, after which the book's sales increased and it surpassed Gone with the Wind. It was blessed by Pope Leo XIII, the first novel ever to receive such an honour. The success of the novel and its stage and film adaptations also helped it to become a popular cultural icon that was used to promote numerous commercial products.\n\nParagraph 12: Suburban Legends are known to perform many live covers, most often when performing at the Disneyland Resort, sometimes performing top 40 and classic pop or rock hits to appeal to the theme park guests outside of the band's usual fanbase. The band has also performed and recorded many songs from Disney films and television shows. They have performed \"Under the Sea\" from The Little Mermaid at many of its shows since 2002, and the theme songs from Disney's Adventures of the Gummi Bears and DuckTales, \"I Just Can't Wait to Be King\" from The Lion King, and more recently, \"Kiss the Girl\" from The Little Mermaid and \"Colors of the Wind\" from Pocahontas. Until 2013, only \"Gummi Bears\", \"Under the Sea\", and \"I Just Can't Wait to Be King\" had seen recorded releases, with the first track appearing on the Bomb Squad EP and Origin Edition, and the latter two tracks appearing on the band's 2012 album, Day Job. The band released an EP consisting of Disney covers in October 2013, including \"DuckTales\", \"Kiss the Girl\", and others. The band's Disneyland performances have also featured \"Build Me Up Buttercup\" by The Foundations, \"Celebration\" by Kool & the Gang, \"Higher Ground\" by Stevie Wonder, \"Rubberneckin'\" by Elvis Presley, \"Can't Take My Eyes Off You\" by Frankie Valli, \"I'm the Leader of the Gang (I Am)\" by Gary Glitter, \"Sweet Caroline\" by Neil Diamond, and an excerpt of \"Moves Like Jagger\" by Maroon 5 as a segue into the band's own \"All Around the World\".", "answers": ["Paragraph 4"], "length": 3238, "dataset": "passage_retrieval_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "e15a6117bec61cf603a6212bef62878edad2a6c94df93f6e"}

In 1981, he joined forces with Moore to create Moving Hearts, a band that blended Irish traditional music with rock, jazz, and other genres.

In 1981, Lunny reunited with Moore to form Moving Hearts, along with a young uilleann piper, Davy Spillane. Following the example of the group Horslips, Moving Hearts combined Irish traditional music with rock and roll, and also added elements of jazz to their sound. The group disbanded in 1985. In February 2007, Moving Hearts reunited for a concert in Dublin. In 2008 and 2009, the group performed again in several concerts in Ireland and the United States.\n\nParagraph 2: The Padma Nayaka king of Rachakonda (in present-day Nalgonda District) wanted Pothana to dedicate ‘Sri Maha Bhagavatam’ to him. The king himself is a scholar and wrote many works including Rudranavasudhakara, a well known Sanskrit drama. But, Pothana refused to obey the king's orders and dedicated the Bhagavatamu to Lord Rama, whom he worshiped with great devotion. It is said that Pothana remarked, ‘It is better to dedicate the work to the supreme Lord Vishnu than dedicate it to the mortal kings.’ He was of opinion that poetry was a divine gift and it should be utilized for salvation by devoting it to the God. It is known that Pothana was patronized by this king in his early career, Pothana dedicated his first great work to this king, the king himself was a scholar, his contemporary reputation was immense. It was common practice for many poets of the time to dedicate their devotional works to God himself and not necessarily to their patron-kings. The poem containing the derision against the \"Karanata Kiraata Keechakulu\" is a chatuvu (apocryphal) attributed to Pothana with no proof that he actually wrote it. Even if he did, it is unclear who the Karanata villains were, very likely the rulers of Karnaata Samrajyam (the contemporary term for the Vijayanagara empire) who were raiding Rachakonda at the time. The Rachakonda kingdom was under intense turmoil at the time, under attack by the Bahamanis from the west, Karanata (Vijayanagara) empire from the south and the Reddy Kingdom from the east. Rachakonda and its king ceased to exist by the mid-15th century, absorbed into the Bahmani kingdom. There is yet another version about his birthplace. He indicated in one stanza that he belonged to 'Ekasila Nagaram', meaning single stone city which was also called as Orukallu later changed to Orugallu (Warangal) in usage, Orukallu meaning single stone.\n\nParagraph 3: Orion Acaba left Critical Role in 2015. Emily Friedman, in the book Roleplaying Games in the Digital Age: Essays on Transmedia Storytelling, Tabletop RPGs and Fandom (2021), highlighted that \"while the public statements by all were civil and warm, fan speculation was so rampant that the Critical Role Reddit page ... has an entire FAQ section on what can and cannot be discussed in relation to Acaba and his character Tiberius Stormwind [...]. Acaba attempted to run an independent spinoff series focused on the character's home country of Draconia, but the show only saw a handful of episodes before it ended. Acaba courted fan appeals to bring back his character (and thus himself), none successful. As of this writing, almost all episodes of the spinoff have been purged from YouTube ... The show's audience base expanded significantly in the months after Acaba's departure [...]. As a result, different viewers have a different experience of 'how long' Tiberius was a part of Critical Role\". Shelly Jones, in an essay in the book Watch Us Roll (2021), also highlighted the fan response (including the Reddit FAQ) to Acaba's departure and the cast's \"external strife associated\" with his departure (such as \"disgruntled and deleted Tweets\" and an \"uncomfortable AskMeAnything [AMA] on Reddit\"). Jones also commented that Critical Roles fandom has learned a \"behavior of erasure in the guise of maintaining a positive attitude\" from the show itself. The FAQ of The Legend of Vox Machina Kickstarter states that Tiberius would not appear in the show; Jones wrote, \"while there are many possible reasons for this exclusion, the result is the same: the ultimate distortion of the narrative of Critical Role\". Cori McCreery, for WWAC, highlighted Tiberius' exit in the second volume of the prequel comic. She wrote, \"Part of the beauty of adaptations is that you can change things that no longer fit the story you want to tell. The Critical Role team had a falling out with the actor who played Tiberius, and the character wound up leaving the game pretty early on into the stream, and leaving a bit of a conundrum for adaptations like this and the upcoming cartoon. [...] So while I don't know if they're writing the character out in the comics earlier than he left the game, I do know that they do not plan to use him in the animated series, despite his being present for some of the adventures there. I'd be perfectly fine if this adaptation took a page from the medium it's part of and provides everyone with a retcon of the group's past\".\n\nParagraph 4: Part two of the Arusha Declaration focuses on socialism and some key features of socialism which include a policy of receiving a just return for one’s labour and the necessity for the leadership and control of major resources, services and government, to be in the hands of the working class.  In “a true socialist state no person exploits another, but everybody who is able to work…gets a his [or her] income for his [or her] labour” (Publicity Section, TANU, Dar es Salaam, 1967, p. 3).  The “major means of production”, which the TANU identify as those resources and services which a large section of the population and industries depend, are “under the control and ownership” of the working class (Publicity Section, TANU, Dar es Salaam, 1967, p. 3).  It follows that a democratically elected government of the people is an essential component of socialism (Publicity Section, TANU, Dar es Salaam, 1967). The policy of socialism, the TANU posits, “can only be implemented by people who firmly believe in its principles and are prepared to put them into practice” as well as “live by the principles of socialism in their day to day life” (Publicity Section, TANU, Dar es Salaam, 1967, p. 3-4).\n\nParagraph 5: Tonto and the Renegades were founded in 1964 by four grade school students in Grand Ledge, Michigan.  When the band was formed, all of the band's four original members Tom Kirby, Terry Slocum, Bill Ford, and Gary Richey, were 8th graders at Grand Ledge High School (though a high school, it had an eighth grade class).  Two years earlier in 1962, while their drummer Kirby was fourteen and in 6th grade, growing up in a subdivision just outside Grand Ledge, he expressed interest to his parents that he wanted to learn to play percussion, they bought him a drum set and arranged for him to take lessons from a retired music professor who had retired from Michigan State University.  Kirby and his older brother Randy played in his first band, the Grandaires.  The Grandaires repertoire consisted primarily of covers of Chuck Berry, Ray Charles, and other hits of the day, but they broke up shortly thereafter.  Terry Slocum, who grew up on a farm, started out playing a clarinet which his mother, a fan of Pete Fountain, bought him.  Slocum became a fan of rock and roll after hearing his brother play his collection of rockabilly, R&B, and early Motown records.  A pivotal moment for Slocum was when he watched the Beatles perform on the Ed Sullivan Show which convinced him to start playing in a rock band.  He took his clarinet to Marshall Music in Lansing and traded it for a guitar the following day.  His father tried to discourage him from playing the new instrument, claiming that he would never master it, but he persisted, spending most of his spare time practicing in his room, intent on proving his father wrong.  Bill Ford grew up on the outskirts of Grand Ledge next to Highway 43.  He began playing guitar in 1962, following brief spell of attempting to learn the drums.  He took guitar lessons, and improved to the point where he was able to teach guitar at the Zvonar Music Studios in Charlotte, Michigan.  Like Slocum, Ford remembers being \"completely blown away listening to the music of the Beatles\".  He did not yet have an amplifier, so he compensated by plugging his guitar into a tape recorder owned by his uncle, but ended up blowing out the speakers.  He then saved up to buy and amplifier.  Kirby, Slocum, and Ford started practicing together informally during their eighth grade year and played in a number of talent shows.  They added fellow schoolmate Bob Dick on and later that year and named their act the Henchmen.\n\nParagraph 6: Mikkelsen and Rosenberg each made important contributions to the description of the ship. During excavation, Rosenberg kept detailed journals that are still considered the most important source of information regarding the ship and its contents. Mikkelsen also kept a journal during excavation, but its entries only cover a period of less than three months, from May 21 to October 10, 1935. Rosenberg's and Mikkelsen's notes complement each other well. Rosenberg was more the specialist in his writing, using more colloquial language, while Mikkelsen's reflections are more emotional and focused on the discovery of the ship. According to his journal entries, Rosenberg at first believed that the iron pieces found with the ship did not belong to the stem, while Mikkelsen believed that they did. Mikkelson was relieved when Rosenberg changed his mind regarding the iron-pieces and concluded that they indeed belonged to the stem. The iron-pieces turned out to be spirally-rolled iron bands, which must have been placed as ornaments on the wooden stem, now dissolved. The spirals lay in a line for a length of roughly 60 cm. Rosenberg and Mikkelsen agreed that the stem, with its ornamentation, was meant to symbolize the mane on an animal, a dragon in particular, whose head had rotted away. Both larger and smaller longships typically had loose “stemterminations” carved into the shape of dragon-heads. Viking ships depicted in Viking-Age and medieval pictures do not always exhibit dragon-heads, and it is uncertain under what conditions such ornamentation was permitted on a ship. Large longships from the twelfth and thirteenth centuries—dreki (plural for drekar)—belonged to the king only. It is possible that the right to bear a dragon-head on one's ship was a royal privilege or a symbol of royal ownership. Smaller longships may have belonged to wealthy and influential persons, perhaps with a military or administrative association or obligation to the king, while larger longships belonged to the king himself. A dragon-ship may have been used in the campaigns of Harald Bluetooth.\n\nParagraph 7: This canto begins by describing the pain felt by the \"captive patriots\" and how the retraction of their liberty is the worst pain that can be felt; this pain is then described as Almanzor's as he dwells in his dungeon as a captive of the Turkish army. Almanzor laments upon his \"dreadful fate\" and the beauty of the isle that is no longer his; yet most of all he is angry that \"the Crescent [is] where the Cross should be\". A short monologue by Almanzor ensues in which glory and honour are key themes alongside his disgust at fellow Greeks \"kneeling to a Moslem lord\". Almanzor resolves to die and accept a horrible fate rather than accept the bribes of the Ottoman Empire and ultimately betray his country. The Turkish soldiers approach his dungeon with their \"scimitars unsheath'd\"; their position as slaves is consistently reiterated throughout this canto. Almanzor is dragged to the \"Pacha\" yet he shows no fear as \"when hath fear been known to dwell within the perfect patriot's heart?\". Almanzor stands before the Pacha who enters a monologue that describes the Turkish as the \"prophet's favor'd race\" and then proceeds to lay out the terms of Almanzor's imprisonment. Almanzor is offered \"bright heaps of gems and gold\" alongside immense power on the condition that he \"renounce[s] thy county and thy creed\" and that he \"bow[s] to the Crescent's sacred sign\". Anger consumes Almanzor and in \"words of mingled scorn and hate\" he declares that a free-born Greek can not be swayed by taunts and bribes. The Pacha thereby sentences him to death after one night in the dungeon. Almanzor is then resting peacefully in his cell, his peace the result of \"religion's pow'r' which can 'brighten e'en the darkest hour\"; yet footsteps that do not resemble a soldier's weight are heard by Almanzor. The footsteps turn out to be Corai's, who intends to rescue him. After much deliberation upon who should attempt escape they run out of time and the Pacha and his guards surround the father and his hapless child; upon tearing her away from her father the Pacha declares Corai a \"flow'r\" that is \"fit for a Moslem's paradise\" and she is sent away to his harem. Within the lavishly decorated harem there are dancers that attempt to ease Corai from her despair, but to no avail. Finding their efforts in vain, a young Greek slave named Isidore is introduced. Using his lute he performs a song for Corai that is appropriate to her situation as a captive who seeks her loved ones; this rouses Corai from her state of despair and she avidly listens to Isidore's song. Once midnight passes Isidore approaches Corai and tells her to follow him if she wishes to be free; as they escape she witnesses her father's headless corpse in the courtyard which causes her to faint.\n\nParagraph 8: Recruited by the Green Lantern known as Starkaor, he is known to have come to Earth on several occasions. In the American Old West, he teams up with an ancestor of Hal Jordan's to battle an alien named Traitor (who was responsible for the death of Starkaor). Abin would then wield Starkaor's ring after his mentor's death. In 1873, while severely wounded, he recruits the lawman Daniel Young to be a temporary Green Lantern. During World War II, he encounters Starman and Bulletman when the three battle an alien being under the control of Mr. Mind. On a later visit, his ring's power is neutralized by the foe he is tracking. He discovers the unconscious forms of Alan Scott and Jay Garrick, and borrows Scott's slightly different ring. He uses it against his adversary, taking advantage of the ring's effectiveness against the color yellow. He also visits Earth at some point between the Golden and Silver Ages, when he encounters the Martian Manhunter. At one point, Abin Sur imprisons the evil wizard Myrhydden inside his own ring, depriving him of the voice needed to cast his spells. Later, he is sent to retrieve Earth's most infamous gangster, Al Magone, whose evil had brought him to the notice of the Guardians. Abin Sur imprisoned Magone on a prison planet where time did not pass, an action that would have ripples throughout the Corps for decades to come.\n\nParagraph 9: Ferrari began his footballing career with local club Alessandria in the prima divisione nazionale in 1923, and he was also there when the newly established Serie A started in the season 1929-30, aside from a brief loan to Napoli during the 1925–26 season, where he scored an impressive 16 goals in 15 matches. He was given credit over the seven-year period (1923–1930) with Alessandria and Napoli in total to be playing 137 matches and scoring 78 goals. The following year Ferrari changed over to Juventus and was handed the number 10 shirt. Over that five-year period (1930–1935), which was his 1st spell at Juventus, he played in 160 games and scored 66 goals, in addition to providing many assists. Although the official number of assists he provided was not recorded, it was said to be extremely high. The next move Ferrari would make would be to Inter, where he also played for a five-yer period (1935-1940), and subsequently to Bologna for the 1940–41 season, before returning to Juventus in the 1941–42 season for his 2nd spell, this time as a player-manager in what turned out to be the final season of his playing career, winning his 10th major national trophy. After the Second World War, when Italian club football started up again in the season 1945-46, he became a full-time manager for Brescia.\n\nParagraph 10: The contemporary landscape of central New York is primarily a result of glacial activity between one million and ten thousand years ago. The last glacier to recede (starting about 19,000 years ago and leaving New York entirely approximately 11,000 years ago) deposited the Valley Heads Moraine, a prominent geological feature that separates the St. Lawrence watershed from the Susquehanna watershed. Before the deposition of the Valley Heads Moraine, glaciers had deepened the many north-south oriented valleys that characterize the region. These valleys originally were streams that flowed to the south. The moraine formed a series of lakes in the valleys. Drainage was still to the south over the moraine until the glacier retreated far enough to the north to allow escape of the waters along the southern edge of the glacier. At an elevation of about 900 feet, the glacial lakes filling the finger lakes valleys joined to form an interlocking system of lakes to the west (glacial Lake Warren ). At first Lake Warren continued to drain to the west, but as the ice retreated west of Rome, New York, flow shifted to the east into the Mohawk-Hudson River system. As the ice continued to retreat, a series of east-west channels were cut by the easterly flowing glacial meltwater. According to Fairchild, the westernmost of these was the gully that runs from near Mud Pond about 4 miles north-northeast of Skaneateles and 4 miles north-northwest of Marcellus and empties into Nine Mile Creek 2 miles south of the Village of Marcellus. The water was impounded in the Otisco Valley (glacial Lake Marcellus), and the delta formed where debris carried by this meltwater stream was deposited as it entered the lake can be easily seen on topographic maps. The meltwater soon continued draining to the east, carving the channel now known as Pumpkin Hollow that leads east from the Village of Marcellus. With the continuing northward retreat of the glacier, meltwater deepened the Nine Mile Creek Valley and cut the Camillus Valley that runs east from Martisco to the Village of Camillus. For a time this channel discharged to the east towards Syracuse at an elevation of about 500 feet. Eventually the glacier receded far enough north to open the channel near Rome New York that resulted in the formation of Glacial Lake Iroquois at an elevation of about 440 feet. Lake Iroquois had a relatively long existence, but 13,400 years ago the collapse of an ice dam led to the rapid draining of Lake Iroquois, and Nine Mile Creek started to assume its present form.", "answers": ["Paragraph 1"], "length": 3236, "dataset": "passage_retrieval_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "ac021596bfb8c87447cbf799822f6c321dd710b9a7475437"}

After receiving training from Satoru Sayama, Sato made his MMA debut in 1994 and showcased his exceptional submission skills by winning over Michael McAuliffe with a calf slicer, a move that had never been used in MMA before. Sato quickly rose through the ranks by winning ten consecutive matches, impressing fans with his aggressive and exciting grappling style. In his fourth match, he achieved victory by submitting his opponent with a flying inverted triangle choke.

She manages to keep her addiction secret for a number of months, however, her father Doug eventually uncovers it, leading to Laurel throwing Doug out of the family home. She also makes a fool out of herself by drunkenly falling down the stairs while attending Kerry Wyatt's (Laura Norton) party. Marlon eventually discovers the extent of his wife's addiction, but Laurel lies and says that she has only begun drinking because she cannot cope with looking after the children all of the time and she will stop drinking once she and Marlon take a short holiday away from the village. When they return, it becomes apparent that Laurel has not stopped drinking, and continues to drink alcoholic drinks when Marlon is at work. At breakfast, she spikes her orange juice with vodka, which April drinks. Laurel takes April to hospital, where they are told that April will be fine, but Laurel manipulates her into not telling Marlon about the incident. A number of weeks later, Laurel drinks alcoholic beverages while looking after April and Arthur, and viciously shouts at April when she asks Laurel to help her with her homework. Laurel then passes out of the sofa and begins to choke on her own vomit, however, April phones for an ambulance and Marlon realises that Laurel has not stopped drinking. While Laurel is in hospital recovering, April reveals to Marlon about the orange juice incident, which infuriates him; things turn from bad to worse when Jai dismisses Laurel from her job at the factory, as he does not want an alcoholic working for him. When Laurel is discharged the following week, Marlon confronts her and he gives her some harsh home truths, leading to Laurel punching Marlon in the face. He appears to be fine, but the next day he collapses and claims that he cannot see. He is taken to hospital and told that Laurel has detached his retina in his eye when she punched him. Marlon's concerned relative Cain Dingle (Jeff Hordley) orders for Laurel to leave Marlon and the children, but she refuses and gets drunk yet again. She leaves the house, unaware that she has left the front door open, leading to Marlon's beloved dog Daisy escaping. When Marlon is discharged from hospital following an operation on his eye, he is furious to discover that Cain has told Laurel to leave and they go and find her. They discover Laurel's car crashed into a tree and her pleading with Marlon not to come any closer. It is then revealed that Laurel has run over and killed Daisy. This leads to Marlon throwing Laurel out of the family home and him filing for legal separation.\n\nParagraph 4: Westville is located in the western part of the city west of the West River. The official neighborhood planning area for Westville is defined to be the area bordered by the neighboring town of Woodbridge, Connecticut on the west (the border runs roughly along the Wilbur Cross Parkway), by the Amity neighborhood on the north (along Fountain Street), by the West Rock neighborhood on the northeast (along Valley Street), by the West River on the east, and by the city of West Haven on the south. Whalley Avenue, Edgewood Avenue, Fountain Street and Forest Road are the main through routes of the neighborhood.\n\nParagraph 5: On the 1st of October, the Gunners played the 7th league match of the season against newly promoted Brighton & Hove Albion at the Emirates. Arsenal won the match 2–0 thanks to goals by Nacho Monreal and Alex Iwobi. Two weeks on following an international break the Gunners were away to Watford. Captain Per Mertesacker gave the Gunners a first-half lead but Watford went on to win 2–1: during the second half Troy Deeney converted a penalty which was controversially given by referee Neil Swarbrick. Then in stoppage time former Manchester United and Everton player Tom Cleverley gave Watford the win. On 19 October Arsenal made the trip to Serbia for the third Europa League match against Red Star Belgrade. The Gunners won 1–0 with Olivier Giroud scoring an exceptional overhead kick. Three days sooner Arsenal went to Goodison Park to face struggling Everton. During the first half the out-of-form Toffees took the lead through a shot by Wayne Rooney just outside the 18-yard box but Arsenal equalised with Monreal's rebounded shot five minutes before the break. In the second half Mesut Özil got his first goal of the season, heading home Alexis Sánchez's cross. Then 15 minutes later Everton's Idrissa Gueye was sent off for two yellow cards, which proved to set up the Merseyside team's capitulation as goals by Alexandre Lacazette and Aaron Ramsey put Arsenal 4–1 up. In stoppage time Oumar Niasse scored to give Everton hope following a mistake by Petr Čech who failed to control a tame back pass by Monreal. But then Sánchez scored the fifth goal for Arsenal in the final minute of stoppage time as the match ended 5–2 to the Gunners. Only two days later Arsenal played in the League Cup fourth round at home to Championship team Norwich City. During the first half Norwich grabbed a shock 1–0 lead as the Gunners were booed off on the half time whistle. However, on 85 minutes youngster Eddie Nketiah went off the bench to score an equalizer   for Arsenal — his first goal on his home debut — as the match went to extra time where Nketiah scored once more for Arsenal, heading in a set piece delivery to put them 2–1 up. The match ultimately ended 2–1 to take the Gunners into the fifth round. The final match of this October was in the Premier League at home to Swansea City. The Gunners were embarrassed to be 1–0 down at half time for a second consecutive home match but they went on to win 2–1 with goals by Sead Kolašinac and Ramsey to keep the three points in Arsenal's favor.\n\nParagraph 6: The first night of 21–22 July, the Marines of 3rd Battalion came under a concerted counterattack by the survivors of the Japanese 320th Independent Infantry Battalion, as well as the 319th, committed by Japanese commander General Kiyoshi Shigematsu to retake the Chonito Cliffs. The Japanese managed to infiltrate past many 3rd Battalion units through ravines and dry river beds and briefly threatened to overrun the battalion command post. The fighting was so heavy that parts of the Division Reserve were committed and the destroyer USS McKee was unable to provide close fire support, as the Japanese and Marines were so closely intermingled. However the Marines held firm and managed to repulse the attack by 0830. During the counterattack, a mortarman with Kilo Company, Private First Class Luther Skaggs, Jr., was critically wounded in the leg by a Japanese grenade. After applying a tourniquet, Skaggs continued to fight for another eight hours before moving unassisted to the rear where most of his leg was amputated. For this he became the first Marine from 3rd Battalion to be awarded the Medal of Honor. Over the next two days the 3rd Battalion fought a savage battle with the Japanese defenders for the Chonito Cliffs and Fonte Plateau area, as the battalion struggled to capture the Mt. Tenjo Road. On 23 July, 3rd Battalion seized the last ridge leading to the Fonte Plateau, provoking a heavy Japanese counterattack. LtCol Houser himself was seriously wounded in this engagement and the executive officer, Major Royal Bastian, took command. Then 3rd Battalion, now reinforced with tanks, took part in the assault on the Fonte Plateau on 25 July, seizing the key position after just an hour of fighting. The night of 25–26 July saw the climax of the fighting on Guam when the Japanese launched an all-out counterattack against the Americans. In the 3rd Battalion's sector, Japanese sailors of the 54th Keibitai launched a series of failed attacks against the now-well defended Marine positions. Backed up with artillery, the Marines easily repulsed the Japanese.\n\nParagraph 7: Coenraad's son Casparus Johannes (1844–1901), employed since 1865, had a gift for marketing and contributed greatly to the growth of the company. Advertisements for Van Houten could be found on trams throughout Europe and the United States. As early as 1899, Van Houten produced a commercial film that depicted a sleepy clerk who recovers miraculously after eating some chocolate. The factory was a boost for the town of Weesp, whose population doubled in the second half of the 19th century. Casparus Jr. had himself built a 99-room Jugendstil villa in Weesp, by the renowned architect Abraham Salm (1857–1915). Work was started in 1897 but not completed until 1901, the year he died.\n\nParagraph 8: Little is known about the prehistory of the Iveston area. In fact no certain remains from this period have been found at all. It was once thought that 'Castle Hill' might be the sight of an Iron Age hillfort. However, the remains at this site are simply those of an early-19th-century quarry. The hill itself is a spoil tip from the quarry. The only object to have been found here is a 17th-century shoe buckle. More likely to be of prehistoric date is the enclosure shown by cropmarks, which was excavated in 1963. Although no dating evidence was found, this is not surprising as many prehistoric sites produce very few finds.\n\nParagraph 9: DDaddy's Girls: This CBS series followed Dudley Walker (Dudley Moore), the owner of a New York fashion house who loses his wife and his business partner when, after a years-long secret affair, they run off together leaving him as the primary caretaker to his three daughters. The series is notable as the first in which a gay principal character was played by an openly gay actor. Harvey Fierstein played Dennis Sinclair, a high-strung designer at Walker's firm. Although Fierstein earned praise for his performance, Daddy's Girls was hated by critics. New York magazine called the series \"Despised, reviled.\" Entertainment Weekly, somewhat prophetically, found Moore to be \"wan and confused.\" The Dallas Morning News could only say that \"Daddy's Girls isn't horrendously bad\" but predicted that it would not last until Christmas. Indeed, the series was placed \"on hiatus\" after only three episodes aired and never returned. Moore never returned to television; he was later diagnosed with progressive supranuclear palsy, which Moore later cited as the cause of his difficulties on the set of the show.Dads: This 2013 Fox multicamera sitcom from Seth MacFarlane received scathing reviews from critics, receiving a score of 15 out of 100 on Metacritic and 0% on Rotten Tomatoes. The network used extracts of the negative reviews (\"offensive\", \"reprehensible\", \"morally wrong\") to promote the show. On May 7, 2014, Fox cancelled it after only one season.Delilah: The series was CBC's first prime-time sitcom, but it generally received poor reviews and negative audience reception. It was cancelled after a single 13-episode season in an era when Canadian content requirements made canceling Canadian programs after so few episodes a rarity. Delilah was one of several CBC flops during the early 1970s, including Corwin and McQueen, the product of inferior creativity. However, CBC's next sitcom, King of Kensington, fared much better and became a multi-year success. Toronto Star television critic Jim Bawden declared the series as the \"Worst Canadian Sitcom\", declaring the script writing to be \"appalling\" and discovered an absence of laughter from the audience when he attended a taping of an episode.Don't Call Me Charlie!: Debuting in a US fall 1962 season among a number of sitcoms with wildly unrealistic fantasy premises (The Jetsons and The Beverly Hillbillies would be the only two new sitcoms of that year to have any sort of afterlife), the sitcom featuring a rural veterinarian mistakenly drafted into the armed forces received a scathing review from Rick Du Brow at the time, who chided those responsible for calling the show a comedy, noted that the star of the series was a poor actor, and publicly questioned setting the series in Paris, France, despite having nothing to do with that city (noting that the show eliminated most traces to France after Charles de Gaulle returned to the Presidency). The show was pulled from air partway through its lone season with eight episodes left unaired.\n\nParagraph 10: She runs away from the Sikhs and literally into the arms of a veteran British officer, Rodney Savage (commander of a Gurkha battalion who \"have come from the war, lots of wars\"). Savage is, like John Masters, not only a professional soldier but also a member of a British family who have for generations served in India. Victoria originally dislikes Savage as hard and cruel but eventually becomes both his lover and his unofficial adjutant in the last hectic days of British rule in India. But in the end she realises that she cannot escape her origins, and—rejecting both the Indian man and the British one—chooses Patrick, an Anglo-Indian like herself.", "answers": ["Paragraph 2"], "length": 2957, "dataset": "passage_retrieval_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "848f9f0f5679f0bbc744980580904454b6776cc361d2e847"}

He scored his last goal for City in a 6–1 victory against Wrexham in the Western Regional League in 1939, the Second World War having disrupted the normal league programme. In over eleven years with Manchester City, Brook scored 177 goals in 494 appearances. He was the all-time highest Manchester City goalscorer until his tally was equalled and then surpassed by Sergio Aguero in 2017. Before a Premier League match between City and Arsenal in November 2017, Aguero was presented with a prize for becoming City's record goalscorer by Mike Summerbee and Brook's daughter, Betty Cowgill. Brook retained the record for most league goals (158) for City (which he held with Tommy Johnson) until 2019. Aguero's hat-trick in a 6-0 victory against Chelsea in February 2019 put him on 160 league goals, surpassing both Brook and Johnson. Brook also held the record of having scored the most goals for England (10) of any Manchester City player. Francis Lee equalled this record when he scored his final goal for England in a 3-1 defeat to West Germany in 1972. Raheem Sterling equalled this record with his first goal and surpassed it with his second goal in a 6-0 defeat of Bulgaria in October 2019 (the two goals put Sterling on 12 goals for England overall, but he had only scored eleven of them when he was a City player). Only five players have appeared for Manchester City more times than Eric Brook: Alan Oakes, Joe Corrigan, Mike Doyle, Bert Trautmann and Colin Bell. Of the 158 league goals Brook scored for City, 145 were scored in the first division. The only left wingers to have scored more goals in the top flight of English football are Cliff Bastin who scored 150 and Grenville Morris who scored 153. The highest scoring right winger in the history of the top flight is Tom Finney who scored 164 goals for Preston North End in the top flight.\n\nParagraph 2: The results of the 2018 Ontario General Election saw a number of significant changes in the distribution of seats among all three major parties, in some cases unprecedented in the province's history. The Liberal Party of Ontario lost the greatest number of seats, falling to just 7/126 seats, with roughly 19% of the popular vote, and losing Official Party Status for the first time in their history. The Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario, in contrast, saw a large increase in seats (and a modest increase in votes) obtaining 76/124 possible seats and roughly 41% of the popular vote. The New Democratic Party of Ontario, considered the main opponents to the PC's this election, saw a significant increase in both votes and seats in the Legislature, obtaining 40/124 seats and roughly 34% of the popular vote. The result between these two parties saw the Progressive Conservatives form a majority government, while the New Democratic Party became the Official Opposition for only the third time in its history (last seen in the Ontario general election of 1987). Finally, the 2018 Ontario Election also saw the Green Party of Ontario obtain its first-ever seat in the legislature, no less won by the party leader, Mike Schreiner, in the district of Guelph, with roughly 5% of the popular vote, province-wide.\n\nParagraph 3: A notable feature of Macedonian culture was the ostentatious burials reserved for its rulers. The Macedonian elite built lavish tombs at the time of death rather than constructing temples during life. Such traditions had been practiced throughout Greece and the central-west Balkans since the Bronze Age. Macedonian burials contain items similar to those at Mycenae, such as burial with weapons, gold death masks etc. From the sixth century, Macedonian burials became particularly lavish, displaying a rich variety of Greek imports reflecting the incorporation of Macedonia into a wider economic and political network centred on the Aegean city-states. Burials contained jewellery and ornaments of unprecedented wealth and artistic style. This zenith of Macedonian \"warrior burial\" style closely parallels those of sites in south-central Illyria and western Thrace, creating a koinon of elite burials. Lavish warrior burials had been discontinued in southern and central Greece from the seventh century onwards, where offerings at sanctuaries and the erection of temples became the norm. From the sixth century BC, cremation replaced the traditional inhumation rite for elite Macedonians. One of the most lavish tombs dating from the 4th century BC, believed to be that of Phillip II, is at Vergina. It contains extravagant grave goods, highly sophisticated artwork depicting hunting scenes and Greek cultic figures, and a vast array of weaponry. This demonstrates a continuing tradition of the warrior society rather than a focus on religious piety and technology of the intellect, which had become paramount facets of central Greek society in the Classical Period. In the three royal tombs at Vergina, professional painters decorated the walls with a mythological scene of Hades abducting Persephone (Tomb 1) and royal hunting scenes (Tomb 2), while lavish grave goods including weapons, armor, drinking vessels and personal items were housed with the dead, whose bones were burned before burial in decorated gold coffins. Some grave goods and decorations were common in other Macedonian tombs, yet some items found at Vergina were distinctly tied to royalty, including a diadem, luxurious goods, and arms and armor. Scholars have debated about the identity of the tomb occupants since the discovery of their remains in 1977–1978, yet recent research and forensic examination have concluded with certainty that at least one of the persons buried was Philip II (Tomb 2). Located near Tomb 1 are the above-ground ruins of a heroon, a shrine for cult worship of the dead. In 2014, the ancient Macedonian Kasta Tomb, the largest ancient tomb found in Greece (as of 2017), was discovered outside of Amphipolis, a city that was incorporated into the Macedonian realm after its capture by Philip II in 357 BC. The identity of the tomb's occupant is unknown, but archaeologists have speculated that it may be Alexander's close friend Hephaestion.\n\nParagraph 4: In September 2002, the museum moved to its third location, at 36-01 43rd Avenue, third floor, in Long Island City, Queens, intended as \"an interim home before a permanent move to 110th Street and Fifth Avenue in Manhattan,\" a site that in 2002 was expected to be ready \"within four years or so.\"  In 2005, the museum was among 406 New York City arts and social service institutions to receive part of a $20 million grant from the Carnegie Corporation, which was made possible through a donation by New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg. The Museum closed its public gallery in Queens in 2006, and in 2013 the board changed its name to the New Africa Center, which later became the Africa Center, and changed its intended purpose from art museum to \"a clearinghouse and public policy institute for all things Africa.\"  After several years of delayed openings, and the realization that the initial goal of a museum on Fifth Avenue was not sustainable, the decision was made to broaden the project's scope, and push back the opening to 2015. The new building would be on Museum Mile at the corner of Fifth Avenue and East 110th Street in East Harlem, Manhattan.\n\nParagraph 5: The Houchen Settlement House was founded in 1912 in Segundo Barrio in El Paso, Texas. El Paso was the chosen site to place a settlement house for Mexican immigrants because of its border location  Poverty, education and high infant mortality were concerns Houchen staff had to contend with on a daily basis. With the Mexican Revolution creating uncertainty in the eyes of many Mexican citizens, El Paso was the rational move for many. Known as the Ellis Island for Mexican immigrants, Segundo Barrio's Mexican American populous exploded in the early twentieth century. In 1900, El Paso's Mexican community numbered only 8,748 residents, but by 1930 this population had swelled to 68,476. Mexican immigration into the U.S. is a common occurrence. Many Mexican Americans ancestors could potentially have a history in this specific location, making it ideal for the Houchen House. Methodist missionaries opened the Houchen Settlement as a community driven establishment that wanted to improve the lives of Segundo Barrio's citizens. They attempted to gain the trust of residents by serving the surrounding community by providing public health care, combating poverty and opening a day school for children. Houchen had “two initial goals: (1) Provide a roominghouse for single Mexicana wage earners and (2) open a kindergarten for area children. Houchen’s staff was geared toward assimilating Mexican American immigrants into mainstream American society. As the missionary was geographically placed on the border land of Mexico and the United States, Methodist staff embraced the idea of the melting pot. Dorothy Little, a Methodist missionary that served Houchen House states, “Houchen Settlement stands as a sentinel of friendship… between the people of America and the people of Mexico. We assimilate the best of their culture, their art, their ideals and they in turn gladly accept the best America has to offer as they… become one with us. For right here in our four walls is begun much of the “Melting” process of our “Melting Pot.\" Due to their religious and assimilation programs, many claim the Houchen House attempted to convert Mexican women and children to Methodism. Missionaries thought little of Catholicism and structured their curricula around Christian Americanization. This agenda was aimed toward the Mexican American youth and women who attended Houchen's medical and educational services. “While these programs did not regard immigrants as permanently alien to American society, they did look on their languages, religions, and cultural practices as foreign. Anglo missionaries faced challenges throughout their work during the early years by trying to attract Mexican American's to their programs and gain the trust of the Segundo Barrio populace. “They met resistance from community members not because of what they offered or stood for with relation to education and social change, but because of their association with Protestantism. Even though Houchen provided exceptional medical care and children's activities, Mexican American women utilized the House's services without losing sight of their Mexican heritage. Although, many mothers were reluctant to allow their children to attend Houchen programs, or even play on the Houchen public playground. “Thus, while the settlement's playground and programs were tempting, particularly to children, many mothers refused to allow their children to participate because of their association with Protestantism. Most notable was how Houchen evolved into a trusted community center by the Mexican American women who attended the House as children. Some Mexican American women became nurses working for the Freeman Clinic and Newark Maternity Hospital, while others became day teachers to the community's adolescents. While working within the Houchen establishments, these key women adopted new practices that led to a more trusting institution for the better of their community.\n\nParagraph 6: In 1931 Nakagawa and Yamada graduated from Tokyo Imperial University, and it would be several years before the two would meet again. A short while after graduation Soen attended a Dharma talk by Rinzai Zen master Keigaku Katsube at Shorin-ji and knew he wanted to become a monk. Soen wanted to be ordained on his birthday at Kogaku-ji, once the monastery of his favorite Zen master Bassui. His mother felt he was throwing away his education, but knew he was a grown man who had to make his own decisions. So on March 19, 1931, Soen was ordained as a Zen monk by Keigaku Katsube at Kogaku-ji and given his Dharma name Soen. Just like Bassui, Soen began travelling to Dai Bosatsu Mountain in Kai province (near Mount Fuji) doing solitary retreats as a hermit and then returning to the monastery to resume his duties as a monk. On the mountain Soen sat zazen and wrote haikus, bathing in nearby streams and living off of the land. One day while on the mountain he nearly killed himself by eating poisonous mushrooms, and some peasants from nearby took him in and nursed him back to health. During this time Soen also became a friend and informal pupil of Dakotsu Iida, the now famous haiku poet. He later sent his work to Iada and had it published in Iida's haiku journal, Unmo. In 1932 Nakagawa first conceived the idea of an International Dai Bosatsu Zendo while meditating on Dai Bosatsu Mountain, traveling to Sakhalin Island in Siberia in an empty search for gold to fund the project. It was also on Dau Bosatsu Mountain that Soen came up with his original mantra, \"Namu dai bosa\". In 1933 Nakagawa completed his haiku anthology Shigan (Coffin of Poems). That following year, 1934, selections from Shigan were published in the haiku journal Fujin Koron.\n\nParagraph 7: By the late 18th century, most of the southern region of India had been conquered by the British and Madras was established as the capital of the Madras Presidency. During this period, the port flourished under the British rule, becoming an important naval base and urban center. A port at Madras was first suggested by Warren Hastings in 1770 when he was posted here, who later became the first Governor General of India. However, it was not until the 1850s that work began on a pier to berth vessels following suggestions from the Madras Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Till 1815, it was an open roadstead and exposed sandy coast, swept by occasional storms and monsoons. At the time, the natural harbour was so shallow that ships had to anchor over  offshore, and cargo was delivered to and from the shore in masula boats and catamarans. Cargo losses were high, close to 90 percent, in addition to pilfering with several goods from the ships often taken to the nearby evening bazaar. A  iron-screw pile pier capable of berthing larger vessels was built perpendicular to the shore in 1861. However, the storms of 1868 and 1872 made the initial piers inoperative. In 1875, Edward VII laid the foundation stone for a new port, and the masonry work for L-shaped breakwaters was started in 1876. The northern and southern groynes of the harbour were constructed, to create a still water enclosure that would be unaffected by storm and surf water. However, the groynes collapsed in 1877. The same year, construction of the south pier was commenced with concrete blocks weighing 33 tonnes each brought from Pallavaram, and the port started handling ships inside the harbour from 1881. However, again the storm of 12 November 1881 completely washed the almost-completed harbour, breaching over half a mile of breakwater. An artificial harbour was then built and the operations were started in 1881, and the pier was rebuilt in 1885, although there was a demand for relocating the entrance. Work on the harbour was completed in 1911. The Chennai Port Trust has taken the year 1881, the year of rebuilding, as the starting year. The cargo operations were carried out on the northern pier, located on the northeastern side of Fort St. George in Chennai. In the first couple of years the port registered traffic of 300,000 tonnes of cargo handling 600 ships. The first railway line in South India was laid between Madras and Arcot which started operating in 1856. By the late 19th century, the port was well connected to the other two important cities in the British colony, viz. Bombay (Mumbai) and Calcutta (Kolkata). In 1904, a new northeastern entrance was added to control siltation in the basin, after closing the original eastern entrance. The port's quays (berths) were constructed at different periods—the South Quay I in 1913, the five west quay berths between 1916 and 1920, the north quay in 1931 and the South Quay II in 1936, in the Inner Harbour, later christened Dr. Ambedkar Dock. Chennai was the only Indian city to be attacked by the Central Powers during World War I when a German cruiser, , shelled the oil depot within the port belonging to the Burmah Oil Company and raided vessels in 1914 disrupting trade, resulting in the death of at least 5 sailors. Other than Calcutta, which was practically taken over by the American army, Chennai port was the only other operational one in eastern waters during the Second World War. In 1911, the Royal Madras Yacht Club (RMYC), which is based within the Chennai Port premises, was founded by Sir Francis Joseph Edward Spring, the first chairman on the Madras Port Trust who was responsible for Chennai becoming a trading hub, especially during World War II. In 1916, the harbour office building was constructed.\n\nParagraph 8: Some argue that the particular models proposed by Sakharov and others have been proven impossible by the Weinberg–Witten theorem. However, models with emergent gravity are possible as long as other things, such as spacetime dimensions, emerge together with gravity. Developments in AdS/CFT correspondence after 1997 suggest that the microphysical degrees of freedom in induced gravity might be radically different. The bulk spacetime arises as an emergent phenomenon of the quantum degrees of freedom that are entangled and live in the boundary of the spacetime. According to some prominent researchers in emergent gravity (such as Mark Van Raamsdonk) spacetime is built up of quantum entanglement. This implies that quantum entanglement is the fundamental property that gives rise to spacetime. In 1995, Jacobson showed that the Einstein field equations can be derived from the first law of thermodynamics applied at local Rindler horizons. Thanu Padmanabhan and Erik Verlinde explore links between gravity and entropy, Verlinde being known for an entropic gravity proposal. The Einstein equation for gravity can emerge from the entanglement first law. In the \"quantum graphity\" proposal of Konopka, Markopoulu-Kalamara, Severini and Smolin, the fundamental degrees of freedom exist on a dynamical graph that is initially complete, and an effective spatial lattice structure emerges in the low-temperature limit.\n\nParagraph 9: In the original version of the film—as in the original Jonathan Hensleigh script—Emma, having escaped Russia via the American embassy, collapses while giving a lecture and dies in Simon Templar's arms. Watching the videotape back, he sees Ilya Tretiak stabbing her in the leg with the tip of his cane. The final half-hour has Simon returning to Moscow to destroy the villains' plans and avenge her death. With Dr. Botvin's help, he switches the formulas around and humiliates Ivan Tretiak during his show trial of the Russian president. The Tretiaks shoot their way out of the crowd and escape back to their mansion, with Simon and the Russian Army in pursuit. Ivan shoots the treacherous Dr. Botvin, and in turn Ilya shoots and kills Ivan. Simon arrives and finds the bodies of Botvin and Ivan Tretiak. Simon battles Ilya on the stairwell as Russian tanks pound the mansion walls, exposing and setting fire to the vast stockpile of heating oil in the basement. With the stairwell disintegrating around them, the fight spills out on to the chandelier, suspended above the blazing oil. Simon teases Ilya with the disc containing the formula for cold fusion. As he reaches out for it, Simon cuts the rope and Ilya plummets to a fiery death. Returning to Emma's home, Simon finds a letter from her, a tear fills his eye and he vows to use his skills only for good.\n\nParagraph 10: Archaeological evidence from Soba suggests a decline of the town, and therefore possibly the Alodian kingdom, from the 12th century. By  1300 the decline of Alodia was well advanced. No pottery or glassware postdating the 13th century has been identified at Soba. Two churches were apparently destroyed during the 13th century, although they were rebuilt shortly afterwards. It has been suggested that Alodia was under attack by an African, possibly Nilotic, people called Damadim who originated from the border region of modern Sudan and South Sudan, along the Bahr el Ghazal River. According to geographer Ibn Sa'id al-Maghribi, they attacked Nubia in 1220. Soba may have been conquered at this time, suffering occupation and destruction. In the late 13th century, another invasion by an unspecified people from the south occurred. In the same period poet al-Harrani wrote that Alodia's capital was now called Waylula, described as \"very large\" and \"built on the west bank of the Nile\". In the early 14th century geographer Shamsaddin al-Dimashqi wrote that the capital was a place named Kusha, located far from the Nile, where water had to be obtained from wells. The contemporary Italian-Mallorcan Dulcert map features both Alodia (\"Coale\") and Soba (\"Sobaa\").", "answers": ["Paragraph 2"], "length": 3565, "dataset": "passage_retrieval_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "d640c2f17111a0c5de38117a2bcbb631a62b6890b386ffc7"}
{"input": "After a month, Dick's choir appears at a competition, but only David performs in memory of his brother. The mine remains closed after the disaster, and the remaining miners struggle to gather coal from the top of a spoil heap. They are unable to earn the same amount of money as before and many have to rely on social benefits. Mrs Parry, who is now caring for five children, is visited by Mrs Owen, the mother of Emlyn's fiancée. Mrs Owen insists that Gwen cannot marry Emlyn because he doesn't make enough money to support her. However, Gwen secretly visits the Parry house and declares her love for Emlyn, regardless of his income. This inspires Emlyn to march to London with David and two other miners to demand that the government reopen the mine. However, when they arrive in London, they realize that the government is preoccupied with the looming threat of the German invasion of Poland. The government reopens the mine to distract and send the miners away. Upon their return to Wales, a fire breaks out in the mine, causing it to collapse and trapping the team inside. With limited oxygen remaining, one miner tries unsuccessfully to break through a weak rock with a pickaxe. Emlyn decides to use dynamite to create an exit, but David, fearing another Parry death, knocks him unconscious and activates the dynamite himself. The blast breaks through the rock, but David sacrifices his life in the process. The other miners wake up Emlyn, discover David's lifeless body, and pray for his soul. The mine is reopened, and the town celebrates as the coal is transported through the mine once again.", "context": "Paragraph 1: Gilman attended local elementary school in White Plains. Hoping for better education, in 1955 his parents sent him to The Taft School in Watertown, Connecticut, where he completed grades 10 to 12. The school was known for its sports activity, and he described it as \"a strict, monastic, and frankly unpleasant environment in the 1950s: academic boot camp.\" He recalled that he was \"the worst 120-pound lineman on the intramural tackle football team.\" He studied science at Yale University. His first research project was to test the adaptor hypothesis of Francis Crick. He worked in the laboratory of Melvin Simpson, where he met his future wife Kathryn Hedlund. (They were married in 1963.) He graduated in 1962 receiving a BA in biology with major in biochemistry. During summer break in 1962, he briefly worked at Burroughs Wellcome & Company in New York, under with Allan Conney. With Conney he published his first two research papers in 1963. He then entered a combined MD-PhD program at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine in Cleveland, Ohio where he wanted to study under Nobel laureate pharmacologist Earl Sutherland, who was a close friend of his father. It was Sutherland who had introduced the combined MD-PhD course, and invited Gilman to join course. But to Gilman, a seven-year program was like \"an eternity in purgatory\" and that he preferred not to have a degree in pharmacology, so he refused. Sutherland later persuaded him by explaining that pharmacology was \"just biochemistry with a purpose.\" However, Sutherland was departing for Vanderbilt University, so Gilman studied with Sutherland's collaborator, Theodore Rall. Gilman graduated from Case Western in 1969, then did his post-doctoral studies at the National Institutes of Health with Nobel laureate Marshall Nirenberg from 1969 to 1971. Nirenberg assigned him to work on the study of nerve endings (axons from cultured neuroblastoma cells), which he considered as \"a truly boring project.\" Instead, against the advice of Nirenberg, he worked on a new method for studying protein binding. After six weeks of working, he showed his result to Nirenberg, who immediately communicated it and got it published in 1970. The work was a simple and vital biochemical assay for studying cyclic AMP.\n\nParagraph 2: Along  of the main chain stretches the High Tauern National Park (Nationalpark Hohe Tauern), to which the Austrian Alpine Club as freeholder and the three states of Carinthia, Salzburg and Tyrol have contributed territory. With an area of about , it is by far the largest of Austria's seven national parks as well as the largest nature reserve in the Alps. It is divided into a core zone of  including the Grossglockner and Grossvenediger massifs, with complete prohibition of agricultural use, and a fringe zone of  used for forestry and alpine-meadow farming. Five special nature sanctuaries are protected from any human disturbance.\n\nParagraph 3: Quality management is a recent phenomenon but important for an organization. Civilizations that supported the arts and crafts allowed clients to choose goods meeting higher quality standards than normal goods. In societies where arts and crafts were the responsibility of master craftsmen or artists, these masters would lead studios and train and supervise others. However, the importance of craftsmen diminished as mass production and repetitive work practices were instituted. This approach’s aim was to produce large numbers of the same goods. The first proponent in the US for this approach was Eli Whitney, who proposed (interchangeable) parts manufacture for muskets, hence producing the identical components and creating a musket assembly line. The next step forward was promoted by several people including Frederick Winslow Taylor, a mechanical engineer who sought to improve industrial efficiency. He is sometimes called \"the father of scientific management.\" He was one of the intellectual leaders of the Efficiency Movement and part of his approach laid a further foundation for quality management, including aspects like standardization and adopting improved practices. Henry Ford was also important in bringing process and quality management practices into operation in his assembly lines. In Germany, Karl Benz, often called the inventor of the motor car, was pursuing similar assembly and production practices, although real mass production was only properly initiated in Volkswagen after World War II. From this period onwards, North American companies focused predominantly upon production against lower cost with increased efficiency.\n\nParagraph 4: A month later, Dick's choir appears at a competition but only David performs for Dick's memory. The mine has been closed since the disaster and the rest of the miners are reduced to gathering coal from the top of a spoil heap, but they are unable to make the same amount of money that the mine had paid them and many have to claim social benefits. A year later, Mrs Parry is struggling with five children to care for and is visited by Mrs Owen—the mother of Emlyn's fiancée, Gwen—who snaps that Gwen is not allowed marry Emlyn because he cannot make enough money to look after her. Gwen later sneaks to the Parry house and tells Emlyn that she would marry him no matter his income, which gives Emlyn the idea to march to London and demand that the government reopens the mine. Emlyn takes David and two other miners and they walk to London, and arrive the day after Germany invaded Poland. The British government are busy focusing on building up the army and reopen the mine to send the gatecrashers away. The team return to Wales and attempt to reopen the mine, but a large fire causes the mine to collapse which traps the team inside. Their candle flickers, indicating the oxygen is disappearing and David estimates they have an hour left until suffocation. One miner finds a weak rock and tries to break through with a pickaxe but he and David fail. Emlyn decides to leave the group to explode an exit through with dynamite, but, knowing that it could lead to another Parry death, David sneaks away as the rest of their team pray and punches Emlyn unconscious, activating the dynamite and breaking through the rock. The other two miners wake up Emlyn, discover David's lifeless body nearby and pray for David's soul. The mine is reopened and the town sing in unison as the coal is transported through the mine.\n\nParagraph 5: Like ibn Ezra, he presents his theology not in systematic and coherent form, but in observations made throughout the book, in connection with the various portions of the Torah. Unlike ibn Ezra, however, he avoids references to hidden mysteries of the Biblical text, insisting always on its plain meaning or its possible figurative significance. For the latter he especially uses the commentary of Nahmanides, whose pupil he is erroneously said to have been. Like Judah Hadassi and Maimonides, he accentuates the spirituality of God; but, unlike these, he assumes certain attributes of God to be inseparable from His essence, but to be taken rather as human forms of speech. In connection with this he dwells especially on the will of God, by which the world was created, and by which the celestial bodies are moved and governed. Angels are to him intelligences emanating from the divine intellect, not created beings; and the existence of demons he rejects as an absurdity. God's saying, \"Let us make man!\" he explains as signifying the cooperation of the spiritual with the sensuous in the creation and evolution of man; and when God is described as giving names to things, the meaning is that He prompts man to do so. Still, he opposes that rationalism which dissolves miracles into natural occurrences. Prophecy he explains as a psychological, not a physical, process, manifested in different forms; either the inner eye or ear perceiving the object in a vision or dream, or, the truth being on a higher plane, communicated intuitively. Only Moses received the divine revelation directly and clearly without any mind-obscuring vision. Abraham's call to sacrifice his son he takes to be a mere vision. Aaron is very outspoken on the subject of man's free will, opposing emphatically the notion held by ibn Ezra and others, that human destiny or disposition is influenced by the planets. The expression, that God hardened the heart of Pharaoh, he so interprets as not to contravene the principle of free will.\n\nParagraph 6: Sami comes back to town to find Nicole alive and married to her twin brother, Eric. She is revealed to be a grandmother after her daughter Allie becomes pregnant. She later claims Nicole tried to hide her grandson from her, which wasn't true. During this time Sami revealed her life with EJ after she left town and revealed that Johnny and Sydney are with him, along with his mother, Susan, who is looking after him for his hospice care. Sami is addressed as Mrs. Sami DiMera in her custody battle over her grandson with Eric and Nicole, whom she had been fighting with as well.  Sami even got restraining orders against them which were eventually lifted when Sami won custody of her grandson and wanted to allow them to say goodbye to him. Sami moved back into the DiMera mansion where her and EJ stayed to raise her grandson. She apologizes to John about causing his heart attack but John doesn't accept her apology and she just walks out. She went back to the DiMera mansion and saw Lucas and Nicole there, with Nicole holding her grandson, and she was not happy. Fortunately, Allie arrived at the home and stopped Sami from reacting any further. It was then revealed on September 21st that EJ is out of the hospice center and is at home in Rome with Sydney and Johnny looking after him. They have servants there to take care of the home. Allie dislikes the idea of her son being there around EJ and his kids because she thinks her mother, Sami, would spend more time taking care of EJ than with her son. It was revealed that Allie was raped by Steve Johnson's son, Tripp Dalton, which resulted in her pregnancy. Later, after the rape scandal, we learn that Tripp was not Allie's rapist, but it was in fact his brother, Charlie Dale (son of Ava Vitali). Sami is very mad at Allie for returning without a care for her son, and Allie even tried to take her grandson away and have the custody thrown out. Later that day Sami's twin brother, Eric, announces he’s leaving town for missionary work. He ends up getting angry at Sami before he leaves ends up slamming the door on her as he says goodbye to Nicole. Kate wasn’t okay with Sami taking her great grandson to Italy and tries to stop her. On September 25, Sami left town without her grandson and feels heartbroken but has to get back to EJ and take care of him.\n\nParagraph 7: The protests, which started on 2 July, are organized by some nationalist and leftist parties, primarily VMRO-DPMNE, its coalition Renewal, Levica, Democratic Party of Serbs in Macedonia and others. They rejected the EU's proposal to approve the country's negotiating framework, also known as the French proposal. The protesters rallied under the slogan \"Ultimatum, No Thanks!\" They also carried posters with inscriptions: \"Fuck the EU\" and \"Bulgarian fascism - European value\". On July 4, protesters symbolically burned the 2017 Treaty of Friendship, Good Neighborliness and Cooperation with Bulgaria, the 2018 Prespa agreement with Greece and the so-called French proposal for the start of North Macedonia's negotiation process with the EU, calling these documents fascist.North Macedonia: Nationalist protesters reject French EU proposal.  Deutsche Welle, 03.07.2022. Macedonian singer Lambe Alabakovski, who burned the documents, was arrested a month earlier by the police in Bitola in connection with the burning of a Bulgarian cultural center in the city. On 5 July, 47 policemen were injured. Protesters threw various items at the parliament building, government building and the building of the Ministry of Internal Affairs in Skopje. Offensive and even vulgar chants against the European Union and Bulgaria were heard during the protests. Slogans were raised that Bulgaria is a “fascist state” and the EU is a “fascist union”. Protesters in Skopje carried mostly the former national flag, abandoned under Greek pressure, because of its relation to the controversial antiquization nation building policy,Anastas Vangeli (2011) Nation-building ancient Macedonian style: the origins and the effects of the so-called antiquization in Macedonia, Nationalities Papers, 39:1, 13-32, as well as red flags with communist symbols, while the European flag was set on fire in one instance. The protesters demanded the resignation of the government and chanted also for the restoration of the former name of the country, disputed by Greece, because of its origin. Violence escalated further when groups of ethnic Macedonians and Albanians, clashed in the centre of Skopje, at the Skanderbeg Square. During the clash demonstrators threw stones at a group of people and three armed people were present, shots were fired into the air. The armed people were later apprehended by the police. As a result of the protests, the \"Albanian Alliance\" ended any partnership with the opposition, which practically left it isolated, because the other Albanian formations support the government. On 14 July, thousands of protesters protested in front of the parliament, while the French proposal was being discussed. President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen came to address the parliament, where she was met with whistles and jeers from the opposition MPs. The opposition MPs wore t-shirts with the word “no’ written on them in red and held up banners against the French proposal. At one point, MP Apasiev served von der Leyen a pamphlet with a large \"NO\" written on it. Prime Minister Dimitar Kovačevski also addressed the parliament and asked the MPs to accept the deal, while the opposition MPs protested. During the same day, a demonstration march was led by Kumanovo Municipality Mayor Maksim Dimitrievski in Kumanovo. On the next day an opposition lawmaker compared von der Leyen's visit to the Nazis' activity related to the Law for the Prevention of Hereditarily Diseased Offspring. VMRO-DPMNE also threatened that Prime Minister Kovačevski will be in prison for what he is doing to (North) Macedonia and its people. On July 16, the former Foreign Minister from VMRO-DPMNE Antonio Milošoski accused the ruling Social Democrats of treason. A deputy of the SDSM, asked him \"who are you to call us traitors, you who has several passports in your pocket\", alluding to the claims that he has Bulgarian citizenship, as many other Macedonians. At the end of the same session, with 68 \"yes\" votes, the parliament approved draft conclusions, giving the government a mandate to negotiate within the so-called \"French proposal\".\n\nParagraph 8: Prior to his abbotship, Hsin Ting held a variety of high posts, such as the secretary of Fo Guang Shan's Religious Affairs Committee, Managing Director of the Ilan Buddhist Society, President of the American Buddhist Youth Association, Vice President and later President of the BLIA chapter in Taiwan. He also served as abbot at Long Hua Temple in Malaysia, Hsi Lai Temple in California, Pu Men Temple in Taipei, and Pu Hsien Temple in Kaohsiung. Outside of Fo Guang Shan, Hsin Ting serves as a board member at the Humpty Dumpty Institute in New York City and as vice chair of the board of trustees at University of the West.\n\nParagraph 9: It is not in great demand, and even in Iceland it is only occasionally used to make folk medicines and in a few traditional dishes. In earlier times, it was much more widely used in breads, porridges, soups, etc. It forms a nutritious and easily digested amylaceous food, being used in place of starch in some preparations of hot chocolate. Cetraric acid or cetrarin, a white micro-crystalline powder with a bitter taste, is readily soluble in alcohol, and slightly soluble in water and ether. It has been recommended for medicinal use by alternative medicine sites, in doses of 2 to 4 grains (0.1 to 0.25 grams), as a bitter tonic and aperient. It is traditionally used to relieve chest ailments, irritation of the oral and pharyngeal mucous membranes and to suppress dry cough.\n\nParagraph 10: In 2005, Buehrle began the season with a 10–3 record, a 2.58 ERA and a 1.11 WHIP. On April 16, he finished a game against the Seattle Mariners in only 1 hour and 39 minutes, giving up only one run and three hits (all to Ichiro Suzuki), and backed by only two White Sox runs, both homers by Paul Konerko. In the game, he threw just 106 pitches. Subtracting the time spent between innings, the game took only  minutes to play. Buehrle was selected to the American League All-Star Team, and was named the starting pitcher after Roy Halladay could not to play due to a broken leg. He pitched two innings, allowing no runs and striking out three batters while earning a win. Buehrle's streak of 49 consecutive starts of six or more innings ended on August 1, 2005, after he was ejected for hitting Baltimore Orioles outfielder B. J. Surhoff. During the White Sox playoff run, Buehrle pitched a complete game against the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim in Game 2 of the ALCS, the first of four consecutive complete games for White Sox starters. On October 25, 2005, Buehrle became the first pitcher in World Series history to start and save consecutive games, earning a no-decision in Game 2 and his first career save in Game 3 of the 2005 World Series, which the Sox swept from the Houston Astros, winning their first world championship since 1917.", "answers": ["Paragraph 4"], "length": 3213, "dataset": "passage_retrieval_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "c061333422958078686828eac8506ea4cc2fb98266390ffa"}
{"input": "The text discusses the distinct appearance and specific elements of characters in Commedia dell'arte performances. The identification of a character is often achieved through their mask and how it affects their presence on stage. The masks can be grouped into four or five classes, including old men like Pantalone and Il Dottore, the adventurous man Il Capitano, the servant Zanni, and the crooked Pulcinella. Servant characters typically have long noses, with more curve for Pantalone, and those with names ending in \"ino\" are often small and round. Traditional servant masks have big noses and smaller eyes to create a primitive and lower-class look. The Capitano's mask has a strong brow with smaller eyes to emphasize his frown. Some characters may also have hair, beards, eyebrows, or eyelashes. For example, Brighella has a swirled-up mustache, while Il Capitano has a large nose and spiked mustache. Dottore sometimes has hair or eyebrows but no upper lip. Pantalone is known for his red and black costume, long pointed beard, and easily recognizable mask. Dottore and Pantalone, though both old men, have distinct looks.", "context": "Paragraph 1: One year ago, King Leo had made and held the Battle of the Beast God tournament in order to see who was worthy enough to challenge and fight against him from within their own given time and opportunity. Nine fighters had entered the tournament upon sight and that each of them had battled against one another from within a strong and relentless manner, but in the end, Sho Hayate had proven to be the strongest warrior and that he had won the tournament while defeating both King Leo and his fake impersonator King Lion from within the finals of the competition. To seek revenge against Hayate and those who caused his humiliating downfall, King Leo has organized a second version of the Battle of the Beast God tournament, but this time, there's a new rule: teams of two people must work together from within this new tournament so that they can either ensure victory or face defeat. The competitors from last year's tournament have learned of King Leo's new tournament and that each of them have decided to join forces with each other on either friendly or temporary terms. With the exception of Carol Stanzack (who decides to skip the tournament in order to continue her gymnastics training) and Nicola Zaza (who's too busy in having to work on his latest scientific project), Hayate and the fighters from the previous tournament have returned for combat and that they're ready to face the latest challenge that's presented to them by King Leo. However, the previous fighters aren't the only ones from within this tournament, as two new challengers have entered into the fray as well and that they have their own reasons in participating from within King Leo's new competition. The gathered fighters must be ready and prepared to not only fight against each other and King Leo from within this tournament, but also, they must deal with an unknown threat that lies directly from within the shadows of this competition as well.\n\nParagraph 2: There is also some external evidence corroborating to a certain degree the thesis about Cārvāka / Lokāyata affiliation of Jayarāśi. Vidyānanda who first mentions Jayarāśi brings some interesting details to light (alluded to above). In his Aṣṭa-śatī (AṣS 29.20–36.7), he explicitly indicates a category of nihilistic thinkers who reject a number of vital principles and claim that ‘There is no [reliable] omniscient authority (tīrtha-kāra), there is no [reliable] cognitive criterion (pramāṇa), there is no [reliable] authoritative doctrine (samaya) or [reliable] Vedas, or any kind of [reliable] reasoning (tarka), because they contradict each other,’ and he quotes a popular verse: ‘Reasoning is not established, testimonies differ, there is no sage whose words are a cognitive criterion (i.e., authoritative), the essence of the moral law (dharma) is concealed in a secret place (i.e., is not available). The [proper] path is that taken by the majority of people’[3]. Whether the verse comes from an unidentified Lokāyata source, which is not impossible, or not, it is echoed by Jayarāśi in the above mentioned verse at the beginning of his work and the expression ‘the worldly path’ (laukiko mārgaḥ). Interestingly, the verse has an obvious sceptical underpinning. The category of such ‘nihilists’ includes (1) the followers of the Lokāyata school (laukāyatika, AṣS 29.26), also known as the Cārvāka (AṣS 30.25), who are associated with the view that there is just one cognitive criterion, i.e. perception, and (2) the category of ‘those who propound the dissolution of [all] categories’ (tattvôpaplava-vādin, AṣS 31.2). Vidyānanda (AṣS 31.2 ff.) explains who the latter are: ‘Some who are those who propound the dissolution of [all] categories take (1) all the categories of cognitive criteria such as perception etc. and (2) all the categories of the cognoscibles as dissolved (i.e., not established)’. Throughout his text, Vidyānanda keeps these two traditions – the Lokāyata and the Tattvôpaplava — separate, although he does acknowledge that they are genetically related, the main difference between them being whether one recognises at least one cognitive criterion (Cārvāka / Lokāyata) or none (Jayarāśi). Further on, Vidyānanda begins the exposition of materialism (AṣS, p. 35.22 ff.) which is designated with a generic term ‘cognitive criteria-free assumption’ (apramāṇikā … iṣṭi), among which the first variety represents standard materialists who accept perception as the only cognitive criterion (AṣS, p. 35.19–37.9), and the second variety concerns ‘those who propound the dissolution of [all] categories’ (tattvôpaplava-vādin) who do not accept any cognitive criteria (pramāṇa) (AṣS, p. 37.10 ff.). Also Anantavīrya explicitly classifies Jayarāśi as a materialist by making a pun on the word cārvāka: ‘The author of “[The Lion Destroying] the Delusion of Categories’” says what is charmingly chastised by the Cārvākas’ (SViṬ, p. 277.19: tattvôpaplava-kṛd āha – cārvākaiś cāru carcitam…).\n\nParagraph 3: Simoneau made his debut in 1949 at the Opéra-Comique of Paris as Vincent in Gounod's opera Mireille and at the Paris Opera as Tamino in Mozart's The Magic Flute. He made his debut at the Aix-en-Provence Festival in 1950 singing Ottavio in Don Giovanni and Ferrando in Così fan tutte. The following year, 1951, he made his debut at the Glyndebourne Festival as Idamante in Idomeneo. His performances at these two festivals quickly established him as the outstanding Mozartian tenor of his time. He was invited to sing at the Salzburg Festival and the Edinburgh International Festival, at the Vienna State Opera and at La Scala in Milan, while pursuing his career in France, in roles such as Nadir in Bizet's Les pêcheurs de perles, Gérald in Delibes' Lakmé. He took part in the revival of opera such as Rameau's Les Indes galantes and Orphée in the French version for tenor of Gluck's Orfeo ed Euridice. In France he was frequently singing opposite his wife, who was a light lyric coloratura soprano excelling in the same repertoire as her husband.\n\nParagraph 4: Liberals sought economic development under the assumption that the economy would flourish if the structure of landholding would re-ordered. For this reason, they targeted the corporate holdings of the Catholic Church and indigenous communities that held ownership in common. Liberals saw both as stumbling blocks to economic development, which they envisioned as the creation of a class of small-scale yeoman farmers. They targeted indigenous communities' material support since they sought to transform indigenous from being ethnically, socially, and economically separate from Mexico, seeking to make them individual citizens of the secular Mexican nation-state rather than members of their community. Breaking up collective indigenous community landholdings and giving community members a chance to purchase parcels held as private property was a failure. Individual community members did not have the capital to purchase such holdings, so that the buyers were largely well-off non-indigenous who could now acquire land suddenly on the market. Many buyers were large estate owners who could expand the holdings, but a number were liberals.  Although liberals sought to undermine the economic power of the Church by the forced sale of property, much of their property was urban and not rural. Miguel Lerdo de Tejada, author of the Lerdo Law, purchased disentailed Church property in Veracruz for 33,000 pesos, a significant sum.  Other liberals also acquired disentailed property worth over 20,000 pesos, including Ignacio Comonfort, José María Iglesias, Juan Antonio de la Fuente, and Manuel Payno. The land reform did not stimulate industrial development with capital now freed from investment in real estate; and it did not result in improvements in rural property since many buyers exhausted their capital on the purchase price itself. The Reform did create an expanded base of urban property owners who bought Church-owned property.  Since economic development remained a liberal goal, the disappointing lack of industrial development from domestic capital meant that pursue the program liberals had to look to foreign investors and a situation of economic dependency.\n\nParagraph 5: The dried juice, virgin scammony, obtained by incision of the living root, has been used in traditional medicine as scammonium, but the variable quality of the drug has led to the employment of scammoniae resina, which is obtained from the dried root by digestion with alcohol. Upon consumption, the resin is inert until it has passed from the stomach into the duodenum, where it meets the bile.  A chemical reaction occurs between it and taurocholate and glycocholate in the bile, whereby it is converted into a powerful purgative which in high doses becomes a violent gastrointestinal irritant.  Scammony kills both roundworm and tapeworm, especially the former, and it was therefore used as an anthelmintic.\n\nParagraph 6: Jews were especially involved as translators. Moses ibn Tibbon translated from the Arabic Jabir ben Aflah's acute criticisms of the Ptolemaic system, an anticipation of Copernicus, and thus brought them to the notice of Maimonides. Ibn al-Haitham's Arabic compendium of astronomy was a particular favorite of Jewish astronomers; besides being translated into Spanish by Don Abraham Faquin, it was turned into Hebrew by Jacob ben Makir and Solomon ibn Pater Cohen and into Latin by Abraham de Balmes. Other translations from the Arabic were by Jacob Anatoli, Moses Galeno, and Kalonymus ben Kalonymus, bringing the Greco-Arabic astronomers to the notice of western Europe. Jacob Anatoli, for example, translated into Hebrew both the Almagest and Averroes' compendium of it, and this Hebrew version was itself translated into Latin by Jacob Christmann. Other translators from the Hebrew into Latin were Abraham de Balmes and Kalonymus ben David of Naples, while David Kalonymus ben Jacob, Ephraim Mizraḥi, and Solomon Abigdor translated from the Latin into Hebrew. The well-known family of translators, the Ibn Tibbons, may be especially mentioned. In practical astronomy Jewish work was even more effective. Jacob ben Makir (who is known also as Profiat Tibbon) appears to have been professor of Astronomy at Montpellier, about 1300, and to have invented a quadrant to serve as a substitute for the astrolabe. Levi ben Gershon was also the inventor of an astronomical instrument, and is often quoted with respect under the name of Leon de Bañolas. Bonet de Lattes also invented an astronomical ring. Abraham Zacuto ben Samuel was professor of Astronomy at Salamanca, and afterward astronomer-royal to Emmanuel of Portugal, who had previously been advised by a Jewish astronomer, Rabbi Joseph Vecinho, a pupil of Abraham Zacuto, as to the project put before him by Christopher Columbus, who, in carrying it out, made use of Zacuto's \"Almanac\" and \"Tables.\"\n\nParagraph 7: Each character has specific elements and a distinct appearance that makes them recognizable in performances across the world. A character's identification is often found through their mask and how it impacts their presence on stage. There are four or five classes that the masks can be grouped into: the old men such as Pantalone and Il Dottore; the young and adventurous man, Il Capitano; the servant sometimes named Zanni; and another old man though more crooked and crippled Pulcinella. The servant characters such as Zanni typically will have a long nose, sometimes with more curve for Pantalone, and the servants whose names that end in \"ino\" such as Truffaldino or Arlecchino are more often small and round. To follow traditional masks the servant characters such as Zanni should have big noses and smaller eyes, this creates a more animal look making them seem more primitive, as the servant is lower than the master. The zanni mask was one of the first and was a full mask, covering the full face and sometimes head, until the bottom of the mouth was removed. Capitano's mask has a strong brow, in a frown, wide eyes would only make his farrowed brow less prominent so the smaller eyes are better for him as well. Some characters also have hair, beards, eyebrows, or eyelashes. Brighella is one character mentioned to have a beard in some early mentions of masked characters. He is often known to have a mustache now that is swirled up to give him the mischievous feeling. Il Capitano is often described as having a long nose as well as Zanni, though typically larger. He also has a mustache sometimes that is a stiff and strong mustache under such a large nose, it almost looks like spikes poking out. Dottore also sometimes has hair, in the form of a small mustache, or eyebrows, and no upper lip. His mask covers the actors forehead and nose exposing their cheeks. Leaving the cheeks exposed so that the actor may use blush to create the look that he enjoys his spirits. Pantalone is known for his red and black costume but also his beard and easily recognizable mask.  His long pointed beard looks almost like an extension of his equally long nose, he sometimes also has a mustache and some bushy eyebrows to give him a very distinct look. Dottore and Pantalone though both old men, have very different looks.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Commedia delArte An Actors Handbook|last=Rudlin|first=John|publisher=Routledge|year=1994}}</ref>\n\nParagraph 8: Given the task of forming the personalities of the Crash Nitro Kart cast through the full-motion videos, the Red Eye Studio artists set certain rules for how each character would carry itself by default. As animator Thomas Happ noted, \"N. Gin, for example, would always default to twitchy, side-to-side glances, while Tiny would often scratch his head in confusion. There were a lot of scenes where the characters are just standing around listening to Emperor Velo talk, and we had to invent ways to personalize their mannerisms and create a uniquely 'thinking character'.\" To achieve the bold and deeply saturated colors and textures for the characters and environments, the artists used Maya as well as Adobe Photoshop and Corel Painter. While the artists adapted many of the sets and props in the cinematics from in-game counterparts, they recreated the majority of these objects from scratch in order to add surrealism to the scenery. The cinematics were completed well in advance of the four-month deadline. The console version of Crash Nitro Kart was announced by Vivendi Universal prior to the Electronic Entertainment Expo of 2003, while the N-Gage version was announced on February 16, 2004. Crash Nitro Kart is among the first titles to be developed using the Intrinsic Alchemy middleware technology following Vicarious Visions' purchase of its rights from the defunct Intrinsic Graphics.Crash Nitro Kart was released for the PlayStation 2, Xbox, GameCube and Game Boy Advance in North America on November 11, 2003, and in Europe on November 28, 2003; The N-Gage version of the game was released in Europe on June 30, 2004, and in North America on July 28, 2004. The mobile version was released on September 20, 2004. The PlayStation 2 version was re-released in the three-disc \"Crash Bandicoot Action Pack\" compilation (alongside Crash Twinsanity and Crash Tag Team Racing) in the United States on June 12, 2007, and in Europe on July 20, 2007.\n\nParagraph 9: Joseph Reid Anderson (February 16, 1813 – September 7, 1892) was an American civil engineer, industrialist, politician and soldier. During the American Civil War he served as a Confederate general, and his Tredegar Iron Company was a major source of munitions and ordnance for the Confederate States Army. Starting with a small forge and rolling mill in the mid-1830s, It was a flourishing operation by 1843 when he leased it. He eventually bought the company outright in 1848 and forcefully and aggressively built Tredegar Iron Works into the South's largest and most significant iron works. When the Civil War broke out he entered the Army as a brigadier general in 1861.  Shortly after he was wounded and then resigned from the Army returning to the iron works. It was the Confederacy's major (and for much of the war only) source of cannons and munitions, employing some 900 workers, most of whom were slaves. His plant was confiscated by the Union army at the end of the war, but returned to him in 1867 and he remained president until his death. Anderson was very active in local civic and political affairs.\n\nParagraph 10: By September, it was the opinion of many supporters that the Fast had made a significant contribution to the peace movement. By the 6th week, the presidents of the World Council of Churches and the U.S. National Council of Churches cabled and urged an end to the Fast, as did some congressmen. A message was sent to fasters from Rev. Philip Potter, General Secretary of the World Council of Churches, commending the life-affirming action having heard the testimonies of thousands from around the world. Part of the message read, \"Your fasting has fed the solidarity of all who hunger for disarmament.  In your weakness you have made us strong.\" The message called on the fasters to end their fast, having \"encouraged the representatives of the member churches of the World Council to commit themselves further in this way\". With doctors increasingly fearful, fasters at the three centers (Oakland, Bonn and Paris) decided on September 13 to end their fast September 15. Andrea Elukovich continued three more days. In early October, the French fasters were granted a two-hour audience with President Mitterrand where they affirmed their opposition to nuclear buildup and testing in Polynesia. The final edition of \"The Date Is Set\" (November 1983) chronicled that French priest Joseph Pyronnet fasted for 15 days until October 18 when he held a press conference as bishops assembled for the Synod of Reconciliation. On October 30, Tom Siemer reported a letter he presented to the World Catholic Bishops' Synod was read aloud by Cardinal Loerschreider of Brazil. The Synod adopted the terms of Tom's letter by issuing a summary which condemned nuclear weapons, and signed by 15 Catholic communities around Rome. On October 24 in Stockholm, Sweden, significant blockades were held at the British, West German and Italian embassies following a day on non-violence training. Further actions also occurred throughout Europe in the months following the end of the fast. An international meeting was held in Lyon, France on September 24–25 1983, where two hundred people assembled. Acknowledging the power that fasting had shown, the gathering undertook to pursue the same aims; the moral pressure on governments to respond to the Fast's appeals for greater justice in this shared world would be maintained until a reversal in the escalation of nuclear weapons occurs, and real attempts to confront the plight of the world's hungry are made. Alan Burns, from the Scottish support group, agreed to act as international coordinator to maintain communications between participating countries. According to Alan Burns, this was continued through the summer of 1984, when an international gathering took place in Oxford, England on June 1-3 with about 20 people participating to assess the Fast's effect.", "answers": ["Paragraph 7"], "length": 3272, "dataset": "passage_retrieval_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "c4286c67441459fa029c52f9e62f1bb16e348da4d623dec9"}

In 2003, these operations increased as Morón became key for airlift and fighter deployments in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. In 2004, the 496th ABS started reporting to the 712th Air Base Group and was realigned under the 38th Combat Support Wing of Ramstein Air Base, Germany later that year. In 2007, the 712th ABG inactivated and the 496th ABS was realigned again under the 86th Operations Group of Ramstein Air Base. In April 2019 the 496th ABS was realigned again under the 65th Air Base Group creating the Atlantic Air Bridge.\n\nParagraph 3: We met many sledges laden with goods en route to the fair which takes place every February at Irbit. This fair is of great importance to Siberia, and attracts merchants from all the region west of Tomsk. From forty to fifty million rubles worth of goods are exchanged there during the four weeks devoted to traffic. The commodities from Siberia are chiefly furs and tea, those from Europe comprise a great many articles. Irbit is on the Asiatic side of the Ural mountains, about two hundred versts northeast of Ekaterineburg. It is a place of little consequence except during the time of the fair.\n\nParagraph 4: British Steel saw the band reprise the commercial sound they had established on Killing Machine. This time, they abandoned some of the dark lyrical themes which had been prominent on their previous releases, but some of it still remains. In a June 2017 appearance on Sirius radio podcast \"Rolling Stone Music Now,\" Rob Halford said the band may have been inspired by AC/DC on some tracks after supporting them on a European tour in 1979. British Steel was recorded in December 1979 at Tittenhurst Park, home of former Beatle Ringo Starr, after a false start at Startling Studios, also located on the grounds of Tittenhurst Park, due to the band preferring Starr's house to the recording studio itself. Digital sampling was not yet widely available at the time of recording, so the band used analog recording of smashing milk bottles to be included in \"Breaking the Law\", as well as various sounds in \"Metal Gods\" produced by billiard cues and trays of cutlery. It is the first Judas Priest album to feature drummer Dave Holland, and it was released in the UK at a discount price of £3.99, with the advertisements in the music press bearing the legend \"British Steal\". The songs \"Breaking the Law\", \"United\", and \"Living After Midnight\" were released as singles.\n\nParagraph 5: Cristóvão da Costa is believed to have been born somewhere in Africa, possibly in Tangier, Ceuta (both Portuguese cities at the time), or in Portuguese Cape Verde, since in his work he claims to be African (Christophorus Acosta Africanus), but the exact place and date of his birth remain unknown. He probably studied at Salamanca and first travelled to the East Indies in 1550 as a soldier. He took part in some campaigns against the native populace, and at one point was taken prisoner and held captive in Bengal. After returning to Portugal, he joined his former captain, Luís de Ataíde, who had been appointed viceroy of Portuguese India. He returned to Goa in 1568, the year Garcia de Orta died. He served as personal physician to the viceroy, and in 1569 was appointed physician to the royal hospital in Cochin, where he had the opportunity of treating the king of Cochin. By 1571, he was noted as collecting botanical specimens from various parts of India. He returned to Portugal in 1572 after Ataíde's term ended. From 1576 to 1587 he served as surgeon and then physician in Burgos (Spain).\n\nParagraph 6: Dr. Fisher was a pioneer for medical reform in Boston. He is credited with introducing the stethoscope into the United States and was an early advocate for the practice of mediate auscultation—listening to the body through a stethoscope—using the techniques that he had learned during his studies in Paris with Laënnec. In July 1832, while using auscultation to examine a child affected with chronic hydrocephalus, he discovered what was called \"cephalic bellows-sound\" or \"cerebral murmur\", a phenomenon related to cerebral circulation which was thought to be a physical symptom of diseases of the brain.  His findings were circulated in medical journals throughout the world. However, the phenomenon was dismissed in 1880 as being without pathological significance. He was among those present in the Ether Dome at Massachusetts General Hospital when ether was first used in public for a surgical operation, described by many as the most significant event in American medical history. He was one of the first to use ether during childbirth. Although Antoine Jean Desormeaux, a French surgeon, first introduced the endoscope to a patient and is considered the Father of Endoscopy, Dr. Fisher had several years earlier described an endoscope initially to inspect the vagina, but later modified it to examine the bladder and urethra. As one of a group of young American doctors influenced by the teachings of another French physician, Pierre Louis, Dr. Fisher was an advocate of the \"numerical method\" in the United States, where the emphasis on the collection of observable, detailed data and their statistical analysis became a guideline for medical research and the foundation for epidemiology.  He was present along with William Cogswell, Richard Fletcher, Oliver Peabody and Lemuel Shattuck at a meeting held on November 17, 1839, in which the American Statistical Association (ASA) was formed.  These men were graduates of Brown, Dartmouth, and Harvard and were trained in law, medicine, theology, literature and education. The constitution of the Society set out as its aims: \"...to collect, preserve, and diffuse statistical information in the different departments of human knowledge.\"  It was particularly instrumental in improving public health and encouraging advances in preventive medicine.  He was also a member of the Massachusetts Medical Society which, in concert with the ASA in 1842, led the effort to establish the first statewide system to collect and publish vital statistics in the United States.  In 1846, Dr. Fisher was elected attending physician at Massachusetts General Hospital, a position he held until his death on March 3, 1850, at his home in Hayward Place, Boston.  On March 17, 1850, the hospital's Board of Trustees expressed its deep regret for \"...the loss of an officer who, to high scientific attainments, united amiable and unassuming manners and the greatest kindness of heart; one who has uniformly discharged in a most zealous, faithful, and acceptable manner his duties toward this institution.\"  A white marble monument in his memory stands in Mount Auburn Cemetery, Cambridge, Massachusetts.\n\nParagraph 7: Neveh Shalom came from two other synagogues. Neveh Zedek and Ahavi Shalom. Ahavi Shalom was led for three years by Rabbi Julius Eckman. During these early years Jews of Prussian and Polish ethnicity were the primary demographic of the synagogue. Ahavi was known as the Polisha Shul. After Eckman left a Hazzan named Robert Abrahamson served as both the hazzan and the Rabbi due to difficulties in finding a new one. By 1889 Ahavi Shalom began conducting sermons in English instead of German. The synagogues Talmund Torah and Neveh Zedek merged in 1902, creating the modern Neveh Zedek. As the synagogue grew the need for new buildings to fit the growing congregation size arose, resulting in the construction of two buildings in 1904, 1911, and 1950. Throughout the 1920's Neveh Zedek struggled to find a Rabbi, relying on its cantor Abraham Rosencrantz, who served until 1936, the same year he died. During this period, in 1921, Neveh Zedek joined the Conservative movement. Two years later an arson set fire to the synagogue. After World War 2 an influx of Jewish refugees due to the Holocaust resulted in Neveh Zedek's teachings shifting into a more traditional style. In 1953 a new Rabbi named Joshua Stampfer arrived at the synagogue. Joshua Stampfer created a Jewish preschool which would later turn into a Foundation School. A year later, in 1954, a non-Jew named Major Pruitt would come to the synagogue to learn everything he could about Judaism. While at the synagogue he organized weddings and bar mitzvahs, kept track of yahrzeits, and he would oversee the synagogue's kosher kitchen. In 1961 Neveh Zedek merged with Ahvahai Shalom to form Neveh Shalom. In 1965 the religious schools run by the synagogue grew. They taught classes on modern and traditional Judaism and they discussed issues from a Jewish perspective. The Rabbi would also lead book discussions. Chaim Potok, Robert Kennedy, and Abraham Joshua Heschel were all hosted as speakers at the congregation in the 1960s. Kennedy would speak in 1968 during his presidential campaign. Min Zidell was the first woman to serve as a member of the board. She became a member in 1967. The first female executive director of the synagogue, Carolyn Weinstein, became so in 1976. 1967 was also the year women officially became equal to men within the law of the synagogue. By 2009 it was the largest Conservative synagogue located in Oregon.\n\nParagraph 8: Between 1996 and 2009, the mast provided BBC One Wales and S4C to most of the town's residents. Its transmissions utilised spare UHF capacity in which to relay transmissions from the Moel-y-Parc transmitting station on low power (via another similar relay in nearby Bagillt). Due to limited capacity, it was not possible for the site to carry BBC Two Wales or ITV1 Wales. Owing to the constraints of local geography and location of the main Moel-y-Parc transmitter, residents in the town and some surrounding areas had previously been unable to fully access Welsh television output (provided in both the Welsh and English languages). Reception of the Welsh TV stations varied from poor to un-viewable and as a consequence programming was supplied almost exclusively by the North West of England-based TV stations such as ITV1 Granada, easily receivable with a set top aerial. As Flint falls outside the normal coverage area of these TV stations, reference in local programming was rarely ever made to the area. The relay was only installed following a campaign spearheaded by the Welsh-language group Teledu I Pawb (). The group considered the bias toward North West of England regional TV programming across many parts of the North Wales coastal strip unacceptable and detrimental to the preservation and promotion of the Welsh Language, culture and national identity. Similar relays were installed at the same time in the nearby Village of Bagillt and the Town of Holywell. The latter also transmits BBC Radio Cymru. It is estimated that the three relays have made available Welsh regional TV programming to some 24,000 to 30,000 residents. A number of nearby localities remained without any terrestrial access to Welsh TV and radio output including Mostyn and Fynnongroyw. Viewers (and listeners) in these areas (and indeed across the UK) were, however, able to pick up all the Welsh TV and radio output via Sky satellite.\n\nParagraph 9: CJSW finances its capital budget through a week-long funding drive held every October. Raising $13,585 in its first effort in 1985 and approximately $21,000 the following year, the totals brought in from this appeal to the community listenership have steadily increased annually.  In March 1987, a second referendum asking for a $1 per term per student increase in the station's levy was voted on by the University's students.  In an extremely contentious decision involving partisan behaviour by the vote's chief returning officer, the additional levy was won-by one vote.  Since 2001, funding drive pledge totals have been consistently above $150,000.  In 2006, the station reached and surpassed its goal of $200,000 (a feat repeated in subsequent years), and exceeded $240,000 in 2014. The funding drives have contribute to significant changes in the station, including a text-in service for listeners in 2015, the McHugh house (Downtown) venue for all ages concerts, and in 2017 'CJSW in the Wild\"- live broadcasting capabilities. This extraordinary success has made CJSW a model for other campus and community broadcasters across the country, and the station shares its experience and knowledge with those peers wishing to solidify their finances and public profile.\n\nParagraph 10: The patriarch of the Syriac Orthodox Church sent Matthew Nakkar to Damascus to be coped with the problems. His task was to seize by the Turkish authorities of Bishop James al-Haliani, however, Matthew was unable to catch him, because al-Haliani managed to hide in the mountains near the Lebanese Maronites. All that managed to Saint Matthew - it recovered to jail 25 people to Catholicism, after which he went to Jerusalem to meet the Passover. Matthew Nakkar hoping to witness the descent of the Holy Fire - a miracle, which was one of the major arguments against Catholicism. The contemplation of this miracle, as expected in March, was to give him the strength and determination in the fight against Catholics. In Holy Saturday of 1832 Nakkar with his deacon came to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. They mingled with the crowd who wanted to light their own candles from the miraculous fire, Matthew Nakkar heard that the fire in the first few seconds does not burn any hands or face, or even a hair, so as soon as he lit his candle held it to his beard deacon however, Beard deacon immediately broke out. Matthew accused his deacon due to lack of faith, however, the incident sowed doubt in his mind that he had been taught before. Soon after his conversion to Catholicism were found in Aleppo, which became the seat of the Patriarch of the Syriac Catholic Church. Local Catholics staged a lavish reception to Matthew Nakkar, however, failed to appease his persecutor, they save only that started a month of Ramadan and the Turks, as Muslims, were not set up to organize the hunt in the holy month. Metropolitan of Mosul Matthew Nakkar was forced to stay in the city for a month. Thanks to the error of his servant, he stopped at the founding fathers of the Lazarists, whose monastery servant took over the hotel. As the monks were warmly received Matthew, he decided to stay in the monastery, the decision is also influenced by his curiosity and desire to debate with \"heretics.\" The discussions mainly focused on provisions of Chalcedon and the question about the number of natures in Christ. Soon Matthew Nakkar became clear that Catholics oppose the argument is much more difficult than he thought before, a special impression made on him, given evidence from the writings of Saint Ephrem the Syrian, one of the most revered Jacobite saints. Matthew Nakkar asked the monks permission to use their library to prepare arguments. The study of the Fathers of the Church in the monastery library, as well as discussions with the monks have led to the fact that on November 27, 1832 in the Catholic Church of Aleppo, it was in March of that which Matthew has not long been trying to close, he was admitted to the Syriac Catholic Church by Patriarch Ignatius Peter VII Jarweh.", "answers": ["Paragraph 1"], "length": 2698, "dataset": "passage_retrieval_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "5b4d74d9c3484eadef42c44e46584db5a2ade72966863fb2"}
{"input": "During World War II, the distribution of small paperbacks to military forces led to a demand for cheap books among the American population. This resulted in the emergence of a new trend in publishing after the war, known as \"pulp\" fiction. These books were inexpensive, sensational, and widely distributed using new technology. Despite being considered low-brow, many pulp authors are now celebrated. Pulp fiction often addressed taboo topics such as drugs, gangs, crime, and homosexuality. Because the literature was not respected, it faced less censorship, although publishers were cautious about certain themes. In terms of lesbian fiction, pulp books provided the only access to stories involving lesbian characters for many people in certain locations.", "context": "Paragraph 1: The silvery gibbon ranks among the most threatened primates. It is listed as Endangered on the 2009 IUCN Red List, with the population appearing more stable than in a 2004 assessment of the species being Critically Endangered, which suggested there was a 50% chance of the silvery gibbon becoming extinct within the next decade. Habitat destruction on densely populated Java continues to reduce the natural range of the species.  Many gibbons are also lost to the illegal pet trade, when adults are hunted so their young can be sold in the markets as pets. There are less than 2,000 silvery gibbons in the wild on eight sites that are considered to be genetically viable for the continuation of the species. There are also a dozen small, non-viable populations. Mount Halimun Salak National Park sustains the largest population of ca. 1,000 gibbons. Other large populations of several hundred are found in the Gunung Ciremai National Park and Gunung Gede Pangrango National Park. In the latter there is a Javan Gibbon Centre that rehabilitates ex-captive gibbons.\n\nParagraph 2: He was born at Florence on the September 3, 1643. At the age of twenty, when he had already begun his researches on the structure of the kidneys and had described the papillary ducts (also known as Bellini's ducts; latin: ductus Bellini, tubulus Bellini, tubuli Belliniani; see: duct of bellini, bellini duct carcinoma), as published in his book Exercitatio Anatomica de Structura Usu Renum (1662), he was chosen professor of theoretical medicine at Pisa, but soon after was transferred to the chair of anatomy. After spending thirty years at Pisa, he was invited to Florence and appointed physician to the grand duke Cosimo III, and was also made senior consulting physician to Pope Clement XI. He died at Florence on the January 8, 1704. His works were published in a collected form at Venice in 1708.\n\nParagraph 3: In early 2008, CDTA announced that it was going forward with the bus rapid transit line on NY 5, which included 19 upgraded stations. NY 5 BRT service began on Monday, April 4, 2011, with new silver and red-branded Gillig 40-foot hybrid buses, numbered Route #905 and referred to as BusPlus. When NY 5 BusPlus service began, Route #55 was renumbered Route #355 and shortened to provide Rt. 5 local service, between Downtown Schenectady and Colonie Center.  Route #1 continues to provide Rt. 5 local service between Downtown Albany and Colonie Center. Route #55x (the Schenectady/Albany Express buses) was replaced with Routes #530, #531 and #532 (Route #532 was merged with Route #531 on November 13, 2011). Route #2 was replaced with Routes #125 and #138 during Phase 1 of the Albany County Route Restructuring in November 2011. BusPlus service runs the entire length of the Route 5 corridor, although it currently operates differently from the original plans.  In the short term, transit signal priority and queue jump lanes are being constructed and will be rolled out as features of the bus rapid transit service.  Although it is called bus rapid transit, Route #905 is more of an enhanced limited-stop service than an actual BRT service, with only 19 stops between Downtown Schenectady and Downtown Albany.  Improvements and expansions to BusPlus are still in planning, with proposed lines along the Washington Ave./Western Ave. corridor in Albany and along the NY 32/Broadway corridor between Downtown Albany, Menands and Troy/Cohoes. In November 2020, the BRT BusPlus Service was expanded from one to three routes with #905 being referred to as the \"Red Line\" and the two new routes that operate along the NY 32/Broadway corridor between Downtown Albany, Menands, and Troy/Cohoes, #922 & #923, as the \"Blue Line\". The proposed line along the Washington Ave./Western Ave. corridor is being referred to as the \"Purple Line\".\n\nParagraph 4: On 22 February 2019 at 01:45 UTC, SpaceX launched the Beresheet lunar lander, developed by Israel's SpaceIL organization. Launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida on a Falcon 9 booster, with the lander being one of three payloads on the rocket. Beresheet arrived near the Moon using a slow but fuel-efficient trajectory. Taking six weeks and several increasingly large orbits around the Earth, it first achieved a large elliptical orbit around Earth with an apogee near . At that point, with a short deceleration burn, it was caught by the Moon's gravity in a highly elliptical lunar orbit, an orbit which was circularized and reduced in diameter over a week's time, before attempting a landing on the Moon's surface on 11 April 2019. The mission was the first Israeli, and the first privately funded, lunar landing attempt. SpaceIL was originally conceived in 2011 as a venture to pursue the Google Lunar X Prize. On 11 April 2019 Beresheet crashed on the surface of the Moon, as a result of a main engine failure in the final descent. The Beresheet lunar lander's target landing destination was within Mare Serenitatis, a vast volcanic basin on the Moon's northern near side. Despite the failure, the mission represents the closest a private entity has come to a soft lunar landing.\n\nParagraph 5: CSI originally starred William Petersen and Marg Helgenberger alongside an ensemble including George Eads, Gary Dourdan, and Paul Guilfoyle. Jorja Fox joined the cast in episode two of the first season, whilst Eric Szmanda and Robert David Hall recurred throughout the first two seasons of the show before being promoted to regular status starting with the third. Louise Lombard, who first appeared in season five, joined the cast starting with season seven. The first major cast overhaul came with the show's eighth and ninth seasons. Lombard departed the cast in the first episode of season eight, whilst Fox departed in episode seven of the same season. Wallace Langham joined the main cast following Lombard's departure, having recurred since the third season. Fox would return for guest appearances during the ninth season in order to facilitate the departures of both Gary Dourdan and William Petersen, who were replaced by Lauren Lee Smith and Laurence Fishburne, respectively. Smith departed the cast at the end of her first year, and was replaced by a returning Jorja Fox, who featured in a recurring capacity. Liz Vassey and David Berman, who had recurred from season six, and season one, respectively, also joined the cast starting with season ten. Like Smith, Vassey departed the cast after a single season, and was replaced by Fox, who rejoined the main cast. William Petersen would appear in voice clips sporadically over the next three seasons. Fishburne departed the main cast at the end of season eleven, a season that featured guest appearances by Elisabeth Harnois and Louise Lombard, and was replaced by Ted Danson. Danson made his main cast debut alongside Elisabeth Harnois at the start of the twelfth season. Series lead Marg Helgenberger departed the main cast in the twelfth episode of season twelve and was replaced by Elisabeth Shue. Season thirteen saw Jon Wellner join the main cast after eight years a guest star. Helgenberger returned for a single episode in season fourteen, while Paul Guilfoyle departed at the end of the same year, followed by Elisabeth Shue and George Eads at the end of the fifteenth season. The show's finale, a two-hour film, featured the return of Helgenberger, Petersen, and Guilfoyle. The series finale marked their final appearances, as well as the final appearances of Fox, Szmanda, Hall, Langham, Berman, Harnois, and Wellner. Ted Danson went on to reprise his role of Russell during season two of Cyber.\n\nParagraph 6: After the Panama Canal Company went bankrupt in 1888 amidst charges of fraud, Bunau-Varilla was left stranded in Panama.  He struggled to find a new way to construct the canal.  When the New Panama Canal Company sprang up back in his native France, Bunau-Varilla sailed home, having purchased a large amount of stock.  However, as de Lesseps' company had before, the New Panama Canal Company soon abandoned efforts to build the canal.  It sold the land in Panama to the United States, in hopes that the company would not fail entirely.  U.S. President Grover Cleveland, an anti-imperialist, avoided the canal issue.  When the more supportive Theodore Roosevelt became president in 1901, canal planning resumed in the United States.  Bunau-Varilla energetically promoted a canal in Panama.  With aid from the New Panama Canal Company's New York attorney, William Nelson Cromwell, he persuaded the government to select Panama as the canal site, as opposed to the popular alternative, Nicaragua.  When opponents voiced their interest in constructing a canal through Nicaragua, which was a less politically volatile nation, Bunau-Varilla actively lobbied in the United States, for example by distributing Nicaraguan postage stamps featuring belching volcanos to senators.  Through lobbying of businessmen, government officials, and the American public, Bunau-Varilla convinced the U.S. Congress to appropriate $40 million to the New Panama Canal Company, under the Spooner Act of 1902.  The funds were contingent on negotiating a treaty with Colombia to provide land for the canal in its territory of Panama.\n\nParagraph 7: Operation of the first subway began on October 27, 1904, with the opening of all stations from City Hall to 145th Street on the West Side Branch. The line was mostly underground, except for the section surrounding 125th Street, which ran across the elevated Manhattan Valley Viaduct to cross a deep valley there. Service was extended to 157th Street on November 12, 1904, as that station's opening had been delayed because of painting and plastering work. The West Side Branch was extended northward to a temporary terminus at 221st Street and Broadway on March 12, 1906 served by shuttle trains operating between 157th Street and 221st Street. However, only the Dyckman Street, 215th Street, and 221st Street stations opened on that date as the other stations were not yet completed. The 168th Street station opened on April 14, 1906. The 181st Street station opened on May 30, 1906, and on that date express trains on the Broadway branch began running through to 221st Street, eliminating the need to transfer at 157th Street to shuttles. The station at 207th Street was completed in 1906, but since it was located in a sparsely occupied area, it did not open until April 1, 1907. The original system as included in Contract 1 was completed on January 14, 1907, when trains started running across the Harlem Ship Canal on the Broadway Bridge to 225th Street, and the nearby 221st Street station was closed.\n\nParagraph 8: The episode takes its title from a scene when an anonymous informant (later revealed to be Kermit the Frog) secretly meets Brian in an underground parking lot. Brian calls the informant \"Deep Throat,\" in a reference to the anonymous informant Deep Throat. The meeting itself is a reference to the meeting with Deep Throat or to the 1976 film All the President's Men. The part-time job Peter had wherein he sings a song \"Ding Fries are Done,\" was based on a song that was popularized by Doctor Demento in the 1990s concerning Burger King, and is a parody of the popular Christmas song \"Carol of the Bells\". The Noid attempting to ruin Mayor West's pizza is a reference to the Noid from former Domino's Pizza television advertisements. The scene where Cleveland runs off as a black panther when he notices Meg and Brian looking at him as he destroys Brian's cab with a crowbar is a reference to Michael Jackson's \"Black or White\" second ending known as the Panther Dance. Stewie references his cousin, Stewie Cruise, showing him jumping up and down on Oprah's couch while shouting \"I'm in love with Katie Holmes! I'm not gay!\" When Lois mentions to Peter that it would be fun to be in the community talent show, Stewie says \"You know what else is fun? Watching Mr. Belvedere without people talking so loudly!\". He then proceeds to sing the theme song loudly. When Peter is being driven around by Brian, he refers to him as Bitterman, a reference to the chauffeur in the 1981 film Arthur. The song Mayor West and Meg are listening to in the hotel together is the theme song to Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles from the 1987 series. In the DVD version of the episode, Stewie and Brian bump into Scooby-Doo and the gang from Scooby-Doo, Where Are You?. Fred Jones and Stewie argue about who got to City Hall first, but then Stewie sends them off by humming a familiar tune.\n\nParagraph 9: Hanson argues precise human looks are a must if people are going to effectively communicate with robots. Hanson believes social humanoid robots have the potential to serve humanity in a variety of functions and helping roles, like tutor, companion, or security guard. He argues the realism of his work has the potential to pose \"an identity challenge to the human being,\" and that realistic robots may polarize the market between those who love realistic robots and those who find them disturbing. Many of Hanson's creations currently serve at research or non-profit institutions around the world, including at  the University of Cambridge, University of Geneva, University of Pisa and in laboratories for cognitive science and AI research.\n\nParagraph 10: The Second Boer War broke out in October 1899, and Pulteney served with the 1st Battalion of his regiment in South Africa from late 1899, attached to the Guards Brigade, with the brevet appointment as lieutenant-colonel from 11 November 1899. He was present at the battles of Belmont, Enslin and Modder River (November 1899), and the battle of Magersfontein (December 1899). The following year he was appointed second in command of his regiment in April, took part in the march to Bloemfontein and Pretoria, and the battles of Diamond Hill (June 1900), Belfast (August 1900) and the advance to Komatipoort in September. For his service in the war, he received the brevet promotion as colonel on 29 November 1900. He stayed with his regiment in South Africa until the war ended in May 1902, and left for the United Kingdom on the SS Briton two months later.\n\nParagraph 11: In 1896, half of the soldier barracks and a set of officers' quarters were demolished inside the fort. The parade ground was excavated and thousands of piles were steam driven, to support a foundation for a concrete three-gun battery as a way to modernize the defenses protecting ports along the Delaware River. Construction halted for a brief period before resuming in August 1897. This main battery was designed by Army engineer Lt. Col. Charles W. Raymond, assisted by Lt. Spencer Cosby. The new Endicott structure was a three-story reinforced concrete emplacement, which was built from 1894 to 1900 to support three 12-inch breech-loading rifled guns on disappearing carriages. These guns, mounted in 1900, had a range of approximately 10 miles. The three-gun battery, later named Battery Torbert after Maj. Gen. Alfred Torbert, is one of two three-story Endicott batteries in the United States, the other being Battery Potter, with unique gun-lift carriages, at Fort Hancock, New Jersey. The unusual height of Battery Torbert was due to being initially designed for gun-lift carriages. On top of the fort, flanking the 12-inch battery, were two smaller rapid-fire batteries, which protected the short-range sectors around the island and the mine field. These positions were later named Battery Allen and Battery Alburtis, and were armed with two 3-inch M1898 guns on retractable masking parapet mounts each. They were built in 1899 and accepted for service in 1901. Outside of the fort, engineers built additional rapid-fire batteries, which were later named Battery Dodd and Battery Hentig. Battery Dodd was added as an emergency measure after the outbreak of the Spanish–American War in 1898. It had two 4.7-inch 40 caliber guns purchased from the United Kingdom; at that point few of the Endicott batteries were complete and it was feared the Spanish fleet would bombard the US east coast. The battery was completed in 1899, after the war was over. Battery Hentig had two 3-inch M1903 guns and entered service in 1901.\n\nParagraph 12: At the Bayer plant he became the Works Council chairman. In 1921 he was expelled from the \"Fabrikarbeiterverband\" (trades union) in the context of a major strike at the plant,  and after speaking out in support of the political split within the union which took place shortly afterwards.   Schulte himself emerged as a leading figure within the radical left wing break-away group, becoming in 1922 full-time secretary of the new - Communist Party oriented - trades union that had resulted from the split.   During 1923 he spent three months in Berlin as a trainee in the party's trades unions department. Then, till 1925, he worked for the party local group in Leverkusen-Wiesdorf, first as an \"Organisationsleiter\" and then, in the more influential position of a \"Polleiter\" (loosely, \"policy leader\").   As \"Polleiter\" Schulte acquired a reputation as a particularly aggressive advocate of communist doctrine, acquiring among comrades in the region the soubriquet \"the Noske of the Lower Rhine\".      He was also a member of the Unterbezirksleitung (sub-district leadership team) for the party in the Solingen region.   Through the 1920s the Communist Party remained fractious, and it may have been in part a reflection of his early hesitancy about joining the party at its launch that Schulte was regarded as a representative of the party's right wing.   In 1923 he was reportedly talking about \"the idiot Thälmann\" which cannot have endeared him to his (sometime) political mentor the man who emerged after a few more years of splits and divisions as the party leader. In 1924 he was still reading the (illegal) pamphlets circulated by the party's \"Brandler faction\".   However, during 1924, possibly in response to a more general shift in mood within the party, he made his own decisive switch to the Communist Party's increasingly powerful left wing. Later that year he was accepted as a member of the \"Bezirksleitung Niederrehin\" party leadership team for the entire Lower Rhine region. Within the team, in July 1925 he became \"Secretary for Communal Policy\" and then \"Secretary for Agitation and Propaganda\", a role to which the Communist Party - taking its leader from the Communist Party of the Soviet Union - attached great importance.   Further appointments included that of \"Organisationsleiter\" in May 1926 and in 1927 of \"Polleiter\", again in respect of the entire Lower Rhine region. Schulte was for a short time replaced in the role by Lex Ende, apparently in order to that he might be made more available for national party functions.\n\nParagraph 13: Lucas Edward Neill (born 9 March 1978) is an Australian former soccer player. Neill played as a defender, often playing as a centre back as well as a full-back. Neill spent almost 15 years of his career playing in England. He represented Australia at the 2006 FIFA World Cup, the 2007 AFC Asian Cup, the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa, and also the 2011 AFC Asian Cup in Qatar. On 6 October 2006 he was named the 50th captain of the Australian national team, and by the time of his retirement, had amassed a record 61 caps as captain. He played for Millwall, Blackburn Rovers, West Ham United, Everton, Galatasaray, Al Jazira, Al Wasl, Sydney FC, Omiya Ardija, Watford FC and Doncaster Rovers.\n\nParagraph 14: During World War II, the military distributed small paperbacks to its forces, causing a large population of Americans to become accustomed to having access to cheap books and thus creating a demand for the same easy access to reading material when the soldiers returned home. As a result, in the years after the war, there appeared a new and often subversive trend in publishing that allowed for books to be written, cheaply produced, and widely distributed using technology previously unavailable. These books were dubbed \"pulp\" fiction because they were inexpensive and usually sensational or low-brow, much like the \"pulp\" magazines of the first half of the 20th century. Pulps were not necessarily \"low brow.\" Many pulp authors are now celebrated with commemorative hardcover editions.  These mass market paperbacks, printed and bound on cheap paper, often addressed \"dirty\" topics like drugs, gangs, white slavery, crime, murder, and homosexuality. Because the literature was not respected, it was not censored as readily, although most of the larger paperback publishers were wary of postal censorship, and, for instance, took care not to publish works that were overly supportive of \"deviant\" lifestyles. In terms of lesbian fiction, these books were the only ones available in many locations to people who had no previous access to information or stories that involved lesbian characters.", "answers": ["Paragraph 14"], "length": 3543, "dataset": "passage_retrieval_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "767e3cb26ec64fc48f521770469e909d47b6fdd515ad6a9a"}
{"input": "The text explains the origin of the name \"Ori\" in the television series Stargate, which comes from the word \"origin\". The executive producer, Robert C. Cooper, created the word \"Origin\" to represent the religion of the Ori. Cooper was interested in exploring the philosophical arguments surrounding religion and the challenge of proving the existence of God. Unlike the previous antagonists in the show, the Goa'uld, who were proven to be false gods through their technology, the Ori were ascended gods, making it difficult to disprove their existence. Although Cooper wanted to entertain viewers primarily, he saw the storyline as a reflection of real-life conflicts arising from differences in beliefs. He was particularly interested in exploring the mysterious nature of religious belief and the passion it invokes. The Ori were inserted into the show's background similarly to how real-life religions have little direct interaction with humanity.", "context": "Paragraph 1: After a relatively poor 2004, Aerts went into 2005 with an extra round unanimous decision (9.5-8, 10–8.5, 10–8) over American prospect Carter Williams in a superfight at the K-1 World Grand Prix 2005 in Seoul on March 19, 2005. Williams' aggressive style had Aerts backtracking for much of the fight, but he was still able to show his class and take victory in the deciding round. He picked up another win over Mighty Mo at the K-1 World Grand Prix 2005 in Osaka - Final Elimination on September 23, 2005, to ensure his place at the 2005 World Grand Prix. Mo showed signs of damage from Aerts' kicks towards the end of the first round, and Aerts was able to finish him with a low kick in round two. In the quarter-finals of the K-1 World Grand Prix 2005 in Tokyo Final on November 19, 2005, he faced Jérôme Le Banner for the fourth time. The fight started slowly, with both men showing respect for each other's power, but went on to be an exciting and close match. The judges scored it a draw after three rounds and it went into an extra round to decide the winner. All three judges agreed that Aerts was the winner (10-9, 10–9, 10–9). Injury would hinder him once again, however, and he was forced to pull out of the Grand Prix as he could not fight again that night. Having made his debut in mixed martial arts on July 6, 2005, when he knocked out former sumo wrestler Wakashoyo at Hero's 2, Aerts returned for his second and last MMA bout against judoka Shungo Oyama at K-1 PREMIUM 2005 Dynamite!! on December 31, 2005. Aerts was clearly unfamiliar with grappling and was submitted with a heel hook by Oyama as soon as the fight went to the ground at the 0:30 mark of round one.\n\nParagraph 2: In the spring of 1937, he took a trial trip, heading south from Moscow to Baku on the Caspian Sea.  The Intourist official tried to dissuade him, but he found a ship to take him to Lenkoran (Lankaran, Azerbaijan), where he witnessed the deportation of several hundred Turko-Tartar peasants to Central Asia. Stuck there for a few days, he bargained for horses with which to explore the countryside, and was arrested by the NKVD cavalry near to the Persian border.  He explained that he held diplomatic immunity, but his captors could not read his Soviet diplomatic pass. Eventually, as the only person literate in Russian, Maclean \"read out, with considerable expression, and such improvements as occurred to me\" the contents of his pass, and was set free. He took an 1856 paddle steamer back to Baku, and then a train on to Tiflis (Tbilisi, Georgia). British troops had supported the Democratic Republic after World War I, and Maclean sought out the British war cemetery, in the process discovering an English governess who had lived in the town since 1912.  He caught a truck through the Caucasus mountains, via Mtzkhet (Mtskheta), the former capital of Georgia but by then merely a village, to Vladikavkaz (capital of North Ossetia), and then a train to Moscow.\n\nParagraph 3: Half-Safe'''s Australian tour began in late October 1955 in Perth, where Carlin grew up, and included a tour of his old school, Guildford Grammar. The Carlins then went to Adelaide, and subsequently progressed to Melbourne, Sydney, and Brisbane. Half-Safe was returned to Calcutta on a steamship in January 1956; however, Elinore, Carlin's wife, left the trip in Australia, having tired of the long travel and the constant seasickness she was experiencing. Carlin continued his journey alone, with the first leg consisting of a sea voyage from Calcutta to Akyab, Burma, across the Bay of Bengal. At Akyab, he was joined by Barry Hanley, another Australian. The two met on Burma's coast in late February 1956, and from there crossed the Arakan Yoma mountain ranges to the Irrawaddy River, where the vehicle was bogged down in mud for two days. After extricating Half-Safe from the mire, the pair progressed to Rangoon, arriving on 11 March. From Burma, Half-Safe was driven overland to Bangkok, Thailand, and from there to Saigon, on the coast of Indochina. From there, Carlin and Hanley set out to sail from Indochina to Japan, passing through several ports and islands in the South China Sea. Upon his arrival in Hong Kong in early May 1956, Carlin was \"mobbed by autograph-seeking girls\", having been delayed on his voyage by engine trouble and headwinds in the South China Sea. He arrived in Kaohsiung, Taiwan, in early June, and from there travelled to Keelung on the northern tip of Taiwan, and Okinawa, part of the American-administered Ryukyu Islands. Carlin and Hanley drove ashore at Kagoshima Prefecture at the southern tip of Japan in July 1956, and from there drove overland to Tokyo. Hanley returned to Australia at this stage, while Carlin rested in Japan, again performing much-needed repairs. An American journalist for The Japan Times, Boyé Lafayette de Mente, offered to accompany Carlin on the journey from Japan to Alaska, departing in early 1957 for the first stage of the trip from Tokyo to Wakkanai, Hokkaidō. The pair left Tokyo on 1 May 1957 to great fanfare, cheered off from the Mainichi and Yomiuri Newspaper buildings. The craft sprang a leak while crossing the Tsugaru Strait, separating the southern island of Honshu from Hokkaidō, and collided with submerged rocks near the port of Muroran. They reached Wakkanai on 12 June 1957, despite what de Mente later described as Carlin's aggression and \"irascible character\" during the trip.\n\nParagraph 4: The network's current NFL contract includes the rights to the season-opening Thursday night NFL Kickoff Game, another game played on Thanksgiving Night, and three playoff games, two in the Super Wild Card round and one in the Divisional Playoffs. Under the initial 6-year deal, the network was also awarded the rights to two Super Bowl games, following the 2008 (Super Bowl XLIII) and 2011 (Super Bowl XLVI) seasons, and the Pro Bowl games in the years which NBC was slated to air the Super Bowl and two more Pro Bowls in 2013 and 2014. Beginning in 2012, through an extension to the contract that runs through 2022, NBC also gained the rights to air a primetime Thanksgiving game (which had previously been part of NFL Network's Thursday Night Football package), one divisional playoff game in lieu of a Wild Card game in the postseason, and the rights to Super Bowls held in 2015 (Super Bowl XLIX), 2018 (Super Bowl LII), and 2022 (Super Bowl LVI). However, the Pro Bowl is not excluded in the new contract as ESPN was set to gain exclusive rights to the game in 2015, with NBC's broadcast of the 2014 Pro Bowl being the final time the game would air on broadcast television prior to ABC's simulcast with ESPN on the 2018 edition. NBC regained rights to air two Super Wild Card games, beginning with the 2020–21 postseason. The Sunday Night game also aired on Telemundo, NBC's Spanish network, and was able to be streamed on NBCUniversal's streaming service Peacock. On March 18, 2021, a new television deal with the NFL was reached with CBS, Fox, NBC, and ESPN/ABC. The new deal allows NBC to retain its NFL rights with a continuation of Sunday Night Football, including the Kickoff Game and the annual Thanksgiving Night game, expanded streaming rights for Peacock, which includes an additional game for the first 6 seasons of the new deal. NBC also gained three more Super Bowls, which air in 2026 (for Super Bowl LX), 2030 (for Super Bowl LXIV), and 2034 (for Super Bowl LXVIII), all in Winter Olympic years. The new deal will run through 2033.\n\nParagraph 5: For the first 23 years of its existence, Dartmoor National Park was administered by a special committee of Devon County Council, the \"Dartmoor Sub-Committee\". During this time the major proposals dealt with by the committee included extensions of china clay workings and coniferous plantations (which did not take place); the erection of a television transmitting mast at North Hessary Tor in 1953 (passed by the casting vote of the chairman); and proposals to construct three reservoirs, of which the Avon Dam Reservoir (mid-1950s) and the Meldon Reservoir (1972) were built, but one planned for the Swincombe Valley was rejected by Parliamentary Committee in 1970, \"on the grounds of the technical unsuitability of the scheme, not because it was sited in a national park\".\n\nParagraph 6: Despite his lack of a fighting record, Hogan's local connections made him a particularly good election candidate in his home constituency of Galway. He was elected to Dáil Éireann at the 1921 general election. Hogan later supported the Anglo-Irish Treaty and was appointed to the subsequent government as the non-cabinet Minister for Agriculture in 1922. He held the same position in the provisional government, while also briefly serving as Minister for Labour, before retaining the agriculture portfolio in the 1st Executive Council of the Irish Free State. The new Cumann na nGaedheal government believed that a better performance in the agriculture sector would help the economy of the fledgling new state. Hogan adopted policies which aimed at improving the competitiveness of agricultural exports. The new Department of Agriculture set standards for production and presentation in eggs, meat and butter. It also extended the farm advisory service and tried to improve breeding stocks and crops. As Minister, Hogan also believed that land purchase was a desirable development. His Land Act, 1923 ordered the compulsory purchase of all land still held by landlords. This process took nearly fifteen years to complete, however, by 1937 all Irish farmers owned their farms. In 1927, Hogan established the Agricultural Credit Association to make loans available to farmers who wanted to improve their farms.\n\nParagraph 7: The decision on the future of the project lay with the Delaware River Basin Commission, the governing board of which included the governors of the four states in the Delaware River Basin (New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Delaware) and a federal representative who reported to the U. S. Secretary of the Interior. The project's momentum was slowed in the early 70s by objections voiced by New Jersey Governor William T. Cahill, who was concerned with land acquisition issues raised by local residents, by the potential adverse environmental impacts of the project, and by the costs that would be imposed on New Jersey to provide sewerage and highways to serve growth in Northwest New Jersey that would be prompted by the recreation area that would surround the dam. The recreation area was needed to provide the economic benefits needed to allow the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers, which would build the dam, to demonstrate that it had a positive ratio of benefits to cost. The further studies prompted by Cahill's objections and by question raised by his successor, Governor Brendan T. Byrne, in 1974 revealed that better and more economical options existed to reduce flood damage and improve water supply than the dam. The dam was disapproved by a majority vote of the Delaware River Basin Commission in 1975, led by New Jersey, New York and Delaware, dissented by Pennsylvania, and abstained by the United States.\n\nParagraph 8: In the first half of 2001, some of Marconi's major competitors such as Lucent Technologies and Alcatel had issued profit warnings, citing a large drop in orders from large telecoms groups. Marconi executives meanwhile reassured investors; the Financial Times judged they were \"either failing to see the warning signs, or ignoring them.\" However, in late June and early July it became evident that group sales had suffered a massive decline and by 3 July it was clear that a profits warning was inevitable.  This was complicated by the fact that Marconi was to announce the sale of its medical unit to Philips for $1.1 billion.  The company's shares would have to be suspended so that investors could not trade its shares without full information.  At 7.26am on Wednesday 4 July the Philips transaction was announced, and 15 minutes later Marconi announced the suspension of its shares. Following a contentious board meeting that evening, Marconi announced 4,000 job cuts, a 15% drop in sales forecasts, and a 50% fall in operating profit to March 2002. When trading resumed the following day, the share price dropped 54%. This valued the company at £2.8 billion, compared to £35.5 billion in September 2000. John Mayo, the deputy chief executive, was dismissed as a result.  A second profits warning in September 2001 led to the dismissal of Lord Simpson (the CEO) and Sir Roger Hurn (Chairman).\n\nParagraph 9: Rodgers led them in the 2013–14 season to a surprise title challenge, however Liverpool ended the league season in second place, despite scoring 101 goals, the club's most since the 1895–96 season and the third-highest in Premier League history. Rodgers was the first Liverpool manager to win the LMA Manager of The Year Award. However, he was the first manager of the club not to win a major trophy in his first three years at the helm, and on 4 October 2015, he was sacked. On 8 October, he was replaced by former Borussia Dortmund manager Jürgen Klopp. Klopp made an instant impact on the club and guided them to a League Cup Final and a surprise Europa League Final in his first season at the club. During their Europa League campaign, he beat both English rivals Manchester United and his former club Borussia Dortmund en route to the final. However, they lost the League Cup Final to Manchester City via penalty shoot-out and they lost 1–3 to Spanish side Sevilla in the Europa League Final. They also finished 8th in the league, meaning they wouldn't qualify for European competition for the 2016–17 season. On 8 June 2016, Klopp and his coaching staff signed six-year contract extensions that ran until 2022. Klopp guided the club to a fourth-place finish in the 2016–17 season, qualifying them for the 2017–18 UEFA Champions League qualifying play-offs, where they beat German club, TSG 1899 Hoffenheim 6–3 on aggregate in a two-legged play-off to reach the group stage. Klopp led to the team to finish top of their group and beat eventual English champions, Manchester City, and Italian club Roma in the knockout phase en route to the 2018 UEFA Champions League Final. Unfortunately for Liverpool, they lost 1–3 to Spanish giants Real Madrid. During the 2018–19 season, Klopp guided Liverpool to their sixth Champions League triumph with a 2–0 win over fellow English club, Tottenham Hotspur, and also guided the club to a second-place finish in the league. At the start of the 2019–20 season, Klopp's Liverpool side played against Manchester City in the FA Community Shield and against Chelsea in the UEFA Super Cup. Both matches went into penalty shoot-outs, with Liverpool losing the former and winning the latter. Later in December, Klopp also guided Liverpool to their first ever FIFA club World Cup trophy, making it 3 trophies in 2019. In the 2019–20 season, Klopp secured Liverpool's first Premier League title and first top flight title since 1990 by finishing on the most points in their history (99 points). The season was notable both for Liverpool's huge points lead over the rest of the league and for its interruption by the Coronavirus shutdown, meaning Liverpool won the Premier league at both the earliest (7 games to go) and the latest time (June) ever.\n\nParagraph 10: Born in Liverpool, he represented Everton at junior level before signing for Blackburn Rovers where he made his professional debut. He spent five seasons with the Lancashire club, playing for them in the Premier League, but was unable to hold a regular first team place. He was sold to Derby County in January 2007, became a regular starter for the team, but he struggled through injuries; In summer 2010 he was released. He subsequently spent two seasons each with Barnsley and Swindon Town before joining Sheffield United in 2014. During his career, McEveley also spent short spells on loan with a number of clubs; Burnley, Gillingham, Ipswich Town, Preston North End, Charlton Athletic and a brief spell at Swindon Town before his permanent switch.\n\nParagraph 11: Protestant Nonconformist worship has had a long and successful history in the area.  Many denominations founded chapels and meeting places between the 17th and 19th centuries, both in the towns and in rural areas; many survive and remain in use.  Baptist worship never gained such a hold as it did in East Sussex, but Horsham town became a hotbed of the Strict and Particular Baptist cause in the 19th century, when three such chapels were founded: Hope, Rehoboth and Jireh.  General Baptists became established in the 1660s under the leadership of radical evangelist Matthew Caffyn, the first leader of Horsham General Baptist Chapel (1721).  Members of the chapel founded a mission at Billingshurst in 1754; both causes moved towards Unitarianism in the 19th century, and both chapels are still used.  The later Brighton Road General Baptist Church also founded two offshoot chapels.  The Wesleyan and Primitive Methodist movements were also focused on Horsham.  Wesleyan worship at a chapel in the town's London Road dates from 1832.  Outreach work to surrounding villages led to the founding of chapels in Southwater (now demolished), Dragon's Green, Faygate, Mannings Heath and Partridge Green.  The United Reformed Church, into which the Congregational Church merged in 1972, has four congregations in the district; several other chapels fell out of use while still registered as Congregational, and one at Henfield became Evangelical.  The Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) had a presence in towns and villages across the district from the 17th century, despite repression.  William Penn lived at Warminghurst and preached there and at a former meeting house in Steyning, now called Penn's House; he was also linked to the curiously named Blue Idol, a Quaker place of worship since 1691.  Horsham's meeting house dates from 1834, but the community worshipped in houses or in the open air long before that.  Plymouth Brethren, meanwhile, maintain a strong presence in Horsham town.  Their cause was helped by the support of Charles Eversfield of Denne Park, who founded their first meeting house in 1863.  Three other meeting rooms survive in the town.  The Anglican church was strongly opposed to the denomination in the 19th century, seeing it as an \"irritant\" locally.  Other extant places of worship for Christian Scientists, The Salvation Army and Jehovah's Witnesses exist, and denominations such as Presbyterians, Mormons, Swedenborgians, Pentecostalists and the obscure, localised Society of Dependants  formerly worshipped in the district.  The last named sect, also known as Cokelers, established eight chapels in Sussex and Surrey in the 19th century, often with co-operative shops nearby.  Warnham's old chapel was used until the 1970s, as was the associated shop.\n\nParagraph 12: The name \"Ori\" comes from the word \"origin,\" as in the origin of the Ancients. When executive producer Robert C. Cooper looked at the root of \"origin,\" he retcon-invented the word \"Origin\" as the name of the Ori religion. Cooper said it was an interesting idea for him to address the philosophical arguments with various religious people, seeing the whole challenge as \"how do you prove whose God exists or whether God exists at all?\" Unlike the Goa'uld, who were quickly proven to not be gods after killing them and figuring out their technology, it would be hard to present the same argument to the Ori followers because the Ori were essentially ascended gods. Even if their gods were dead, it would not make much difference to them, as their followers would continue to believe; without the \"magic powers\" of the Ori, their followers and the Priors (the Ori's missionaries) could still use the technology and their ships. Cooper said that \"it's not necessarily wrong to believe in something [...] what's wrong is to murder somebody because they don't believe the way you do.\" Although Cooper was reluctant to get too serious about the meaning behind the Ori as Stargate should \"first and foremost [...] entertain people,\" he considered it representative of television and the media \"mak[ing] people believe whatever the people in charge of that magic box–whatever they want you to believe–they can pretty much convince you, or convince the vast majority of people.\" For Cooper, \"the followers of the Ori were the interesting part,\" and he \"wanted to do a story that was in some way reflective of the differences between people's beliefs that we see around us in our society, and how conflicts arise as a result of that.\" Cooper was particularly interested in the interaction between Ori followers and other normal human beings and the resulting \"mysterious aspect and quality to religious belief and the passion that it invokes.\" The producers therefore inserted the Ori into the story's background, similar to the way there was very little direct interaction between the actual deities of the religion and mankind in real life.", "answers": ["Paragraph 12"], "length": 3652, "dataset": "passage_retrieval_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "b03301855f97a3c45e36a4b9ea7bc6bbad82d1e7b8ea660c"}
{"input": "The text is a summary of Hachiya's diary, which covers the period from August 6, 1945, to September 30, 1945. Hachiya describes the effects of the atomic bomb blast on Hiroshima and his own experience as a survivor. He and his wife suffer serious burns and journey to the hospital where he works. Once he recovers, Hachiya resumes his duties as a doctor, witnessing the improvement of medical supplies and the condition of the hospital. The diary also mentions the term \"pikadon,\" used by the hospital staff and patients to describe the atomic bomb. Ultimately, Hachiya's experiences and observations are documented in his book, The Hiroshima Diary.", "context": "Paragraph 1: Sweden is frequently referred to as one of the world's most LGBT-tolerant and accepting countries, with various organisations and venues catering to LGBT people, supportive laws and policies, and high public and societal acceptance. Legislation concerning marriage, anti-discrimination and adoption have all been amended in the past decades to specifically apply to LGBT people and same-sex couples. In 2009, Sweden became the seventh country in the world to legalise same-sex marriage, after the Netherlands, Belgium, Spain, Canada, South Africa and Norway. The move was supported by parties across the political spectrum, as well as the Church of Sweden, the former state church (slightly less than two-thirds of Swedes are members). 2015 polling found that Swedes are the second-most supportive of same-sex marriage within the European Union at 90%, behind the Netherlands at 91%. This high societal tolerance has allowed Swedish LGBT people to come out, establish various associations, and \"enjoy the same rights and obligations as everybody else\". In March 2019, Sweden was named the world's best LGBT-friendly travel destination, along with Canada and Portugal. Neighbouring Norway, Denmark, Iceland and Finland were all ranked forth. Sweden also hosts several gay pride festivals every year. Stockholm Pride is the biggest and oldest such festival, and has been organized annually since 1998. The event is usually attended by half a million spectators, including about 40,000 who participate in the march itself. In later years, pride festivals have also been arranged in Gothenburg, Malmö and Uppsala, and local pride events are also hosted in smaller communities, including Lund, Örebro, Halmstad, Falun and others. In addition, Sápmi Pride is held in the far north, rotating between Norway, Finland and Sweden every year. It was first held in 2014 in Kiruna. Apart from pride festivities, these cities also host a range of gays clubs, bars, cafés and other venues.\n\nParagraph 2: A man of integrity with a prodigious work ethic and a keen business sense, within a few years Redpath was running his own sizeable construction business. He was involved in major projects such as the construction of the Lachine Canal and locks that proved key to future commercial development of the city of Montreal. Beginning in 1689, attempts were made by the French Colonial government and several others to build a canal that would allow ships to bypass the treacherous Lachine Rapids. After more than 130 years of failure, with funding from the recently formed Bank of Montreal, the consortium, of which Redpath was a major part, was successful in its construction and the new canal officially opened in 1825.\n\nParagraph 3: Mister 880 is a 1950 American light-hearted romantic drama film directed by Edmund Goulding and starring Burt Lancaster, Dorothy McGuire and Edmund Gwenn, about an amateurish counterfeiter who counterfeits only one dollar bills, and manages to elude the Secret Service for ten years. The film is based on the true story of Emerich Juettner, known by the alias Edward Mueller, an elderly man who counterfeited just enough money to survive, was careful where and when he spent his fake dollar bills, and was therefore able to elude authorities for ten years, despite the poor quality of his fakes, and despite growing interest in his case.\n\nParagraph 4: Hemingway went on safari to Africa in 1933 with his second wife Pauline and always intended to return. That visit inspired Hemingway's book Green Hills of Africa and his short story \"The Snows of Kilimanjaro\", well-known parts of the Hemingway canon. Two decades later in 1953, having finished writing The Old Man and the Sea, he planned a trip to Africa to visit his son Patrick who lived in Tanganyika. When Look magazine offered to send him to Africa, paying $15,000 for expenses, $10,000 for rights to a 3500 word piece about the trip, and Earl Theisen as official photographer to go with him, he quickly accepted.  Hemingway and Mary left Cuba in June, traveling first to Europe to make arrangements and leaving from Venice to Tanganyika a few months later. They arrived in August, and  Hemingway was thrilled to be deputized as an honorary ranger, writing in a letter, \"due to emergency (Mau Mau rebellion) been acting game ranger\".   Philip Percival, Hemingway's safari guide in 1933, joined the couple for the four-month expedition; they traveled from the banks of the Salengai, where Earl Theisen photographed Hemingway with a herd of elephants, to the Kimana Swamp, the Rift Valley and then on to visit Patrick in central Tanganyika. After visiting Patrick at his farm, they settled for two months on the north slopes of Mount Kilimanjaro. During this period Percival left their camp to return to his farm, leaving Hemingway as game warden with local scouts reporting to him. Hemingway was proud to be a game warden and believed a book would come of the experience.\n\nParagraph 5: Hachiya's diary cover the period from Aug. 6, 1945 to Sept. 30, 1945. He described the effects of the atomic bomb blast from its first flash in the early morning as he rested from his night shift as an air warden at the hospital. The force of the blast stripped all the clothes from his body but he and his wife survived, however they both received serious burns to their bodies and had to journey to the hospital Michihiko worked at. When Michihiko returned to the hospital that he worked in, the Hiroshima Communications Hospital, he spent the night in the care of the hospital staff who were not seriously injured. After his injuries healed, Michihiko started making his daily rounds that he would have normally made as a doctor. The staff and patients at the hospital call the atomic bomb that hit their city \"pikadon\". Pika describes a flash of light and don describes an explosive sound. As time passes an understanding of what hit their city clears up, and historical events such as the surrender of Japan are brought up. The condition of the hospital also drastically improves as more medical supplies are brought into the city, allowing them to better treat patients. After the bombing he wrote the book The Hiroshima Diary. This book describes what happened to him and what he saw.\n\nParagraph 6: White followed up a tremendous freshman season with a great sophomore season, in which he passed for 1,655 yards and 13 TDs and rushed for 1,219 yards and 18 touchdowns on his way to being named the Big East Offensive Player of the Year and was named to the first-team all-Big East squad. He was considered the leader of the team and his three best performances of the year came in the Gator Bowl, in the loss to Louisville when White continued to try to come back late in the game, and against Pittsburgh in the annual rivalry game, a 45–27 win, when he threw for 204 yards and two touchdowns, and ran for 220 yards and two touchdowns. His 200+ rushing and passing yards makes him one of only eight players in NCAA history to do so in a game. He was also caught on camera mocking the Pitt Panther growl by a national ESPN audience in that game. Pittsburgh linebacker H. B. Blades, who was an all-Big East selection that season, said, \"Pat White is the best quarterback in college football,\" after the loss. In the Gator Bowl against Georgia Tech, White battled ankle, neck, and wrist injuries and a 35–17 third-quarter deficit to bring the Mountaineers back to win 38–35 without the help of back Steve Slaton, who was out with injuries as well. White took the ball on 10 of the last 12 plays, gaining 54 yards and four first downs, to run out the clock for the Mountaineers. Georgia Tech linebacker Philip Wheeler said when asked the three players he liked to watch in college football, \"Three? Forget it. How about one? Pat White. Dude is unbelievable. I mean, he can do it all. He's fast, he stronger than he looks and he can throw it. Yeah, I love watching him -- as long as he's not doing it to us.\" Also against Syracuse, White rushed for a career-high 247 yards and scored four touchdowns.\n\nParagraph 7: From 1946 to 1958 Spanish Morocco, the Tarfaya Strip, Ifni, Rio de Oro and Saguia el Hamra were united as Spanish West Africa. Morocco gained independence from France in 1956, including Spanish Morocco (minus the plazas de soberanía which remain part of Spain today). The newly independent state, inspired by the idea of creating a 'Greater Morocco', claimed all of Spanish West Africa as Moroccan land. In 1958 Spain merged Rio de Oro and Saguia el-Hamara in 1958 as Spanish Sahara; that same year Spain ceded the Tarfaya Strip to Morocco (via the Treaty of Angra de Cintra). Ifni was ceded in 1969 (following a failed Moroccan attempt to capture the region by force in 1957). Morocco then turned its sights to Spanish Sahara, however Mauritania (independent since 1960) also contested the territory, claiming the former colony of Rio de Oro as part of 'Greater Mauritania'. A railway was built in 1960-63 which paralleled the southern half of the boundary, including an expensive tunnel through an escapement north-west of Choum constructed so as to order to avoid the right-angle of the south-eastern Spanish Sahara. Saharawi nationalists had meanwhile formed the Polisario, seeking independence for the whole of Spanish Sahara as Western Sahara, and began a low-level guerrilla campaign. An International Court of Justice ruling on the matter in October 1975 stated that neither the Moroccan nor Mauritanian claims to Western Sahara were strong enough to justify annexation, and that the Saharawi people should be allowed to determine their own future. Morocco thereafter sought to settle the matter military, and in November 1975 conducted the 'Green March', in which thousands of soldiers and Moroccan nationalists forcibly crossed the Morocco-Spanish Sahara border. Spain's dictator Francisco Franco was at this time near-death, and the country was unwilling to respond militarily at such a delicate time, keen to avoid the kind of drawn-out colonial war that had bedevilled Portugal in its African colonies. Spain therefore signed a treaty with Morocco and Mauritania, splitting Spanish Sahara roughly in two, roughly two-thirds in Morocco's favour. By this treaty only the northern third of the traditional Mauritania–Western Sahara border remained extant. Polisario forces declared a Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic based on the boundaries of Spanish Sahara, thus starting a long war against Morocco and Mauritania. Unwilling to continue the conflict, Mauritania pulled out of their zone in 1979, which was then annexed by Morocco, thereby reinstating the former Mauritania-Western Sahara frontier.\n\nParagraph 8: The medal is decagonal (ten-sided, representing the ten provinces), 36 millimetres across the flats, with raised busts. The King George VI medal is .800 fine silver and gilded. The Queen Elizabeth II medal is tombac (a copper-zinc alloy). A gilded copper version was introduced in 2008. The King George VI medal has the uncrowned coinage head of King George VI, facing left, with the inscription  around the edge. The Queen Elizabeth II medal has the uncrowned coinage head of Queen Elizabeth II, facing right, with the inscription around the edge  with the word Canada at the bottom. The reverse of the medal has a naval crown, three maple leaves and an eagle representing the navy, army and air force from top to bottom. The word service is on a scroll at the base and a fleur-de-lis is on each side of the crown. The royal cypher is superimposed on the centre of the King George VI medal, but is omitted from the Queen Elizabeth II medal. The King George VI medal has the name and rank of the person to whom the medal was awarded engraved on the reverse of the solid bar while the Queen Elizabeth II medal has the name and rank engraved around the edge of the medal. Early Queen Elizabeth II medals had the letters stamped rather than engraved.\n\nParagraph 9: All American Racers is an American-licensed auto racing team and constructor based in Santa Ana, California. Founded by Dan Gurney and Carroll Shelby in 1964, All American Racers initially participated in American sports car and Champ Car races as well as international Formula One events with cars named Eagle.  The Formula One team, based in the United Kingdom and using British-built Weslake engines was named Anglo American Racers.  Under team manager Bill Dunne they set up shop in Rye, East Sussex. The team were adjacent to Harry Weslake's engine development plant and half a mile from Elva cars. They participated in 25 Grands Prix, entering a total of 34 cars.\n\nParagraph 10: \"I Miss You\" was recorded throughout 2003, and began production at the Rubin's House, a rented home in the San Diego luxury community of Rancho Santa Fe. The song was written using the same method with which the band wrote \"Feeling This\"; namely, DeLonge and Hoppus would discuss themes and then set off to separate rooms of the home to write alone. The two would first have a discussion about the themes of the song \"so that we were on the same page,\" and then they would go away to write, putting both parts together at the end. Tom wrote the second verse, and Mark wrote the first verse and the chorus.  In 2018, Mark shared the original handwritten lyrics on Twitter. \"Mark was always really, really good with words, so a lot of times I would ask him for help with things, to get help with how I say things better [...] But we never really explained song meanings to each other,\" said DeLonge. Hoppus referenced Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas at the request of Barker, with the lines \"We can live like Jack and Sally if we want... and we'll have Halloween on Christmas\",  toward his then-wife, Shanna Moakler.\n\nParagraph 11: The Sound of Music is one of the most commercially successful films of all time. Four weeks after its theatrical release, it became the number one box office movie in the United States, from revenue generated by twenty-five theaters, each screening only ten roadshow performances per week. It held the number one position for thirty of the next forty-three weeks, and ended up the highest-grossing film of 1965. One contributing factor in the film's early commercial success was the repeat business of many filmgoers. In some cities in the United States, the number of tickets sold exceeded the total population. By January 1966, the film had earned $20 million in distributor rentals from just 140 roadshow engagements in the United States and Canada. Worldwide, The Sound of Music broke previous box-office records in twenty-nine countries, including the United Kingdom, where it played for a record-breaking three years at the Dominion Theatre in London and earned £4 million in rentals and grossed £6 million—more than twice as much as any other film had taken in. It was also a major success in the Netherlands, Hong Kong, and Tokyo, where it played for as long as two years at some theaters. It was not a universal success, however, with the film only enjoying modest success in France and it was a flop in Germany. It also initially performed poorly in Italy, but a re-release after the Oscars brought better results. It was number one at the US box office for a further 11 weeks in 1966, for a total of 41 weeks at number one. By November 1966, The Sound of Music had become the highest-grossing film of all time, with over  in worldwide rentals ( in gross receipts), surpassing Gone with the Wind, which held that distinction for twenty-four years. It was still in the top ten at the US box office in its 100th week of release.\n\nParagraph 12: The name Lom Palanka was mentioned for the first time in 1704. The settlement then called Palanka stood between village and town in size and importance. In 1798 Lom suffered from brigand raids. With the development of shipping along the Danube after 1830, the importance of the town grew. The road to Sofia contributed to its progress and turned it into a main export port to Vienna (Austria). By 1869 there were 120 shops, 148 trade offices, 175 food shops, 34 coffee bars, six hotels and two mills. The town was centred on the old Kale (fortress), which was entered through three kapii (gates) — Vidinska, Belogradchishka, Sofiyska. The tradesmen from Lom offered goods at the biggest fairs in the region and beyond. In 1880 there were 7,500 inhabitants in the town.\n\nParagraph 13: \"Sir, we are met here this day, by a former appointment of Presbytery, in obedience to the same sentence of the General Assembly, to admit you minister of St. Ninians- a sentence pronounced by the highest horn of ecclesiastical authority or power. That Assembly have assumed to themselves higher power than the Parliament-by some profanely styled omnipotent-that wise, that august body, never enacting any laws without consent of the people. There has been a formidable opposition made against you by six hundred heads of families, sixty heritors, and all the elders of the parish, I believe, except one. This opposition has continued for seven years by your own obstinacy, and if you should this day be admitted, you can have no pastoral relation to the souls of the parish; you will never be regarded as the shepherd to go before the sheep-they know you not, and they will never follow you; and, let me assure you, dear sir, if you persist in your obstinacy, you will do more harm in this parish than you could have done good in Gargunnock though you had been to live there for a hundred years; and you will draw misery and contempt upon yourself-you will be despised-you will be hated-you will be insulted and maltreated. One of the most eloquent and learned ministers of this Church told me lately that he would go twenty miles to see you deposed; and I do assure you, sir, that I, and twenty thousand more friends to our Church, would do the same. You maintained a good character and reputation till your unhappy And obstinate adherence to this presentation. Now, bending under the weight of years and infirmities of old age, what happiness can you propose to yourself in this mad, this desperate attempt of yours, without the concurrence of the people, and without the least prospect of usefulness in the parish. Your admission into it, therefore, can only be regarded as a sinecure, and you yourself as Stipend-Lifter of St. Ninians. Now, sir, I conjure you, by the mercies of God, give up this presentation. I conjure you, for the sake of the great number of souls in St. Ninians, and by that peace of mind which you would wish in a dying hour, and that awful and impartial account which in a little you must give to God of your own soul, and of the souls of this parish, at the tribunal of our Lord Jesus Christ, give it up.\"", "answers": ["Paragraph 5"], "length": 3288, "dataset": "passage_retrieval_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "ea5586b6e23b0aa0e9fe7b18cfb767310a0f674b8cc50728"}
{"input": "The text revolves around Diane finding out about an affair between her fiancé Tony and Sinead. Diane initially forgives Tony and puts their wedding back on, but after discovering Sinead is pregnant, invites the potential father, Daryl, to the wedding. However, Diane later realizes that Tony and Sinead are still involved and publicly confronts them. She then seeks support from Lockie and ends up having sex with him. Diane later regrets her actions and apologizes to Lockie. In a confrontation with Lockie's wife, Diane falls out of a window and is hospitalized.

She momentarily flatlines but is resuscitated and recovers from a heart attack.", "context": "Paragraph 1: In Ituiutaba reportedly some Congadeiros, the festivities took place on farms outside the city where they also raised their suits. With the becoming of time, the festival has become known, was brought to the city. However, the parish priest of the time did not accept that Congadeiros walk into the church, prohibiting the holding of the festival site. This ban was because the Congadeiros, did not follow the Catholic religion, but others of African origin. Meanwhile, around Ituiutaba, to honor his wife Geralda Ramos da Silva on his birthday on April 2, 1951, Mr. Demetrio Silva da Costa (Cyzicus) invited his father Marciano Silvestre da Costa, his brother Gerard Clarimundo Coast and several other friends to play Mozambique and commemorate the date. Upon learning of the incident, Ana Carolina Ribeiro (Dona Rosa), cousin of Cyzicus, invited the group to work together to bring the suit in Mozambique Ituiutaba and rekindle the devotion to St. Benedict with much dancing, partying and devotion. So they went to the parish priest of the time, Father John Ave, to communicate it and ask him to leave, next to the church, making the feast of St. Benedict and Our Lady of the Rosary. The pastor, not allowed, claiming that the Church had problems previously with the suits Congado that formerly existed in Ituiutaba, and that because of these clashes, had already fragmentado. In 1952, the newly created suit, decided to rehearse in order placing the group properly uniformed street in protest against the attitude of the priest. They walked down the street 22 at 5 am. They made a dawn with fireworks in front of the Forum site getting the consent of justice to conduct the celebrations in the city. They went to St. Joseph Church, where he entered the enclosure and attended the morning mass. After the Congadeiros went visiting various residences singing, dancing saints protectors streets. In the following years the party happened without the existence of a fellowship or church support. Still, Congadeiros insisted on having the recognition of the celebration by the church, performing each year the festivities in honor of St. Benedict and Our Lady of the Rosary, with the support of the devotees and supporters. Years later, restructures itself in the Congado Ituiutaba.\n\nParagraph 2: The peninsula was glaciated during the quaternary period; evidence from this era survives in the form of striae around Hungry hill, and erratics on the western road into Glengarriff. The first signs of human activity date to c 3000 BC, and consist of traces of Early Bronze Age settlements. The landscape is rich in megalithic monuments and other prehistoric archeological sites, including over 70 standing stones, 22 stone rows, 38 dolmens, as well as wedge tombs, stone circles. Later the area became a Viking settlement, as evident in place names such as Longhart. Levels of Early Medieval activity can be deduced from the presence of many ringforts, cashels, cairns and fulacht fiadh.\n\nParagraph 3: The thematic genesis for Cobra Kai began with a few works of pop culture. First, the 2007 music video for the song \"Sweep the Leg\" by No More Kings stars William Zabka (who also directed the video) as a caricature of himself as Johnny, and features references to The Karate Kid, including cameo appearances by Zabka's former Karate Kid co-stars. In a 2010 interview, Zabka jokingly discussed this video in the context of his vision that Johnny was the true hero of the film. Next in June 2010, Macchio appeared in Funny or Die's online short, \"Wax On, F*ck Off\", in which his loved ones stage an intervention to turn the former child star from a well-adjusted family man into an addict besieged with tabloid scandal in order to help his career (with frequent references to The Karate Kid. A recurring joke in the sketch is that Macchio is confused for an adolescent. The short was lauded by TV Guide'''s Bruce Fretts, who referred to the video as \"sidesplitting\" and \"comic gold\". Finally, in 2013, Macchio and Zabka made guest appearances as themselves in the television sitcom How I Met Your Mother (\"The Bro Mitzvah\"). In the episode, Macchio is invited to Barney Stinson's bachelor party, leading to Barney shouting that he hates Macchio and that Johnny was the real hero of The Karate Kid. Towards the end of the episode, a clown in the party wipes off his makeup and reveals himself as Zabka. This influenced the launch of Cobra Kai, which gives a balanced perspective for Johnny, Daniel, and other characters. Zabka continued to be a recurring character throughout the ninth season of the show.\n\nParagraph 4: George Lippard's most notorious story, The Quaker City, or The Monks of Monk Hall (1845) is a lurid and thickly plotted exposé of city life in antebellum Philadelphia. Highly anti-capitalistic in its message, Lippard aimed to expose the hypocrisy of the Philadelphia elite, as well as the darker underside of American capitalism and urbanization. Lippard's Philadelphia is populated with parsimonious bankers, foppish drunkards, adulterers, sadistic murderers, reverend rakes, and confidence men, all of whom the author depicts as potential threats to the Republic. Considered the first muckraking novel, it was the best-selling novel in America before Uncle Tom's Cabin. When it appeared in print in 1845, it sold 60,000 copies in its first year and at least 10,000 copies throughout the next decade.<ref>Reynolds, David. Introduction to The Quaker City; or The Monks of Monk Hall,\" Amerhest, MA, The University of Massachusetts Press, 1970: vii.</ref> Its success made Lippard one of the highest-paid American writers of the 1840s, earning $3,000 to $4,000 a year.The Quaker City is partly based on the March 1843 New Jersey trial of Singleton Mercer. Mercer was accused of the murder of Mahlon Hutchinson Heberton aboard the Philadelphia-Camden ferry vessel John Finch on February 10, 1843. Heberton had seduced (or raped - sources differ upon this point), Mercer's sixteen-year-old sister. Mercer entered a plea of insanity and was found not guilty. The trial took place only two months after Edgar Allan Poe's short story \"The Tell-Tale Heart,\" a story based on other murder trials employing the insanity defense; Mercer's defense attorney openly acknowledged the \"object of ridicule\" which an insanity defense had become. Nonetheless, a verdict of not-guilty was rendered after less than an hour of jury deliberation, and the family and the lawyer of young Mercer were greeted by a cheering crowd while disembarking from the same Philadelphia-Camden ferry line on which the killing took place.  Lippard employed the seduction aspect of the trial as a metaphor for the oppression of the helpless. The Monks of Monk Hall outraged some  readers with its lingering descriptions of \"heaving bosoms\" but such descriptions also drew readers and he sold many books. A stage version was prepared but banned in Philadelphia for fear of riots. Though many were offended by the story's lurid elements, the book also prompted social and legal reform and may have led to New York's 1849 enactment of an anti-seduction law.\n\nParagraph 5: When Diane nearly catches Sinead and Tony kissing, Sinead suggests to Tony they go away for a weekend. Tony lies to Diane and tells her he's going to a food conference and goes to a hotel with Sinead. Diane is worried when the flat alarm goes off and Tony is away and not available to fix it, and the alarm persists in annoying the whole village. Trevor suggests Diane look at Tony's credit card details to find out where he is staying and she tracks him down to a hotel. However, Tony is there and promises to come home, leaving Sinead behind. Diane shows up to question the hotel on who Tony was staying with, however the receptionist refuses to give any information other than Tony was with another woman. Tony is forced to admit that he is having an affair and Sinead says she went to the hotel to confront him about it. Diane is devastated, but forgives Tony and puts their wedding back on. On her hen night, Diane discovers Sinead is pregnant and confronts her about the father. Sinead informs her that it was her fling, Daryl (Rhys Howells) who fathered her child, so Diane invites him to her wedding to Tony. However, when Diane learns from Daryl that he and Sinead never slept together, she realises that Tony and Sinead are having an affair when she spots them looking at each other in the church. Diane publicly embarrasses them both and changes the locks on the flat and The Hutch, seeking support from Lockie Campbell (Nick Rhys). Diane refuses to forgive Sinead when Sinead tells her the affair was in revenge for Diane not believing her about baby Katy's death, but later rushes to apologise to Sinead afterwards. She finds Sinead and Tony in an embrace and so storms off and has sex with Lockie. Diane soon regrets what she has done and apologises to Lockie. After her affair, Lockie's wife Porsche McQueen (Twinnie Lee Moore) discovers that she had slept with Lockie whilst decorating Diane's room. The pair fight and Diane slips on wallpaper and falls out of the window. Diane regains consciousness in the hospital and Dr. Charles S'avage (Andrew Greenough) informs her that she has broken her ribs. Tegan Lomax (Jessica Ellis) injects her with morphine to take away the pain and she tells her that she had seen Tegan on a video informing Dee Dee that she is her real mother. During the night, the Gloved Hand Killer (who is Lindsey Butterfield) gains entry to Diane's ward and injects her with potassium chloride, the same chemical the assailant used to kill Rick Spencer (Victor Gardener) and Will Savage (James Atherton). Diane's heart monitor drops to 0 and the unknown assailant leaves the ward and leaves Diane for dead. Diane is rushed into resuscitation and soon makes a full recovery, after suffering a heart attack from the potassium chloride.\n\nParagraph 6: He came back to Australia in 2000 and played wherever he could, adopting his middle name 'Charlton' Hill as his artist name. After multiple label deal offers, he was signed to Sony Music's Murmur record label by Head of A&R at the time John O'Donnell, whose indie roster included Lo-Tel, Something for Kate and Silverchair. Under the guidance of his U.K. manager John Wadlow (Seal), Hill continued writing and recording between the U.K. and U.S., including with members of Lenny Kravtiz's and Dave Matthews' bands, whilst still hunting for the right producer. He also spent a brief period living and writing with Adamski in Bologna, Italy. Hill ultimately returned to London to record his debut album Waterline with producer Ian Grimble (David Gray, Travis, Morcheeba) at studio 2kHz in Willesden on the 1960s EMI TG12345 Mk 2 console originally built as a mobile unit for John Lennon. Along with Ap Gwynedd, Hill enlisted an a-list ensemble of musicians including bassist brother Rheinallt ap Gwynedd, drummer Chuck Sabo, Sade percussionist Martin Ditcham and Brian Eno's programmer/technologist James Sanger. '2's Company' was written just prior to the album sessions and was Hill's first single, released in Australia on 14 June 2002. Hill toured extensively on the back of the album most notably with John Mayer, Bic Runga and The Whitlams.  His debut album Waterline, produced three hits: '2's Company', 'Deep' and 'Don't Sail'. Hill travelled to Iceland to film a music clip for '2's Company' with director Richard Gibson and the song stayed at No.1 on the Australian Indy chart for eight weeks. There is also a version of the song translated into Mandarin and released by Taiwanese artist Nicholas Tse on his 2004 album 'Listen Up'. The music clip for 'Deep' was filmed in Byron Bay with director George Muskens and includes footage from legendary surfing cinematographer Jack McCoy. Hill personally directed the clip for 'Don't Sail'.\n\nParagraph 7: Holmes explains how he reached his conclusion. Amberley's alibi fell apart when Holmes discovered that his seat at the Haymarket Theatre had not been occupied on the night in question, its number deduced from the ticket that Watson had seen. Also, the painting was a clue. Holmes realised that it was being done to mask a smell, and he soon discovered what that was: gas.  He found a gas pipe leading into the strongroom with a tap outside. Amberley had lured his wife and her lover—for so he had believed Dr. Ernest to be—into the strongroom, locked them in, and turned the gas on, killing them out of jealousy. He had simply hidden the \"stolen\" valuables somewhere. In indelible pencil, one of the victims wrote \"We we…\", perhaps meaning to write \"We were murdered.\"\n\nParagraph 8:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n\nParagraph 9: The variant that is spoken in Trinidad and Tobago is known as Trinidadian Hindustani, Trinidadian Bhojpuri, Trinidadian Hindi, Indian, Plantation Hindustani, or Gaon ke Bolee (Village Speech). A majority of the early Indian indentured  immigrants spoke the Bhojpuri and Awadhi dialects, which later formed into Trinidadian Hindustani. In 1935, Indian movies began showing to audiences in Trinidad. Most of the Indian movies were in the Standard Hindustani (Hindi-Urdu) dialect and this modified Trinidadian Hindustani slightly by adding Standard Hindi and Urdu phrases and vocabulary to Trinidadian Hindustani. Indian movies also revitalized Hindustani among Indo-Trinidadian and Tobagonians. The British colonial government and estate owners had disdain and contempt for Hindustani and Indian languages in Trinidad. Due to this, many Indians saw it as a broken language keeping them in poverty and bound to the cane fields, and did not pass it on as a first language, but rather as a heritage language, as they favored English as a way out. Around the mid to late 1960s the lingua franca of Indo-Trinidadian and Tobagonians switched from Trinidadian Hindustani to a sort of Hindinized version of English. Today Hindustani survives on through Indo-Trinidadian and Tobagonian musical forms such as, Bhajan, Indian classical music, Indian folk music, Filmi, Pichakaree, Chutney, Chutney soca, and Chutney parang. As of 2003, there are about 15,633 Indo-Trinidadian and Tobagonians who speak Trinidadian Hindustani and as of 2011, there are about 10,000 who speak Standard Hindi. Many Indo-Trinidadians and Tobagonians today speak a type of Hinglish that consists of Trinidadian and Tobagonian English that is heavily laced with Trinidadian Hindustani vocabulary and phrases and many Indo-Trinidadians and Tobagonians can recite phrases or prayers in Hindustani today. There are many places in Trinidad and Tobago that have names of Hindustani origin. Some phrases and vocabulary have even made their way into the mainstream English and English Creole dialect of the country. World Hindi Day is celebrated each year on 10 January with events organized by the National Council of Indian Culture, Hindi Nidhi Foundation, Indian High Commission, Mahatma Gandhi Institute for Cultural Co-operation, and the Sanatan Dharma Maha Sabha.\n\nParagraph 10: Modern art historian Sergey Zagraevsky surveyed hundreds of Russian icons and miniatures, from the eleventh century onward. He concluded that most icons painted after the Mongol invasion of Rus display only onion domes. The first onion domes appeared on some pictures from the twelfth century. He found only one icon from the late fifteenth century displaying a dome resembling the helmet instead of an onion. His findings led him to dismiss fragments of helmet domes discovered by restorators beneath modern onion domes as post-Petrine stylisations intended to reproduce the familiar forms of Byzantine cupolas. Zagraevsky also indicated that the oldest depictions of the two Vladimir cathedrals represent them as having onion domes, prior to their replacement by classicizing helmet domes. He explains the ubiquitous appearance of onion domes in the late thirteenth century by the general emphasis on verticality characteristic of Russian church architecture from the late twelfth to early fifteenth centuries. At that time, porches, pilasters, vaults and drums were arranged to create a vertical thrust, to make the church seem taller than it was. Another consideration proposed by Zagraevsky links the onion-shaped form of Russian domes with the weight of traditional Russian crosses, which are much larger and more elaborate than those used in Byzantium and Kievan Rus. Such ponderous crosses would have been easily toppled, if they had not been fixed to sizeable stones traditionally placed inside the elongated domes of Russian churches. It is impossible to place such a stone inside the flat dome of the Byzantine type.\n\nParagraph 11: As early as 1989, city officials in Allentown had announced plans to revitalize brownfield land along the Lehigh River, which included the abandoned Arbogast & Bastian plant.  This redevelopment, which was to be known as \"Lehigh Landing,\" was originally to include a museum, a brewery, walking trails, a footbridge across the river, and a promenade for festivals.  Allentown businessman Raymond E. Holland, former president of Holiday Hair Fashions, had purchased the abandoned Arbogast & Bastian plant for $250,000 in 1985 and gave it to the Allentown Economic Development Corp. as a charitable contribution in 1990.  Development of \"Lehigh Landing\" was hindered by fundraising problems, environmental remediation issues, and even a national debate on pork barrel government spending.  The iconic Arbogast & Bastian plant remained vacant for over a decade, often the victim of vandalism and suspicious fires.  The plant was finally dismantled in late 1990s, and the company's large heart-shaped sign, long a fixture of the Allentown skyline, was taken down on June 30, 1998. The offices of Arbogast & Bastian, had not been torn down and were later incorporated into the America On Wheels museum, which was opened on the site of the former Arbogast & Bastian plant in 2008  and RB Collection-Ruozzi Brothers Collection / Palazzo Reale, occupying the redeveloped storage building.\n\nParagraph 12: Moments before being crowned as the new emperor, La Gour's secret was finally publicly divulged by his jealous and ambitious bastard cousin, Zu Zambajil. He was branded a traitor, stripped of his title, separated from his pregnant wife and then imprisoned. Lozaria later dies during childbirth while the helpless La Gour could only weep in mourning behind bars. With the aid of the rebels he was able to escape from prison. La Gour then led a rebellion against the empire, but his ragtag troops of former slaves were simply no match against the superior might of the Boazanian military. Even though La Gour was adamant to fight alongside the rebels until the bitter end, his desperate comrades urged the former to live on; they sacrificed themselves in order for La Gour to board their last remaining space saucer which the latter then used to reach planet Earth. Wounded and unconscious in a foreign world, La Gour was found near his ship's wreckage by a local woman, a scientist named Mitsuyo Goh, whom he later marries. Fearing Zu Zambajil's inter-planetary conquest ambitions, La Gour (who now goes by the name Professor Kentaro Goh) collaborated with his wife, as well as premier Earth scientist Professor Hamaguchi and Earth International Defense Force commander General Oka to design and construct Voltes V, his greatest creation and the ultimate defense against a potential Boazanian invasion. After the birth of their third and youngest son, Hiyoshi, Professor Kentaro Goh tearfully left his newfound world and family; he returned to Boazania as a diplomat in a peaceful effort to abate the cruelty and tyranny of the now current reigning emperor, Zu Zambajil. Instead of listening to Professor Goh's appeal of non-violence towards other planets, the ruthless monarch offered his long lost cousin the lofty designation of being lead designer to Boazania's inter-planetary war machine. Disgusted by how vile and despotic Zu Zambajil had become, Professor Goh vehemently refused the Boazanian emperor's proposition and was therefore incarcerated.", "answers": ["Paragraph 5"], "length": 3396, "dataset": "passage_retrieval_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "cc2d03e9e525a33463fd9bf7412d2155b02e14ac87261d1a"}

The militia, ordered to hold fire until after the enemy's first volley, took aim and successfully killed and wounded several warriors.

He played his first match of the 2017-18 Indian Super League season on 19 November 2017 in a 2–0 loss against his former team and one of the two new entries, Bengaluru. Mumbai won their first match of the season with Amrinder in goal on 25 November against FC Goa, which ended 2–1 to Mumbai. Amrinder kept his first clean sheet of the season on 10 December against Chennaiyin, which ended 1–0 to Mumbai.

Amrinder kept 10 clean sheets and made 61 saves in 2020–21 season.\n\nParagraph 3: Hegemon of Thasos () was a Greek writer of the Old Comedy. Hardly anything is known of him, except that he flourished during the Peloponnesian War. According to Aristotle (Poetics, ii. 5) he was the inventor of a kind of parody; by slightly altering the wording in well-known poems he transformed the sublime into the ridiculous. When the news of the disastrous defeat of the Sicilian Expedition reached Athens, his parody of the Gigantomachia was being performed: it is said that the audience were so amused by it that, instead of leaving to show their grief, they remained in their seats. He was also the author of a comedy called Philinne (Philine), written in the manner of Eupolis and Cratinus, in which he attacked a well-known courtesan. Athenaeus (p. 698), who preserves some parodic hexameters of his, relates other anecdotes concerning him (pp. 5, 108, 407).\n\nParagraph 4: Lance Nayek Nur Mohammad was selected as the captain of the Standing Patrol team at Goalhati in Jessore's Chutipur Camp that was established to monitor the Pakistan army. On 5 September, Nur Mohammad was patrolling with 4 fellow soldiers. The Pakistan army attacked them from three different sides. Nur Mohammad tried to retreat to his base while still engaging the Pakistani troops. Meanwhile, one of his fellow soldiers, Nannu Mia, was injured after a bullet hit him. Nur Mohammad tried to carry Nannu Mia towards safety while trying to fire his gun from different places as a trick to confuse the Pakistani troops into believing that there were more than four Bangladeshi rebels. In doing so, Nur Mohammad himself was hit by a mortar and his foot was destroyed. Even though he was seriously injured, Nur Mohammad decided to continue to provide cover fire for his team to escape. At the time, his fellow Sepoy Mostafa urged Nur Mohammad to go with him. Mostafa even tried to force Nur Mohammad to go but Nur Mohammad refused to go and gave his light machine gun to Mostafa so that it would not be captured after his death. He kept a self loaded rifle with him and kept on fighting until he died.\n\nParagraph 5: He took a warm interest in everything connected with the social condition of the people, and, whether he was its founder or not, zealously promoted the establishment of a friendly society at Southwell. In 1824 he published The Constitution of Friendly Societies upon Legal and Scientific Principles exemplified by the Rules and Tables of Calculations adopted ... for the Government of the Friendly Institute at Southwell (3rd edition, 1826); followed in 1825 by Tables showing the single and monthly contributions to be paid, the allowances to be granted, and the method of calculating, at every period of life, the value of assurances effected by members of Friendly Societies, together with a system of Bookkeeping recommended for the use of such institutions. In 1826 appeared his Observations upon the Report from the Select Committee of the House of Commons on the Laws respecting Friendly Societies, exemplifying and vindicating the principles of Life Assurance adopted in calculating the Southwell Tables, together with the heads of a Bill for improving the constitution and management of such institutions. The vindication was of Becher's contention that sick allowances could be calculated on a scientific basis, and that the Northampton tables of mortality afforded the best data for life assurance and cognate calculations, both of which positions had been contested before the committee by Mr. Finlaison, the actuary of the national debt. In 1828 Becher published The Anti-Pauper System, exemplifying the positive and practical good realised by the relievers and the relieved under the frugal, beneficent, and careful administration of the poor laws prevailing at Southwell and in the neighbouring district…. The erection of a workhouse at Southwell, the substitution of indoor for outdoor relief, and the making the former as repulsive as possible to able-bodied paupers, had caused considerable reduction in the rates at Southwell, and the system in operation there had been copied with similar results in various parishes throughout the country. The select committee of the House of Commons on agriculture in its report pointed attention to the value of Becher's system, which was also favourably mentioned by the Quarterly Review. In 1834, during the official investigation which resulted in the new poor law, Becher issued a second edition of this work, with a new introduction. In 1837, he apparently converted, on at least one point, Finlaison, his former antagonist, and there appeared Rules of the Northampton Equitable Friendly Institution, and tables calculated from actual returns of sickness, old age, and death, by the Rev. J. T. Becher, M.A., and J. Finlaison, Esquire, Actuary of the National Debt.\n\nParagraph 6: The main concern raised in Microsoft v Commission was whether two distinct products were a subject of a tie. Tying is a specific type of exclusionary abuse which refers to the situation where customers that purchase one product (the tying product) are also required to purchase another product from the dominant undertaking (the tied product). This is intended to provide the customers with better products in the most cost-effective ways. However, an undertaking which is dominant in one product market can harm consumer benefit through tying by foreclosing the market for other products. The commission's findings showed that Microsoft had tied its Windows Media Player to its personal computer operating system. There was serious evidence to point out that Microsoft advertised Windows Media Player as a standalone product to be downloaded by itself, it was designed to work with competitors' operating systems, and there was a separate licensing agreement for the media player. Alden F. Abbott (U.S. Federal Trade Commission), while visiting the Center for Competition Law and Policy at the University of Oxford, in his paper on \"A Brief comparison of European and American Antitrust Law\" talked about the early intervention of the European enforcers in regard to bundling/tying practices which conforms to the idea about the European Union and its concern for false negatives. He states that bundling carried out by a dominant firm is likely to be found more concerning by the EU than the American enforcers. Neelie Kroes, the then Commissioner for EU Competition Policy, stated that Microsoft had continued to abuse its powerful market position and hindering innovation by charging extraordinary royalties to companies for providing crucial data to computer users around the world. She also goes on to state that main aim of the competition policy is to avoid consumer harm and to produce consumer benefits. However, the Assistant Attorney General at that time for Antitrust, R. Hewitt Pate issued a statement on the EC's decision in its Microsoft investigation. He commented that the US antitrust laws are enforced to protect the consumers by protecting the competition, not competitors. The commission's guidance on Article 102 states that the commission will normally only intervene where the conduct concerned has already been or is capable of hampering competition from competitors which are considered to be as efficient as the dominant undertaking. The commission is mindful that what really matters is protecting an effective competition process and not simply protecting competitors. This may well mean that competitors who deliver less to consumers in terms of price, choice, quality and innovation will leave the market. With regards to tying of Windows Media Player, the commission found out that customers were unable to buy Windows without WMP, and they install any alternative software alongside WMP. Microsoft argues that customers need not use it and that they did not have to pay extra for it. Microsoft argues that tying of WMP allowed the consumers to have their personal computers running with default options, out of the box, which lowered the transaction cost by reducing time and confusion.\n\nParagraph 7: Dooley was assigned to the medical intelligence task force sponsored by the Military Advisory Assistance Group, whose leader, Lt. Gen. John W. O'Daniel, was an active ally of Ngo Dinh Diem. His official duties involved collecting samples for epidemiological work, \"but his primary role was as a liaison between the refugee campaign...Operation Passage to Freedom and American reporters and politicians with an interest in Southeast Asia.\" In return for his work as a \"spokesman\", the doctor was awarded the highest presidential honor by Diem. During this period, he wrote numerous letters to his mother, many of which she shared with reporters; the letters were then printed in the local press, including the St. Louis Globe-Democrat. Most of the letters exaggerated his personal contribution to the refugee work. Despite his self-promotion, he \"was indefatigable in taking care of his patients.\" Concerning the \"self-aggrandizement\" aspect of his personality, he said that to be a humanitarian in the modern world \"you've gotta run it like a business. You've gotta have Madison Avenue, press relations, TV, radio...and of course you get condemned for being a publicity seeker\"; he argued that being able to care for 100 people per day, between 1954 and 1958, with MEDICO later treating 2,000 per day, justified this approach to humanitarianism.\n\nParagraph 8: The Vasin continue to evade the Boman chasing them by continually splitting off into smaller groups in the jungle, which makes Camsan even more suspicious.  Roger briefs his forces near a stream, who are awaiting orders to move out.  However, tragedy strikes when Matsugae, who is filling up Roger's camel bag in the stream, fails to pay attention to the water and is subsequently attacked by a damncroc.  Roger's troops manage to kill the creature but not in time to save Matsugae's life.  As Roger prepares to conduct a short ceremony over Costas' body, Pahner comms in and orders his troops to move further down South.  Roger scraps the ceremony reluctantly and orders Costas' body cremated.  Roger's forces return to the Sindi-D'Sley road to assist in securing the laborers working there, but Roger himself isn't paying attention to anything because of Matsugae's death and simply turns over command to one of his subordinates.  Upon hearing about this, Pahner decides to violate every regulation in the book to get Roger to function properly and sends Nimashet to speak to him.  While Roger initially doesn't want to speak to anyone, he eventually opens up to Nimashet.  He admits that his initial rejection of her was due to his awareness of his position in the succession and his determination not to bring into the world a bastard just like him, so he never \"fooled around\" (and hasn't had sex in over 10 years) and that only Costas had guessed why he acted this way and that he feels responsible for his death and the death of all the other marines he fell along the way.  He also confesses his love for Nimashet.  Nimashet, who knows she loves Roger as well, tells him that they are willing to die for him, now more than ever because they all knew the risks when they signed on.  She also makes him promise to have sex with her when they aren't in the middle of a battle for their lives, but Roger instead promises to marry her when they get home.  With Roger tracking again, Pahner orders him and his units to stay put and secure the rear while the Vasin continue to draw out the Boman in pursuit as they head back for Sindi.  The city and its surrounding areas are made ready for the final stage of the operation.\n\nParagraph 9: Conditional gene knockouts in mice are often used to study human diseases because many genes produce similar phenotypes in both species. For the past 100 years laboratory mouse genetics have been used for this because mice are mammals that are physiologically similar enough to humans to generate qualitative testing. These two have such similar genes that out of 4000 studied genes, only 10 were found in one species but not the other.  All mammals shared the same common ancestor approximately 80 million years ago; technically speaking, all genomes of mammals are comparatively similar. However, in comparison between mice and humans, their protein-coding regions of the genomes are 85% identical and have similarities between 99% of their homologs. These similarities result in similar phenotypes to be expressed between the two species.[8][12] Their genes are very alike to those of humans with 99% having homologs being similar. Along with producing similar phenotypes as well making them very promising candidates for conditional gene knockouts.[8] The goal of KOMP is to create knockout mutations in the embryonic stem cells for each of the 20,000 protein coding genes in mice. The genes are knocked out because this is the best way to study their function and learn more about their role in human diseases. There are two main strategies to conditional gene knockout and those are gene targeting or homologous recombination and gene trapping. Both methods usually have a modified viral vector or a linear fragment as the mode of transportation of the artificial DNA into the target ES cell. The cells then grow in a petri dish for several days and are inserted into the early-stage embryos. Lastly, the embryos are placed into the adult female’s uterus where it can grow into its offspring.[9] Some alleles in this project cannot be knocked out using traditional methods and require the specificity of the conditional gene knockout technique. Other combinatorial methods are needed to knockout the last remaining alleles. Conditional gene knockout is a time-consuming procedure and there are additional projects focusing on knocking out the remaining mouse genes. The KOMP project contributor, Oliver Smithies, arguably provided the biggest scientific impact on this gene targeting. Oliver received the Nobel prize for medicine due to a technique allowing the ability to identify functions in genes and how to use the 'knockout' method to delete certain genes. Unfortunately, the pioneer in gene targeting died at the age of 91 on January 10, 2017.[11] The KOMP projected was started in 2006 and is still ongoing today. The KOMP Repository provides incentives to those partaking in the projects to return feedback to them and those who meet specific criteria can be refunded 50% of the cost of their research cells.[10]\n\nParagraph 10: During Father Rale's War, at about 3:00 pm on August 23, 1724 (N. S.), a force of English colonial militia attacked Norridgewock for the last time. A force of 208 militia had left Fort Richmond (now Richmond) and divided, leaving about 80 militiamen including three Mohawks under the command of Captain Jeremiah Moulton. His militia quietly approached the village, which at that time no longer had a stockade. A startled Indian emerging from a cabin gave a war whoop, then darted back inside to get his musket. Norridgewock women and children ran from houses to swim or ford across the river and up into the woods. In the confusion, about 60 braves fired guns wildly but did little harm. At that point the militia, ordered to withhold fire until after the enemy's first volley, took aim—with deadly effect. The warriors fired again, then fled across the river, leaving 26 dead and 14 wounded. Bomazeen (or Bomaseen), the sachem, who with Sebastien de Villieu had led 250 Abenakis to Durham, New Hampshire on July 18, 1694, for the Oyster River Massacre, was shot fording the Kennebec at a place thereafter called Bomazeen Rips. From a cabin, old Chief Mogg shot one of the Mohawks, whose brother then shot him. Meanwhile, from another cabin Father Rale was firing at the militia. Refusing to surrender, he was shot through the head while reloading his gun.", "answers": ["Paragraph 10"], "length": 3389, "dataset": "passage_retrieval_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "27dd8f0741120a6e40c949d3bc15aa5b7b1728e8a77a7e8c"}

McCall had a strained relationship with his father and felt guilt over his actions during the Cold War. Edward Woodward received Emmy and Golden Globe nominations for his portrayal of Robert McCall.", "context": "Paragraph 1: The Midwest Clinic began on December 7, 1946, when approximately 120 directors from the Chicago area assembled in a YWCA gymnasium on Chicago's West Side for a six-hour clinic and new music reading session. In 1947, the event was expanded to two days and moved to the Hotel Sherman to take advantage of the larger facility and accommodations for out-of-town directors.  This second installment brought new features, including a printed program, an additional band, and a new name: The Mid-West Band Clinic. The VanderCook College of Music, Neil A. Kjos Music Company, and Lyons Band Instrument Company sponsored the event. For the next twenty-five years, the Hotel Sherman was home to the Midwest Clinic. In the 1950s, orchestras and jazz ensembles were introduced, and in 1962, the Midwest Clinic held its first official Orchestra Day. In 1963, the clinic expanded to its present format of four-and-a-half days. Since 1973, the Midwest Clinic has been held at the Hilton Chicago, and in 1995, the Blackstone Hotel was used in addition to the Hilton for hosting clinic events.  With the addition of this facility, the Midwest Clinic was able to present more clinics. In 1999, the Congress Plaza replaced the Blackstone Hotel as the second site of conference events.  In 2008, the Blackstone Hotel was once again added as a clinic venue after reopening in 2007.  In 2008, the Midwest Clinic board of directors voted to move the conference to McCormick Place in order to house all Midwest events in one location.\n\nParagraph 2: She has also worked in radio, as a co-presenter of The Steve Wright Show for BBC Radio 2 and has presented a number of documentaries for BBC Radio 4. She  also presented a live edition of The Choir for BBC Radio 3 and in 2017 hosted the BBC Radio 2 Young Choristers of the Year final. In November 2011, she wrote and directed the off-beat New York Comedy A Magpie in the Mirror. The festival arts documentary National Eisteddfod 2017 with Josie d'Arby was broadcast in the summer of 2017 on BBC Four and BBC Two Wales. She regularly presents Proms in the Park.\n\nParagraph 3: The Escape, Round 1 - The final escape was split into 4 rounds, or stages.  The winner of each round earns an advantage for the next.  The first round was the Descent.  This was a head to head battle between 1 adventurer from each team.  The pairs of adventurers were drawn from a bag and each adventurer was represented by their symbols that they were first given when they arrived on the island.  The captains had to transport one of the other teams treasures.  For this challenge the adventurers had to abseil a cliff face to the beach below. As soon as one adventurer finished the time it took for the other adventurer to get down was then used as a headstart for the next.  The first pair of adventurers were Natty from Sting against Lizzie from Claw.  Natty had to transport an Island treasure and her dislike of heights was clear, therefore Lizzie won this challenge.  The next pairing was Peter from Sting against James from Claw, Lizzie's win meant that James had a 32-second headstart.  This enabled James to nearly reach the bottom before Peter could even start.  Therefore, James won, however Peter cut the headstart down to 28 seconds.  The third race saw Khadie take on the Claw team captain Dilhan.  Dilhan won this and passed on a time advantage to the next member Zach who was against Sting member Jeremy.  Zach won this which meant that it was Down top Jordan of Sting and Eleanor from Claw to see who would win this stage of the escape.  Instead of this being a straight race the last pair of adventurers had to tie the opposing team's treasures onto a rope and send them down to their other team members one at a time.  Eleanor started this round first due to her time advantage.  However Jordan only had to pass down 2 treasures compared to Eleanor's 7.  Therefore, Jordan finished this very quickly and it took Eleanor about 2 minutes 30 seconds longer.  This was then Jordan's head start for the descent.  Jordan chose to take his time and approach the descent with caution, however due to the time advantage he managed to still finish before Eleanor started.  Eleanor then descended quickly as Claw could not continue without all of its members.  As Sting won this round they then earned a head start in round 2.\n\nParagraph 4: Itō was the owner, founder and honorary chairman of the $30 billion (in sales) Ito-Yokado retailing group, the second largest retailing organization in the world, which includes more than 10,000 7-Elevens in Japan and the US. Itō built the company from a small apparel store in Tokyo, into a corporation with annual revenues of more than $28 billion and a labour force of more than 125,000. The Ito-Yokado Group includes more than 10,000 7-Eleven stores in Japan and 5,800 in North America, along with 1,000 other stores, department stores, restaurants, specialty shops, supermarkets and superstores. Ito-Yokado was also the Japanese franchisee for Oshman's Sporting Goods stores, Robinson department stores, and Denny's restaurants. The company has begun opening superstores in China.\n\nParagraph 5: He was born in Carona and apprenticed under his father Guiniforte Solari, who was the leading architect of the Duomo di Milano. In his fathers workshop, he learned to draw plans and sculpture statues. In 1476, he was hired to contribute to the construction of the Duomo di Milano. With twenty six-years of age, he was appointed a deputy of his father by the Duke of the Duchy of Milan. When his father died, he was appointed his successor for the buildings of the Duke but not at the Catherdral of Milan. Later he also sculpted a tomb of the bishop Marco de Capitani in the Cathedral of Alessandria.\n\nParagraph 6: Balance-sheet insolvency is when a person or company does not have enough assets to pay all of their debts.  The person or company might enter bankruptcy, but not necessarily.  Once a loss is accepted by all parties, negotiation is often able to resolve the situation without bankruptcy. A company that is balance-sheet insolvent may still have enough cash to pay its next bill on time.  However, most laws will not let the company pay that bill unless it will directly help all their creditors. For example, an insolvent farmer may be allowed to hire people to help harvest the crop, because not harvesting and selling the crop would be even worse for his creditors.\n\nParagraph 7: Rehearsals for the tour began in March 2007. The set list of the shows included songs from the standard and deluxe edition of B'Day as well as songs from Dangerously in Love (2003). Ten shortened versions of Destiny's Child's songs were performed, as well as \"Listen\", a track performed by Knowles on the soundtrack of the 2006 musical drama film Dreamgirls, in which Knowles had starred. Twenty three people were present on stage with Knowles: ten instrumentalists, three harmony vocalists and ten dancers, from which only four were male. Anthony Venutolo from The Star-Ledger noted that the inclusion of female persons on stage was \"a simple, effective way\" to underscore the theme of female empowerment showcased during the concerts. Both Venutolo and Jon Pareles of The New York Times agreed that the shows used men only as dancers for the female audience. The conception and staging for the concert was done by Knowles, Kim Burse and Frank Gatson Jr. Gatson, Jonte Moaning, Ramone, Anthony Burrell and Danielle Polanco choreographed the dance routines. The tour was managed by Alan Floyd and its sponsors were Samsung and L'Oréal Paris. 75 stage and crew members and 60 tons of stage equipment, most of which was lighting, were present for the tour. 38 Sennheiser wireless channels were used for the shows and in a different frequency range, 38 backup wireless channels. The engineering team comprised James Berry who handled monitors for the band, Ramón Morales for Knowles, and Horace Ward at front of house. Sixteen of the wireless channels were devoted to personal monitor systems: 11 in stereo and five in mono. Knowles and the rest of the band members had a Sennheiser EK 300 IEM G2 monitoring receiver. Eleven of the channels provided wireless instrument support for guitar, bass and horns, using Sennheiser SK 500 G2 bodypack transmitters. The remaining channels covered Knowles' vocal microphone and those of her backup singers and guest vocalists. Sennheiser EM 3032-U and EM 550 G2 true-diversity receivers with Sennheiser A 5000-CP antennas and AC 3000 combiners rounded out the system. Knowles sang through a nickel Sennheiser SKM 5200 transmitter outfitted with a Neumann KK 105-S capsule. Ward commented that The KK 105-S was an \"absolutely stunning microphone... [it] is beautifully smooth and captures every nuance of a talented vocalist's performance\". He specified Sennheiser SKM 935 G2 microphones for the backup and guest vocalists because they sounded \"excellent even under less-than-ideal conditions\".\n\nParagraph 8:  Edward Woodward as Robert McCall: A veteran operative of The Company who becomes disillusioned with sacrificing ordinary people for the perceived greater good. He quits and takes out a newspaper advert offering his services to those who need it as The Equalizer. McCall himself is divorced, a \"lost dad\" long estranged from his son, Scott (William Zabka). Scott comes back into his life as a young adult who is at first bitterly critical of his father's world, but then becomes drawn into that world to the dismay of both of his parents. McCall also lost a woman he was in love with, a fellow operative named Manon Brevard, and discovers that she had secretly given birth to his daughter Yvette. McCall appears to be independently wealthy, as although he almost never takes payment for his work, he owns a high-end apartment, is always well dressed and drives a Jaguar XJ6 car (registered 5809-AUG). He enjoys classical music (playing the piano himself), fine wine and dining and is occasionally seen dating and trying to live a \"normal\" life, only for work or his past to get in the way. His father, William, was a British Army officer who was killed in Egypt in 1952 when McCall was 19 and also an army officer. His mother was a working class American entertainer and his father was disinherited by his family and shunned by his regiment for being seen to be marrying beneath himself. McCall had a strained relationship with his father, whom he blamed for remaining overseas and leaving him at boarding school while his mother was dying. He was also guilt-ridden at his various actions during the Cold War, notably helping to establish the dictatorship in Chile and working with South Africa's apartheid regime in Angola. Woodward was nominated for an Emmy for Outstanding Actor in a Drama Series four years in a row but never won, and was also nominated in 1986 and 1987 for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Television Series Drama, winning in 1986.\n\nParagraph 9: The establishment of a duty of care is usually broken up into a three-step test. The first case to establish a general duty of care was Donoghue v Stevenson. Famously, Mrs Donoghue claimed compensation for illness after she consumed a ginger beer containing a decomposed snail in a public house in Paisley, Scotland. The bottle was opaque so neither Mrs Donoghue nor the shopkeeper could see a snail, and at the time she could not sue the shopkeeper for breach of contract or consumer rights. The House of Lords by a majority held that the manufacturer, Mr Stevenson, was liable in tort. Lord Atkin held liability was \"based upon a general public sentiment of moral wrongdoing for which the offender must pay\" and people \"must take reasonable care to avoid acts or omissions which you can reasonably foresee would be likely to injure your neighbour.\" By contrast, Lord Macmillan suggested that the law should protect Mrs Donoghue by incremental analogy to previous cases. Nevertheless, Lord Atkin's speech was widely followed and was understood to contain three main points for establishing a duty of care. First, the concept of reasonable foreseeability of harm; second, the claimant and the defendant being in a relationship of proximity; third, and more loosely, it being fair, just and reasonable to impose liability on the defendant for his careless actions. This three-step scheme (also known as the tripartite or threefold test), however, did not crystallise until the case of Caparo Industries Plc v Dickman. A company called Caparo took over another company by buying up a majority of its shares. It did this because it sneakily obtained word from a company audit that the target was financially sound. The audit was prepared by a group of accountants (Dickman) and was intended for shareholders, not outsiders. Once Caparo owned the company it found that the finances were in fact pretty shoddy, and so it sued the accountants for being negligent in its audit preparation. The House of Lords found against Caparo and established the current threefold test. Although it was \"reasonably foreseeable\" that outsiders might learn of the carelessly prepared information, it was not the case that Caparo and Dickman were in a relationship of \"proximity\". This the court used as a term of art (note, this is different from the American use of the word) to say that it should not be the case that absolutely anyone who heard something said that was stupid and acted on it can sue. The court was reacting to its concern that to allow a claim here might open the floodgates of litigation. The third element, whether liability would be \"fair, just and reasonable\", was an extra hurdle added as a catch-all discretionary measure for the judiciary to block further claims.\n\nParagraph 10: At CyberSlam, Whipwreck began a new angle with Taz by picking up a fight with him after Taz continued to assault his defeated opponent Joel Hartgood after the match, but Whipwreck was taken down with a Tazmission. Whipwreck lost to Taz in a series of matches including one at Big Ass Extreme Bash on March 8. At Heat Wave, Whipwreck attempted to regain the ECW World Tag Team Championship from The Eliminators with Sabu as his partner but failed to win the titles. He captured the European Wrestling Association (EWA) European Junior Heavyweight Championship on August 2 by defeating The Dirt Bike Kid and appeared with the belt on ECW television until losing it to Sabu at London, England in December. Whipwreck appeared on the February 24, 1997 episode of Monday Night Raw, emanating from ECW's home arena Manhattan Center where he lost to Taz as part of an angle between ECW and the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). He took a hiatus from ECW for the next few months until returning to television on the May 29 episode of Hardcore TV, where he and Spike Dudley lost to Big Dick Dudley and D-Von Dudley. Whipwreck and Dudley began teaming together and got involved in a feud with PG-13. Whipwreck and Dudley lost to PG-13 at Orgy of Violence but defeated PG-13 and Whipwreck's longtime rival Jason in a handicap match at July's Heat Wave pay-per-view.\n\nParagraph 11: A team on the sixth or seventh step could not ask for any number of questions that would take them past the ninth one, and had to stop there if they reached it after stealing control from an opponent. A team on the eighth step could only play two questions and had to stop at the ninth one if they answered both correctly. The ninth step of each team's path always contained a prize more valuable than the others, often a holiday trip. Once a team reached this point, they had a choice to either end the turn and bank the prizes, or to attempt one final open-ended question for which conferring was allowed. If they attempted the question on that same turn and missed, they forfeited the un-banked prizes and had to answer a new question on their next turn. The first team to correctly answer their final question won the game, banked any prizes still at risk, and advanced to the bonus round. If time was called before a team reached the ninth step, the team in last place was eliminated and the second-place team moved up to the same position as the leaders. These two teams were asked one final tiebreaker question; the first to answer correctly won the game.\n\nParagraph 12: Meanwhile, Pintoo plans to leave the country but Guddu and Johnny catch up to him. While running from them, Pintoo gets onto a private plane to escape but learns that instead of the pilot, he brought the janitor with him. The janitor escapes with the only parachute and the plane crashes. Coincidentally everyone arrives at the site of the crash where Pintoo reveals that the money is kept in the Janakpur Zoo by him and asks them to look under an OK. After learning about the money, everyone decides to grab the money for themselves. Guddu and Johnny's car breaks down and they wait on the road to find another car. Avinash drives the car into the forest while claiming he knows a shortcut. Lallan takes him and Jhingur to a nearby helicopter service. Adi and Manav use the stolen car to reach Janakpur. Guddu and Johnny find an advanced car with a sarcastic G.P.S system which leads them to wrong routes and ultimately leads the car down a steep slope and destroys the car. Avinash and Bindu get lost in the forest and meet a local villager who claims to know the route to highway. They both take him with them. Lallan and Jhingur arrive at the helicopter service where they travel on an old and broken helicopter of the owner which is on the verge of crashing. Adi crashes the car in a desert after getting distracted by an attractive woman and gets stuck in quicksand. Manav takes a snake and asks Adi to grab it to get out. Somehow Adi gets out and bashes Manav for not bringing the nearby rope. Soon, they get attacked by a flock of vulture. Guddu and Johnny come across the Police Commissioner who then chases them both to a railway crossing. Avinash and Bindu try to cross a wooden bridge to get to the other side which breaks down. After luckily avoiding falling into the cliff, they realize that the villager was instead leading them to a restaurant called Highway which leads Avinash to beat him. Guddu and Johnny escape the Commissioner when a train collides with their car. Lallan and Jhingur jump off the crashing helicopter and land on a building under construction. Adi and Manav mess up with the remote and barely escape the burning car. Avinash and Bindu try to cross a river which gets filled by water when the dam gets opened and get swept to the edge of the waterfall. Guddu and Johnny get on a plane which they believe is going on a swimming trip but soon find out that it is actually going for skydiving trip. The both reluctantly jump off the plane. After somehow escaping near-death scenarios, everyone reaches Janakpur Zoo where they start finding the hidden money. They see that a man named Chinappa Swamy is planning to illegally close the zoo by killing all the animals. When the caretaker Prachi disagrees, he locks her inside the control station. The group then sees that Chinappa's men are poisoning the animal's food to kill them. When Jhingur, Manav, Johnny and Bindu ask to save them, the group decides to save the animals. Guddu comes across a lion and succeeds in keeping him from eating the poisoned steak. Lallan and Jhingur try to stop a baby gorilla from eating the poisoned bananas but Lallan gets beaten up by the father gorilla. Lallan saves the gorillas by convincing them to not eat the bananas. Adi and Manav try to rescue a baby elephant which has eaten the poisoned sugarcanes. They save him but the elephant pukes on Adi and the elephants thank them. Avinash and Bindu try to stop a tiger from eating the poisoned steak but Bindu gets chased by the tiger and she escapes him by climbing up a tree. Avinash then succeeds in convincing the tiger. Prachi gets freed when her pet monkey Security opens the door. After successfully saving the animals, the group confronts Chinappa but get saved when Security holds a gun to Chinappa's face. The animals then chase Chinappa. The group finds the OK and decides to split the money equally between all of them. The Commissioner forgives Guddu and Johnny when he also receives the money. Avinash and Bindu forgive each other and decide to live happily together. Guddu falls in love with Prachi with Johnny asking if he can get a girlfriend too.", "answers": ["Paragraph 8"], "length": 3686, "dataset": "passage_retrieval_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "a83340ad80a9e187029262c34b831c17116cf743c30a2d26"}
{"input": "This text provides a summary of the writing career and influence of Singaporean poet Edwin Thumboo. It notes that in the 1950s, Thumboo wrote lyrical poetry inspired by personal experiences and influenced by the English literary tradition. However, he shifted his focus to the public sphere in the 1970s, advocating for the creation of a national literature in post-independence Singapore. His collection of poetry, \"Gods Can Die,\" explored themes related to Singapore's national life. His subsequent anthologies, \"Ulysses by the Merlion\" and \"A Third Map,\" further established his reputation as a national poet committed to expressing a cultural vision for a multicultural Singapore. Thumboo is often referred to as Singapore's unofficial poet laureate due to his nationalistic-themed poems and his promotion of Singapore literature. His poem, \"Ulysses by the Merlion,\" was inspired by Irish mythology and history, particularly the works of W.B. Yeats. Thumboo considers himself a myth-inspired poet and views myths as narratives that provide stability in a multicultural society. The poem has also inspired other Singaporean poets to write their own Merlion-themed verses. A copy of \"Ulysses\" is installed on a plaque near the Merlion statue in Singapore.", "context": "Paragraph 1: Titkheperure or Tyetkheperre Psusennes II [Greek Ψουσέννης] or Hor-Pasebakhaenniut II [Egyptian ḥr-p3-sb3-ḫˁỉ--nỉwt], was the last king of the Twenty-first Dynasty of Egypt. His royal name means \"Image of the transformations of Re\" in Egyptian. Psusennes II is often considered the same person as the High-Priest of Amun known as Psusennes III. The Egyptologist Karl Jansen-Winkeln notes that an important graffito from the Temple of Abydos contains the complete titles of a king Tyetkheperre Setepenre Pasebakhaenniut Meryamun \"who is simultaneously called the HPA (i.e., High Priest of Amun) and supreme military commander.\" This suggests that Psusennes was both king at Tanis and the High Priest in Thebes at the same time, meaning he did not resign his office as High Priest of Amun during his reign. The few contemporary attestations from his reign include the aforementioned graffito in Seti I's Abydos temple, an ostracon from Umm el-Qa'ab, an affiliation at Karnak and his presumed burial – which consists of a gilded coffin with a royal uraeus and a Mummy, found in an antechamber of Psusennes I's tomb at Tanis. He was a High Priest of Amun at Thebes and the son of Pinedjem II and Istemkheb. His daughter Maatkare B was the Great Royal Wife of Osorkon I.\n\nParagraph 2: Three days after the events of the first film and a day after the events of the third film, the Creeper abducts a young Billy Taggart in front of his father Jack Sr., his older brother Jack Jr. and their dog Mac in its 22nd day of feeding. The next day, a school bus carrying a high school basketball team and cheerleaders suffers a blowout, after one of the tires is hit by a hand-crafted shuriken made of bone fragments. Later a cheerleader named Minxie Hayes has a vision of Billy Taggart and Darry Jenner who attempt to warn her about the Creeper before it blows out another tire and disables the bus. With the team stranded, the Creeper abducts bus driver Betty Borman and coaches Charlie Hanna and Dwayne Barnes. When the Creeper returns, he singles out six of the students: Dante Belasco, Jake Spencer, Minxie Hayes, Scotty Braddock, Andy \"Bucky\" Buck, and Deaundre \"Double D\" Davis. Minxie has another vision in which Darry says the Creeper emerges every 23rd spring for 23 days to eat humans and she tells the other students.\n\nParagraph 3: According to Folo Akintan's preliminary data, a medical doctor and epidemiologist from the Rocky Mountain Tribal Epidemiology Center in Billings, Montana, four out of ten Wind River Reservation residents reported that they have had a relative die from cancer. Many of the residents believe it is due to a uranium mill and contamination plume near St. Stephens. In 1958 Susquehanna–Western began processing uranium and vanadium ore on the reservation with sulfuric acid. Although the mill closed in 1963, there were tailings left behind. In 1988 the Department of Energy (DOE) found that soils, surface water and shallow groundwater were all contaminated. The DOE believes the land will naturally flush itself and be contamination-free 100 years from now. In 2010, the DOE recorded levels of contamination 100 times higher than what is allowed by the USEPA Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) for drinking water. Tribal officials were worried about their water sources being contaminated by these deadly toxins. The DOE placed plastic PVC for the water pipeline. They reassured the residents that it was secure and wouldn't break; however, Wind River Environmental Quality Commission officials state that the pipe has broken multiple times within the past year. The residents have become fed up with the DOE due to lack of cleaning up the land, poor pipeline equipment, and lack of spreading data about the high levels of contamination from flooding. Although it's hard to suggest that a uranium tailing site is causing an increased cancer rate, Dr. Akintan suggests, \"It is a risk indicator.\" The cancer rates on the reservation are higher than the national and state average. Although Dr. Akintan's reports show an increased cancer rate, the research had many limitations. The first limitation was lack of responses returned. There was a total of 3,000 surveys and only 286 were completed. Also, the data collected was only self-reported data which is unreliable due to response bias from the participants. Also, the results were leading but not statistically significant.\n\nParagraph 4: In the , West End had a population of 8,061 people; 50% male (4,029 males) and 50% female (4,032 females). Just over half (52.4%) of households were family households, 34.6% were single person households and 13.1% were group households. The median age of the West End population was 35 years, 2 years below the Australian median. Children aged under 15 years made up 11.5% of the population and people aged 65 years and over made up 8.8% of the population. The suburb has traditionally been home to Brisbane's largest Greek community, with an estimated 75% of Brisbane's Greek population living in West End by 1980. The most common ancestries in West End are English 20.6%, Australian 16.8%, Irish 10.1%, Scottish 8.0% and Greek 5.2%. Indigenous Australians make up 1.5% of the population of West End. For this reason, West End has often been cited as one of Brisbane's most successful multicultural areas. 56.6% of people living in West End were born in Australia, compared to the national average of 69.8%. The other top responses for country of birth were England 4.5%, New Zealand 3.4%, Vietnam 2.7%, Greece 2.7% and India 1.4%. 66.4% of people spoke only English at home; the next most popular languages were Greek 5.9%, Vietnamese 3.3%, Mandarin 2.0%, Cantonese 1.4% and Spanish 1.1%. The most common religious affiliation was \"No Religion\" (35.3%); the next most common responses were Catholic 16.5%, Anglican 8.1%, Eastern Orthodox 7.4% and Buddhism 5.2%.\n\nParagraph 5: Since the release of Team Fortress 2, Valve has continually released free updates and patches through Steam for Windows, OS X, and Linux users; though most patches are used for improving the reliability of the software or to tweak gameplay changes, several patches have been used to introduce new features and gameplay modes, and are often associated with marketing materials such as comics or videos offered on the Team Fortress 2 website; this blog is also used to keep players up to date with the ongoing developments in Team Fortress 2. As of July 2012, each class has been given a dedicated patch that provides new weapons, items, and other gameplay changes; these class patches typically included the release of the class's \"Meet the Team\" video. Other major patches have included new gameplay modes including the Payload, Payload Race, Training, Highlander, Medieval, and Mann vs. Machine modes. Themed patches have also been released, such as a yearly Halloween-themed event called \"Scream Fortress\", where players may obtain unique items available only during a set period around the holiday. Other new features have given players the ability to craft items within the game from other items, trade items with other players, purchase in-game items through funds in Steam, and save and edit replay videos that can be posted to YouTube.\n\nParagraph 6: Peruzzi began his Serie A career with Roma in 1987. He was loaned to Hellas Verona in 1989, but was one of the two Roma players (the other being Andrea Carnevale) to be suspended for a year in October 1990 after failing a doping test because of an appetite suppressant he was taking at the time, which contained the banned substance Phentermine. His signing with Juventus in 1991 successfully revived his career and he soon surpassed Stefano Tacconi as the club's starting goalkeeper, remaining with the team until 1999, and winning the Serie A Goalkeeper of the Year Award in 1997 and 1998, as well as the Guerin d'oro in 1997. Peruzzi won three Serie A titles, a Coppa Italia, two Supercoppa Italiana titles, a UEFA Cup, a UEFA Super Cup, an Intercontinental Cup and was part of Juventus' 1996 UEFA Champions League title squad that defeated Ajax in the final on penalties, saving two in the final shoot-out. He also reached two more consecutive Champions League finals with the Turin-based club, as well as a semi-final finish during his final season with the club. Peruzzi also won a runners-up medal in the 1995 UEFA Cup final and in the 1992 Coppa Italia final, and was voted to the ESM Team of the Year during the 1996–97 and the 1997–98 seasons. Over this period, several Italian pundits began to consider him the best goalkeeper in the world, due to his consistency.\n\nParagraph 7: In the 1950s, Thumboo wrote mostly lyrical poetry based on personal experiences. Displaying the influence of the English literary tradition on him, they dealt with aesthetic and metaphysical themes. By the mid-1970s, he had shifted his focus to the public sphere, believing that poets of post-independence Singapore should work towards creating a national literature. Singapore's national life was a key subject of his collection of poetry Gods Can Die (1977), and it has been said that the subsequent anthologies Ulysses by the Merlion (1979) and A Third Map (1993) \"established his reputation as a national poet committed to articulating a cultural vision for a multicultural Singapore\". Thumboo is often dubbed Singapore's unofficial poet laureate because of his poems with nationalistic themes, notably 9 August – II (1977), and Ulysses by the Merlion (1979) which was published in the anthology of the same name, as well as his role in promoting Singapore literature, for example, through his work as General Editor of the literary journal Singa. Ulysses, which references an iconic statue of a beast with the upper body of a lion and the tail of a fish called the Merlion that faces Marina Bay, was inspired by the use of Irish mythology and history by W. B. Yeats. The Irish poet has asserted a significant influence on Thumboo, as Thumboo recognizes parallels between Ireland's nationalistic struggle and Singapore's breakaway from colonialism. He describes himself as a myth-inspired poet, and sees myths as ancient narratives and structures which provide a stable point of reference for a multicultural society. Ulysses has prompted other Singaporean poets such as Alfian Sa'at, Vernon Chan, David Leo, Felix Cheong, Gwee Li Sui, Koh Buck Song, Lee Tzu Pheng, Alvin Pang and Daren Shiau to write their own Merlion-themed verses; it is often joked that one cannot be regarded as a true Singapore poet until one has written a \"Merlion poem\". A copy of Ulysses is installed on a plaque near the statue.\n\nParagraph 8: Though comparatively healthy as an adult, Amelia was a sickly child and her mother employed Johann Georg Steigerthal and Hans Sloane to treat her as well as secretly asking advice from physician John Freind. In 1722, her mother, who had progressive ideas,  had Amelia and her sister Caroline inoculated against smallpox by an early type of immunisation known as variolation, which had been brought to England from Constantinople by Lady Mary Wortley Montagu and Charles Maitland. On 11 June 1727, George I died and her father succeeded him as George II. She lived with her father until his death in 1760.\n\nParagraph 9: As grandchildren of Dáire Cerbba (Cearba, Cearb) in most sources (e.g., Rawlinson B 502), also an ancestor of the Uí Liatháin and Uí Fidgenti, the brother and sister are sometimes regarded as belonging to an early branch of the Eóganachta which later became peripheral or became extinct, although it is more likely that all descendants of Dáire Cerbba belong to a distinct people, possibly the Dáirine, which may be hinted at in an obscure Old Irish poem by Flann mac Lonáin, although in the Banshenchas Mongfind is called \"Mongfind of the Érnai\" (Érainn), a people in any case related to the Dáirine. A passage in Rawlinson B 502 declares that Dáire Cerbba was born in Mag Breg (Brega), Mide, much of which probably remained Érainn or Dáirine territory at the time of his supposed floruit. Later political genealogies may remove this generation to make the monarch appear closer to the historical Eóganachta, his natural kindred having mostly fallen into obscurity. Byrne reproduces one of these (2001), and does not give his source, probably Laud 610, in which the father of Crimthand Mór is a certain Láre Fidach, son of Ailill Flann Bec. Possibly this is a mistake, or an attempt by the Eóganachta literati, well known for their political fables, to more closely associate the brother and sister with the new Munster dynasty. Mongfind is simply called the daughter of Dáire (Cerbba?), not of Fidach, in the Book of Lismore, and there Dáire's father is called Findchad, while Crimthand Mór is not mentioned at all.\n\nParagraph 10: Due to concerns about diesel emissions in the East River Tunnels and the underground tracks of Grand Central Terminal and Penn Station, passenger trains entering New York City have long been required to use electrical power, as coal and later diesel exhaust would pose a hazard to human health in the confined underground spaces. At the same time, much of the New Haven's trackage was not electrified beyond New Haven. To allow passenger trains to travel to New York City from non-electrified lines without requiring a change of locomotives, the New Haven Railroad purchased a class of locomotive that could switch between diesel and electric power on the fly.", "answers": ["Paragraph 7"], "length": 2421, "dataset": "passage_retrieval_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "23c6743defc01d7bb8a905ab4c147906f10eef786d360d9b"}
{"input": "The text explains that the abyssal zone, a deep area of the ocean, is undergoing negative effects from climate change, ocean acidification, pollution, overfishing, and potential deep sea mining. While the zone is not immediately impacted by rising temperatures, it is affected by ocean acidification and pollution, particularly plastics. These substances are decreasing the already limited biomass in the abyssal zone. Overfishing also poses a threat as it reduces the amount of dead material that sinks to the seafloor, which is essential for the ecosystem. Additionally, the text mentions that deep sea mining operations could be disastrous for the abyssal zone, as they can lead to increased pollution, destruction of habitats, and harm to the overall ocean ecosystem.", "context": "Paragraph 1: She was recommissioned on 25 May 1915 and assigned to the 6th Division, Torpedo Flotilla, Atlantic Fleet. The ship then cruised along the east coast carrying out routine patrols. Prior to the entrance of the United States into World War I, she served on Neutrality Patrols, trying to protect American and neutral-flagged merchant ships from interference by British or German warships and U-boats. In the course of performing those duties, Aylwin was at Newport, Rhode Island in early October 1916. At 05:30 on 8 October, wireless reports came in of a German submarine stopping ships near the Lightship Nantucket, off the eastern end of Long Island. After an SOS from the British steamer  was received at about 12:30, Rear Admiral Albert Gleaves ordered Aylwin and other destroyers at Newport to attend to survivors. The American destroyers arrived on the scene about 17:00 when the U-boat,  under the command of Kapitänleutnant Hans Rose, was in the process of stopping the Holland-America Line cargo ship . Shortly after, U-53 stopped the British passenger ship . As Rose had done with three other ships, U-53 had sunk earlier in the day, he gave passengers and crew aboard Blommersdijk and Stephano adequate time to abandon the ships before sinking the pair. At one point, Rose signaled Aylwin requesting that she move out of the way to allow Stephano to be torpedoed, much to the later chagrin of Lord Beresford, who denounced Aylwins compliance as \"aiding and abetting\" the Germans in a speech in the House of Lords. In total, 226 survivors from U-53s five victims were rescued by the destroyer flotilla. Aylwin picked up the crew of Stephano and a number of passengers, later transferring them to destroyer  for return to Newport.\n\nParagraph 2: As with all of the rest of the natural world climate change has negative effects. Due to the zone’s depth, increasing global temperatures do not affect it as quickly or drastically as the rest of the world, but the zone is still afflicted by ocean acidification. Along with climate change and ocean acidification, pollutants, such as plastics, are also present in this zone. Plastics are especially bad for the abyssal zone due to the fact that these organisms have evolved to eat or try to eat anything that moves or appears to be detritus, resulting in most organisms consuming plastics instead of nutrients. Both ocean acidification and pollution are decreasing the already small biomass that resides within the abyssal zone. Another problem caused by humans is overfishing. Even though no fishery can fish for organisms anywhere near the abyssal zone, they are still causing harm. The abyssal zone depends on dead organisms from the upper zones sinking to the seafloor, since their ecosystem lacks producers due to lack of sunlight. As fish and other animals are removed from the ocean, the frequency and amount of dead material reaching the abyssal zone decreases. A future problem for the abyssal zone could be deep sea mining operations. The talks and planning for this industry are already underway. This could be disastrous for this extremely fragile ecosystem since the ecological dangers from mining for deep sea minerals are many. Mining could increase the amount of pollution in not only the abyssal zone, but in the ocean as a whole, and would physically destroy habitats and the seafloor. This industry represents a looming threat to the abyssal zone and the rest of the ocean's inhabitants.\n\nParagraph 3: Haplo lands near a huge citadel but can't enter. In the forest he encounters giant creatures called . Being stuck he sets sail to a city he had seen. He encounters elves. He meets a group of elven and human children, including the elven prince. They take him to one of their secret meetings with a wizard called Zifnab. Haplo follows Zifnab. He meets Zifnab and his dragon. Zifnab seems to be a crazy wizard but Haplo learns that Zifnab is a Sartan. Zifnab senses that Haplo is very important even though he is a Patryn. He tells Haplo that the Citadel is supposed to generate power for the other realms and that the  are supposed to operate it. Inside the Citadel is the seal piece of Pryan. But the Citadel is closed and can only be opened by the mensch with three specific objects, a golden staff, a golden sword and a golden hammer. The golden sword is carried by the human leader and is currently in hands of the human princess. The golden staff had been given to the elves but one king tossed it into a giant crevice known as the 'Maw'. The golden hammer is in possession of the dwarves. Haplo needs the humans, elves and dwarves to use their golden items to open the citadel. But he also needs to distract the  who seem to worship a crystal fragment and have forgotten about their tasks for the citadel. Zifnab also tells Haplo of the Wave, the balance of the universe and that his dragon was created by the Wave trying to restore the balance, in response to something very evil that happened a long time ago. He gives Haplo a stone that will glow when he will encounter this evil and tells Haplo to crush the stone when that happens. Haplo retrieves the golden staff and convinces the human princess and the elven prince to accompany him to the Citadel. In the forest they free a dwarven girl from the . The girls tells him that the hammer is stashed in the vault and that the vault is only opened when the dwarves go to war. With help from the princess and the prince, Haplo manages to steal the crystal fragment which enrages the . Haplo tosses it into the dwarven tunnels and the  start attacking it. The dwarven girl obtains the hammer and the mensch open the Citadel and the  take their place. Zifnab allows Haplo to take the seal piece even though he knows that Lord Xar wants to conquer the realms and rid it of the Sartan. Haplo returns to the Nexus and delivers the seal piece to Xar who sends Haplo to Abarrach, the realm of Earth. On the crystal fragment, Haplo finds the symbol of Abarrach and transfers it to his steering stone.\n\nParagraph 4: Kenneth Michael Stabler (December 25, 1945 – July 8, 2015) was an American professional football player who was a quarterback in the National Football League (NFL) for 17 seasons, primarily with the Oakland Raiders. Nicknamed \"Snake\", he played college football at Alabama and was selected by the Raiders in the second round of the 1968 NFL Draft. During his 10 seasons in Oakland, Stabler received four Pro Bowl selections and was named Most Valuable Player in 1974. Stabler also helped the Raiders win their first Super Bowl title in Super Bowl XI. He was posthumously inducted to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2016.\n\nParagraph 5: Nearly all public transit in the city is operated by the Utah Transit Authority. In addition to operating the bus system, it also operates the TRAX light rail system, which contains three lines, the first of which runs from downtown south to Draper, the second runs from University of Utah southwest to South Jordan, and the third from the Salt Lake City International Airport east through downtown and then southwest to West Valley City. A commuter rail line, called the FrontRunner, runs north through Davis County to Ogden in central Weber County and south to Provo in central Utah County. UTA also operates a streetcar line that connects the Sugar House neighborhood with the TRAX system in South Salt Lake. The road system is also extensive, with three interstate highways, two additional state freeways, a limited-access highway, and a third state freeway under development/construction. However, the geographic constrictions of the Salt Lake Valley, as well as its rapid population growth, have led to severe congestion problems.\n\nParagraph 6: In pulse-width modulation the switches are turned on at a constant chopping frequency. The total time period of one cycle of output waveform is constant. The average output voltage is directly proportional to the ON time of chopper. The ratio of ON time to total time is defined as duty cycle. It can be varied between 0 and 1 or between 0 and 100%. Pulse-width modulation (PWM), or pulse-duration modulation (PDM), is a technique used to encode a message into a pulsing signal. Although this modulation technique can be used to encode information for transmission, its main use is to allow the control of the power supplied to electrical devices, especially to inertial loads such as motors. The average value of voltage (and current) fed to the load is controlled by turning the switch between supply and load on and off at a fast rate. The longer the switch is on compared to the off periods, the higher the total power supplied to the load. The PWM switching frequency has to be much higher than what would affect the load (the device that uses the power), which is to say that the resultant waveform perceived by the load must be as smooth as possible. Typically switching has to be done several times a minute in an electric stove, 120 Hz in a lamp dimmer, from few kilohertz (kHz) to tens of kHz for a motor drive and well into the tens or hundreds of kHz in audio amplifiers and computer power supplies.\n\nParagraph 7: At SummerSlam, Commissioner Shane McMahon was the special guest referee for the United States Championship match between Kevin Owens and AJ Styles. During the match, Owens attempted a pin, but Shane saw that Styles' foot was on the bottom rope and ordered the match to continue. A frustrated Owens shoved Shane, who shoved back, allowing Styles to defeat Owens to retain the title. On the following SmackDown, Shane gave Owens one final shot at the title as long as Styles was the champion and also allowed him to pick the referee for the match; Owens chose Baron Corbin. During the match, Shane took over referee duties after Corbin walked out on the match. Styles took advantage and defeated Owens to retain the championship again. Two weeks later, Shane attacked Owens after warning him not to talk about his children. Subsequently, Shane was suspended indefinitely on orders of his father, WWE Chairman Vince McMahon. The following week, Vince called out Owens, reinstated Shane, and scheduled a Hell in a Cell match between the two at Hell in a Cell. Owens agreed on the condition that Vince would allow him to beat a McMahon senseless if provoked. After agreeing and shaking hands, Owens attacked Vince with a headbutt, a superkick, and a frog splash. Vince refused to be carried out on a stretcher and walked out of the ring, helped by his daughter Stephanie McMahon (her first cable television appearance since WrestleMania 33). The following week, Shane threatened that he would give Owens a beating at Hell in a Cell and warned him of his actions. The same night, Owens, via satellite, apologized for attacking Vince, but blamed Shane for his actions. On the September 26 episode, Owens called out Shane, but was confronted by Sami Zayn, who said that Owens went too far. As the two were about to fight, they were stopped by General Manager Daniel Bryan, who scheduled a match between the two. Owens defeated Zayn by referee stoppage after performing a powerbomb onto the ring apron. After the match, Owens attacked Zayn, but Shane appeared. As he attempted to go after Owens, Owens threw Zayn into Shane and fled through the crowd. The following week, Shane changed their match to a falls count anywhere Hell in a Cell match. He called out Owens to no avail, but midway through his promo, Owens appeared in the crowd. Owens began to leave and Shane chased after him through the crowd, where they fought in the concession area and Owens attacked Shane with a powerbomb through a table. Owens returned to the ring to cut a promo, but Shane returned and fought with Owens, which ended with Owens attacking Shane with a super kick and a pop up powerbomb.\n\nParagraph 8: Individuals with depersonalization describe feeling disconnected from their physicality; feeling as if they are not completely occupying their own body; feeling as if their speech or physical movements are out of their control; feeling detached from their own thoughts or emotions; and experiencing themselves and their lives from a distance. While depersonalization involves detachment from one's self, individuals with derealization feel detached from their surroundings, as if the world around them is foggy, dreamlike, or visually distorted. Individuals with the disorder commonly describe a feeling as though time is passing them by and they are not in the notion of the present. In some cases, individuals may be unable to accept their reflection as their own, or they may have out-of-body experiences. One-third to one-half of patients with DPDR also experience hearing internal voices. This is to differentiate from external voices which are more commonly found in psychosis. Additionally some individuals experience difficulty concentrating and problems with memory retrieval. These individuals sometimes lack the \"feeling\" of a memory where they are able to recall a memory but feel as if they did not personally experience it. These experiences which strike at the core of a person's identity and consciousness may cause a person to feel uneasy or anxious. The inner turmoil created by the disorder can also result in depression.\n\nParagraph 9: The weekly one-hour show played segments from the Top 10 charting songs accompanied by the Solid Gold Dancers. Of the eight original Solid Gold '79 dancers, only four would join the Solid Gold series cast: Darcel Wynne (1980–1984 & 1985–1986), who would be the program's principal dancer for its first five years and was often credited by her first name alone, Paula Beyers (1980–1982), Deborah Jenssen (1980–1984), Tony Fields (1980–1984) and Alexander Cole (1980–1983). Gayle Crofoot (1982–1985) would join the roster in late fall of 1982, replacing dancer Lucinda Dickey (1982). The other remaining \"Solid Gold '79\" dancers were Larry Blum, Candy Brown and Judy Pierce. Cooley Jackson/Jaxson (1983–1986) joined the show in 1983, replacing Alexander Cole. Cooley also was the White Ranger in the Power Rangers Live Tour, Breakin' the Movie, and Electric Boogaloo Breakin' 2. Other dancers who appeared on Solid Gold were: Pam Rossi (1980–1986), Helene Phillips (1980–1982), Laura Melton (1980), Michael Perea (1980), Kahea Bright (1980–1984), Janeen Best (1982–1983 & 1985), Macarena Gandarillas (1982), Tricia McFarlane (1983), Jamilah Lucas (1983 & 1984–1988), Chelsea Field (1983–1984), Kelly Stubbs (1983), Lezlie Mogell (1984–1985), Steve La Chance (1984), Mark Sellers (1984–1986), Arlene Ng (1984), Beverly Jeanne (1984–1986), Nicole Romine (1984–1986), Eileen Fairbanks (1985–1987), Leslie Cook (1986–1988), Gigi Hunter (1986–1988), Audrey Baranishyn (1986–1987), Darrell Wright (1986–1988), Paul Michael Thorpe (1986–1988), Regan Patno (1986–1988), Andrea Moen (1987–1988), and Betsy Harris (1987–1988).\n\nParagraph 10: According to CNN News, \"After the June 5 sentencing, [Judge] Walton said he was inclined to jail Libby after the defense laid out its proposed appeal, but the judge told attorneys he was open to changing his mind\"; however, on June 14, 2007, Judge Walton \"ordered\" Libby \"to report to prison while his attorneys appeal his perjury and obstruction.\" Although \"Libby's attorneys asked that the order be stayed  ... U.S. District Court Judge Reggie Walton denied the request and told Vice President Dick Cheney's former chief of staff that he has 10 days to appeal the ruling\"; in denying Libby's request, which had questioned Special Counsel Patrick Fitzgerald's \"authority to charge Libby,\" as quoted by CNN, Judge Walton said: \"'Everyone is accountable, and if you work in the White House, and if it's perceived that somehow (you're) linked at the hip, the American public would have serious questions about the fairness of any investigation of a high-level official conducted by the attorney general,'\" supporting Fitzgerald's authority in the case. The judge was also responding to an Amicus curiae brief that he had permitted to be filed, which had not apparently convinced him to change his mind, as he subsequently denied Libby bail during his appeal. Prior to Judge Walton's order, Josh Gerstein stated, in The New York Sun, \"Bail remains a critical question for Libby. Judge Walton has indicated he is not inclined to grant it. Many political observers believe that if Libby gets bail and his appeals fail, he stands a better chance of receiving a presidential pardon because President Bush's term will be nearing its end. Technically, the scholars took no position on the question of bail, but if Judge Walton agreed with them [i.e., their arguments], bail would be highly likely.\" Though \"Judge Walton granted the scholars permission to file their brief,\" Gerstein reports, \"his order doing so contained a caustic footnote questioning the motivation of the legal academics and suggesting he might not give a great deal of weight to their opinion[:]", "answers": ["Paragraph 2"], "length": 2949, "dataset": "passage_retrieval_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "0e8c69019805819444bf646f6b76ad392e294a7973c4a542"}

In proper typography and in handwriting, the palatalisation mark does not extend above the cap height (except uppercase letters Ń, Ŕ, Ś, V́ etc.), and it is written above the letter if the letter has no ascender (ǵ, ḿ, ń, ṕ, ŕ, ś, v́ etc.) but written to the right of it otherwise (b’, d’, f’, h’, k’, l’, t’). In computing, it is not usually possible to enter these character combinations or to make them look esthetically pleasing with most common fonts, so the apostrophe is generally placed after the letter in all cases. This convention is followed in this article as well.\n\nParagraph 3: After his time there was over, he lost the Ciclope mask to Antifaz del Norte early in 1999. He quickly reverted to his Halloween character but lost his mask again on December 24, 1999 in a match against Super Parka. He has wrestled in many United States promotions over the years including for USA Pro Wrestling, Florida Championship Wrestling (FCW) and Luchamania. In 2002 he along with La Familia de Tijuana (a group consisting of himself, Damián 666, Nicho el Millonario, Rey Misterio, Sr. and their valet Lady Victoria. although Rey did not come for the tour) came to Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre in Mexico City. The trio won the National Trios title but Nicho had a falling out with management and La Familia soon left entirely. They continued to work for independent promoters until CMLL called them back in 2005 to wrestle against Negro Casas, Heavy Metal and Felino on a show celebrating Negro's 25 years of wrestling. Perro Aguayo, Jr. recruited him and Damián for his Los Perros del Mal group. However, Halloween suffered a leg injury and his role was minimalized. After Universo 2000 used the illegal martinete on Damián 666, Halloween challenged Univeso to a hair vs. hair match on the December 2 show. After losing the match and his hair, Halloween underwent knee surgery that put him out of action for several months after which he was released from CMLL. In 2009 Halloween joined Aguayo's Perros del Mal Producciones, where he reunited with Damián 666. In June 2010, Halloween became a major part of a storyline, where Los Perros del Mal invaded AAA. On June 18, 2011, at Triplemanía XIX, Halloween, Damián 666 and X-Fly defeated Los Psycho Circus in a tournament final to become the first ever AAA World Trios Champions. On July 31 at Verano de Escándalo, Los Perros del Mal faced Los Psycho Circus in a steel cage match, where the last person left in the cage would lose either his hair or mask. The match ended with Psycho Clown escaping the cage, leaving X-Fly inside and forcing him to have his hair shaved off. On October 9 at Héroes Inmortales, Los Perros del Mal and Los Psycho Circus ended their year long rivalry, when Halloween, Damián 666 and Nicho el Millonario were defeated in a Masks vs. Hairs steel cage match and were all shaved bald. After a five-month break from the rivalry, Los Perros del Mal lost the AAA World Trios Championship to Los Psycho Circus on March 11, 2012. The following day, Halloween, Damián 666 and X-Fly announced that they had quit Los Perros del Mal.\n\nParagraph 4: After months of preparation the Eastern Expeditionary Force (EEF) crossed the Sinai Desert at the end of 1916 and prepared to invade Palestine, beginning the Sinai and Palestine Campaign. 52nd (L) Division was held in reserve during the 1st Battle of Gaza (26–27 March 1917) and was not committed. There followed several weeks of preparation for the 2nd Battle of Gaza, during which 1/7th HLI began a daily routine of sending a company to turn a Turkish post out of an orchard to the front, only to retire back to the British lines at dusk. These apparently meaningless operations were designed to accustom the Turks to British troops being moved into the area, in order to cover preparations for the main attack. The first phase was carried out on 17 April, with 52nd (L) Division tasked with taking Ali Mansur and the adjoining hills. 157th Brigade slipped quietly into its positions before 01.00, and at 04.45 (before dawn) it advanced up the El Burjaliye Ridge to attack the cliffs of Ali Mansur, with 1/7th HLI advancing in the centre led by Lt-Col Galbraith. As the light grew, the Turks opened fire, and the British artillery bombardment began. When the bombardment ended, HLI patrols scaled the cliffs and were soon at the top, firing down on retreating Turks. By 07.00 the brigade was in complete possession of the objective, with patrols pushing out across the plain behind. Consolidation was carried out under Turkish shellfire. The second phase of the attack on 19 April against Ali Muntar, for which 157th Bde was in reserve, was less successful. The Turkish positions known as 'the Labyrinth' had not been sufficiently suppressed by the bombardment and although 155th (South Scottish) Brigade took a lunette on Outpost Hill, it could not be held, and changed hands several times. It was finally abandoned at 18.20, just as 1/7th HLI arrived to reinforce the position. 1/7th HLI then helped 156th (Scottish Rifles) Brigade to establish a line across the ridge. They dug all night in the hard ground, but by daybreak on 20 April the trench was less than 1 metre deep  and came under mortar fire. Several men of the 1/7th HLI were killed trying to get water through to the men pinned down in this trench; the battalion lost 34 men by sniping during the day. At midnight the advanced line was withdrawn to a stronger defence line in rear. During the four-day battle the 1/7th HLI lost 4 officers and 14 ORs killed, 1 officer and 7 ORs missing, and 3 officers and 115 ORs wounded. Most of the missing were in fact dead, and many of the wounded also died.\n\nParagraph 5: In \"The Natural System of Colours\" published in 1766, Harris discussed the multitude of colours that can be created using three \"grand or principle\" colours: red, yellow and blue. As a naturalist and an engraver, Harris focussed on the relationships between colours and how they are coded and created. He explained how three colours can be íntermixed, tinted and shaded to create 660 colours \"materially, or by the painters art\". Harris referred to red, yellow and blue as \"Primitives\" and attempted to link these to Isaac Newton's colour theory by making reference to colours \"seen in the rainbow refracted by the prism\". \"The Natural System of Colours\" features two illustrations and the first of these is Harris' 'Prismatic' colour wheel which features red, yellow and blue as the key principle colours. These colours sit at the centre of the colour wheel surrounded by variations of 'Mediate' colours, orange, green and purple. The second illustration in \"The Natural System of Colours\" is Harris' 'Compound' colour wheel which features orange, green and purple at the centre surrounded by variations of tertiary colours between each of the 'Mediate' colours. Harris conflated the creation of colour using pigments with the creation and appearance of colour in respect to light-waves in two ways. Firstly, in his attempt to deal with black and white. He suggested that the admixture of opposing colours create \"a dirty unmeaning colour\" and he contended that the admixture of red, blue and yellow \"in equal force and in the strongest powers which by violently opposing each other and in very unequal contest are all three continually defeated, causing a total confusion and obscurity in darkness\", thereby suggesting that these three colours create black. In reference to this claim, the centres of each colour wheel feature three overlaid colours (red, yellow and blue, and orange, green and purple) outlined in black (as a result of the engraving process used to create the illustration) thereby causing a blackish effect but on closer inspection, the central segment of each colour wheel appears a dark, murky brown. In reference to white, Harris suggested that white represented a \"total privation or absence of colour\". In addition, Harris suggested that his 'Prismatic' colour wheel reflected the colours \"shown in the prism\" while the colours depicted in the 'Compound' colour wheel \"admits of all colours in nature, not found in the prismatic part\". \n\nParagraph 6: Four years after leaving prison, while he was still on parole, Beardslee was arrested in California for the April 5, 1981, drug-related homicides of 19-year-old Patty Geddling and 23-year-old Stacie Benjamin in Redwood City, California. Prosecutors claim a drug deal between the friends of Beardslee's roommate had gone wrong, and a $185 drug debt had gone unpaid. In a scheme devised by Frank Rutherford, a drug dealer, Beardslee's roommate, Ricarda Sue (Rickie) Soria, lured the two to their apartment. The prosecutors noted that Beardslee sent Soria out to get duct tape to bind the victims before they arrived. Beardslee and, according to the prosecution, Bill Forrester, both shot Geddling, and later Beardslee slashed Benjamin's throat.\n\nParagraph 7: On 24 October 2018, Ortiz's manager Jay Jimenez announced that a deal had been reached for Ortiz to fight American boxer Travis Kauffman (32–2) on the Deontay Wilder vs. Tyson Fury Showtime PPV card on 1 December at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, California. The fight, along with the rest of the card was finalized on 9 November. Before the fight was announced, Ortiz and Dillian Whyte called each other out. Ortiz offered Whyte a fight on the 1 December card and Whyte offered Ortiz a chance to fight him on 22 December in London. Ortiz accepted Whyte's offer, however promoter Eddie Hearn stated Dillian Whyte vs. Derek Chisora made more sense in the UK. In the build up to his fight against Ortiz, Kauffman questioned Ortiz's wins on his resume after multiple failed drug tests. At the same time, he also praised Ortiz's boxing skills. Ortiz stepped on the scales at 241 pounds and Kauffman weighed 229 pounds. For the fight, Ortiz was guaranteed $375,000 compared to Kauffman's $125,000 purse. On fight night, Ortiz dropped Kauffman three times before winning the fight via TKO in the final round. The official time of stoppage was 1 minute and 58 seconds of round 10. Ortiz dominated every round leading to the stoppage, however Kauffman was always standing in front of him and showed a good chin and heart, even switching to the southpaw stance, where he had some success. Ortiz was twice warned for low blows. In round 6, Ortiz landed an overhand left which dropped Kauffman to the canvas. Ortiz, believing he won, stood on the top ropes and did his signature chest pounding. Kauffman beat the count and finished the round. Another overhand left, this time to Kauffman's jaw, dropped him for a second time in the first minute of round 8. Kauffman slowly got up and again beat the count and saw out the remainder of the round. In the first minute of round 10, Ortiz landed another overhand left, dropping Kauffman a third time. After Kauffman beat the count, Ortiz piled on the pressure with numerous power shots, mostly unanswered, forcing referee Thomas Taylor to step in and stop the fight. Ortiz landed 135 punches in comparison to the 37 punches landed by Kauffman. Ortiz landed 69 power punches in total. After the fight, Ortiz stated he was looking for fight Wilder. British boxer Joe Joyce, who also boxed on the card, called out Ortiz. Ortiz later accepted, stating he does not turn down a challenge.\n\nParagraph 8: Overton has wired to Cambridge to find out if Staunton has been seen there; he has not. He has also wired Lord Mount-James, Staunton's very wealthy uncle and nearest living relative, but has heard no answer. Staunton is the almost-eighty-year-old Lord Mount-James's heir, but he must meanwhile live in relative poverty owing to his uncle's miserly behaviour. Meanwhile, Holmes questions the porter. The bearded man who brought the note was neither a gentleman nor a workman, and he seemed to be bothered by something too, for his hand was trembling as he handed Staunton the note. The only word that the porter overheard of their short conversation was \"time\".\n\nParagraph 9: The main occupation of the colonists was agriculture. With their arrival a massive cultivation of hemp started, although by some Turkish notebooks the cultivation of hemp was mentioned even when they ruled with these areas. The land in Odžaci and around was ideal for growing these plants, with the help of the river Mostonoga that was frequently casting and flooding the surrounding area. Also, Mostonoga was ideal for plunging the hemp. The production was initiated by baron Kotman who informed Vienna that the hemp succeeds well on the territory of the new colonist settlements. He gathered the hemp producers, he provided them with work means and obliged to purchase from them 5000 cubits of fabric annually. The production got more massive and Odžaci became one of the biggest centers for hemp production in Europe. In 1779 hemp fair was held for the first time and eventually became more significant. In 1907 a factory for cultivation of hemp and production of ropes was open by the members of a wealthy family Ertl (Franc and Johan) by the example of a similar factory in Segedin. The factory had initial 200 workers but it advanced rapidly and in 1929 reached a number of 800 employed. Eventually the production expanded so besides ropes they produced: carpets, and since 1933 wool and silk fabric.\n\nParagraph 10: Viki developed heart trouble and was saved by a heart transplant from her comatose husband, Ben. One of the most appreciated storylines of the second Malone/Griffith era was Marcie Walsh (Kathy Brier)'s struggle with her self-esteem and her love story with Al Holden (Nathaniel Marston). Inexplicably, Marston was fired, while Al was killed off despite the couple's immense popularity. But a write-in campaign led by Marcal fans convinced ABC to rehire Marston, in spite of his character having died on screen. Al's spirit took over Michael McBain's body, causing the ghost to lose all memories as Al, and court Marcie and Michael. Brooding actor Michael Easton (who had a following as Stephen Clay/Caleb Morley, a singing vampire, on Port Charles) was hired as Michael's cop brother, John McBain. John was introduced as a pool tournament organizer who recruited Natalie for her pool skills. Natalie and John had an instant connection and attraction to each other but Natalie was engaged to Cristian.   Unknown to her and Cristian, John was an undercover FBI agent working on a bust to trap Walker Flynn, Mitch Lawrence's brother who had been paid by Todd to use his face as a cover.  After Natalie and Cristian wed, they flew to Las Vegas for a high-stakes pool competition against the Black Widow.  Antonio, who learned of John's identity at Cristian's bachelor party, joined them in Las Vegas along with Jessica.  John told Natalie to lose on purpose or he would kill her and Cristian.  When Natalie learned that both Cristian and Roxy bet their life savings on her, she won the tournament.  Chaos erupted eventually leading to Cristian Vega's death only a day after he married Natalie.  In her grief, Natalie lashed out at John who made it his mission to make it up to her. John was reassigned to the Music Box Killer case in New Jersey but remained in Llanview when the serial killer killed a local Private Investigator, Alyssa Collins.  John worked alongside Bo and Antonio on the case, forming a friendship with both. Eventually, Natalie's heart softened toward John and they began a close friendship.  Al's mother, Gabrielle, was murdered by the Music Box Killer, and Al's father, Max, left town, thus removing the Holden family from the canvas. Next came the saga of the Santi mobster family, to whom Antonio learned he was related. To the detriment of ratings (which fell to an all-time low in the summer of 2004), much of the action revolved around new characters: Antonio's brother Tico (who married Jessica Buchanan), stepsister Sonia, and mother Angelina.\n\nParagraph 11: James Hervey Otey was born January 27, 1800, on a plantation near Fancy Farm in Bedford County, Virginia to Major Isaac Otey and Elizabeth Mathews. His paternal grandfather, Capt. John Armistead Otey, had served in the American Revolutionary War. Major Otey farmed using enslaved labor as well as represented Bedford County in the Virginia House of Delegates (part-time) for many terms beginning (1798-1804, 1805–1812), before attaining his military rank in the War of 1812. In 1807, Major Isaac Otey purchased Fancy Farm (including a distillery and grist mill) from the estate of Andrew Donald, a Scottish merchant who had built that plantation but died before his sons reached legal age. Major Otey or his heir of the same name also served as executor of the will of Thomas Dillard, who owned Fancy Farm 1817–1820. His son Isaac Otey Jr. would also operate plantations and serve five terms in the Virginia House of Delegates representing Bedford County. Isaac Otey purchased Mount Prospect plantation and other properties on the Otter River (altogether about 3000 acres) in 1818, then sold 1540 acres to his son John M. Otey in 1820 James Otey was among the youngest of his father's twelve children, and received a private education at the New London Academy at the county seat (then called Liberty, Virginia, now Bedford), before attending the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. In addition to receiving an A.B. and B.D., Otey was named a Bachelor of Belles Lettres\".", "answers": ["Paragraph 2"], "length": 3113, "dataset": "passage_retrieval_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "1871d3f08523229c63046369c673822eeaa03b218dc7fee3"}
{"input": "During the battle, two PVA battalions successfully attacked a portion of the trenchline defended by Company G, 3/1 Marines at Boulder City. The PVA then targeted the Berlin and East Berlin gates, cutting off the Marines' supply and reinforcement routes. Cloud cover hindered aerial support for the Marines defending the gates, allowing the PVA to gain control of the Berlin gate and launch a second assault on the Boulder City perimeter. The remaining Marines engaged in intense hand-to-hand combat, with dwindling ammunition and increasing casualties. Company I, 3/1 Marines, attempted to reinforce the survivors but suffered heavy casualties due to intercepted radio messages. However, some of the reinforcements managed to reach Boulder City and participate in a successful counterattack. Additional reinforcements arrived later to consolidate the position. Despite this, a few PVA troops remained on the slopes nearest the Marine Line of Resistance (MLR). The PVA launched another attack on Boulder City, but Marine mortars, artillery, tanks, and aircraft were instrumental in repelling the assault. The tanks proved effective against the PVA troops, but they also attracted enemy artillery and mortar fire. F9F jets provided air support, conducting multiple missions against PVA positions threatening Boulder City and neighboring strongpoints.", "context": "Paragraph 1: Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly graded the film with a B. Schwarzbaum praised the movie for its appeal to both adult and child audiences, \"juxtaposing the blithely self-absorbed parallel universes of small, diapered children and their large, Dockered parents\". However, other Entertainment Weekly reviewer Ty Burr gave The Rugrats Movie a B−, criticizing that the film's issues sprung from it being \"bigger\" than the original series, thus it having more cultural references, out-of-place CGI scenes, and \"[going] into scary territory\". Burr did praise the \"escaped circus monkeys\" for being \"scary in a good way\", as well as a joke that was accessible to younger audiences.Rugrats co-creator and co-writer Paul Germain (who, along with the other original writers, left the series in 1993) has stated that he disliked the film's story. Germain felt that the film's writers did not understand what the series was about, and thought that the scene in which Stu gives a watch to Tommy did not work as the adults were not supposed to recognize the babies' intelligence. In addition, he felt that by giving Tommy a baby brother, Tommy was no longer the baby, which changed the story of the series from what Germain intended it to be.\n\nParagraph 2: In the first case with allegations of police collusion, a former Gangnam police officer surnamed Kang, age 44, was sentenced to one year in prison on August 14. During the trial co-CEO Lee Sung-hyun testified that he paid 20 million won (US$17,000) to Kang to cover for an underage clubgoer incident at the Burning Sun and had not discussed the arrangements with Seungri. In drug related cases, on August 22, co-CEO Lee Moon-ho received a suspended sentence of three years probation and community service for a year and a half prison term in a habitual drug use case where he pled guilty, but at a second trial on November 28, was sentenced to one year in prison with charges of using more than 10 drugs, including ecstasy and ketamine in Gangnam clubs from 2018 through February 2019. The court said that Lee Moon-ho's position as the operator of the Burning Sun Club put him at a different level than an \"ordinary drug offender\" and his first sentencing had been \"light and unfair\". A senior SMPA official, Yoon Gyu-geun, age 49, referred to as the \"police chief\" in the chatrooms, was arrested on October 10, on charges of accepting bribes and misuse of power, among others, following a search at his office in September. Yoon was referred for prosecution in June for allegedly informing Seungri and Yoo In-seok of police crackdowns, but the late search and focus on Yoon was questioned by a The Korea Times report by Lee Suh-yoon as possibly being related to his having worked in the Blue House in 2017 under Justice Minister Cho Kuk, who was being investigated in a separate case. A businessman named Jeong, a possible link between Yoon and Yoo was arrested earlier on embezzlement charges. Yoon was indicted on October 29, on charges of bribery, obstruction of business, and concealing evidence, among others, related to allegations of attempting to cover up illegalities at the Burning Sun and other businesses run by Seungri and Yoo. Yoon was also alleged to have received unlisted stocks from businessman Jeong in relation to the case; while Jeong is suspected of being tied to illicit financial transactions in the separate case against ex-Justice Minister Cho. A Burning Sun employee, an MD named Cho, age 28, one of the first investigated in the club's scandal, was sentenced to four years and six months imprisonment in early December for smuggling and administering drugs.\n\nParagraph 3: Before 2002, PHS occupied a small plot of land located across the road from the Yio Chu Kang MRT station, and shared a field with the neighbouring Li Hua Primary School and Ang Mo Kio North Primary School, even though PHS herself shared no affiliations with either of these. Today, the school stands on 3 hectares of land and is home to over 1,400 students and staff. The new school includes a hall that can accommodate the entire school population, well-equipped computer laboratories and IT-enabled classrooms, an Indoor Sports Stadium consisting of three levels of facilities such as a basketball court, a volleyball court and various rooms for CCAs(co-curriculum activities) such as the Drama Room, the Band Room and a Music Room for students studying the subject, as well as the National Education Stairwell and the Olive Garden.\n\nParagraph 4: On July 1, 1902, when the town lots in the new railway were to be auctioned outside the promoter's office, an argument broke out between John Brooks, son of Willis, and Lon Riddle, son of McFarland ally George Riddle. Brooks threatened Riddle with his six-shooter and was disarmed by camp manager G.G. Tyson. Brooks then  began hitting Riddle with brass knuckles and knocked him to the ground, so Tyson intervened again to take the weapon away. However, before the fight resumed, John's uncle, Sam Baker, armed himself with his rifle and pointed it at Riddle. Hill, who was standing nearby, pushed Baker's rifle barrel toward the ground and said: \"Don't act a fool.\" Baker then released his hold on the rifle, drew his revolver, and pointed it at Hill's face. Rutherford then armed himself and pointed his weapon at Sam while the latter's sixteen-year-old son, Bill, grabbed his rifle and pointed at Rutherford. The situation was very tense for a moment, but the \"cool headed\" Cliff Speer managed to diffuse it by slowly lowering Rutherford's rifle barrel and allowing Sam a chance to leave. When Sam was out of firing range, Bill lowered his weapon as well and they both left to tell Willis. Jesse Hill said the following about that day: \"It was the first and only time I ever looked down a gun barrel.... Willis Brooks and his cohorts, each mounted and armed, rode up to do battle.... Unless something was done to stay the upcoming disaster, potential buyers would not become lot-owners. To my surprise, Rutherford entered the scene. Rutherford addressed the leader of each side in turn, at times bombastically belligerent, at times profanely pacific, but at all times profusely perspiring. He talked the two sides out of battle, but all of this had a bad effect on the crowd.\" In spite of the interruption, Rutherford and Hill managed to make $14,000, and more over the next few days. After the sale, the new land owners began building houses and businesses, but the town \"refused to boom\" because of the feud. Although Spokogee quickly grew to support a population of 150 people, Hill described them as nervous, especially when the McFarland or the Brooks families rode in heavily armed. Hill eventually left town because of the stress, some of which was brought about by George Riddle, who had a bad habit of pulling his gun on anyone over any kind of altercation.\n\nParagraph 5: In 1923, Lascorz issued a manifesto to the Greek people, proclaiming himself \"Prince Eugene Lascaris Comnenus, heir to the Emperors of Byzantium and Pretender to the Throne of Greece\". Lascorz believed that his supposed Byzantine ancestry went well with Greek dreams of past glories such as the Megali Idea. The Greek monarchy was abolished in 1924 in favour of the Second Hellenic Republic. The abdication of George II of Greece saw the momentary end of the rule of the House of Glücksburg over Greece. Lascorz took advantage of this interregnum to try to push his claim to the Greek throne, writing to various influential Greek figures. According to Lascorz, he had already received the blessing of the Patriarch of Constantinople, Meletius IV, in 1922, and in 1927 Lascorz and his oldest son Teodoro were supposedly granted some honours by the Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem, Damian I. The Láscaris family archives contain documents which they claim were sent in the early 1920s by Eleftherios Venizelos, the former prime minister of Greece, during his self-exile in Paris, supposedly seriously considering Lascorz as a candidate for the Greek throne. According to contemporary newspapers and radio broadcasts in Spain, several Greek deputies had expressed interest in offering the Greek crown to Lascorz. That nothing came of Lascorz's candidacy for the Greek throne, even after Venizelos became prime minister again in 1928, is explained away by Lascorz' modern descendants as being due to economic crisis and political instability plaguing the country and any potential plans for making Lascorz king being forgotten.\n\nParagraph 6: A precursor to the present cathedral was built in 1250, and was replaced with a stone church in 1333 by Grand Duke Ivan Kalita, who would later become the first Russian monarch to be buried in the church.  In 1505, Grand Duke Ivan III, already in the midst of major renovation project for the Kremlin, turned his attention to the church, as in the case of the rebuilding of the Assumption Cathedral two decades earlier, turned to architects from Italy for assistance.  An Italian, Lamberti Aloisio da Mantagnana (Aloisio the New) was invited to Moscow, and ground was broken for a new cathedral on 21 May 1505. Ivan died in the autumn of the same year, and was buried in the still unfinished building. Work on the cathedral was completed by the end of 1508, but it was not formally consecrated until 8 November 1509.\n\nParagraph 7: Linney was born in Philadelphia, the son of Maitland (née Thompson) Linney and physician Romulus Zachariah Linney III. His great-grandfather was Romulus Zachariah Linney, a prominent North Carolinian who served in the American Civil War and as a U.S. Congressman. Linney grew up in the town of Madison, Tennessee where his father was a regular M.D. He also lived with his extended family for a few years during the Great Depression in the Linney/Coffey homestead in Boone, North Carolina and returned to the homestead to visit his favorite cousins, the Coffeys, throughout his life. Linney recalled that his mother \"was a very good amateur actress\" and when she starred in the Nashville Community Theatre's 1940 production of Our Town as Mrs. Gibbs, he was deeply moved by her performance, particularly by her character's death. \"I became really connected to my mother and it was the first time I was really shattered by a play. And in many ways that was the beginning. It, in a very visceral way, showed me the profound impact theater can have... Music might give you exultation or something else equally profound, but theater at a great stroke can just shatter you, can break you.\" Linney's father died of throat cancer when Linney was 13 years old. Linney said about his father's death, \"I've never gotten over it. My father was a very good man...I think his death is in everything I do. All other experiences in life pall beside the death of a parent you dearly love, when you have to deal with that as a child. No religion can console you for it. Nothing can.\" After his father's death, Linney and his mother moved to Washington, D.C., where he attended middle school and high school.\n\nParagraph 8: The regiment moved to Louisville, Kentucky, February 28, 1863; then to Glasgow, Kentucky, March 4-11.

On March 24, 2021, WWE announced that it would move its ThunderDome residency—a bio-secure bubble used to film the company's weekly programs Raw, SmackDown, and Main Event, as well as those shows' associated pay-per-views, due to the COVID-19 pandemic—to Yuengling Center beginning with the April 12 episode of Raw, following WrestleMania 37 (which was held at Tampa's Raymond James Stadium). The ThunderDome was relocated from Tropicana Field due to the start of the Tampa Bay Rays' 2021 season; as before, programs produced at the arena were held behind closed doors with no in-person audience. During their residency at the Yuengling Center, WWE held two pay-per-view events, WrestleMania Backlash and Hell in a Cell. WWE resumed live touring on July 16, thus ending the ThunderDome productions. The company finished tapings at the Yuengling Center on July 9; the final show to air featuring the ThunderDome at the Yuengling Center was the July 15 episode of Main Event.\n\nParagraph 10: Time Out critic stated: \"Shamelessly ripping off plot ideas and entire sequences from Tango & Cash, Lethal Weapon, The Fast and Furious, Ocean's Eleven and Thelma and Louise, this energetic and surprisingly enjoyable nonsense zooms along at full-throttle, braking only for the peppy songs\". Rating 3 out of 5, David Parkinson from Radio Times called it a \"slick and stylish Indian drama\" and wrote: \"Style unashamedly triumphs over substance throughout, but the story rattles along and the set pieces are very slickly staged ... this rousing adventure owes as much to Hollywood and Hong Kong as it does to the crime classics of the 1970s\". Omar Ahmed from Empire rated 2 in 5 and said that \"Clearly regarding itself as Bollywood's answer to The Fast and The Furious, director Gadhvi's latest marks a departure for studio Yash Raj Films. Sadly, it's not the good kind of departure, with the studio abandoning its usually innovative approach and replacing it with an anxious attempt to blind its audience with style ... Another film that falls into the classic trap of trying to beat Hollywood at its own game instead of focusing on its primary strength – cultural uniqueness\", but opined that the actors' performances are remarkable.\n\nParagraph 11: The two PVA battalions attacking on the Marine right had their greatest success at Boulder City, seizing a portion of the trenchline defended by Company G, 3/1 Marines. In an attempt to exploit this foothold, the PVA attacked the Berlin and East Berlin gates, passages through the wire that the Marines had used to supply and reinforce the two outposts before both were overwhelmed. Cloud cover prevented aerial observers from supporting the troops protecting the gates, and the PVA managed to gain control of Berlin gate and mount a second determined assault on the Boulder City perimeter. Hand-to-hand fighting raged all along the  of trench that Lieutenant Swigart's Marines still held. The company's ammunition ran low, and the plight of casualties became increasingly difficult as PVA fire killed two of Boulder City's eight corpsmen and wounded most of the others. By midnight, Swigart's company could muster no more than half its earlier strength, but it still clung to the rear slope of Boulder City. Casualties had further eroded the strength of the Boulder City garrison, when at 00:15 on the 25th, Company I, 3/1 Marines, moved toward the hill to reinforce Swigart's survivors. The PVA intercepted and correctly interpreted the coded radio message ordering the Company I Marines forward, thus obtaining information that enabled their artillery and mortars to wound or kill about a third of the reinforcements. Despite the deadly barrage, much of Company I reached Boulder City, joined forces with the remnants of Swigart's garrison, and took part in a counterattack that recaptured the hill by 03:30. Further reinforcements from Company E, 2/7 Marines, and Company E, 2/1 Marines, arrived by 05:30 to consolidate the position. A few PVA, however, continued to cling to positions on the slopes nearest the MLR. Since the PVA still controlled the approaches to Boulder City, they were able to mount another attack on that position at 08:20, 25 July. Fire from Marine mortars and artillery, and from the 90mm weapons of 10 tanks dug in on the Marine positions, played the key role in breaking up the new assault, although the last of the attackers did not withdraw until afternoon. The M-46 tanks proved deadly against advancing PVA troops, but also presented an inviting target for PVA artillery and mortar crews, who directed some 2,200 rounds at the armored vehicles. Aircraft also helped repulse the 25 July attack on Boulder City, as when F9F jets flew nine missions, guided by ground radar, against positions threatening Boulder City and nearby defensive strongpoints.\n\nParagraph 12: The censorship of books was actually very ineffective, and prohibited books circulated in Spain without significant problems. The Spanish Inquisition never persecuted scientists, and relatively few scientific books were placed on the Index. On the other hand, Spain was a state with more political freedom than in other absolute monarchies in the 16th to 18th centuries. The apparent paradox gets explained by both the hermeticist religious ideas of the Spanish church and monarchy, and the budding seed of what would become Enlightened absolutism taking shape in Spain. The list of banned books was not, as interpreted sometimes, a list of evil books but a list of books that lay people were very likely to misinterpret. The presence of highly symbolical and high-quality literature on the list was so explained. These metaphorical or parable sounding books were listed as not meant for free circulation, but there might be no objections to the book itself and the circulation among scholars was mostly free. Most of these books were carefully collected by the elite. The practical totality of the prohibited books can be found now as then in the library of the monasterio del Escorial, carefully collected by Philip II and Philip III. The collection was \"public\" after Philip II's death and members of universities, intellectuals, courtesans, clergy, and certain branches of the nobility didn't have too many problems to access them and commission authorised copies. The Inquisition has not been known to make any serious attempt to stop this for all the books, but there are some records of them \"suggesting\" the King of Spain to stop collecting grimoires or magic-related ones. This attitude was also not new. Translations of the Bible to Castillian and Provenzal (Catalan) had been made and allowed in Spain since the Middle Ages. The first preserved copy dates from the 13th century. Like the bible of Cisneros they were mostly for scholarly use, and it was customary for laymen to ask religious or academic authorities to review the translation and supervise the use.", "answers": ["Paragraph 11"], "length": 3720, "dataset": "passage_retrieval_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "031a0eeb0ec2beb89d7262db6ed715ffea285eec518f8a8d"}
{"input": "The text discusses the career of a performer named Reed, who began his career in the late 1940s. He joined the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company in 1951 and spent eight years as an understudy before becoming the principal comedian in 1959. Reed played various famous comedic roles in Gilbert and Sullivan operas, showcasing his fleet-footed clowning, dry wit, impeccable timing, clear diction, and amusing character voices. He recorded all of his principal roles with the company.", "context": "Paragraph 1: On Wednesday, November 14, Darrell Cain gave his testimony in his own defense. Cain claimed that he and Arnold found the Rodriguez brothers in their bed, and that they looked sweaty. Arnold told Cain that the brothers were the ones he saw running from the gas station. Cain and Arnold put the boys in handcuffs behind their backs and took them to a parking lot behind the burglarized gas station. Cain recalled that he and Arnold met officers Foster and McKee and that Arnold claimed there may have been a third burglar. According to Cain, when Arnold asked Santos if the boys had another brother, Santos affirmed that they did but that he did not know where his other brother was. Cain told Arnold that he would \"make him [Santos] tell the truth\", and took his pistol between his legs, emptied it, and visually checked that there were no bullets in the gun before closing the gun's chamber. Cain then pointed the gun at Santos and pulled the trigger, making a clicking sound. He warned Santos to tell the truth, and that there was a bullet in the gun. The second time Cain pulled the trigger, a shot fired, killing Santos. Cain described how he grabbed the bullets from his lap, jumped from the car, and put the bullets back into the gun while he was out of the vehicle. Cain said he was in shock and hysterical, and that he cried over what had happened. Mulder cross-examined Cain and asked if it was within normal police procedure to interrogate a young boy using a gun. Cain responded that it was not. Mulder asked Cain what made him set himself up as a judge of truth, and Cain responded that he did not know. Mulder had Cain reenact the incident in front of the jury. In response to Cain's previous claims that he had pressed his gun's ejector rod to empty it of bullets, Mulder demonstrated that the bullets would fall out of the gun if it were merely tilted. Mulder loaded and unloaded the gun by turning the cylinder upside down several times. Mulder questioned Cain about his claim that he reloaded the pistol, stating that Foster claimed he did not see Cain reload his gun outside of the car. Cain responded that he did indeed reload his gun, but that in the confusion nobody saw him. Mulder asked Cain what Santos' last words were, and Cain responded that they were \"I am telling the truth.\"\n\nParagraph 2: Pittas started playing football as an amateur at GS Patision in 1974. He won the local championship and he also became an international with the youth team in 1976. Two years later he moved to Korinthos, where he played for three seasons and  in 1979 he won the second division at their group, as well as the promotion to the first division. In 1981 he moved to Ethnikos Piraeus, where he played for four seasons and his performances attracted the interest of the big clubs. In 1985, Pittas was transferred to the PAOK and played at the club of Thessaloniki until December 1986. In December of 1986, Pittas moved to AEK Athens and performed quite well, helping the team with his good technique and strong shot. On 24 January 1988, in a match against PAOK and while the score was at 0–0, at the 30th minute AEK won an indirect foul from quite a long distance and Pittas had not seen the gesture of the referee for an indirect foul, he executed directly with the ball hitting the goalkeeper's hand and ending up in the net. If the goalkeeper had let the ball go straight to the net, the goal would not count. PAOK objected, asking for the replay of the match but,  the objection fell on deaf ears. As he revealed, when the players and the referee were returning after the goal for the continuation of the match, the referee angrily addressed him and asking him if he was trying to end his refereeing career. On 7 September 1988, he scored the winner with a header against Athletic Bilbao for the UEFA Cup. He distinguished himself quite a bit in the yellow-blacks, actively participating in winning the league in 1989. An interesting story of that time is that he won a bet of 500,000 drachmas from his teammate Stelios Manolas, betting that AEK would win the championship in the end of the season, where Manolas did not expect that AEK would succeed and naturally lost the bet. He left AEK in 1989 in a bad way, having complaints mainly from the president of the club, Stratos Gidopoulos, as well as the manager, Dušan Bajević, since his contract was not renewed and at the same time the management owed him money, making an appeal and staying out of matches for a long time. He then played for 3 seasons in the second division with E.A. Rethymniakou, before ending his career in 1992.\n\nParagraph 3: A waffle iron or waffle maker is a kitchen utensil used to cook waffles between two hinged metal plates. Both plates have gridded indentations to shape the waffle from the batter or dough placed between them. The plates are heated and the iron is closed while the waffle bakes. Waffles are a dessert with a light and sweet flavor, similar to pancakes. Their appearance is much harder to achieve than a pancake's without a waffle iron. Similar technology is employed to bake wafers, and several other snacks including , a waffle-shaped but crunchy Indonesian snack which can be made with both sweet and savoury flavours.\n\nParagraph 4: At the start of the novel, Manette has been recently released from the Bastille after a long imprisonment. He is briefly given shelter in Paris by his former servant Ernest Defarge (who will subsequently be a leader of the storming of the Bastille) and is then reunited with his daughter Lucie. He does nothing but make shoes, a pastime that he adopted to distract himself from the tortures of prison. He is clearly not in his mind during this time; he speaks only when necessary, and has become so used to being a prisoner that he can hardly bear light or freedom. As he overcomes his past as a prisoner, due to his daughter's love and devotion to him, however, he resumes his occupation as a physician in England, and proves to be a kind, loving father who prizes his daughter’s happiness above all things. He even blesses her marriage to Charles Darnay; the son of the aristocrat who was responsible for his imprisonment (Darnay has completely renounced his family's ill-gotten fortune and is a good fellow, unaware of the harm that his father once inflicted on his current father-in-law). When Charles Darnay is arrested in France during the French Revolution, Manette is his witness that he is innocent. Unfortunately, Darnay is arrested again, due to a diary that Manette wrote when he was in jail, which sends Darnay back to prison. Darnay is condemned for his uncle's sins, but Sydney Carton (out of love for Lucie Manette), disguises himself as Charles and takes his place in the guillotine and dies for him.\n\nParagraph 5: The son of a butcher from County Durham, Reed began performing at the end of World War II, joining the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company in 1951.  After eight years as understudy to Peter Pratt, he became the principal comedian of the company in 1959, remaining for two decades, playing all the famous Gilbert and Sullivan patter roles, including Sir Joseph in H.M.S. Pinafore, the Major-General in The Pirates of Penzance, Bunthorne in Patience, the Lord Chancellor in Iolanthe, Ko-Ko in The Mikado, Jack Point in The Yeomen of the Guard and the Duke of Plaza-Toro in The Gondoliers, among others.  He was known for his \"fleet-footed clowning\", dry and roguish wit, comic timing, \"crystal clear diction\" in the patter songs, and his amusing character voice, recording all of his principal roles with the company.\n\nParagraph 6: BP Canada was a Canadian petroleum company and subsidiary of British Petroleum that existed between 1955 and 1992. The name refers to a group of companies that engaged in various segments of the petroleum industry lifecycle. BP entered the Canadian market in October 1953 when it purchased a 23 percent stake in the Triad Oil Company. In 1955, BP formed a Canadian subsidiary, based in Montreal, called BP Canada Limited. The company began acquiring retail stations in Ontario and Quebec and in 1957 started construction on a refinery in Montreal. By the end of the 1950s BP Canada was a fully-integrated operation. In 1964 it acquired from Cities Service the Oakville Refinery, and then expanded its operations significantly in 1971 when it acquired Supertest Petroleum.\n\nParagraph 7: This species of lizard has a distinctive flat body with one row of fringe scales down the sides. They are a medium sized lizard and can grow up to approximately 3.75 inches or 95mm in size. They have one row of slightly enlarged scales on each side of the throat. Colours can vary and generally blend in with the color of the surrounding soil, but they usually have a beige, tan, or reddish dorsum with contrasting, wavy blotches of darker color. They have two dark blotches on the neck that are very prominent and are bordered posteriorly by a light white or grey color. They also have scattered pointed scales and other irregular dark blotches along the dorsum of their body. Unlike other horned lizards, Phrynosoma platyrhinos individuals do not have a prominent dorsal stripe. Their dorsal stripe can appear faintly or be entirely absent depending on the individual. They also have pointed scales on the dorsum (back) of the body. Juveniles are similar to adults, but have shorter and less-pronounced cranial spines. Desert horned lizards have horns that  are wide at the base, which isn't true for their congener, the short-horned lizard.\n\nParagraph 8: The idea of having the oil company negotiate directly with the interior of Oman was not favored by the British Political Agent who resided in Muscat providing the justification that it would mean recognizing the authority of the Imamate and it would increase its prestige- which would not favor IPC deal. The British Political Agent believed that the only method of granting the oil company access to the interior was by assisting the sultan in occupying the Imamate. The position of the British government was thereafter to eliminate any possibility of entering into direct relations with the interior in order not to alienate the sultan and to avoid invalidating the claim of IPC that its concession from the sultan covers the entirety of Oman. In 1946, the British government provided arms and ammunition, auxiliary supplies and officers to occupy the interior.  In September 1946, the British government studied the proposal that was promised to the sultan of using the British Royal Air Force (RAF) to occupy the interior. The British government concluded that it is reluctant \"in principle\" to the use of force for the reason of avoiding international criticism that may lead to the calling of the British government before the United Nations Security Council but they executed anyway waging war for over 5 years between the two Head of Estate on the battle ground Jabel Akhdar (The Green Mountain) with over 2,000 martyrs losing their lives. Meanwhile, the British government recognized that the use of RAF would expedite oil exploration operations in the interior of Oman.\n\nParagraph 9: Weddell seals measure about  long and weigh . They are amongst the largest seals, with a rather bulky body and short fore flippers relative to their body length. Males weigh less than females, usually about  or less. Male and female Weddell seals are generally about the same length, though females can be slightly larger. However, the male seal tends to have a thicker neck and a broader head and muzzle than the female. A molecular genetic-based technique has been established to confirm the sex of individuals in the laboratory. The Weddell seal face has been compared to that of a cat due to a short mouth line and similarities in the structure of the nose and whiskers.\n\nParagraph 10: From Centreville, the Mid-Shore Section of the Chesapeake Country Scenic Byway continues on MD 213, with a spur along US 50 providing access to the Wye Mills Natural Resource Management Area. The byway heads into Wye Mills and heads south on MD 662, passing by the site of Wye Oak, which was the largest white oak tree in the United States until it was destroyed during a storm in 2002. The byway continues along MD 662 before picking up US 50 and coming to Easton, a historical town which is home to the Avalon Theatre and the Academy Art Museum. From Easton, a branch of the Chesapeake Country Scenic Byway heads west on MD 33 to St. Michaels, a shipbuilding town that is home to the Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum, before heading to Tilghman Island, where several restaurants and marinas. The byway heads back along MD 33 before heading onto MD 329 and crossing the Tred Avon River on the Oxford–Bellevue Ferry, one of the oldest ferries in the country, to Oxford, a maritime town home to the Oxford Museum and the Oxford Customs House. From here, the Chesapeake Country Scenic Byway follows MD 333 back to Easton, at which point it heads east along MD 331, crossing the Choptank River on the Dover Bridge. The byway continues to Preston, following MD 16 south to East New Market, a Native American trading post that became a center of Methodism. The Chesapeake Country Scenic Byway follows MD 14 through the fishing community of Secretary before running along MD 16 to Cambridge, which has sites related to the Underground Railroad and Harriet Tubman as well as the Richardson Maritime Museum and Boatworks. The byway continues along MD 343 to Hudson, where the Sharps Island Light can be seen, before heading back to Cambridge. At this point, a branch of the byway heads south along MD 341 and Maple Dam Road into the Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge, which is home to the largest amount of bald eagles on the East Coast. Another branch of the byway continues south along MD 335, passing to the west of the Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge before reaching Hooper's Island. Another branch of the Chesapeake Country Scenic Byway known as the Elliott's Island Branch splits to the east and passes through the Fishing Bay Wildlife Management Area. From here, the byway heads north along the Nanticoke River to Vienna and Eldorado. The byway continues north to Federalsburg, where the Idylwild Wildlife Management Area is located.\n\nParagraph 11: In 1915, ownership of the newly created land became an issue in a lawsuit. The boundary of the District of Columbia had been set by the Black-Jenkins Award, a decision by an arbitration panel in 1874 which resolved centuries of dispute by placing Virginia's boundary with Maryland at the low-water mark on the Virginia side of the Potomac River. The Virginia retrocession of 1846-1847 returned a portion of the District of Columbia on the Virginia site of the Potomac River to the state of Virginia. This left in doubt the exact position of the District's border with Virginia. In Morris v. United States, 174 U.S. 196 (1899), the Supreme Court of the United States held that land built in the Potomac River not only belonged to the District of Columbia but to the federal government (contrary to the claims of private landowners, who believed the property belonged to them). In Maryland v. West Virginia, 217 U. S. 1 (1910), the U.S. Supreme Court again affirmed that Maryland's southern border extended to the low-water mark on the far side of the Potomac River. The issue arose again in 1915, when the Washington Steel & Ordnance Company claimed it owned the newly created land in the Anacostia River created by the dredging operation. The District of Columbia Supreme Court held on December 29, 1915, that the federal government held title to the land. But this decision was overturned on technical grounds by the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia in Washington Steel & Ordnance Company v. Martin, 45 App. 600 (1917). Nonetheless, in dicta in Washington Steel & Ordnance Company, the court of appeals made note of the Supreme Court's ruling in Morris v. United States and held that the reclaimed land belonged to the federal government. The issue as to who owned the dredged land and islands seemed settled.\n\nParagraph 12: There were no churches in the area until the end of the 16th century. The church consisted of a very basic chapel, without communion. It was a favoured hotbed of the north-east Cheshire Non-conformist movement. After the Restoration in 1662, it was forbidden for ministers to preach without the Book of Common Prayer. The minister of Norbury Chapel, John Jolie, went to preach, but found that the door was locked. He and his followers broke down the door and he preached as usual. Subsequently, he was tried for Non-conformity, but it was decided that Norbury Chapel was not a consecrated place. In 1750, John Wesley preached in Bullock Smithy describing it as \"... one of the most famous villages in the county for all manner of wickedness.\"\n\nParagraph 13: Pedrosa made the move to 990cc MotoGP bikes in , riding for Repsol Honda. Critics said that Pedrosa's tiny stature was not strong enough to handle a big, heavy MotoGP bike and successfully race in the premier class. Proving critics wrong, he finished second in the opening round at Jerez on 26 March 2006. At his fourth ever MotoGP appearance, on 14 May 2006, during the Chinese Grand Prix, he won his first race. This win made him the equal 2nd youngest winner (tied with Norick Abe) in the premier class at the time, behind Freddie Spencer. He won his second MotoGP race at Donington Park and became a strong candidate for the MotoGP Championship. It was a memorable victory for Pedrosa, who shared the podium for the first time with Valentino Rossi in 2nd place. He also took two pole positions in the first half of the season. Until the Malaysian Grand Prix at Sepang, Pedrosa was 2nd in the Championship only behind his more experienced teammate Nicky Hayden. However, he fell heavily during free practice and suffered a severe gash to the knee, which practically rendered him immobile. Pedrosa qualified 5th on the grid in that race after heavy rain cancelled the qualifying session. He managed to finish 3rd in the race, behind Rossi and Ducati rider Loris Capirossi.\n\nParagraph 14: Quashaamit lived near Great Blue Hill and was a resident of Ponkapoag, a Praying town, which was founded in 1657 after the Indians were removed from their traditional lands on the Neponset River near what is now the Neponset River Reservation. Quashaamit (William Awinian) served as an Indian preacher in Ponkapoag from 1656 until his death sometime between 1670 and 1672. Quashaamit was acquainted with Rev. John Eliot who translated the first Bible into a Native American language, and in 1662 Eliot helped Quashaamit and other Ponkapoag Indians deed land to settlers, in what is now Mendon, Massachusetts and Milford, Massachusetts and to reserve their traditional hunting and fishing rights in the area. In 1659, Quashaamit went to Providence to assert his right to land in what is now northern Rhode Island, and the town agreed to investigate his claim with the Indians in the area, and in 1661-62 his rights to northern Rhode Island were referenced in a deed by Alexander (Wamsutta), recorded in Providence. On \"August 5, 1665, in a deed to the town of Braintree [(Quincy)] made by Wampatuck alias Josiah, Chief Sachem of the Massachusetts Indians, [w]ith the consent of his wise men, [Quashaamit] is called William Mananiomott in the body of the instrument, but his signature is William Manunion, and Joseph Manunion was a witness.\" In 1666 Quashaamit deeded land to Edward Inman and John Mowry in and around what is now North Smithfield, Rhode Island, and Quashaamit signed his name \"William Minnian\" which \"suggests, the English were well established in the region.\" Inman purchased further land from William Minnian in 1669 which was also confirmed by King Philip (Metacomet) who also refers to William's uncle, Jeffrey, but the deeds were disputed by the town of Providence for several years thereafter because the town already claimed exclusive possession of those lands as previously granted by Canonicus.  Daniel Gookin wrote in 1674 that \"William Awinian...was a knowing person, and of great ability, and of genteel deportment, and spoke very good English. His death was a very great rebuke to this place,\" and he was \"a very able teacher who died about three years since.\" Upon his death John Eliot stated that \"Their late Teacher, William, is deceased; He was a man of eminent parts; all the English acknowledge him, and he was known to many. He was of ready wit, sound judgment, and affable. He has gone into the Lord.\"", "answers": ["Paragraph 5"], "length": 3609, "dataset": "passage_retrieval_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "8d095b9848f32168203471bf49153f48102b017e10abc3c5"}

The Trochelmann’s alleged that the rock had been brought from the moon by Apollo 12 astronaut Alan Bean and given to John Glenn. They claimed Glenn, the first American to orbit Earth and later a U.S. senator, had given the rock to their father in recognition of his supposed invention.\" ...\" The brothers had negotiated a consignment agreement with Phillips Son & Neale, a Manhattan auction house, to sell the rock in December 1995. However, before the auction took place, the rock was confiscated by FBI agents in December 1995 prior to the scheduled auction.\" This story first broke in a New York Times Article written by Lawrence Van Gelder on December 2, 1995. At that time NASA expressed the belief that the Moon rock might have been real as it matched the general description of a Moon rock that was stolen in 1970. \"Eileen Hawley, a spokeswoman for NASA, said of the sample offered through Phillips & Neale: We have a rock that is classified as lost, an Apollo 12 lunar sample of approximately the same weight. With that information, we need to look at this—that this might be a true lunar sample. Ms. Hawley said a rock sample collected during the Apollo 12 mission had been part of a shipment of registered and certified mail that was stolen while en route to a researcher at the University of California in Los Angeles in 1970. The space agency received a call on Thursday from the Postal Investigative Service in New York, she said, after articles about the impending auction had been published. The service passed along a tip from the retired inspector, who was not identified, about a possible connection between the theft and the rock to be auctioned.\"  This scheme and schemes like it were the inspiration for the undercover sting operation known as Operation Lunar Eclipse, which resulted in the acquisition of the Honduras Goodwill Moon Rock in December 1998.\n\nParagraph 3: In 2004, Rubin, who had become the company's president, left the company to work on a new project, Iron and the Maiden. In addition to their inhouse game team, Naughty Dog is also home to the ICE Team, one of PlayStation Studios's central technology groups. The company's first PlayStation 3 game, Uncharted: Drake's Fortune, was released in 2007, followed by several sequels and spin-off titles. This lasted until Naughty Dog announced a new intellectual property for the PlayStation 3, The Last of Us, which was in development by a secondary team at the studio and released to critical acclaim in 2013 which spawned a franchise. A sequel, The Last of Us Part II for the PlayStation 4, was released by Naughty Dog in 2020 to similar acclaim, though the narrative polarized critics and audiences.\n\nParagraph 4: The boys' soccer team has won the NJSIAA Group II championship in 1983 (defeating Millburn High School in the tournament final), 1986 (as co-champion with Millburn), 1988 (as co-champion with Chatham High School), 2003 (as co-champion with Kearny High School), 2004 (vs. Harrison High School), 2008 (as co-champion with Cliffside Park High School), 2009 (as co-champion with Cliffside Park) and 2013 (vs. Newton High School); the program's eight group championships is the tenth-most among high schools in the state. The 1983 team finished the season with a record of 22-0-1 after defeating Millburn by a score of 2-1 on a goal scored by Peter Vermes with under a minute left in the second overtime period in the Group II finals. The 1986 team finished the season with a record of 17-5-1 after being declared as co-champion with Delran following a 1–1 tie in the tournament final played at Trenton State College. The 2003 team was Group I state co-champion after a 1–1 tie with Harrison High School. The team moved on to win the 2004 Group II state championship with a shootout win vs. Cinnaminson High School in the semifinals and a 2–1 victory against Harrison High School in the tournament final. In 2005, they lost the sectional finals with a 2–1 loss to Haddonfield Memorial High School. In 2007 The team also made it to the sectional finals with a 4–1 loss to Cinnaminson High School. The team won the 2008 Central Jersey Group II sectional with a 3–1 win over Shore Regional High School. Then they moved on to play Middle Township High School in the state semis and won 4–2. They drew 2–2 in the state finals to Cliffside Park High School. They recently won the 2009 Central Jersey Group II with a 2–1 over-time victory in the quarter-finals over school rival Cinnaminson High School. In the finals they defeated Raritan High School in penalty-kicks after drawing 0–0 in regulation. Then they played West Deptford High School and pulled a 1–0 victory over the South Jersey Group II champions in the state semi-finals. In the state finals they had a re-match with Cliffside Park High School, the team they tied in the state-finals the previous year, and ended up beating them, 2-0. By winning the Group II state championships they finished their 2009 season with a 21-2-1 record and were ranked 5th in the state, 2nd in South Jersey and 1st in Group II by The Star-Ledger. In 2013, the team defeated Newton High School in the tournament final by a score of 3-2 in overtime to win the Group II title.\n\nParagraph 5: The Twilight Zone (marketed as Twilight Zone for its final two seasons) is an American science fiction horror anthology television series created and presented by Rod Serling, which ran for five seasons on CBS from October 2, 1959, to June 19, 1964. Each episode presents a stand-alone story in which characters find themselves dealing with often disturbing or unusual events, an experience described as entering \"the Twilight Zone\", often with a surprise ending and a moral. Although predominantly science-fiction, the show's paranormal and Kafkaesque events leaned the show towards fantasy and horror. The phrase \"twilight zone\", inspired by the series, is used to describe surreal experiences.\n\nParagraph 6: Elizabeth, bored wife of Lewis, a successful pulp writer in England, leaves husband and child and runs away to the German town of Baden-Baden. There she meets Thomas, who claims to be a poet but whom viewers know to be a petty thief, conman, drug courier, and gigolo. Though the two are briefly attracted to each other, she returns home. He, hunted by gangsters for a drug consignment he has lost, follows her to England. Lewis, highly suspicious of his wife, invites the young man to stay with them and act as his secretary. Initially resenting the presence of the handsome stranger, Elizabeth one night starts an affair and, after being caught together in the conservatory by Lewis, the two run away with no money to the south of France. Lewis follows them, he in turn being followed by the gangsters looking for Thomas. At the end the gangsters reclaim Thomas, presumably for execution, while Lewis reclaims Elizabeth.\n\nParagraph 7: On the day she was decommissioned, S-24 was transferred to the United Kingdom. In the Royal Navy, she was commissioned as HMS P555 in October 1942 and was assigned to the 7th Submarine Flotilla, a flotilla based at Holy Loch, Scotland, used for training new submarine officers and crews and for training surface warships in anti-submarine warfare. Among the officers who commanded her was Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve (RNVR) Lieutenant Edward Preston Young, making P555 the first Royal Navy submarine to be commanded by a British RNVR officer. The Royal Navy decommissioned P555 in May 1944 and returned her to the U.S. Navy in December 1944.\n\nParagraph 8: The exact significance of the word Khniss remains mysterious. Some invoke a possible meaning of Church as a deformation of the Arabic word \"kanis\", others suggest a link to the word \"khounais\" meaning depression in Arabic. Others reckon the city and its name are of Berber origins, however the word itself is not known. In Iraq there is an old historical Assyrian village with the name of Khinnis or khenis. Also in Morocco there is a village in a Berber area with the same name. Although this may give more credit to a version arguing for a Berber origin of the word, all these guesses and hints needs further investigations.\n\nParagraph 9:  Following his return to India, Prabhu began singing for demos by his cousins, Yuvan Shankar Raja and Karthik Raja, and started his career as a playback singer in the film industry. In 1996, he, his brother Premgi Amaren and his childhood friend S. P. B. Charan set up a music band called Next Generation, which also featured Yugendran and Thaman as members, and did several stage performances. The following year, Prabhu played the lead role opposite Sangeetha in a film titled Poonjolai directed by his father Gangai Amaren, but the film was cancelled in mid-production and attempts to revive and release the film by the late-2000s were unsuccessful. Prabhu starred in two more ventures, alongside his friends S. P. B. Charan and Yugendran; Wanted, directed by Premgi Amaren, and Agathiyan's Kadhal Samrajyam, both failing to release as well. Venkat Prabhu was then approached to essay supporting roles, with April Maadhathil (2002) becoming his first release. He went on to play character roles in nearly ten films, the most notable ventures being N. Linguswamy's Ji, starring Ajith Kumar, and the Perarasu-directed Sivakasi, featuring Vijay in the lead role. In 2008, he worked in Seeman's Vaazhthugal alongside Madhavan in his last credited appearance to date. He also played lead roles in Samuthirakani's directorial debut Unnai Charanadaindhen and Gnabagam Varuthey (2007), both co-starring Charan.\n\nParagraph 10: Hechler held a series of minor appointed positions in the federal civil service until he was drafted into the United States Army during World War II in July, 1942. After graduation from Armored Force Officer Candidate School, he was assigned as a combat historian in the European Theater of Operations. Hechler helped chronicle the liberation of France, the 1944 Normandy invasion, Battle of the Bulge, and entrance into Nazi Germany. He was attached to the 9th Armored Division when an armored and infantry task force, part of Combat Command B, unexpectedly captured the Ludendorff Bridge spanning the Rhine river during the Battle of Remagen. He interviewed both U.S. and German soldiers involved at the time. He was awarded a Bronze Star and 5 battle stars. He returned after the war twice to interview Germans who took part in the battle. He found Captain Willi Bratge, whom a German military court had been sentenced to death in absentia because he had been captured, and spent a week with him in the Remagen area learning about details of the battle. In 1957 he published the book The Bridge at Remagen: The Amazing Story of March 7, 1945, which was adapted into a film in 1969.\n\nParagraph 11: Mining in Schneeberg continued until 1954 reusing many shafts from previous silver and cobalt mining. Up to that time, about 200 tonnes of uranium was extracted from Schneeberg. Oberschlema was mined to depths of over 700 m. Mining ceased in 1960 after producing more than 7,000 tonnes of uranium. A high density of veins near the surface and the 'wild' mining methods of the 1940s and 1950s caused the complete destruction  of Oberschlema. Most houses were so badly damaged and the subsurface so unstable that the entire small town was removed in the 1950s. Today the former mining area hosts a radon health center reestablished in the 1990s. After a restructure of the company in the 1960s, Object 09 became Bergbaubetrieb Aue (mining division Aue). It developed into the single largest producer of uranium within SAG/SDAG Wismut with a peak production of 4,000 tonnes of uranium in 1965. In the last normal production year, 1989, it produced about 550 tonnes. This deposit was the first of all Wismut deposits to be supplied with large modern mining shafts and powerful ventilation in the mid-1950s . The most important shafts where Shaft 38 (Niederschlema), Shaft 366 (Aue-Alberoda) and Shaft 371 (Hartenstein). The latter went into production in 1959 and was the main shaft of the deposit up to the end of production in 1990. Shaft 371 possessed an automated sorting plant used to separate different classes of ore and to increase the overall ore grade. High grade ore was sent directly to the Soviet Union without further processing, while ore containing less than 1% uranium was shipped to the mill at Crossen near Zwickau. This was done until 1980; afterwards all ore was milled, with the sorting plant raising the average ore grade to 0.4% before it was sent to Crossen for processing. An unsuccessful attempt was also made to produce base metals, silver and selenium as by-products. Shaft 371 was connected to the -540 and -990 m level (the depth is related to the Markus Semmler adit dewatering the upper part of the deposit into the Zwickauer Mulde river). Deeper levels were connected by blind shafts. The deepest level opened in 1988 was the -1800 m level, nearly 2,000 m underground, making the mine the deepest in Europe. The mining method used was the same as in the centuries before, although with more modern equipment: galleries were driven along strike of the mineralised vein on a lower and upper level (vertical distance 30 to 45 m). These were connected by small shafts from the lower to the upper level. Then the vein was mined upward using drilling and blasting. The ore was transported to the lower level and brought to the main shafts by rail cars, while the stope was filled with waste rock, as possible. After a vein was mined out, the entrances were sealed to prevent radon from the old stopes from entering areas with active mining. This method was used in all vein type deposits of the Ore Mountains. The total production from Niederschlema-Alberoda was over 72,000 tonnes of uranium.  Together with the production from Schneeberg and Oberschlema, production losses and unmined resources, the total uranium content was about 96,000 tonnes of uranium, making Schneeberg-Schlema-Alberoda the largest vein-style uranium deposit in the world.\n\nParagraph 12: Tsar Alexander I of Russia, while visiting England with his servant the Cossack Platov, is shown a variety of modern inventions. Platov keeps insisting that things in Russia are much better (embarrassing a guide at one point when he finds something that appears well made that turns out to be a Russian gun), until they are shown a small mechanical flea. After his ascension the next tsar, Nicolas I, orders Platov (after he tries to hide the flea) to find someone to outperform the English who had created the clockwork steel flea (as small as a crumb, and the key to wind it up can only be seen through a microscope). Platov travels to Tula to find someone to better the English invention.  Three gunsmiths agree to do the work and barricade themselves in a workshop.  Villagers try to get them to come out in various ways (for example by yelling \"fire\"), but no one can get them to come out.  When Platov arrives to check on their progress, he has some Cossacks try to open the workshop.  They succeed in getting the roof to come off, but the crowd is disgusted when the trapped smell of body odor and metal work comes out of the workshop.  The gunsmiths hand Platov the same flea he gave them and he curses them, believing that they have done absolutely nothing.  He ends up dragging Lefty with him in order to have someone to answer for the failure.", "answers": ["Paragraph 4"], "length": 3144, "dataset": "passage_retrieval_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "20d651867eadef96fc6d5ace1d9389167297044ff32bdcd7"}

During the time of French rule, Ruthweiler belonged to the Mairie (“Mayoralty”) of Burglichtenberg, the Canton of Kusel, the Arrondissement of Birkenfeld and the Department of Sarre. After Napoleon’s troops were defeated and driven out of Germany, the victorious powers discussed a new territorial order, and the Congress of Vienna wrought yet another territorial reorganization. In 1816, Ruthweiler passed to the Principality of Lichtenberg. Put together from part of the former Oberamt of Lichtenberg, parts of the former Electorate of Trier and the Waldgraviate-Rhinegraviate, this was a newly created exclave of the Duchy of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, which as of 1826 became the Duchy of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. Its seat was Sankt Wendel, and it was subdivided into the Cantons of Sankt Wendel, Baumholder (in which Ruthweiler lay) and Grumbach. Ruthweiler was a border town in this new territorial order, lying right at the principality’s eastern limit. As part of this state, Ruthweiler passed in 1834 by sale – the price was 2,100,000 Thalers – to the Kingdom of Prussia, which made this area into the Sankt Wendel district in the Rhine Province. More locally, Ruthweiler lay within the Bürgermeisterei (“Mayoralty”) and later Amt of Burglichtenberg. Although the name Burglichtenberg is almost the same as Burg Lichtenberg, the German name for Castle Lichtenberg, the name was not drawn from the castle itself, but rather from a small village that had arisen on the castle grounds after the castle itself had been burnt down in 1799. Later, after the First World War, the Treaty of Versailles stipulated, among other things, that 26 of the Sankt Wendel district's 94 municipalities had to be ceded to the British- and French-occupied Saar in 1919. The remaining 68 municipalities then bore the designation “Restkreis St. Wendel-Baumholder”, with the first syllable of Restkreis having the same meaning as in English, in the sense of “left over”. The district seat was at Baumholder. Ruthweiler belonged to the Restkreis until 1937, when it was transferred to the Birkenfeld district. This was created by uniting the Restkreis with a hitherto Oldenburg district of that same name. The new, bigger district was grouped into the Prussian Regierungsbezirk of Koblenz. After the Second World War, the village at first lay in the Regierungsbezirk of Koblenz in the then newly founded state of Rhineland-Palatinate. In the course of administrative restructuring in this state in 1968, the Amt of Burglichtenberg was dissolved on 1 January 1972. Ruthweiler passed to the newly founded Verbandsgemeinde of Kusel-Altenglan and to the Kusel district, in which it remains today. It also found itself in the new Regierungsbezirk of Rheinhessen-Pfalz, although this has since been dissolved.\n\nParagraph 2: The production MKS rides on Ford's D3 platform. The MKS features an independent suspension with MacPherson struts and rearward-facing lower L-arms with a  stabilizer bar in the front and a multilink coil over shock setup with stamped steel lower control arms and cast upper control arms in the rear; \"Lincoln Drive Control\" with continuously controlled damping (CCD) available as optional feature. The car features four-wheel antilock disc brakes ( rotors in the front and  rotors in the rear) with standard AdvanceTrac traction control and Roll Stability Control (RSC). Front-wheel drive (FWD) is standard while all-wheel drive (AWD) is optional. In a significant departure from the MKS Concept and past Lincoln flagship sedans, the production MKS does not offer a V8 engine. In the place of the 4.4 L Ford/Yamaha V8 found in the MKS Concept, the production MKS is powered by an all-aluminum 3.7 L Duratec DOHC V6, a larger bore derivative of the Duratec 35 and a member of Ford's Cyclone engine family. The engine was designed to accept either regular grade, 87 octane gasoline or premium grade, 91 octane gasoline. Using regular grade gasoline, the 3.7 L V6 produces 273 hp (204 kW) at 6250 rpm and 270 lb·ft (366 N·m) of torque at 4250 rpm. Using premium grade gasoline results in a small boost in output to 275 hp (205 kW) at 6250 rpm and 276 lb·ft (374 N·m) of torque at 4250 rpm. Power from the MKS' V6 is transmitted to the wheels via Ford's 6F50 6-speed automatic transmission. The transmission is equipped with SelectShift which simulates the operation of a manual transmission. A road test by Car and Driver magazine of an AWD-equipped MKS recorded acceleration from zero to 60 mph in 7.5 seconds and a quarter-mile in 15.7 seconds at . Testers noted the MKS' heavy weight of over 4300 lbs. Ford introduced its EcoBoost V6, an all-aluminum, twin-turbocharged, direct injection 3.5 L DOHC V6, in the 2010 MKS arriving in showrooms in the summer of 2009.\n\nParagraph 3: Historically, feminism has been a traditionally feminine role in America, and being a feminist has had a negative connotation toward it, at least in 1848 when the First-wave feminism started. Women that are a feminist have been called \"ugly\" \"men haters\" or \"always angry.\" These stereotypes only are associated with women, because it is not common in the U.S. for men to be feminists as well. The feminist movement started as a way to grant gender equality to women, but it is not limited to only women. Men can also be a feminist if they believe that women deserve equal rights as well. Gender is a social construct derived from norms that society has implemented; based on how they believe a male or female would represent themselves. The third wave of feminism started the notion of connecting racial, sexual, and gender identities. Gender can be different for most people, and it does not have to fall in line with an individual's sex as well. Gender can be different for most people and it is up to interpretation, feminism and the way an individual chooses to be a feminist can be up for interpretation as well. Women having feminine manners was brought to light as gender tried to explain why women were in unequal positions of power to men; and leads to misogynistic views of calling women \"weak\" because femininity is a female flaw. The words used to describe women that are used as an insult are a compliment to men. For example, if a woman is assertive, aggressive, or bold, she is labeled as bossy. Feminists have continuously tried shifting away from the narrative that being feminine is for women, and men cannot be feminists. Research has shown that men have mad roles in creating change and respecting feminist movements.\n\nParagraph 4: An authority on actors and film history, Brown was a contributor to Scream Queens: Heroines of the Horrors by Calvin Beck and Bhob Stewart. Published by Macmillan in 1978, the book features illustrated biographical profiles of 29 fantasy film actresses and directors. Brown did a similar survey, the unpublished Unsung Heroes of the Horrors, covering the lives of some lesser known Hollywood talents, and he also contributed to various magazines, including Films in Review and Castle of Frankenstein. The book Who Was Who on Screen Third Edition, by Evelyn Mack Truett was dedicated to Brown, whom she credited with giving data support for the previous edition.\n\nParagraph 5: Siddharth Parashar (Farooq Sheikh), Omi Sharma (Rakesh Bedi) and Jomo Lakhanpal (Ravi Baswani) are close friends and roommates who are studying at Delhi University. Siddharth has completed M.A. in Economics and is preparing for PhD. While Siddharth is a studious boy who loves to spend most of his time with books, his friends Omi and Jomo are mostly busy chasing girls. The only thing common among the three of them is smoking. They Used to buy cigarettes from local paan shop owned by Lallanmiyan (Saeed Jaffrey).One day, Omi and Jomo spot a girl named Neha Rajan (Deepti Naval) from their balcony and try to impress her one by one by their tricks. However, both of them give up after experiencing shameful events. After some days, Neha visits their flat as the salesgirl of Chamko washing powder. Omi and Jomo quickly hide as soon as they spot her from the peep hole. Siddharth meets Neha for the first time and soon a love story begins. Meanwhile, Siddharth gets a job in company where Neha's father is manager. He too gets impressed by Siddharth and sees a prospective son-in-law in him. However, when Omi and Jomo discover their relationship, they decide to plot something to end their relationship and also to seek revenge to the embarrassment inflicted upon them by the girl. Initially, they succeed in creating a false image of Neha's character and separating Siddharth and Neha, but later on repent when they realise that Siddharth's love for Neha is genuine and he has started losing his interest in work and study and is most likely to end his life as well. Neha is clueless about abrupt change in Siddharth's behaviour. Finally, Omi and Jomo decide to reunite both the lovers. As a spate of kidnapping (especially of young girls) has started in Delhi, Omi and Jomo plan a fake kidnapping of Neha along with her grandmother (Leela Mishra) where Siddharth will rescue her. Unfortunately, she is kidnapped by the real gang and the duo is left in the lurch. Siddharth fights with real kidnappers and police arrive at the scene with Lallanmiyan to arrest the gang. The later part of the story revolves on how they clear the confusion that she has been going through and how she was kidnapped by real thugs and finally rescued.\n\nParagraph 6: The village of Koningsbosch has a thriving association culture. In 1992 the local shooting club (Schutterij St. Joseph) won the OLS. The local mixed choir Mes Amis became provincial champion in 1992 and 1993 and the local wood-wind and brass band (Harmonie St. Cecilia) became national champion in 1997. Successes of the local male choir \"Koninklijk erkend mannenkoor St. Caecilia\" are from earlier days. Periodically events are organised where various local associations perform together. In sept 2006 Mes Amis, the male choir and Harmonie St. Cecilia celebrated the 85th anniversary of the Harmonie in the Bürger-Treff in Waldfeucht, Germany. Every second week of December Mes Amis, the male choir, Harmonie St. Cecilia and the local church choir St. Caecilia perform together in a Christmas concert.\n\nParagraph 7: In 1862 he was appointed professor of Sanskrit at Florence, but having married a cousin of the Socialist Bakunin and become interested in his views he resigned his appointment and spent some years in travel. He was reappointed, however, in 1867; and in 1891 he was transferred to the University of Rome La Sapienza. He became prominent both as an orientalist, a publicist and a poet. He maintained close ties with Romanian orientalists. At International Congress of Orientalists from Florence in 1878 he invited Bogdan Petriceicu Haşdeu, a prominent Romanian writer and philologist. He was a good friend with the Romanian Princess Dora d'Istria (Elena Ghica) who collaborated with him at Rivista Orientale.\n\nParagraph 8: Founded in 1123 by Stephen, Count of Boulogne, it was built originally for the Order of Savigny. Located in the 'Vale of Nightshade', south of Dalton-in-Furness, the abbey is built entirely out of local sandstone. It passed in 1147 to the Cistercians, who gradually enlarged and rebuilt the original ornate church. The majority of the current ruins date from the 12th and 13th centuries. By the 15th century, it had been completely remodelled and had become the second richest and most powerful – as well as one of the grandest – Cistercian abbeys in England, behind Fountains Abbey. The Gothic-style monastery and its adjacent structures cover an expansive area of land and reach a maximum height of  above ground level.\n\nParagraph 9: In 1996, he announced his remailer would shut down due to legal pressure from the Church of Scientology. Scientology officials, upset that some users of Helsingius' service were sending information about the church, obtained a court order to force him to reveal the identity of many of the site's users. When announcing the service's closure, he wrote, \"I will close the remailer for the time being because the legal issues concerning the Internet in Finland are yet undefined.\" The American Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), an Internet civil rights initiative, reported continuously on the incidents concerning anon.penet.fi and collected donations to cover legal costs should Helsingius be involved in a court case to settle whether Finnish law could force him to reveal the identity of anon.penet.fi users. The closing down of anon.penet.fi led to an outbreak of outrage and solidarity with Helsingius throughout the Internet in order to protect freedom on the Internet.\n\nParagraph 10: The film set an IMAX opening record worldwide with $20.5 million from 574 IMAX theaters, surpassing the $17.1 million record held by The Hunger Games: Catching Fire (2013), and is also the best opening for an IMAX 2D, non-sequel, and November IMAX release. It had a worldwide opening of $132.6 million, which was the tenth-largest opening of 2014, and it became the tenth-highest-grossing film of 2014. Interstellar is the fourth film to gross over $100 million worldwide from IMAX ticket sales. Interstellar was released in the UK, Ireland and Malta on November 6, 2014, and debuted at number one earning £5.37 million ($8.6 million) in its opening weekend, which was lower than the openings of The Dark Knight Rises (£14.36 million), Gravity (£6.24 million), and Inception (£5.91 million). The film was released in 35 markets on the same day, including major markets like Germany, Russia, Australia, and Brazil earning $8.7 million in total. Through Sunday, it earned an opening weekend total of $82.9 million from 11.1 million admissions from over 14,800 screens in 62 markets. It earned $7.3 million from 206 IMAX screens, at an average of 35,400 viewers per theater. It went to number one in South Korea ($14.4 million), Russia ($8.9 million), and France ($5.3 million). Other strong openings occurred in Germany ($4.6 million), India ($4.3 million), Italy ($3.7 million), Australia ($3.7 million), Spain ($2.7 million), Mexico ($3.1 million), and Brazil ($1.9 million). Interstellar was released in China on November 12 and earned $5.4 million on its opening day on Wednesday, which is Nolan's biggest opening in China after surpassing the $4.61 million opening record of The Dark Knight Rises. It went on to earn $41.7 million in its opening weekend, accounting for 55% of the market share. It is Nolan's biggest opening in China, Warner Bros.' biggest 2D opening, and the studio's third-biggest opening of all time, behind 2014's The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies ($49.5 million) and 2013's Pacific Rim ($45.2 million).\n\nParagraph 11: \"Succession and inheritance rules are determined by the principle of patrilineal descent. According to custom, the eldest son is the probable heir, but a father may choose any one of his sons to succeed him. An heir takes his dead father's name and inherits any titles held by the latter, including the right to membership in any societies to which he belonged. And, until the mid-1960s, when the law governing polygamy was changed, the heir also inherited his father's wives--a considerable economic responsibility. The rights in land held by the deceased were conferred upon the heir subject to the approval of the chief, and, in the event of financial inheritance, the heir was not obliged to share this with other family members. The ramifications of this are significant. First, dispossessed family members were not automatically entitled to live off the wealth of the heir. Siblings who did not share in the inheritance were, therefore, strongly encouraged to make it on their own through individual initiative and by assuming responsibility for earning their livelihood. Second, this practice of individual responsibility in contrast to a system of strong family obligations prevented a drain on individual financial resources. Rather than spend all of the inheritance maintaining unproductive family members, the heir could, in the contemporary period, utilize his resources in more financially productive ways such as for savings and investment. [...] Finally, the system of inheritance, along with the large-scale migration resulting from population density and land pressures, is one of the internal incentives that accounts for Bamileke success in the nontraditional world\".\n\nParagraph 12: In the seventh reading, God promised to maintain the covenant with Abraham and his offspring as an everlasting covenant throughout the ages, and assigned all the land of Canaan to him and his offspring as an everlasting holding. God further told Abraham that he and his offspring throughout the ages were to keep God's covenant and every male (including every slave) was to be circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin at the age of eight days as a sign of the covenant with God. If any male failed to circumcise the flesh of his foreskin, that person was to be cut off from his kin for having broken God's covenant. And God renamed Sarai as Sarah, and told Abraham that God would bless her and give Abraham a son by her so that she would give rise to nations and rulers. Abraham threw himself on his face and laughed at the thought that a child could be born to a man of a hundred and a woman of ninety, and Abraham asked God to bless Ishmael. But God told him that Sarah would bear Abraham a son, and Abraham was to name him Isaac, and God would maintain the everlasting covenant with him and his offspring. In response to Abraham's prayer, God blessed Ishmael as well and promised to make him exceedingly numerous, the father of twelve chieftains and a great nation. But God would maintain the covenant with Isaac, whom Sarah would bear at the same season the next year. And when God finished speaking, God disappeared. That very day, Abraham circumcised himself, Ishmael, and every male in his household, as God had directed. The maftir () reading that concludes the parashah reports that when Abraham circumcised himself and his household, Abraham was 99 and Ishmael was 13.

{"input": "The text discusses the issue of Latvia's borders and its relationship with Russia. The Latvian constitution states that borders are determined by international treaties, with the 1920 Treaty of Rīga being considered still in force. In 1990, Latvia declared its independence and stated that it would base its relations with Russia on treaty principles. However, Russia does not acknowledge Latvia's previous occupation and incorporation into the USSR, viewing it as a newly independent country. Western countries have not recognized the legality of Latvia's incorporation into the USSR, but there is pressure for both countries to resolve the issue. The need for a border agreement is also highlighted as it could affect Russia's visa policy with the EU.", "context": "Paragraph 1: The film has influenced other European films since its initial release. Spanish director Jesús Franco created films throughout his career that were influenced by the film. Franco's first such film was the Spanish/French co-production Gritos en la noche (1962). Franco's version of the story concerns the efforts of a mad surgeon, Dr. Orloff, to reconstruct the face of his disfigured daughter Melissa. Inspector Edgar Tanner investigates Orloff using his girlfriend, Wanda Bronsky, as an undercover spy. Franco followed the film with several sequels to Gritos en la noche. He made one more film strongly influenced by the Franju film, Faceless (1988). Faceless has a similar plot involving beautiful women who are abducted by Dr. Flamand's (Helmut Berger) female assistant and kept hostage. The doctor uses the skin of the women to perform plastic surgery on his disfigured sister, but the experiments leave the victims mutilated and dead. The Italian film Atom Age Vampire (1961) was also influenced by Eyes Without a Face with a doctor attempting to take the faces of other women to repair his daughter's face. These homages are seen in the plot line of a police lieutenant who is investigating the circumstances behind the death of a young girl whose body has scars around the eyes. The lieutenant's investigation eventually leads him to a plastic surgery clinic, a similar plot motivation to Eyes Without a Face. The British film Corruption (1968), starring Peter Cushing, adds a new variation to the theme: a surgeon tries to restore his fiancée's beauty by repeatedly treating her with fluids extracted from the pituitary glands of murdered female victims. Spanish director Pedro Almodóvar has stated his film The Skin I Live In (2011), which features a mad scientist who performs skin grafts and surgeries on an unwilling victim, was heavily influenced by Eyes Without a Face.\n\nParagraph 2: Filmed from January to March 1947, the film was financed by Crosby, Hope, and Paramount. It produced $4.5 million in rental income in its initial release period in the United States and was placed sixth in the top-grossing films of 1947.  The critics liked it, with The New York Times saying in its review of February 19, 1948, inter alia: \"With Bing Crosby and Bob Hope on the tramp again in Road to Rio, recklessly scattering jokes and rescuing perennial girl friend Dorothy Lamour from dangerous hypnotic trances, there's fun to be had at the Paramount. Maybe this is not the funniest picture ever made; maybe it is not even quite as rewarding as some of those earlier journeys, but there are patches in this crazy quilt that are as good and, perhaps, even better than anything the boys have done before. They are traversing more of a rollercoaster highway than usual this time and so there are some tedious uphill pulls when the huffing and puffing is excessive and the results negligible. However, when they reach the top “Road to Rio” is irresistible... All that matters really is that “Road to Rio” is fairly well loaded with laughs.\"\n\nParagraph 3: Author James Riordan translated a tale from the Tatar people with the title Shaitan the Devil and His Forty Daughters, a man named Safa looks for adventure and rescues a swan in a lake from a black witch. In gratitude, the bird takes Safa to visit her sisters. He is given a little box and a warning not to open it until he reaches home. However, on his way, curiosity takes the better of him and he opens the box: a retinue of market sellers, wares, jades and money comes out of the box. At first, Safa is astonished by the wondrous contents of the box, but, after trying to shut them all back, regrets his decision. Suddenly, a mysterious gray-bearded man offers to help the man, in exchange for what Safa does not know he has at home. Safa closes the box and returns home, only to find his wife gave birth to a son, and immediately regrets his deal. Years later, Safa's son, a jigit, decides to fulfill his father's deal, and stops by a lakeside, waiting for the coming of Shaitan the Devil. He sees a flock of 40 swans coming to the lake and bathing in the water. The jigit creeps behind one of the birds and snatches it, while the other swans fly away. The bird in the jigit's hands shakes off her feathers and becomes a human maiden. She reveals that she is one of Shaitan's daughter, and her father plans to eat him, but he can delay this fate by asking to do chores for him. She flies back to the skies and Shaitan appears soon after to take the boy to his lair in the depths of the forest. the jigit offers to do chores for him, and Shaitan sets three tasks: first, to chop down the forest and sell the wood, then buy rye, plant it and harvest it, grind the corn and store hay - all in one night; secondly, to draw water from a lake to another with a sieve; thirdly, to bridle a wild stallion from Shaitan's stables (which is Shaitan metamorphosed). The jigit fulfills the tasks with the help of the swan girl. Shaitan agrees to marry the jigit to one of his daughters, after the youth passes more tests: to identify his daughter among 40 doves; then, to identify who is his daughter among her sisters, each playing a kurai. After succeeding twice more, Shaitan locks his youngest daughter and the jigit in the dungeons, but the swan girl takes the jigit with her and both escape in a \"Magic Flight\" sequence.\n\nParagraph 4: The Latvian constitution stipulates that the borders of the Republic are set by international treaties, and the government considers the 1920 Treaty of Rīga to be still in force. The 4 May 1990 declaration of independence (reinstating the 1920 constitution subject to a transitional period) by the Supreme Soviet of the Latvian SSR affirmed that the restored Republic of Latvia would base its relations with the Russian Federation on the treaty principle. In January 1991, the Russian Federation (while still in the USSR) and Latvia signed a document regulating their bilateral relations. The Latvian delegation attempted to include a reference to the 1920 treaty but the Russian delegation objected. In essence, Russia views Latvia as a newly independent country and consistently refuses to acknowledge that Latvia was occupied and illegally incorporated into the USSR, while Latvia insists upon the legal continuity of Latvian state occupied in 1940. Key players in post-war politics in the West never recognised or at least questioned the legality of the incorporation of Latvia into the USSR, but there is pressure on both countries to resolve the issue. This can be seen on the example of their attitude towards events from the beginning of the 20th century in Latvia. Thus, the European Community, for example, did not use the term \"recognition\" but referred to \"the restoration of sovereignty and independence\" when restoring diplomatic relations in 1991; the US to \"the culmination of the USA’s 52 year refusal to accept the forcible incorporation of the independent Baltic States by the USSR\". (See, for example, Roland Rich's paper for the Symposium on Recent Developments in State Recognition.). Pressure on the RF includes the need for Russia to have a border agreement in order to pursue a less draconian visa policy from the EU.\n\nParagraph 5: is a 1995 shoot 'em up video game developed by T&E Soft and published by Nintendo. Released as a Virtual Boy launch game, it requires the player to pilot a space fighter and defeat the army of a malevolent artificial intelligence called \"KAOS\". The game takes inspiration from the 1993 title Star Fox, and it is one of the few third-party titles for the Virtual Boy. Unlike most of the console's games, Red Alarm features three-dimensional (3D) polygonal graphics. However, hardware constraints limited the visuals to bare wire-frame models, similar to those of the 1980 arcade game Battlezone. Reviewers characterized Red Alarms graphics as confusing, but certain publications praised it as one of the most enjoyable Virtual Boy titles.\n\nParagraph 6: Girard's main contribution to philosophy, and in turn to other disciplines, was in the psychology of desire. Girard claimed that human desire functions imitatively, or mimetically, rather than arising as the spontaneous byproduct of human individuality, as much of theoretical psychology had assumed. Girard found that human development proceeds triangularly from a model of desire who indicates some object of desire as desirable by desiring it themselves. We copy this desire for the object of the model and appropriate it as our own, most often without recognizing that the source of this desire comes from another apart from ourselves completing the triangle of mimetic desire. This process of appropriation of desire includes (but is not limited to) identity formation, the transmission of knowledge and social norms, and material aspirations which all have their origin in copying the desires of others who we take, consciously or unconsciously, as models for desire.\n\nParagraph 7: In the 2018 season, Shoji helped Kashima Antlers keep two clean sheets in the first two league matches of the season. He then captained the side for the next three matches between 13 March 2018 and 31 March 2018. However, Shoji suffered a calf injury that saw him miss two matches. It wasn't until on 14 April 2018 when he made his return to the starting line-up from injury, in a 2–0 win against Nagoya Grampus. However, Shoji's return was short–lived when he was sent–off for a second bookable offence, in a 4–1 loss against Kawasaki Frontale in a follow–up match. Shoji returned from suspension, appearing in the starting line–up against V-Varen Nagasaki on 2 May 2018 and helped them win 2–1. Following the World Cup, Shoji's performance during the tournament attracted interests from clubs around Europe, but he responded to the transfer speculation by stating he wanted to stay at Kashima Antlers. It wasn't until on 22 July 2018 when Shoji made his return to the starting line-up as captain against Kashiwa Reysol and led the side to win 6–2. However, his return was short–lived when he suffered ankle injury and had to be substituted in the 41st minute during a 2–0 win against Cerezo Osaka on 25 July 2018. Initially out for three weeks, Shoji was eventually sidelined for three months. It wasn't until on 14 October 2018 when he made his return from injury, coming on as a late substitute, in a 2–2 against Yokohama F. Marinos in the second leg of the J. League Cup semi–finals, resulting Kashima Antlers’ elimination. Ten days later on 24 October 2018 against Suwon Samsung Bluewings in the second leg of the AFC Champions League semi–finals, Shoji captained the side and led them to a 3–3 draw, resulting Kashima Antlers reaching the AFC Champions League Final for the first time. He then played in both legs of the AFC Champions League Final against Persepolis and led the side by beating them 2–0 aggregate to win the club's first AFC Champions League trophy. It wasn't until on 24 November 2018 when Shoji scored his first goal of the season, in a 3–0 win against Vegalta Sendai. He later appeared twice during the FIFA Club World Cup, as they finished fourth place in the tournament. At the end of the 2018 season, Shoji went on to make thirty appearances and scoring once in all competitions.\n\nParagraph 8: At state level, Bosnia and Herzegovina votes for the rotating Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Parliamentary Assembly. President is elected for a four-year term by constituencies referring to the three main ethnic groups. The candidate with the most votes in a constituency is elected. The Parliamentary Assembly (Parlamentarna Skupština) has two chambers. The House of Representatives (Predstavnički dom/Zastupnički dom) has 42 members, elected for a four-year term by proportional representation in each main ethnic group. The House of Peoples (Dom Naroda) has 15 members, appointed by the parliaments of the two Entities. Bosnia and Herzegovina has a multi-party system, with numerous political parties in which no one party has a chance of gaining power alone, and parties must work with each other to form coalition governments. Each main ethnic group has its own dominant political party.\n\nParagraph 9: This is a list of the fundamental frequencies in hertz (cycles per second) of the keys of a modern 88-key standard or 108-key extended piano in twelve-tone equal temperament, with the 49th key, the fifth A (called A4), tuned to 440 Hz (referred to as A440).  Since every octave is made of twelve steps and since a jump of one octave doubles the frequency (for example, the fifth A is 440 Hz and the sixth A is 880 Hz), each successive pitch is derived by multiplying (ascending) or dividing (descending) the frequency of the previous pitch by the twelfth root of two (approximately 1.059463). For example, to get the frequency one semitone up from A4 (A4), multiply 440 by the twelfth root of two. To go from A4 to B4 (up one whole tone, or two semitones), multiply 440 twice by the twelfth root of two (or once by the sixth root of two, approximately 1.122462). To go from A4 to C5 (which is a minor third), multiply 440 three times by the twelfth root of two (or once by the fourth root of two, approximately 1.189207). For other tuning schemes refer to musical tuning.\n\nParagraph 10: The video was directed by Michael Palmieri, who also directed the video for the previous single, \"DOA\". Most of the music video was filmed in Duarte, CA, the rest being green/blue screened to have the band playing under a C.G.I. lighthouse. The video begins with Dave Grohl crossing Route 66 (Huntington Dr.) to a \"Sushi for Less\" restaurant, with wind chimes ringing in the background. He enters the restaurant seeing few people (played by the other band members). He is greeted by an attractive Asian waitress. After being seated Grohl is waited on by a male Asian double of himself, including his tattoos and T-shirt, minus the Motörhead logo. Nate Mendel starts to get bored looking at the live crustacean in his cup and starts balancing a fork and a spoon on the rim of a glass. Taylor Hawkins tries to better this by balancing a salt shaker in a small pile of salt. Grohl hums and sings along to his own song being played on a radio and television. In an extended daydream of sequence, Grohl envisions himself as the scuba suited toy in the restaurant's aquarium as a mermaid, who resembles the restaurant's waitress, swims towards him. (The bottle at his feet with the red liquid is a reference to the video for \"DOA\") After a moment of bubbling love hearts at each other, she detaches his air hose and the glass in his helmet cracks. At the same time, Mendel knocks the glass off the table and Hawkins knocks over the salt shaker. Before the glass hits the ground, Chris Shiflett catches it and puts it back on the table. Still daydreaming, Grohl finds he is able to breathe under water and he swims away with the mermaid. As Shiflett asks Mendel to show him how to balance the fork and spoon on the glass, Grohl is snapped back to reality by the waitress handing him the bill. The video premiered on British television long before it premiered in the United States.\n\nParagraph 11: This Act was first introduced as S.1868 by Senator Don Nickles on March 26, 1998. It provided an alternative to H.R. 2431, \"the Freedom from Religious Persecution Act of 1997\", originally H.R.1685/S.772 introduced by Representative Frank Wolf and Senator Arlen Specter (R-PA) on May 27, 1997 (https://www.congress.gov/bill/105th-congress/house-bill/1685/text) and then reintroduced as H.R. 2431 on September 9, 1997 (https://www.congress.gov/bill/105th-congress/house-bill/2431/text/ih?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22H.R.+2431%22%5D%7D&r=1). During consideration of H.R. 2431 in the House International Relations Committee (HIRC) on April 1, 1998, Rep. Kevin Brady (R-TX) proposed the text of S.1868, just introduced in the Senate, as an Amendment in the Nature of a Substitute. This forced several important changes to H.R. 2431, including moving the persecution \"tzar\" contained in H.R.2431 from the White House to the State Department, and an agreement to allow Rep. Brady to offer a floor amendment to H.R.2431 if he would withdraw his amendment in committee. Rep. Brady withdrew his amendment in committee, and added several provisions from S.1868 to H.R.2431 during the general vote on H.R. 2431, which passed the House on May 14, 1998, by a vote of 375–41, and was subsequently sent to the Senate. However, H.R. 2431 was never considered by the Senate. S.1868 was sponsored by many senators in addition to Majority Whip Don Nickles, including powerful Foreign Relations chairman Senator Jesse Helms (R-NC). Despite initial opposition from the State Department, the White House and advocates of H.R. 2431, S.1868 eventually passed the Senate 98–0. Because this vote was one of the last substantive votes of the 105th Congress, the House agreed to take the Senate version in its entirety, as there was no time for a conference. Accordingly, the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 was renumbered in the Senate as S. 3789, an Amendment in the Nature of a Substitute to H.R. 2431, and then passed on to the House, where it was voted in on the consent calendar on October 10, 1998.\n\nParagraph 12: The  are the judges of the Gegeru and are Daguva's right-hand men. The  crafts the artifacts used by the other groups. The  contains lower-tier Gurongi under Xu·Zain·Da, most of their kin slaughtered by Daguva as they failed to acquire the right to participate. Those who did qualify are brought into the Gegeru by writing their names on the portable  blackboard and using the beads of their  bracelets to mark the number of people they have killed. The  are middle-tier Gurongi led by Me·Garima·Ba, its members brought into the Gegeru by using the  abacus to predict the number of people they are to kill and the period to accomplish that. The  are high-tier Gurongi who can transmute their ornaments into weapons like Kuuga displays while in his Dragon, Pegasus, and Titan forms. Unlike the lesser tiers, the Go having La·Doldo·Gu tally their kills for them while creating their rules of conducting their kills. The Go who completes the Gegeru, or the one who can defeat all the Go class Gurongi, earns the right to fight Daguva for control of the entire Gurongi Tribe. Their leader is Go·Gadol·Ba, one of the three strongest Go Gurongi who had modified themselves to alter their forms like Kuuga and Daguva. The lowest  were all murdered by Daguva without acquiring the right of the Gegeru.\n\nParagraph 13:  is the oldest of the Casull children, Shannon's sister and Pacifica's foster sister. She is a powerful magic-user and able to cast spells faster than many others. She has assumed a motherly role in the family and is always kind and calm. Like Shannon, she has a striking resemblance to Celia and Beckenham Mauser's sister due to the genetic engineering used in their birth. It is however noted that she is often left the odd one out because of Shannon and Pacifica's close relationship. She does not seem to mind, but she is considerably less close to either of her siblings as they are to each other. Her concern for Pacifica is clear in some episodes; for example, when they went to the cave of bugs to look plants for Pacifica's antidote, she says that she does not mind the danger because her sister's life is in danger. Raquel often encourages Shannon's close relationship with Pacifica by sending her brother out to look for and comfort Pacifica. She is the type to comfort Pacifica by doing something, rather than speaking it. Despite her kind, calm and goofy nature, she will not hesitate to strike down anyone in her way of protecting Pacifica or Shannon. Raquel's normal kindness often serves as a cover for a more aggressive and tactical mind that asserts itself whenever Pacifica or Shannon are in danger. Raquel prepared her father, Yuhma, for death and lit the pyre. Toward the end of the series, Raquel starts to become doubtful while separated from Pacifica and Shannon. When she does find Pacifica (with amnesia), she admits that she does not know what to do, still not knowing where her brother is. Her most vulnerable state is during the last episode, as she holds the stabbed Pacifica in her arms. She later returns to her family farm with Pacifica, Shannon and Zefiris.", "answers": ["Paragraph 4"], "length": 3565, "dataset": "passage_retrieval_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "5ade245338ca8897c7d0951de6823381b6c7f9e0217bbb36"}
{"input": "The text discusses two instances involving the writer Jonathan Chait. In the first instance, he responded to John Mearsheimer's comment about Gilad Atzmon's book, The Wandering Who, by citing anti-Semitic quotes from the book. In the second instance, Chait wrote an article for New York magazine, discussing political correctness and how it has changed over time. He argued that social media has contributed to a more widespread and less restricted form of political correctness compared to the 1990s.", "context": "Paragraph 1: Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans has emerged as an economically significant bacterium in the field of biohydrometallurgy, in the leaching of sulfide ores since its discovery in 1950 by Colmer, Temple and Hinkle. The discovery of A. ferrooxidans led to the development of  “biohydrometallurgy”, which deals with all aspects of microbial mediated extraction of metals from minerals or solid wastes and acid mine drainage. A. ferrooxidans has been proven as a potent leaching organism, for dissolution of metals from low-grade sulfide ores. Recently, the attention has been focused upon the treatment of mineral concentrates, as well as complex sulfide ores using batch or continuous-flow reactors.\n\nParagraph 2: The show featured two teams of three players in a charades competition: the Challenger Team was composed of a contestant joined with two guest star players, while the Home Team consisted of series regulars Jack Duffy, Dinah Christie and Billy Van. Using game play similar to the American game show Pantomime Quiz, answers were usually jokes or complex phrases involving a pun or some other form of word play (example: \"Tiny Tee Hee.... \"I didn't raise my daughter to be fiddled with,\" said the pussycat as she rescued her offspring from the violin factory\"). Viewers at home were also invited to send their own joke or phrase, which if used, could win them a small prize.\n\nParagraph 3: According to followers' admissions, Lundgren later went inside the barn with a church member named Ron Luff, luring Avery into a place where the other men awaited by asking him for help with equipment for the camping trip. Luff attempted to render Avery unconscious with a stun gun, but due to a malfunction, a stun bullet struck Avery but failed to knock him out. Avery then was gagged and dragged to the place where Lundgren awaited. He was shot twice in the back, dying almost instantly. To mask the sound of the gun, a chainsaw was left running. Luff then told Avery's wife, Cheryl, that her husband needed help. She was gagged like her husband, but also had duct tape put over her eyes, and dragged to Lundgren. She was shot three times, twice in the breasts and once in the abdomen. Her body lay next to her husband's. The Averys' 15-year-old daughter, Trina, was shot twice in the head. The first shot entered but ricocheted off of her skull, missing her brain, but the second killed her instantly. Thirteen-year-old Becky Avery was shot twice and left to die, while six-year-old Karen Avery was shot in the chest and head.\n\nParagraph 4: In the fourth century BC, Alexander the Great introduced this \"Persian nut\" (Theophrastus' καρυα ή Περσική) in Macedonian, Ancient Greek ancestral forms with lateral fruiting from Iran and Central Asia. They hybridized with terminal-bearing forms to give lateral-bearing trees with larger fruit. These lateral-bearers were spread in southern Europe and northern Africa by Romans. Recent prospections in walnut populations of the Mediterrean Basin allowed to select interesting trees of this type. In the Middle Ages, the lateral-bearing character was introduced again in southern Turkey by merchants travelling along the Silk Road. J. regia germplasm in China is thought to have been introduced from Central Asia about 2,000 years ago, and in some areas has become naturalized. Cultivated J. regia was introduced into western and northern Europe very early, in Roman times or earlier, and to the Americas in the 17th century, by English colonists. Important nut-growing regions include California in the United States; France, Serbia, Greece, Bulgaria, Romania and Hungary in Europe; China in Asia; Baja California and Coahuila in Mexico; and Chile in Latin America. Lately, cultivation has spread to other regions, such as New Zealand and the southeast of Australia. It is cultivated extensively from 30° to 50° of latitude in the Northern Hemisphere and from 30° to 40° in the Southern Hemisphere. Its high-quality fruits are eaten both fresh or pressed for their richly flavored oil; numerous cultivars have been selected for larger nuts with thinner shells.\n\nParagraph 5: On November 16, 2001, after discussing the idea with the US State Department (who were not only supportive but offered financial assistance) Tahir lead a delegation to Pakistan \"to promote better understanding between Pakistan and the United States of America.\" The central points of the trip were to promote the idea that \"Pakistan's future development relies heavily on foreign investment, especially from the United States and the European Union\", \"to establish better awareness between the people of Pakistan and the USA\", and \"to inform Pakistanis that are many Americans who support fair policies towards Muslim nations.\" Tahir's press release stated that he \"feels that American citizens should know that the people in Pakistan care for them equally\" and that he believed that \"there are tremendous mis-impressions regarding how Pakistanis view Americans and vice versa.\" Which \"has resulted in lack of trust and confidence between the two peoples.\" The delegation visited Islamabad, Lahore, Karachi and Quetta. Press conferences were held with the local media with the facilitation of the US Embassy of Pakistan in Washington DC. The Pakistani Government also offered financial assistance, but both their and the State Dept.'s offers were politely declined and the mission was self-funded by the delegation. Tahir's personal goals for the delegation was to combat the sentiments in Pakistan that led some Pakistanis to burn American flags before the media. He held this \"can only infuriate Americans all over the world. This type of behavior does not promote the investments that can create jobs and lead to progress.\" He hoped the delegation could \"turn sentiments around as both Pakistan and the United States are now at the threshold of establishing a more durable and lasting relationship.\" In a press release by the United States Embassy, Tahir was quoted as saying \"Who is teaching Pakistanis about how good America is? There's been a relationship between the U.S. government and the government of Pakistan, but there has never been much people-to-people contact. We're going to tell Pakistanis how good a life, we as Muslims, live here in the U.S. Freedom of speech, freedom of religion, human rights, justice for all - this is exactly what Islam is.\" He expressed that \"he would like to see Pakistan develop the same level of tolerance and respect that he experiences in the United States, and he sees education as the key to that achievement. As a boy, he said, he spent an hour every morning in the madrassa, learning the Koran, and then went to school, where he studied mathematics and science for the rest of the day. 'We need education'.\"\n\nParagraph 6: A second critically influential philosopher to the neo-pragmatist is Thomas Kuhn who argued that our languages for representing reality, or what he called \"paradigms\", are only as good as they produce possible future experiments and observations. Kuhn, being a philosopher of science, argued in The Structure of Scientific Revolutions  that \"scientific progress\" was a kind of a misnomer; for Kuhn, we make progress in science whenever we throw off old scientific paradigms with their associated concepts and methods in favor of new paradigms which offer novel experiments to be done and new scientific ontologies. For Kuhn 'electrons' exist just so much as they are useful in providing us with novel experiments which will allow us to uncover more about the new paradigm we have adopted. Kuhn believes that different paradigms posit different things to exist in the world and are therefore incommensurable with each other. Another way of viewing this is that paradigms describe new languages, which allow us to describe the world in new ways. Kuhn was a fallibilist; he believed that all scientific paradigms (e.g. classical Newtonian mechanics, Einsteinian relativity) should be assumed to be, on the whole, false but good for a time as they give scientists new ideas to play around with. Kuhn's fallibilism, holism, emphasis on incommensurability, and ideas concerning objective reality are themes which often show up in neopragmatist writings.\n\nParagraph 7: John Day, Sr., although he was a fairly successful cabinetmaker, often found himself in debt due to alcoholism and gambling, and he moved the family around often to find business in order to earn an income. This problem brought the Day family to North Carolina in 1817, where John went to work for Thomas Reynolds, a furniture craftsman, to pay off his debts, including that from the migration bond imposed on incoming free Blacks by the state of North Carolina. It is around this time that John Day, Jr., and Thomas Day begin their own cabinet shop in order to earn their own income, moving to Milton to establish their furniture business. After some time working in North Carolina, John Day, Jr. left the furniture business to pursue ministry, moving back to Virginia with his own family, where he owned a home and a few slaves. After a schism with the Baptist church there, he migrated to Liberia where he helped found the colony itself, set up its government, and was a missionary. Thomas Day remained in Milton as a craftsman and achieved success and respect for his skill, and in 1829 he married Aquilla Wilson of Halifax County, Virginia; she, too, was a free Black. However, due to the increasingly strict migration laws imposed by the state of North Carolina, Wilson was barred from entering North Carolina. Upon hearing of this, the townspeople of Milton beseeched the state General Assembly on Day's behalf to allow Wilson to enter the state and live with her husband, stating that a man of Day's status and skill deserved such respect. Even the state Attorney General and lawmaker Romulus Saunders, having been acquainted with Day's craft skill and strong work ethic, testified on his behalf. It was Day's social status and his crafting skill that gained him the support of the white Milton community and eventually led to Wilson being granted a waiver to enter the state. Day and his wife had three children, Mary Ann, Devereux, and Thomas Jr, who were educated in the North. The Day family were also prominent members in the Milton Presbyterian Church, and Aquilla was Day's business partner. In the church, Day and his family were highly respected and they worshipped in the white section of the sanctuary; referred to as Mr. Day by church leadership, Day had the rare privilege to host church sessions in his own home as well as to craft the church pews.\n\nParagraph 8: Inside the church, the nave is wide and the aisles are narrow, forming passages.  The arcades are carried on round piers.  The walls of the chancel curve forward to incorporate the pulpit on one side and the reading desk on the other. Above the pulpit is a sounding board, the underside of which is lined with beaten copper.  On the front of the pulpit is a shield inscribed with Fiat Lux (Let there be light), and on the front of the reading desk is a carved eagle.  Behind the altar is a wooden reredos carved by H. H. Martyn of Cheltenham based on Leonardo da Vinci's Last Supper.  On each side of the chancel are finely carved wooden choir stalls.  Above those on the east side is an elaborate canopy in memory of Henry Tate carved by C. J. Allen.  The font was also carved by Allen; it is movable and was designed by Ronald Potter Jones.  When it was built, the church was wired for electricity.  This supplied power for the series of copper electroliers in the nave, which are in Arts and Crafts style and made by the Artificers' Guild of London.\n\nParagraph 9: On September 26, 2011, Chait, while admitting he had not read Gilad Atzmon's book The Wandering Who, in order to assess the context of a number of quotes, responded to John Mearsheimer's comment about Atzmon's book by citing passages which he regarded as characteristically anti-semitic. On January 27, 2015, Chait wrote an article for New York magazine on political correctness, which he labeled \"a system of left-wing ideological repression\" and cited examples from academia and social media. Chait's piece drew parallels between forms of political correctness popular in the 2010s with those popular in the 1990s. However, he also argued that the advent of social media had contributed to a form of political correctness that was more ubiquitous and less constrained to academia.\n\nParagraph 10: In the season premiere \"Lines We Cross\", Dante works with Siddiq in the infirmary and checks on Siddiq while he suffers from hallucinations and PTSD. Dante helps at the crash site to help put out the fire and attends to injured survivors. In the episode \"Ghosts\", Dante tells Siddiq that he was a field medic during combat in Iraq and suffered from PTSD after losing his entire military squad. In the episode \"Silence the Whisperers\", Dante treats an injured Lydia in the infirmary and Daryl arrives to check on her. In the episode \"What It Always Is\", Dante radios Siddiq to update him on Alexandria while he is at the Hilltop. In the episode \"Bonds\", at Alexandria, Siddiq and Dante rush to fight off a fast-moving infection within Alexandria, the cause of which they struggle to identify. In the episode \"Open Your Eyes\", Dante discovers that the medical kit being used to treat a prisoner's wounds contained hemlock, which was mistakenly given to him; Siddiq blames himself, as he realizes that he accidentally added the hemlock to the bag due to his fatigue. After seeing Dante burying one of the older infected women that he had grown close to, Siddiq attempts to commit suicide by drowning himself, but is rescued by Rosita. As they talk, Siddiq has a realization and rushes to test the water supply, discovering it to be contaminated; he blames himself for failing to notice. After decontaminating the water supply, Dante tries to cheer up a depressed Siddiq, reassuring him that what happened wasn't his fault. While doing so, Dante then makes a strange verbal tic which causes Siddiq to have another lucid dream, in which he remembers one of the Whisperers' making the same tic during the decapitation of several fair attendees. He realizes that Dante is a Whisperer agent who helped Alpha sneak into the Kingdom's fair and capture the victims. He moves to attack Dante, but Dante gets the upper hand and is able to subdue and choke him to death. In the first part finale \"The World Before\", it is shown that in  flashback several months after the blizzard, Alpha chooses and assigns Dante, due to his loyalty and because Lydia doesn't know him, to infiltrate Alexandria as her spy and sabotage the community from the inside for the impending war between them. It is revealed that Dante is the one who painted the \"Silence the Whispers\" graffiti, sabotaged the water supply, and suffocated Cheryl to death. In the present, Rosita goes to visit Siddiq, but finds Dante who attacks her. Rosita is able to stab Dante in the shoulder with a knife and is forced to put down a reanimated Siddiq, before beating Dante unconscious. Daryl, Carol, Gabriel, and Rosita interrogate Dante. That evening in Alexandria, Gabriel visits an imprisoned Dante and ends up stabbing him to death.\n\nParagraph 11: With Norwich out of the top flight there was much speculation surrounding Ashton's future at the club, with some people believing a player with his qualities merited a place in the Premier League. Many clubs, including Manchester City and Charlton Athletic, considered him; the Addicks manager, Alan Curbishley, was reportedly prepared to axe six of his players to buy the Norwich youngster. West Ham United were also among the clubs interested in buying the striker. Nigel Worthington attempted to quash these rumours, saying that Ashton would only be sold for a price which matched his value to the club. Wigan Athletic manager Paul Jewell was put off considering a move for Ashton because of this price. Dean Ashton re-stated his commitment to the club in the summer of 2005 by signing a contract-extension until 2009. By December, it looked likely that a Premiership club would bid for Ashton, as boss Nigel Worthington said that Ashton would be allowed to leave in January of that year – if the club are happy with the fee. Dean Ashton's future looked increasingly uncertain after missing the FA Cup match against West Ham through injury which meant Ashton was not cup-tied. After playing 46 matches for Norwich, in which he scored 18 goals, he was transferred to West Ham on 22 January 2006 for a fee of £7 million, rising to £7.25 million with two £125,000 bonuses dependent on a future England call-up and possible European qualification while Ashton is at West Ham. Norwich also negotiated a 15% sell-on clause.\n\nParagraph 12: A thin layer of grease made for this application can be applied to the ground glass surfaces to be connected, and the inner joint is inserted into the outer joint such that the ground glass surfaces of each are next to each other to make the connection. In addition to making a leak-tight connection, the grease lets two joints be later separated more easily. A potential drawback of such grease is that if used on laboratory glassware for a long time in high-temperature applications (such as for continuous distillation), the grease may eventually contaminate the chemicals. Also, reagents may react with the grease, especially under vacuum. For these reasons, it is advisable to apply a light ring of grease at the fat end of the taper and not its tip, to keep it from going inside the glassware. If the grease smears over the entire taper surface on mating, too much was used. Using greases specifically designed for this purpose is also a good idea, as these are often better at sealing under vacuum, thicker and so less likely to flow out of the taper, become fluidic at higher temperatures than Vaseline (a common substitute) and are more chemically inert than other substitutes.\n\nParagraph 13: Jordaens has depicted the biblical scene as an event occurring in 17th-century Flanders.  The composition shows two groups of people: on the left people are on a ferryboat which is setting off and on the right is a group with a man (Saint Peter) pulling a fish from the water and looking at the coin he has found in its mouth. Only the apostles on the right surrounding Peter are concerned with him and his find. All passengers on the ferry are just minding their own business and do not pay any attention to the miraculous find that is occurring on the jetty. The gunwale of the ferryboat is only just clear of the water as the boat is heavily loaded with animals and passengers of all ages and nationalities.  Within the group on the boat can be distinguished a man hoisting the sail and another one pushing the boat from the jetty with an oar.  They are  stocky, muscular men solely wearing loincloths. Behind them watching their work and huddled together are several persons, one of them a child crying because his apple has fallen into the water. The group on the boat includes an African man, possibly a trader, in an exotic turban and with a white horse.  The sky is covered with dark clouds. It must be windy as there are high waves on the river and a boat in the distance seems to be struggling. Two persons on the ferry are holding the rims of their hats to prevent them from flying away as the boat violently sets off.   The scene on the boat with its lively crowd is the centre piece of the composition.  It overshadows the scene on the right which is being watched from the boat by a peasant leaning on his cow. He is the only one who is not affected by the violent jerk, because he is witnessing the miraculous event on the jetty. He is looking at the large coin which a swarthy fisherman holds in his hand after finding it in the mouth of a large fish which he is still holding with his other hand. This almost naked fisherman is sitting on the jetty while four men who are no different from the rest of the people in the boat, either, are bending over him to see the coin, with expressions of amazement.", "answers": ["Paragraph 9"], "length": 3478, "dataset": "passage_retrieval_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "3360840c325e1ae8dd1d73e490c11b9d69f463e2ebec9e89"}
{"input": "FBI Special Agent Aloysius X.L. Pendergast and Sergeant Vincent D'Agosta are investigating a series of unusual deaths that seem to be connected to pacts made with Lucifer. The investigation leads them from New York City to Florence, Italy, where they uncover the motives and methods of the killers. Along the way, they also discover the truth about a missing Stradivarius violin and prevent a potentially apocalyptic riot involving Messianic Christians. Pendergast also reveals information about his deranged brother, Diogenes, and his sinister plans.", "context": "Paragraph 1: Borgata was part of a major project in Atlantic City nicknamed \"The Tunnel Project\", started around 1999. When Steve Wynn planned the Le Jardin in Atlantic City, he wanted to connect a $330 million  tunnel from the Atlantic City Expressway to the new resort, later named the Atlantic City-Brigantine Connector, which would funnel incoming traffic off the Atlantic City Expressway into the city's marina district. This caused major controversy, as it would cut through a residential neighborhood; competitor Donald Trump sued Wynn for it saying that it was a \"driveway\" to Wynn's casino. The Tunnel Project did progress, even after Le Jardin was cancelled, and finally opened in 2001.\n\nParagraph 2: On the day of the battle, there was a heavy rain. Maad Semou Gallo Joof (son of Maad Amad Ngoneh) with his cousin Mbagne Somb Faye and their griots led an attack on the Muslim Marabout forces. The Serer strategy was to push the Muslim Marabout forces into Somb where a strong resistance had been prepared and to prevent them from entering Thiouthioune. The strategy failed. Maba and his army successfully entered Thiouthioune. However at Thiouthioune, Maba's army faced a strong resistance by some of the retinue forces of King Amad Ngoneh of Thiouthioune, which included Maad Semou Gallo Joof and the princes: Gniba Dior Joof, Madior Latdjigué and Biram Joof. The battle took place between Somb and Thiouthioune and lasted three quarters of the morning. In the early stages of the battle, the Muslim  Marabouts prevailed. The princes and Maad (King) Semou Gallo Joof were killed. The prince Mbagne Somb Faye committed suicide when he was captured by the Muslim Marabouts.  Around 12 pm, it started to rain. Maba and his army took refuge in the coppices which surrounded the pond of Fandane and attempted to dry off their arms. Around that time, Maad Kumba Ndoffene Famak had left Ndoffane Nomad with his army and moving towards Fandane to defend it. Before his arrival, Damel-Teigne  Lat-Dior Ngoneh Latyr and Bourba Jolof Alboury Sainabou (both valiant and experienced warriors) contemplated withdrawing from the battle at around 2 pm (tisbâr time – Muslim prayer time in the afternoon). Damel-Teigne Lat Dior reported to Maba that, he had heard the sound of Sine's junjung approaching, and Maad Kumba Ndoffene Famak is bound to be among them.  He tried to discuss an exit strategy because the Sine army would be too strong for them. Maba was not interested in an exit strategy, his mission was to Islamize and conquer Serer Sine. When Maad Kumba Ndoffene Famak and his army, accompanied by the King of Patar; the King of Poukham and the Sandigue Ndiob arrived on the scene, they interposed between the Muslim Marabout forces and the Kingdom of Saloum locking the Marabouts in Sine and cutting off their exit route into Nioro du Rip (Maba's residence), via Saloum. Damel-Teigne Lat Dior Ngoné Latyr and Bourba Jolof Alboury Sainabou Njie realising that the cause has been lost, abandoned Maba in the battlefield. They fought their way out of the battlefield, the Damel-Teigne escaped and headed towards Cayor and the Bourba Jolof towards Gossas.  The Serer army defeated the Muslim Marabouts.  Maba was killed at Fandane and so was the Serer Prince Makhoureja Ngoneh Joof whom according to some was responsible for killing Maba. The King of Sine was injured. Many of Maba's men fell at Fandane-Thiouthioune. His generals such as Mama Gaolo Nyang were held prisoners. Mama Gaolo was released two days after the battle to go and relay the incident in his country. After Maba had been killed, Maad Kumba Ndoffene Famak had his head cut off and his limbs dismembered.  He then sent an arm and the head, with a letter to the French commandant at Gorée to announce his victory. The remains of Maba's body were scattered in several parts of Sine, including Felir, Samba Toude, Ndialgué and towards Thiamassas. According to some scholars such as Diagne, Becker, Cheikh Diouf, Klein, etc., Maad Kumba Ndoffene Famak's letter and action was a threat to the French administration in Senegal, especially his succeeding letter sent to the French governor which listed the prominent members of Maba's army that had fallen in the Sine.\n\nParagraph 3: The abolition of the Ottoman Sultanate by the Grand National Assembly of Turkey on 1 November 1922 ended the Ottoman Empire, which had lasted since 1299. On 11 November 1922, at the Conference of Lausanne, the sovereignty of the Grand National Assembly exercised by the Government in Angora (now Ankara) over Turkey was recognized. The last sultan, Mehmed VI, departed the Ottoman capital, Constantinople (now Istanbul), on 17 November 1922. The legal position was solidified with the signing of the Treaty of Lausanne on 24 July 1923. In March 1924, the Caliphate was abolished, marking the end of Ottoman influence. This shocked the Sunni clerical world, and some felt the need to present Islam not as a traditional religion but as an innovative socio-political ideology of a modern nation-state. The success of the October Revolution, also known as the Bolshevik Revolution, in Russia led by the Bolshevik Party of Vladimir Lenin in 1917 was a source of inspiration. In British India, the Khilafat movement (1919–24) following World War I was led by Shaukat Ali, Maulana Mohammad Ali Jauhar, Hakim Ajmal Khan and Abul Kalam Azad as an expression of this desperation. The reaction to new realities of the modern world gave birth to Islamist ideologues like Rashid Rida and Abul A'la Maududi and organizations such as Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt and Majlis-e-Ahrar-ul-Islam in India. Rashid Rida was a prominent Salafi theologian of Egypt who called for the revival of Hadith studies in Sunni seminaries and a pioneering theoretician of Islamism in the modern age. During 1922–1923, Rida would publish a series of articles in Al-Manar titled “The Caliphate or the Supreme Imamate”. In this highly influential treatise, Rida advocates for the restoration of Caliphate ruled by muslim jurists and proposes gradualist measures of education, reformation and purification through the efforts of Salafiyya reform movements across the globe. Ayatullah Khomeini's book government of the jurist is greatly influenced by this book, so is his call to the pure Islam () and his analysis of the post-colonial Muslim world. Sayyid Rashid Rida, a student of Muhammad Abduh, had visited India in 1912 and was impressed by the Deoband and Nadwatul Ulama seminaries. These seminaries carried the legacy of Syed Ahmad Barelvi and his pre-modern Islamic emirate. Maududi was an Islamist ideologue and Hanafi Sunni scholar active in Hyderabad Deccan and later in Pakistan. Maududi was born to a clerical family and got his early education at home. At the age of eleven, he was admitted to a public school in Aurangabad. In 1919, he joined the Khilafat Movement and got closer to the scholars of Deoband. He commenced the dars-i nizami education under supervision of Deobandi seminary at the Fatihpuri mosque in Delhi. In 1925, he wrote a book on Jihad, al-Jihad fil-Islam(), that can be regarded as his first contribution to islamism. He was a prolific writer and wrote many books. His writings had a profound impact on Sayyid Qutb.\n\nParagraph 4: FBI Special Agent Aloysius X.L. Pendergast and Sergeant Vincent D'Agosta, now working for the Southampton Police Department, investigate a series of unusual deaths—deaths that appear to be the work of Lucifer in return for pacts entered in with him by his victims.  Their investigation takes them from the New York City area, site of the first two deaths, to Florence, Italy where they uncover the motive and method of the killers behind the strange and gruesome deaths.  During the course of unraveling the mystery, the truth behind a priceless, missing Stradivarius violin is revealed and a potentially apocalyptic riot with Messianic Christians is averted. Pendergast also reveals details of his insane brother Diogenes, whom he believes is planning something horrible.\n\nParagraph 5: In addition, while he was the Vatican's chief astronomer, Fr. George Coyne issued a statement on 18 November 2005 saying that \"Intelligent design isn't science even though it pretends to be. If you want to teach it in schools, intelligent design should be taught when religion or cultural history is taught, not science.\" Cardinal Paul Poupard added that \"the faithful have the obligation to listen to that which secular modern science has to offer, just as we ask that knowledge of the faith be taken in consideration as an expert voice in humanity.\" He also warned of the permanent lesson we have learned from the Galileo affair, and that \"we also know the dangers of a religion that severs its links with reason and becomes prey to fundamentalism.\" Fiorenzo Facchini, professor of evolutionary biology at the University of Bologna, called intelligent design unscientific, and wrote in the January 16–17, 2006 edition L'Osservatore Romano: \"But it is not correct from a methodological point of view to stray from the field of science while pretending to do science. ...It only creates confusion between the scientific plane and those that are philosophical or religious.\" Kenneth R. Miller is another prominent Catholic scientist widely known for opposing Young Earth Creationism and Intelligent Design. He writes, concerning Emeritus pope Benedict XVI, that \"The Holy Father's concerns are not with evolution per se, but with how evolution is to be understood in our modern world. Biological evolution fits neatly into a traditional Catholic understanding of how contingent natural processes can be seen as part of God's plan ...a careful reading suggests that the new pope will give quarter neither to the enemies of spirituality nor the enemies of evolutionary science. And that's exactly as it should be.\"\n\nParagraph 6: In the opening game of the season, he made his debut in a 3–2 win over Wimbledon. On 24 September 2011, he scored his first goal for Bristol Rovers away at Morecambe, which won the match for Rovers 3–2. After the match, manager Buckle was pleased to see him back on track from his injury and said: \"We haven't seen too much of him because of injury and, as we build, get strong and get to know each other and add to the squad we will be fine. It's still all brand new and we have to keep working hard and hopefully there will be a lot more performances like (Saturday's).\" 20 days later on 14 October 2011, he scored his second goal of the season in a 5–2 rout against Rotherham United at the Memorial Stadium. On 29 October he added his to his tally with a goal in the 2–0 home win over Dagenham and Redbridge. 7 days later, he scored again in the 2–1 loss away at Accrington Stanley. On 4 December 2011, he scored his last goal of the season and set up a goal in 6–1 FA Cup rout against Totton. During his first season, the club would suffer losing form, leading to Buckle's sacking but under new manager Mark McGhee, the club would eventually survive relegation. For Anyinsah in the second half of the season, he was substituted very early in the first half in a 2–1 win over Morecambe and McGhee's action was explained when he changed formation from 4–4–2 to 4–3–3. Despite this, Anyinsah praised McGhee's impact, saying, \"It's been good. He's come in and he's just shaken up the place with the way he works. He's very thorough in his methods and he's got the players playing as he wants us to.\"''\n\nParagraph 7: Throughout the series, Shion has exhibited abilities unbecoming of most humans.  During the Gnosis' assault on the Woglinde, she was caught in close proximity to an FAE (fuel air explosion), which no ordinary human could possibly survive. Shion, however, was blown back by the explosion and left otherwise unscathed.  Shion has also demonstrated the peculiar ability to hear the Song of Nephilim, something which only Realians and U.R.T.V.s should be capable of (chaos has also demonstrated this ability, but his status as a \"human being\" remains ambiguous at best). During a Gnosis assault on the Woglinde, Shion was caught by a Gnosis in its immaterial state, which was able to grip onto her. She was able to escape crystallization and mysteriously avoided the fate of those whom did not survive such an encounter with a Gnosis, as those that comes into physical contact with Gnosis usually transformed into one. Andrew Cherenkov, for instance, suffered such a fate. This could be due to her status as the \"Maiden\" or her possession of what Wilhelm referred to as the \"Shining Will\", which is a prerequisite to become a Testament; it is said that those with the Shining Will will not Gnosify.\n\nParagraph 8: Charles A. Beard's An Economic Interpretation of the Constitution of the United States (1913) offered an explanation of the form and content of the U.S. Constitution by looking at the class background and economic interests of the Founding Fathers. Sir Lewis Namier produced an equally influential study of the 18th-century British House of Commons, and inspired a circle of historians whom Stone light-heartedly termed \"Namier Inc.\" Stone contrasted this older prosopography with what in 1971 was the newer form of quantitative prosopography, which concern was with much wider populations including, particularly, \"ordinary people\". An example of this kind of work, published slightly later, is Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie's pioneering work of microhistory, Montaillou (1975), which developed a picture of patterns of kinship and heresy, daily and seasonal routine, in a small Occitan village, the last pocket of Cathars, over a 30-year period from 1294 to 1324.\n\nParagraph 9: In 1979, the southwest end of runway 3-21 was extended 1,500 ft. and the entire runway was widened 50 ft., which allowed new Boeing 737 service operated by Frontier Airlines. The original runway has 13 inches of concrete from 1963 with additional concrete from 1979 at the southwest end and widened areas. Only a 660 ft area for runway safety area is built at the departure end of runway 21 due to the location of a localizer antenna compared to the compliant 1000 ft area at the end of runway 3. Therefore, runway 21 has a landing length of 7,000 versus 6660 ft on takeoffs and landings from runway 3.\n\nParagraph 10: After being rebuked by his studio, Touchstone Television, Washington issued a statement apologizing for repeating the word on the Golden Globes carpet. On January 30, 2007, a source told People magazine that Washington was scheduled to return to the Grey's Anatomy set as early on that Thursday for the first time since entering \"executive counseling\" after making the comments at the Golden Globes. However, on June 7, 2007, ABC announced it had decided not to renew Washington's contract, and that he would be dropped from the show. \"I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore,\" Washington said in a statement released by his publicist, borrowing the famous line from Network. In another report, Washington stated he was planning to \"spend the summer pursuing charity work in Sierra Leone, work on an independent film and avoid worrying about the show.\" In a subsequent interview, Washington claimed that \"they fired the wrong guy\", referring to Knight, and said he was considering filing a lawsuit as a result. He accused Knight of using the controversy to bolster his own career and increase his salary on Grey's Anatomy. Washington, in late June 2007, began asserting that racism within the media was a factor in his firing from the series. On July 2, 2007, Washington appeared on Larry King Live on CNN, to present his side of the controversy. According to Washington, he never used the \"F Word\" in reference to Knight, but rather blurted it out in an unrelated context in the course of an argument \"provoked\" by Dempsey, who, he felt, was treating him like a \"B-word,\" a \"P-word,\" and the \"F-word,\" which Washington said conveyed \"somebody who is being weak and afraid to fight back.\" Washington himself said that his dismissal from Grey's Anatomy was an unfortunate misunderstanding that he was eager to move past. He later stated that if he were to be asked to make a cameo appearance on the show, he would not hesitate to say \"yes.\" Washington's image was used in advertisements for the May 9, 2008 episode \"The Becoming.\" After this aired, Washington's attorney Peter Nelson contacted ABC and Screen Actors Guild and cited this as an unlawful use of his client's image. His publicist, Howard Bragman, told The Hollywood Reporter that \"they have the rights of the character to advance the story, but not the image\" and stated he expected this to result in a \"financial settlement\", but it is still uncertain whether this ultimately happened.\n\nParagraph 11: On release, A Clockwork Orange was met with mixed reviews. Vincent Canby of The New York Times praised the film: \"McDowell is splendid as tomorrow's child, but it is always Mr. Kubrick's picture, which is even technically more interesting than 2001. Among other devices, Mr. Kubrick constantly uses what I assume to be a wide-angle lens to distort space relationships within scenes, so that the disconnection between lives, and between people and environment, becomes an actual, literal fact.\" The following year, after the film won the New York Film Critics Award, he called it \"a brilliant and dangerous work, but it is dangerous in a way that brilliant things sometimes are\". The film also had notable detractors. Film critic Stanley Kauffmann commented, \"Inexplicably, the script leaves out Burgess' reference to the title\". Roger Ebert gave A Clockwork Orange two stars out of four, calling it an \"ideological mess\".  In her New Yorker review titled \"Stanley Strangelove\", Pauline Kael called it pornographic because of how it dehumanised Alex's victims while highlighting the sufferings of the protagonist. Kael derided Kubrick as a \"bad pornographer\", noting the Billyboy's gang extended stripping of the very buxom woman they intended to rape, claiming it was offered for titillation.", "answers": ["Paragraph 4"], "length": 3079, "dataset": "passage_retrieval_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "89c41e6f996726b65faf0a95464cb93699a397eaff092614"}
{"input": "The text discusses the achievements and contributions of an individual named Bourne. In 1969, Bourne became an assistant professor at Emory University, working in the fields of psychiatry, preventive medicine, and community health. He played a significant role in expanding a federally-funded Community Health Center into the first standalone community mental health center in Georgia. Bourne also actively participated in efforts to promote integration in Georgia and the South. He and his first wife led a campaign to challenge Georgia's strict abortion laws, filing a lawsuit on behalf of a patient seeking an abortion. The case, known as Doe vs Bolton, eventually reached the Supreme Court, alongside the well-known Roe vs Wade case, leading to a significant ruling that transformed women's access to abortion in the US. Bourne has also been involved with the American Psychiatric Association, chairing their Task Force on Drugs and Drug Abuse Education and serving on the Task Force on the Treatment of Psychiatric Disorders. He has served on the editorial board of the journal Psychiatry since 1969 and was honored with the title of Distinguished Life Fellow of the APA in 2008. In 1972, he was recognized as one of \"The Five Outstanding Young Men in Georgia.\"", "context": "Paragraph 1: While working at the company, Ziglar became interested in self-help and motivational speaking and began giving speeches of his own. With Richard \"Dick\" Gardner and Hal Krause, Ziglar was a charter member in the establishment of American Salesmasters in 1963. The company's objective was to raise the image of salespeople in America by providing seminars. They began with cities across the South and Midwest (Memphis, Atlanta, Kansas City, St. Louis, Chicago, Denver, etc.), featuring speakers such as Ziglar, Norman Vincent Peale, Ken McFarland, Cavett Robert, Bill Gove, Maxwell Maltz, and Red Motley. They booked an auditorium, put together a slate of speakers and contacted local businesses to sell tickets. Audiences included insurance agents, car salesmen, financial advisors, entrepreneurs, small business owners and curiosity seekers.\n\nParagraph 2: “What methods have I used?\" said Griswold. “Why, honest ones, I hope. I have tried to make a good publication and sell it upon its merits. That has been my formula of success. Difficulties? Well, I have known what it is to live on three dollars a week. It has not been all plain sailing. But there has always been plenty of encouragement to go on, and at present my journal is on an extremely satisfactory footing. No, I don't think that a woman has any advantage over a man in the publishing field—certainly she had many disadvantages ten years ago, for women had not begun to do so large a share of the world's work, and when she went into business there were many who looked askance at her efforts. Those days are past, happily, and now she is on an equal footing with men—is at liberty to go ahead unquestioned and do the best that lies in her. In the advertising field there are probably as good opportunities as in other departments of business. In fact, there are some notably successful women in advertising and publishing. Miss Keyes, of the Semi—ready Clothing Company, is one right here in New York, while in Chicago there is Mrs. Dr. Ellen Sage, who was formerly with the J. Walter Thompson agency, and who is now an independent ad writer. In publishing, there are Miss Caro M. Clarke and Miss Helen Winslow, of Boston. Miss Clarke has been very successful as a publisher of fiction, and was almost the first to use billboard advertising as a medium for exploiting novels. Women are successful as advertising solicitors, while in ad writing there are many lines that she can handle to better advantage than men provided she has equal ability. Her viewpoint gives her certain advantages, of course, but it is all a matter of ability. The day is gone when she can be classed by herself. The February issue of Profitable Advertising is to be a woman's number, dealing with her work in the field of publicity, and I think that it will be something of a revelation. As for the woman who wishes to embark in advertising — well, if she has ability, I believe it better for her to enter upon actual work as the associate of an advertising manager. Real experience transcends all theory. Such positions almost invariably give her experience of retail advertising, which seems to be the natural point of beginning in an advertising career. Retail advertising operations bring one into close touch with readers. You fire at short range and fire often, and the experience gained is invaluable in general publicity.\" \n\nParagraph 3: The Proclamation of Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity was made by the Director-General of UNESCO starting in 2001 to raise awareness of intangible cultural heritage and encourage local communities to protect them and the local people who sustain these forms of cultural expressions. Several manifestations of intangible heritage around the world were awarded the title of Masterpieces to recognize the value of the non-material component of culture, as well as entail the commitment of states to promote and safeguard the Masterpieces. Further proclamations occurred biennially. In 2008, the 90 previously proclaimed Masterpieces were incorporated into the new Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity as its first entries.\n\nParagraph 4: One of CDF's most famous discoveries is the observation of the top quark in February 1995.  The existence of the top quark was hypothesized after the observation of the Upsilon at Fermilab in 1977, which was found to consist of a bottom quark and an anti-bottom quark. The Standard Model, which today is the most widely accepted theory describing the particles and interactions, predicted the existence of three generations of quarks. The first generation quarks are the up and down quarks, second generation quarks are strange and charm, and third generation are top and bottom. The existence of the bottom quark solidified physicists’ conviction that the top quark existed. The top quark was the very last quark to be observed, mostly due to its comparatively high mass. Whereas the masses of the other quarks range from .005 GeV (up quark) to 4.7GeV (bottom quark), the top quark has a mass of 175 GeV. Only Fermilab’s Tevatron had the energy capability to produce and detect top anti-top pairs. The large mass of the top quark caused the top quark to decay almost instantaneously, within the order of 10−25 seconds, making it extremely difficult to observe. The Standard Model predicts that the top quark may decay leptonically into a bottom quark and a W boson. This W boson may then decay into a lepton and neutrino (t→Wb→ѵlb). Therefore, CDF worked to reconstruct top events, looking specifically for evidence of bottom quarks, W bosons neutrinos. Finally in February 1995, CDF had enough evidence to say that they had \"discovered\" the top quark. On February 24, CDF and DØ experimenters simultaneously submitted papers to Physical Review Letters describing the observation of the top quark. The two collaborations announced the discovery publicly at a seminar at Fermilab on March 2 and the papers were published on April 3.\n\nParagraph 5: The Aviation Safety Reporting System, or ASRS, is the US Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) voluntary confidential reporting system that allows pilots, air traffic controllers, cabin crew, dispatchers, maintenance technicians, ground operations, and UAS operators and drone flyers to confidentially report near misses or close call events in the interest of improving aviation safety. The ASRS collects, analyzes, and responds to voluntarily submitted aviation safety incident reports in order to reduce the likelihood of aviation accidents. The ASRS was designed and is operated by NASA, who is seen as a neutral third-party due to its lack of enforcement authority and relations with airlines. The confidential and independent nature of the ASRS is key to its long-term success in identifying numerous latent system hazards in the National Airspace System (NAS). The FAA extends limited immunity to individual aviation workers for reporting safety events which do not result in an accident, as defined by the FAA. This has the effect of encouraging these potential reporters to come forward with systemic safety issues without fear of reprisal. The success of the system stands as a positive example used as a model by other industries seeking to make improvements in safety. Other industries who have modeled similar systems on the ASRS include the rail, medical, firefighters, and off-shore petroleum production.\n\nParagraph 6: For the first seven years she experienced a normal childhood. She lived in Los Angeles, California until 1942 when President Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066, causing her and her family to be evacuated. They were forced to leave their home and be taken to Manzanar. They rode in large greyhound buses from Los Angeles to Manzanar, a drive that takes about three hours and forty five minutes today. At the time she was only seven years old. She did not understand what was happening because she had no concept of war. She and her family spent the next three years in the camp, attempting to live a \"normal\" life behind barbed wire, under the watch of armed guards in searchlight towers. Conditions in the camp were awful and sickness spread throughout the camp quickly. This can be attributed to the compactness of the camp. Nearly 10,000 inmates lived in a 500 acre square, and this caused a lot of illness. Adapting to the climate was also difficult. Winters were very cold, and summers were very hot. The food they were provided was canned military food. It was not uncommon for prisoners to not eat because the food was not the traditional food they were accustomed to. Water in the camp was unclean, and it often caused Dysentery. Despite their efforts, obstacles managed to get in the way: her father's drinking habits and aggressive abuse, having no freedom, and very little space in the cubicles. In her book, Farewell to Manzanar, Jeanne describes the living conditions, \"After dinner we were taken to Block 16, a cluster of fifteen barracks that had just been finished a day or so earlier—although finished was hardly a word for it. The shacks were built of pine planking covered with tarpaper. They sat on concrete footings, with about two feet of open space between the floorboards and the ground. Gaps showed between the planks, and as the weeks passed and the green wood dried out, the gaps widened. Knotholes gaped in the uncovered floor.” She goes on to explain the size and layout of the barracks. They were divided into six units that were sixteen long by twenty feet wide, and a singular light bulb hung from the ceiling. They had an oil stove for heat as well as two army blankets each, some mattress covers and steel army cots. However, things eventually improved, and they learned to adapt to their environment. Several years after leaving the camp in 1945, Jeanne went to San Jose State College (now San José State University) where she studied sociology and journalism and participated in the marching band's flag team. She met her husband James D. Houston there, and they married in 1957. Jeanne later decided to tell her story about the time she spent in Manzanar in Farewell to Manzanar, co-authored by her husband, in 1972. Ten years after their marriage, in 1967, Jeanne gave birth to a girl. Six years later she gave birth to twins.\n\nParagraph 7: In 1966, López was elected as a senator and negotiated the return of the MRL to the Liberal Party in 1967. This same year López traveled to the city of Valledupar after being appointed by President Carlos Lleras Restrepo as the first governor of Cesar Department, a newly created province in the northern Caribbean Region of Colombia. López was able to trace his grandmothers' family ancestors \"the Pumarejos,\" back to this town. During those years, he was also instrumental in the creation of the Vallenato Legend Festival (nowadays, one of the most important cultural events in Colombia) along with vallenato composer Rafael Escalona and journalist Consuelo Araújo. He served as governor of Cesar from December 21, 1967, until August 14, 1968.\n\nParagraph 8: Moments before being crowned as the new emperor, La Gour's secret was finally publicly divulged by his jealous and ambitious bastard cousin, Zu Zambajil. He was branded a traitor, stripped of his title, separated from his pregnant wife and then imprisoned. Lozaria later dies during childbirth while the helpless La Gour could only weep in mourning behind bars. With the aid of the rebels he was able to escape from prison. La Gour then led a rebellion against the empire, but his ragtag troops of former slaves were simply no match against the superior might of the Boazanian military. Even though La Gour was adamant to fight alongside the rebels until the bitter end, his desperate comrades urged the former to live on; they sacrificed themselves in order for La Gour to board their last remaining space saucer which the latter then used to reach planet Earth. Wounded and unconscious in a foreign world, La Gour was found near his ship's wreckage by a local woman, a scientist named Mitsuyo Goh, whom he later marries. Fearing Zu Zambajil's inter-planetary conquest ambitions, La Gour (who now goes by the name Professor Kentaro Goh) collaborated with his wife, as well as premier Earth scientist Professor Hamaguchi and Earth International Defense Force commander General Oka to design and construct Voltes V, his greatest creation and the ultimate defense against a potential Boazanian invasion. After the birth of their third and youngest son, Hiyoshi, Professor Kentaro Goh tearfully left his newfound world and family; he returned to Boazania as a diplomat in a peaceful effort to abate the cruelty and tyranny of the now current reigning emperor, Zu Zambajil. Instead of listening to Professor Goh's appeal of non-violence towards other planets, the ruthless monarch offered his long lost cousin the lofty designation of being lead designer to Boazania's inter-planetary war machine. Disgusted by how vile and despotic Zu Zambajil had become, Professor Goh vehemently refused the Boazanian emperor's proposition and was therefore incarcerated.\n\nParagraph 9: In 1969, Bourne returned to Emory University as an assistant professor of psychiatry, preventive medicine and community health. He ran the mental health department of a federally-funded Community Health Center which he eventually expanded into the first free-standing community mental health center in Georgia. He also continued to play an active role in the integration efforts in Georgia and the South. Together with his first wife, Judith Rooks, Bourne led an effort to overturn Georgia's restrictive abortion laws. Having failed in the state legislature, together with other plaintiffs, they filed suit against the state on behalf of Jane Doe, a patient seeking an abortion for whom Bourne was the physician of record. Following victories for the plaintiffs in the state courts the case, as Doe vs Bolton, was appealed to the Supreme Court of the US. It was heard together with the better known case from Texas, Roe vs Wade. The court's watershed ruling based on the two cases transformed women's access to abortion in the US. He was active with the American Psychiatric Association (APA), chairing the organization's Task Force on Drugs and Drug Abuse Education and serving on the Task Force on the Treatment of Psychiatric Disorders. He has served on the editorial board of the journal Psychiatry since 1969. In 2008 he was made a Distinguished Life Fellow of the APA. In 1972 he was named one of \"The Five Outstanding Young Men in Georgia.\"\n\nParagraph 10: According to the driver, the train slid due to the rain and hail, as he noticed it, he attempted to brake and later tried to deactivate the autopilot system. As both actions failed, he contacted the Central Control Center to request them to cut the energy. The Center did not reply and, as he realized the train would impact the parked one, he decided to jump out of the cab before the crash. According to the train event recorder, the train had reached  at the Oceanía–Terminal Aérea slope (whose subsidence increased to at least 7% since its opening) and the driver did brake, reducing the speed to , but was ineffective as the tracks were wet and the slope increased the speed to . The Metro system director, Joel Ortega, concluded that the accident was mainly a consequence of a \"double human error\"; the first one caused by the driver, who did not deactivate the autopilot when he was requested to do so, and the second by the Central Control Center regulator, who did not request Train No. 5 to stop at any point, even when the Train No. 4's driver had warned he would stop the train due to the obstruction.\n\nParagraph 11: Detroit: Become Human received generally favourable reviews. Destructoids Chris Carter said that, despite tiring of Quantic Dream's penchant for detective stories, he enjoyed its execution and Connor's \"calm demeanor and android origin\". Carter praised the setting, calling it \"believable\" and \"captivating\", while also noting that the \"smaller moments\" were among its strengths. Michael Goroff of Electronic Gaming Monthly favoured the fact that the playable characters were androids because their second-class citizenship status created an \"effective viewpoint\". The controls and quick-time events were also subject to approval. Goroff lauded the \"incredibly satisfying and sometimes unexpected\" impact of the collective decisions and declared this the game's \"biggest accomplishment\". Writing for Game Informer, Kimberley Wallace agreed with Carter's assessment of the \"little moments\" and said the character development was \"fun to watch\", well-handled, and the \"highlight of the game\". She appreciated how the branching narratives affected the latter parts and complimented Quantic Dream for the \"impressive\" achievement. Paul Tamburro at Game Revolution wrote that Detroit: Become Human boasted a \"compelling world ... enriched by fantastic performances and state-of-the-art motion-capturing\". He commended Curry, Dechart, and Williams for their \"engrossing performances\" and said the game was among \"the most well-acted\" around. He also felt the choices \"drastically\" changed the story. Peter Brown of GameSpot welcomed the variety of cycling between characters for ensuring player engagement. The game's \"most dreadful and horrific scenes\" made a considerable impression on Brown, some of which he found to be \"truly unforgettable\". Additionally, he remarked that the visuals were beautiful and \"captivating to behold\". GamesRadar+s Andy Hartup praised Quantic Dream for making \"an interactive story capable of provoking genuine, honest, and varied emotions\". He thought the consequences of the decisions were \"utterly delightful\", albeit rarely, and saw the setting as \"beautiful\". Hartup liked the character models, calling them \"the most remarkable you’ll see in gaming\", and favoured the eyes in particular. On the decision-making aspects, he proclaimed Detroit: Become Human \"the new gold standard ... for meaningful choice in gaming\". Lucy O'Brien at IGN wrote that the game \"manages to be a frequently moving melodrama that bends to your choices with meaningful results\". She also praised the acting of Curry, Dechart, and Williams, observing different benefits to each character. O'Brien appraised the general plot as \"big, ambitious fun\" and the environments as \"beautifully detailed\". Like Goroff, Wallace, Tamburro, and Hartup, O'Brien found the \"branching paths to be multiple and deep\", while also complimenting the flowcharts, a feature Colm Ahern of VideoGamer.com singled out as one of the game's few redeeming qualities.\n\nParagraph 12: The Vienna Secession (; also known as the Union of Austrian Artists, or Vereinigung Bildender Künstler Österreichs) is an art movement, closely related to Art Nouveau, that was formed in 1897 by a group of Austrian painters, graphic artists, sculptors and architects, including Josef Hoffman, Koloman Moser, Otto Wagner and Gustav Klimt. They resigned from the Association of Austrian Artists in protest against its support for more traditional artistic styles.  Their most influential architectural work was the Secession Building designed by Joseph Maria Olbrich as a venue for expositions of the group.  Their official magazine was called Ver Sacrum (Sacred Spring, in Latin), which  published highly stylised and influential works of graphic art.  In 1905 the group itself split, when some of the most prominent members, including  Klimt, Wagner, and Hoffmann, resigned in a dispute over priorities, but it continued to function, and still functions today, from its headquarters in the Secession Building. In its current form, the Secession exhibition gallery is independently led and managed by artists.", "answers": ["Paragraph 9"], "length": 3405, "dataset": "passage_retrieval_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "d1a3433f92c83bfdb6f55cc101113b8e1a616035fc72ccf3"}

Kazamatsuri fights Mizoguchi, who only draws his sword after his opponent destroys his wooden sword. He then disarms Kazamatsuri near a cliff.  Kazamatsuri, admitting defeat, commits suicide by jumping off the cliff. Heishirō and the others go to the bottom, where there is no sign of Kazamatsuri's body, but Koharu spots the stolen sword at the bottom of the river, where Heishirō retrieves it.\n\nParagraph 2: The song received mixed reviews from critics. PopMatters described it as \"dripping with sexual energy and cool\" and is \"sexy as hell, but contains a pretty unmistakable edge of hostility, macho swagger, and thunderous chest thumping.\" Entertainment Weekly wrote that it was an \"appealing throwaway single\" and lyrics such as \"after you work up a sweat, you can play with the stick\" are not seductions; \"they're orders\". MusicOMH wrote that the chemistry between 50 Cent and Olivia \"is almost as explicit as the lyrics ... the bass line is made for grinding to\". Author Ethan Brown, in a review of The Massacre, called the track \"uninspiring\" and \"nearly identical\" to his previous collaboration with Lil' Kim on \"Magic Stick\". He stated that 50 Cent seemed too content with his \"hypersexual image\" among other things and \"not inspired enough to work beyond the same old attention-getting schemes.\" Pitchfork Media listed \"Candy Shop\" as a reprise of \"Magic Stick\" both \"in beats and in timbre\", and Stylus magazine said it was \"more of the same\" as his previous collaboration. Billboard wrote that 50 Cent \"shows little growth lyrically\" with the song being \"typical playa-friendly fodder\". The song was nominated at the 2006 Grammy Awards for Best Rap Song, but lost to Kanye West's \"Diamonds from Sierra Leone\".\n\nParagraph 3: On December 10, 2011, the UCLA Bruins announced the hiring of Mora as head coach, replacing alumnus Rick Neuheisel. Mora signed a five-year contract for $12 million, plus incentives. He immediately went to work as the head coach by hiring Adrian Klemm, Steve Broussard, Demetrice Martin and Eric Yarber as assistant coaches. Less than two months later, the results came early, as UCLA landed a consensus No. 12-ranked recruiting class in 2012 after having a class ranked in the high 40s at Rick Neuheisel's departure. In his first season as head coach, the 2012 UCLA team went 9–5, including a victory over rival USC by a score of 38–28 and clinching the Pac-12 South title for the second year in a row. Standout players that year included freshman quarterback Brett Hundley, NFL first-round draft pick defensive end Datone Jones, and UCLA's all-time leading rusher Johnathan Franklin. Building on the team's success, Mora landed the No. 11-ranked recruiting class of 2013, UCLA's highest-ranked recruiting class in the last two decades. During the 2013 season, Mora and the Bruins finished 10–3 with notable wins over No. 23 ranked Nebraska (41–21) and No. 23 ranked USC (35–14), and a Sun Bowl win against Virginia Tech (42–12). In 2014, he led UCLA to their ninth 10-win season in school history, and just the third time in their history that they have won 10 games in consecutive seasons.\n\nParagraph 4: After the September 11 attacks in 2001, Rowley wrote a paper for FBI Director Robert Mueller documenting how FBI HQ personnel in Washington, D.C., had mishandled and failed to take action on information provided by the Minneapolis, Minnesota, Field Office regarding its investigation of suspected terrorist Zacarias Moussaoui. Moussaoui had been suspected of being involved in preparations for a suicide-hijacking similar to the December 1994 \"Eiffel Tower\" hijacking of Air France 8969. Failures identified by Rowley may have left the U.S. vulnerable to the September 11, 2001, attacks. Rowley was one of many agents frustrated by the events that led up to the attacks, writing:During the early aftermath of September 11th, when I happened to be recounting the pre–September 11th events concerning the Moussaoui investigation to other FBI personnel in other divisions or in FBIHQ, almost everyone's first question was \"Why?—Why would an FBI agent(s) deliberately sabotage a case?\" (I know I shouldn't be flippant about this, but jokes were actually made that the key FBI HQ personnel had to be spies or moles like Robert Hanssen who were actually working for Osama Bin Laden to have so undercut Minneapolis's effort.)Coleen Rowley APFN.org  Memo to FBI Director Robert Mueller.

The book received major notices upon publication, including a review from New York Times Book Review which wrote that the novel was \"brilliant and beautiful.\"  Some have favourably compared the book to earlier Southern Gothic American literature such as To Kill a Mockingbird and A Rose for Emily, while others, including Terry Gilliam and film producer Jeremy Thomas, have called the book a modern hybrid of Psycho and Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.  A subsequent United Kingdom paperback edition followed in 2003 from Weidenfeld & Nicolson, with Gilliam's infamous blurb on the cover: \"F*cking wonderful!\" Other editions have since been published in the Netherlands, Japan, France, Greece, Italy, Poland, Russia, Turkey, and Korea.\n\nParagraph 6: The play was first performed at the Apollo Theatre in London by the Incorporated Stage Society on 9 December 1928, starring a young Laurence Olivier, and soon moved to other West End theatres for a two-year run. It was included in Burns Mantle's The Best Plays of 1928–1929. The piece quickly became internationally popular, with numerous productions and tours in English and other languages. A 1930 film version was followed by other adaptations, and the play set a high standard for other works dealing with similar themes, and influenced playwrights including Noël Coward. It was Sherriff's seventh play. He considered calling it Suspense or Waiting, but eventually found a title in the closing line of a chapter of an unidentified book, \"It was late in the evening when we came at last to our journey's end\".\n\nParagraph 7: Under Emperor Wu of Han, the Han dynasty made China the regional power in East Asia, projecting much of its imperial power on its neighbours. Han China hosted the largest unified population in East Asia, the most literate and urbanised as well as being the most economically developed, as well as the most technologically and culturally advanced civilization in the region at the time. Cultural and religious interaction between the Chinese and other regional East Asian dynasties and kingdoms occurred. China's impact and influence on Korea began with the Han dynasty's northeastern expansion in 108 BC when the Han Chinese conquered the northern part of the Korean peninsula and established a province called Lelang. Chinese influence would soon take root in Korea through the inclusion of the Chinese writing system, monetary system, rice culture, and Confucian political institutions. Jomon society in ancient Japan incorporated wet-rice cultivation and metallurgy through its contact with Korea. Starting from the fourth century AD, Japan incorporated the Chinese writing system which evolved into Kanji by the fifth century AD and has become a significant part of the Japanese writing system. Utilizing the Chinese writing system allowed the Japanese to conduct their daily activities, maintain historical records and give form to various ideas, thoughts, and philosophies. During the Tang dynasty, China exerted its greatest influence on East Asia as various aspects of Chinese culture spread to Japan and Korea. As full-fledged medieval East Asian states were established, Korea by the fourth century AD and Japan by the seventh century AD, Japan and Korea actively began to incorporate Chinese influences such as Confucianism, the use of written Han characters, Chinese style architecture, state institutions, political philosophies, religion, urban planning, and various scientific and technological methods into their culture and society through direct contacts with Tang China and succeeding Chinese dynasties. Drawing inspiration from the Tang political system, Prince Naka no oe launched the Taika Reform in 645 AD where he radically transformed Japan's political bureaucracy into a more centralised bureaucratic empire. The Japanese also adopted Mahayana Buddhism, Chinese style architecture, and the imperial court's rituals and ceremonies, including the orchestral music and state dances had Tang influences. Written Chinese gained prestige and aspects of Tang culture such as poetry, calligraphy, and landscape painting became widespread. During the Nara period, Japan began to aggressively import Chinese culture and styles of government which included Confucian protocol that served as a foundation for Japanese culture as well as political and social philosophy. The Japanese also created laws adopted from the Chinese legal system that was used to govern in addition to the kimono, which was inspired from the Chinese robe (hanfu) during the eighth century AD. For many centuries, most notably from the 7th to the 14th centuries, China stood as East Asia's most advanced civilization and foremost military and economic power exerting its influence as the transmission of advanced Chinese cultural practices and ways of thinking greatly shaped the region up until the nineteenth century.\n\nParagraph 8: In 1833, John Adams hired on as a wild animal collector with a group of showmen. Several menageries were active in the New England area at this time, probably the largest was the June, Titus Company's National Menagerie also known as, Grand National Menagerie. Boston, Massachusetts was the venue for many such menageries while Adams was living there, so he had the opportunity to meet and interact with the proprietors and performers. There were also circuses and menageries on the Pacific Coast when John reached California, one of which was the Joseph A. Rowe Olympic Circus that performed in San Francisco and Sacramento, California, at the time he arrived. On two occasions, Adams told Hittell he had contact with an acquaintance from New England. This person most likely was in some way connected to the circus/menagerie business. Adams told Hittell that the man was his brother, \"William\", although Adams didn't have a brother by that name. According to Earle Williams, the property that Adams ranched near Stockton, California, in 1852 was the same land that was later acquired by Henry C. Lee and John R. Marshall, proprietors of the Lee and Marshall Circus.  Lee hired a man by the name of David Howard to run the ranch which was about eight miles (13 km) southeast of Stockton, on Mariposa road. Grizzly Adams often left his stock and captured animals at \"Howard's Ranch\" to be cared for by Howard and Lee's circus people. Lee's circus used the ranch to keep their circus stock, wagons and other items in the circus' winter off-season. According to Williams when Grizzly Adams established his Mountaineer Museum in San Francisco, in 1856, the menagerie was a part of Lee's Circus, as a side show. Adams and a couple of his bears appeared with Rowe's Pioneer Circus in November. In 1857, Adams had a partner named Sheppard. In 1859, T. W. Tanner was a partner with Adams (this may have been the man who owned a half-interest in Adams' Pacific Museum, prior to Adams leaving for New York in January, 1860). When Adams arrived in New York City in April 1860, he discovered while talking with P.T. Barnum, that Barnum had bought the one-half interest of Adams' California Menagerie, (possibly from Tanner). On April 30, 1860, Adams and Barnum opened the California Menagerie in a canvas tent on the corner of Broadway and Fourth Street in New York City The show ran for six weeks. Adams health was failing, and he sold the remaining interest in the menagerie to Barnum. Adams then went on a summer tour of Massachusetts, Connecticut and New Hampshire as part of Nixon & Company's Circus. He continued to perform with his bears and other trained animals until late October, 1860.\n\nParagraph 9: Asherman's syndrome (AS) is an acquired uterine condition that occurs when scar tissue (adhesions) forms inside the uterus and/or the cervix. It is characterized by variable scarring inside the uterine cavity, where in many cases the front and back walls of the uterus stick to one another. AS can be the cause of menstrual disturbances, infertility, and placental abnormalities. Although the first case of intrauterine adhesion was published in 1894 by Heinrich Fritsch, it was only after 54 years that a full description of Asherman syndrome was carried out by Joseph Asherman. A number of other terms have been used to describe the condition and related conditions including:  uterine/cervical atresia, traumatic uterine atrophy, sclerotic endometrium, and endometrial sclerosis.\n\nParagraph 10: Al Camus Palomar of the University of Oklahoma says that \"Edith L. Tiempo, Rene Amper, Peter Bacho, Jose Capili, Maria Cariño, and the incomparable Fatima Lim-Wilson are included to remind us all of what reading good poetry, feels like. And read Luis Cabalquinto, Jose Capili, and Ricardo de Ungria carefully. You will be immensely rewarded if you do\". A.R.D.S. Bordado said that Capili’s “The Great Australian Landscape” and “Gorilla Bay” show the Filipino sensibility imbibing foreign geography. The latter poem describes the beauty of the bay: “Gastropods on a drift/ conceive enclosures of/ bubbles shimmering forth,/ polished and white among/ rocks, splashing as spring/ time turns supremely aqua/ marine, even less torrential.” Of \"Baguio: The Demise\", critic Ralph Semino Galan writes how Capili utilizes the aftermath of another disaster, the gutted down remains of the Pines Hotel that burned down in 1984, as one of the objective correlatives (“the turn and flow of stones/ we perceived from childhood/ as walls, doors and ceilings/”) to express the emotional vacuity the personae in his elegiac poem are experiencing years after their major romantic breakup. For Galan, Capili is able to obfuscate the obvious intensity of the emotions that are being stirred by the reunion, for he makes the ex-lovers focus on the physical landscape, rather than the inner turmoil they are feeling in each other’s formerly familiar presence: “the rustle of leaves/ behaving like music,” “the landscape of cones/ falling on mountain sleeves,” “pure hemp and other bell-shaped/ things awakening from/ a sudden gush of the wind”. Of A Madness of Birds (1998), Capili's first book, critic Tito Quiling Jr. writes, \"Splattered across its pages are colors such as ceruleans to auburns, and images of falling leaves, cascading water, and stout temple pillars. And spinning in between these are individual’s memories attached to nature’s multifaceted character—from seeing migratory birds returning to their proverbial places to moments illustrating one’s love for his hometown are some of the pieces found in this collection of poems...\"\n\nParagraph 11: Between 1438 and 1446 (several decades before the activities of Leonardo da Vinci), he created manuscripts in Latin on a wide variety of technical subjects, including astronomy, hydraulics, astronomical instruments, and drawings of apparent inventions like a folding ladder and a gem polishing machine. Among the manuscripts is a copy (in Henri's handwriting) of Jacob of Liège's Speculum musicae. The best known part is his treatise on the design and construction of musical instruments, containing, amongst others, the earliest illustration of a harpsichord. He gave  a detailed description of the action and the operation of this keyboard plucked instrument with the complex linkages between the keyboard and the strings. He also described the lute, the clavichord, the dulce melos, and the organ. His description of the organ is more practical than earlier treatises, describing the composition of the diapason chorus and the scaling of the pipes. He describes the layout of pipes, either with the longest in the middle, \"in the form of a bishop's mitre\", or in chromatic order, longest at the left, and he is credited with the first mention of reed pipes. All instruments in his manuscript were to be played at the court and not in churches. The manuscripts were probably only bundled in the 16th century (F-Pn Lat. 7295).\n\nParagraph 12: Laylat al-Qadr occurs during an odd-numbered night within the last ten days of Ramadan, but its exact date is uncertain; due to the promises made in the chapter and in various hadith. Muslims consider it a particularly good time for prayer, supplication, and repentance to God. This event marks the descent of the first revelation of the Quran to Earth. The official Islamic teaching is that Muhammad received the revelations that formed the Quran piecemeal for the next twenty-three years of his life up until the time of his death. Shia Muslims believe that Ali (the first Shia Imam, and the fourth caliph of the Rashidun Caliphate to Sunnis) had special insight and intimacy with God on this night.\n\nParagraph 13: The ReWire system consists of \"Hosts\", \"Panels\", and \"Devices\". Hosts are the host applications which typically do the sequencing at one end and the final mixdown at the other end. A Device is a dynamic link library that only generates sound; it has no user interface. A Panel is a graphical interface for setting the parameters of one Device. A typical setup would be to use Ableton Live in \"Host\" mode, and use Propellerhead Reason as a synthesizer. In this case Reason would provide Device/Panel pairs to Ableton, which could then send MIDI commands, sync timing and mix Reason's output into its own effects chains. Many applications support either mode. In fact, an application could (at the discretion of a developer) act as both a Host and a Panel at the same time.", "answers": ["Paragraph 4"], "length": 3014, "dataset": "passage_retrieval_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "be85d896160c8ef24cae3a35456934d592ebc381d4f221b8"}

During this period Cincinnati was one of the seven most populous US citiesand had a rate of growth and economic importance that was similar to that of New York City and Chicago. The slow streetcars shared the crowded streets with horse-drawn carriages and people, and collided with the first automobiles on an almost daily basis. It was not unusual for trips between downtown and the surrounding suburbs to take 45 minutes to an hour. Despite having  of streetcar tracks, the city found itself in a growing traffic nightmare.\n\nParagraph 3: In 2011, another version of the Revengers appear in the Earth-616 universe. Formed by Wonder Man (whose ionic energy leaking problem has caused him to become convinced that the Avengers are not helping the world and that he must stop them), it consists of lesser-known heroes who he has convinced to help him as this antihero group. During the Revengers attack on Avengers Mansion where they fought the New Avengers, Ms. Marvel tries to reason with Wonder Man which doesn't work. This team manages to defeat the New Avengers and they move on to attack Stark Tower. Wonder Man has Atlas attack Stark Tower to get their attention upon calling a press conference. After failing to reason with Wonder Man, Iron Man trapped him in a stasis container. When the Avengers do not want to fight with so many civilians nearby, Thor teleports the Revengers to Citi Field and all three teams (the main Avengers, the New Avengers, and the Secret Avengers) gang up on the Revengers all at once. With the Revengers imprisoned at the Raft, each member has been interrogated with Captain America, Thor, and Iron Man watching the video feed of the interrogation. Beast later visits Wonder Man in his stasis container. Wonder Man insists that he is acting of his own free will and remains steadfast in his claim that the Avengers must disband before more people are hurt. He also adds something new: his realization that Scarlet Witch created him and that he probably is not even real. Appealing to their friendship, Wonder Man tries to extract a promise from Beast to shut the Avengers down when he realizes that Wonder Man is in the right, but a distressed Beast walks away. Various news programs are buzzing about the Avengers' lack of transparency and stonewalling tactics. Some openly speculate that the time for a self-appointed hero team is over and done. In his bubble, Wonder Man smiles and vanishes into a white light.\n\nParagraph 4: A Black-capped squirrel monkey will typically reach sexual maturation at around 3 years of age for females and 5 years of age for males. The yearly reproductive cycle of mature Saimiri has been observed by several researchers to be affected by a number of environmental factors, including the cycles of rainfall and levels of illumination in their habitat. The mating season coincides with the dry season, and will typically result in a single infant being born to each mother. It has been suggested that adult female monkeys are more receptive to environmental cues for the mating season to begin, and the response in males is in part attributed to behavioural and scent cues from the females.  During the mating season, males of the species will gain a large amount of subcutaneous upper body fat, leading to what is known as a ‘fatted’ appearance. It has also been observed that the testosterone levels of monkeys of the Bolivian and Peruvian species are noticeably higher during the mating season than those of other species of male Saimiri from Guayana. Males will become more irritable and aggressive, fight more frequently for the purpose of achieving dominance within the troop, and engage in genital display towards less dominant males. It has been observed in both natural and laboratory settings that the hierarchy of the troop may change up to as often as three times in a month, and this will often result in highly aggressive fights which may lead to the complete exclusion of younger adult males from the troop. The scent and behavioural cues of a female monkey assist a male in his judgement of whether or not she will be receptive to his approach and attempt at mating with her. If she is not receptive, the female, sometimes with the aid of other nearby females, will usually chase the male away. Consorting and copulation between a male and female monkey may last between one minute and over an hour depending on the presence of other monkeys and the environment in which it takes place. The gestation period of the monkey has been estimated to last between 160 and 170 days. During the first week following its birth, an infant monkey will cling to its mother's back and will seldom move or be attended to by the mother unless it is in some way in need of assistance.\n\nParagraph 5: A right-arm fast bowler of express pace, Lindwall was widely regarded as the greatest pace bowler of his era and one of the finest of all time. He modelled his action on the great England fast bowler Harold Larwood. Together with Keith Miller, Lindwall formed a new-ball pairing regarded as one of the greatest to have played cricket. Lindwall was known for his classical style, with a smooth and rhythmic run-up and textbook side-on bowling action, from which he generated his trademark outswinger which moved away late at high pace. Lindwall mixed his outswinger with a searing yorker, subtle changes of pace and an intimidating bouncer that skidded at the heads of opposing batsmen. Later in his career, Lindwall developed an inswinger, which together with his variety, pace and control made him the most feared paceman of his time. Lindwall was a fine all round cricketer; he was a hard-hitting batsman who scored two centuries at Test level and often improved Australia's position with his lower order batting. Lindwall's best known performance was his role in leading the Australian bowling during the 1948 tour of England under Don Bradman; the 1948 Australian team went through the tour undefeated and gained the sobriquet The Invincibles which saw it regarded as one of the finest teams in cricketing history. Lindwall's place in Australian cricket history saw him inducted into the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame in 1996 as one of the ten inaugural members. In 2000, Lindwall was named in the Australian Cricket Board's Team of the Century.\n\nParagraph 6: Vargas' gender performativity did not reflect the Western binary of gender because she wore more masculine clothing, which in the 1940s, included pants, charro suits, sombreros, guayaberos, and ponchos. In Chavela, Vargas remembers people telling her, \"she doesn't dress like a woman, style her hair or wear her makeup like a woman.\" Mid-20th century Mexico was not as accepting of Vargas and her music because her gender expression and sexual orientation were constantly questioned throughout her career. Anthropologists including Roger Lancaster, Joseph Carrier, Stephen O. Murray studied the intersections of gender and sexuality in Latin America, and they claim \"that patterns of sexuality can be as easily affected by political, social, and economic currents as gender relations.\" Vargas was publicly identified as a lesbian and her music would reflect queer love, joy, and heartbreak. Emma Perez commented on Vargas' role in shaping queerness in Mexico's music industry and calls it the sitio she \"formed within Mexican popular music, a space/place for mestiza lesbian subjectivity, desire, and sexuality.\" Vargas' ability to engage with her sexuality through her music amidst finding success in a traditional country, where there was deep-rooted homophobia and religious fundamentalism, paved the way for LGBTQ artists like Concha Buika and other Latin women artists such as Lila Downs, Eugenia León, La Santa Cecilia, Julieta Venegas, and more.\n\nParagraph 7: The main antagonist arrives after the third season and is named Aron Feller, an ex agent of CIA and working in Turkey (or controlling Turkey in some ways). İskender Büyük is considered like an anti-hero, who also loves his country but has different views from Polat; instead of Aron Feller being the main antagonist. After a long fight-relation against İskender Büyük, Polat finally manages to kill his main enemy İskender Büyük, but he loses his wife Ebru and his little daughter is taken by Aron Feller to be raised as a Christian in the USA. After the death of İskender Büyük, Polat and his team are facing a new wage of enemies, they try to fight against Kurdish terrorism, most notables of which are Lale Zara and Şahmeran, by the same time a new character appears, his name is Ersoy Ulubey, Ersoy wants to take the deep state of Turkey by the \"force\". His methods are : terrorism and many relations with big familie leaders like Haşim Ağa, İzzet Ağa, Yaşar Ağa etc. He creates a secret fraternity to take upon Turkey, but Polat and his team must now take him down. By the same time, Polat keeps his relations with the \"İhtiyarlar\" (the Elders), they give him new missions and Polat is chosen as the \"protector\" of Turkey. After many episodes Polat kills Ersoy and the main antagonist Aron Feller, by this way almost destroying \"Gladio\". Through upcoming episodes Süleyman Çakır's family returns after 6 years and new character \"Kara\" is being introduced, he was the \"old\" Polat Alemdar before Polat Alemdar, he too worked for the Elders. As the series goes on, many new characters are making appearance such as; Beyefendi, Mete Ağır, Memduh Baba, Şeref Zazaoğlu, Mete Aymar etc. In the episode 161 Memati is killed by a mysterious group, the \"white hair\" of the Elders is killed too by the same mysterious group. Polat and his friends are in shock after Memati's death, they are lost and they cannot take his revenge. The Elders must now choose a new white hair, so Adil Eşrefoğlu is chosen. Adil Bey is the brother of Doğu Eşrefoğlu; Adil, Doğu and Aslan Akbey were the ones who created the secret mission: Kurtlar Vadisi. A new youth team, called the \"Regional KGT\" came to Turkey to help Polat to finish his mission \"Kurtlar Vadisi\", planned by the former white hair to be formed. After this Polat had to kidnap Adil Bey. With the help of a technological tool, Adil Bey tells him everything about his past and he also tells him that he used to be like Polat in his youth services. He says that he formed with his brother Doğu Bey the created KGT (a secret intelligence agency in Turkey), he also tells Polat that he was the one who trained Aslan Akbey. Later, it turned out that Sencer, one of the Elders, was the mastermind behind the murders of Memati Baş and the former white-elder. Sencer and Adil Eşrefoğlu were later executed by the order of the Elders. After that, all of the Elders were executed, as they are revealed by the Templars. The youth team's leader, Akif, told Polat that he should be killed because he had some secrets and he meant that if he is killed, it would be the best for the state.\n\nParagraph 8: In May 2008, Newport Television agreed to sell WOAI-TV and five other stations to High Plains Broadcasting because of ownership conflicts. Providence Equity Partners also holds a 19% ownership stake in Univision Communications, the owner of Univision owned-and-operated station KWEX-TV (channel 41) and Telefutura station KNIC-TV (channel 17). In the case of San Antonio, it would have given Providence Equity control of three stations in the market. Even without KNIC in the picture, both WOAI and KWEX were among the four highest-rated stations in the San Antonio market at the time of the Clear Channel sale (and remain so today). The FCC normally does not allow two of the four highest-rated stations to be owned by a single entity. The sale was finalized on September 15, 2008. However, the sale to High Plains Broadcasting was in name only. Newport continued to operate the station under a shared services agreement, with High Plains only holding the FCC assets of the station (including the license). This effectively made High Plains Broadcasting a front company for Newport Television in a relationship similar to that between Mission Broadcasting and Nexstar Broadcasting Group as well as between Cunningham Broadcasting (and later Deerfield Media) and the Sinclair Broadcast Group. On December 17, 2007, WOAI debuted a slightly altered logo.\n\nParagraph 9: There is a seven screen Odeon cinema, which opened in 1934 as a Majestic and is the only cinema in the area. As of November 2017, its freehold is for sale. Next door, The George pub, an 18th-century building on the site of an earlier inn, was originally a stopping point for stagecoaches, with several bars. The George once had a fine dining area on the first floor and then later a pizzeria in the basement, with a large spiral staircase between the floors. Other local amenities include a number of green areas, many of which form part of Epping Forest.\n\nParagraph 10: As a voice actor, he portrayed the villains Imperiex on Legion of Superheroes, and as the Immortal Caveman Vandal Savage on Justice League and Justice League: Doom. He voiced W'Kabi in the animated series Black Panther. He appeared on one episode each of the series CSI: Miami and Seven Days. Though largely unnoticed, Morris also was the voice of Paul the Apostle in Zondervan's The Bible Experience. Morris also made a cameo appearance as Miles Dyson in photographs in the television series Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles. He provided the voice of the character Doc Saturday in the animated show The Secret Saturdays. He also played a major supporting role in the PlayStation 2 game Ratchet: Deadlocked, as Merc, one of the combat bots that accompany the main character Ratchet. He also worked as a voice actor on The PJs; according to Morris, co-creator and star Eddie Murphy didn't want to show up on some days to record the voice of Thurgood Stubbs, so the producers hired Morris to record Thurgood's lines, where he worked in a separate booth with the other actors, allowing the producers to replace Morris' recordings with Murphy's voice in case Murphy decided he wanted to record his dialogue. He did several voices in the animated film Dead Space: Downfall as Hansen and Glenn. He played Delroy Jones on the TV One series Love That Girl!, Saint Walker on the Cartoon Network series Green Lantern: The Animated Series, and Ultra Richard on the Cartoon Hangover series SuperF*ckers. He also voices Plank in the Sofia the First episode \"The Floating Palace\", Green Arrow and Hawkman in the film Lego DC Comics Super Heroes: Justice League vs. Bizarro League and Vandal Savage in the film Lego DC Comics Super Heroes: Justice League: Cosmic Clash.\n\nParagraph 11: Boatner was educated at Western University in Quindaro, Kansas, Boston Conservatory and received a Bachelor of Music from the Chicago Music College (Now the College of Performing Arts at Roosevelt University). He also studied music privately. He began as a Concert singer with the encouragement and assistance of Roland Hayes — who performed  many of Boatner's works on his concert programs—and choral director R. Nathaniel Dett.  He also sang leading roles with the National Negro Opera Company. For the National Baptist Convention, he served as the director of music from 1925 to 1931. Boatner was a professor for Samuel Huston College (now Huston–Tillotson University) and Wiley College in Marshall, TX. He then settled in New York conducting a studio and directed community and church choirs. This allowed him to concentrate more on composing.\n\nParagraph 12: Nakagawa returned to Shimmer on October 27, 2012, defeating Davina Rose as part of Volume 49. Later that same night on Volume 50, Nakagawa was defeated by Athena. The following night on Volume 51, Nakagawa defeated Veda Scott in a singles match. Later that same night on Volume 52, Nakagawa, in her final match of the weekend, teamed with Kellie Skater as the \"Global Green Gangsters\" (3G) in a tag team match, where they defeated Christina Von Eerie and MsChif. On April 6, 2013, at the Volume 53 internet pay-per-view (iPPV), the Global Green Gangsters unsuccessfully challenged the Canadian NINJAs (Nicole Matthews and Portia Perez) for the Shimmer Tag Team Championship in a four-way match, which also included the teams of Kana and Lufisto, and Made in Sin (Allysin Kay and Taylor Made). A week later on April 13 at the tapings of Volume 54, Nakagawa and Skater defeated the Canadian NINJAs in another title match, however, the Shimmer Tag Team Championship did not change hands due to the match ending in a countout. Later that same day on Volume 55, Nakagawa and Skater continued chasing the Canadian NINJAs and the Shimmer Tag Team Championship, but, despite scoring a win over Regeneration X (Allison Danger and Leva Bates), were denied a rematch with the reigning champions. However, the following day, after Nakagawa and Perez wrestled to a double disqualification on Volume 56, following interference from both Skater and Matthews, the two teams were booked in one more title match against each other, contested under \"No Disqualification, No Countout\" rules. The match took place later that same day in the main event of Volume 57 and saw the Global Green Gangsters defeat the Canadian NINJAs to become the new Shimmer Tag Team Champions. Nakagawa returned to Shimmer on October 19 at Volume 58, where she and Skater made their first successful title defense against Kana and LuFisto. Later that same day on Volume 59, Nakagawa and Skater made their second successful defense against Made in Sin. The following day, Nakagawa and Skater made two more successful title defenses, defeating Nevaeh and Sassy Stephie on Volume 60 and Cherry Bomb and Kimber Lee on Volume 61. On October 25, Nakagawa made her debut for Shimmer's sister promotion, Shine Wrestling, when she and Skater successfully defended the Shimmer Tag Team Championship against Valkyrie (Allysin Kay and Ivelisse). On April 5, 2014, at the Volume 62 iPPV, Nakagawa and Skater successfully defended their title against Madison Eagles and Nicole Matthews. A week later at Volume 64, Nakagawa and Skater made another successful title defense against Leon and Ray. Nakagawa and Skater made two more successful title defenses the following day, defeating Rhia O'Reilly and Saraya Knight on Volume 65 and Cheerleader Melissa and Mercedes Martinez on Volume 66.", "answers": ["Paragraph 1"], "length": 3308, "dataset": "passage_retrieval_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "9fb4b8ec1064b4d898c5abdce7ede9d94b95648d42a8b36c"}
{"input": "The text discusses the movement that took place in China in 1976 following the death of Premier Zhou Enlai and the Qingming festival. The Gang of Four, anticipating that people would use the festival to commemorate Zhou's death, published an article criticizing Deng Xiaoping, implying that Zhou was his \"backer\" for capitalist ideas. This led to protests and demonstrations across cities, with people expressing their dissatisfaction and carrying wreaths in honor of Zhou. The Gang of Four tried to suppress news of the protests, but the information still spread. In response, Deng was criticized at a Politburo meeting for his alleged association with capitalists and seizing power.", "context": "Paragraph 1: But in Padua and in Naples he came in contact with the Society of Jesus and joined the order in 1559.<ref>La vocazione alla Compagnia di Gesu del p. Antonio Possevino in Archivum Historicum Societatis Iesu 12 (1945): 102-124. Possevino's Latin account of his vocation is in the Jesuit archives in Rome, Archivio Romano della Compagnia di Gesu, Hist. Soc. ff.183-195.</ref>  In 1560  Possevino was accompanied by Jesuit General Diego Lainez to the Savoy of Emanuele Filiberto where he bolstered the Catholic Church against heretics and he founded the Jesuit schools at Chambery, Mondovì and Turin. In his efforts to bring the entrenched Waldensians around, he debated Scipione Lentolo (1525–1599), Calvin's emissary to the Italian Reformed community. In combatting the influence of Calvin's Geneva increasingly he gravitated to France. This was at the onset of the Wars of Religion where he sought to rally the Catholics of Lyons together with Jesuit preacher Edmond Auger. He published a treatise on the Mass, Il sacrificio dell'altare (1563) and debated such Geneva reformers as Pierre Viret and the Italian Calvinist, Niccolo Balbani. For the Italian merchant community of Lyons he provided Catholic books, for example the Catechism of Peter Canisius and several other works in Italian. During this time he was put in jail and rescued from his Huguenot captors by influential adherents. In 1565 he successfully defended his order at the Colloquy at Bayonne before the boy king Charles IX and the future king Henri IV who remained a lifelong friend. In 1569 he wrote Il Soldato cristiano for pope Pius V who had it printed in Rome and distributed to the papal troops at the battle of Lepanto. He served as the rector of the Jesuit college of Avignon and then of Lyons where he received the Jesuit General Francis Borgia  in 1571 on a journey from Spain to Rome. He was there during the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre. During these militant years he first conceived of the plan of his Counter Reformation bibliographical works, as he states in the introduction to the Bibliotheca selecta.\n\nParagraph 2: The first draft of Lennon's lyrics for \"I'm Only Sleeping\", written on the back of a letter from 1966, suggests that he was writing about the joys of staying in bed rather than any drug euphoria sometimes read into the lyrics. While not on tour, Lennon would usually spend his time sleeping, reading, writing or watching television, often under the influence of drugs, and would have to be woken by McCartney for their songwriting sessions. In a London Evening Standard article published on 4 March 1966, Maureen Cleave, a friend of Lennon, wrote: \"He can sleep almost indefinitely, is probably the laziest person in England. 'Physically lazy,' he said. 'I don't mind writing or reading or watching or speaking, but sex is the only physical thing I can be bothered with any more.'\"\n\nParagraph 3: Couch then took a one-year leave of absence from the army from 1853 to 1854 to conduct a scientific mission for the Smithsonian Institution in northern Mexico. There, he discovered the species that are known as Couch's kingbird and Couch's spadefoot toad. Upon his return to the United States in 1854, Couch was ordered to Washington, D.C., on detached service. Later that year he resumed garrison duty in Fort Independence at Castle Island along Boston Harbor, Massachusetts. Also in 1854 he was stationed at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, and would remain there into the following year. On April 30, 1855, Couch resigned his commission in the U.S. Army. From 1855 to 1857 he was a merchant in New York City. He then moved to Taunton, Massachusetts, and worked as a copper fabricator in the company owned by his wife's family. Couch was still working in Taunton when the American Civil War began in 1861.\n\nParagraph 4: One of the show trials involving charges of \"wrecking\" was that of official coordinators of the 1937 Soviet Census. The census was organised with great expectations from the government that it would confirm the superiority of the Soviet economic and social model, with Stalin publicly declaring in 1934 that the Soviet Union was gaining at least 3 million citizens per year. The census questions and procedure were prepared for several years by a commission of professional statisticians and demographers, but then significantly changed by Stalin and other members of the Central Committee to better match their political goals – the collection phase of the census was shortened and the procedures simplified.\n\nParagraph 5: Béla Tarr (born 21 July 1955) is a Hungarian filmmaker. Debuting with the film Family Nest (1977), Tarr began his directorial career with a brief period of what he refers to as \"social cinema\", aimed at telling everyday stories about ordinary people, often in the style of cinema vérité. Over the next decade, he changed the cinematic style and thematic elements of his films. Tarr has been interpreted as having a pessimistic view of humanity; the characters in his works are often cynical, and have tumultuous relationships with one another in ways critics have found to be darkly comic. Almanac of Fall (1984) follows the inhabitants of a run-down apartment as they struggle to live together while sharing their hostilities. The drama Damnation (1988) was lauded for its languid and controlled camera movement, which Tarr would become known for internationally. Sátántangó (1994) and Werckmeister Harmonies (2000) continued his bleak and desolate representations of reality, while incorporating apocalyptic overtones. The former sometimes appears in scholarly polls of the greatest films ever made, and the latter received wide acclaim from critics. Tarr would later compete at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival with his film The Man from London, which opened to moderately positive reviews.\n\nParagraph 6: Following college graduation, he moved to Texas. After managing a tire store in Houston and working as an auto mechanic, he began posing for print photography ads and doing television commercials. In a nationwide talent search in Dallas, he became one of four finalists out of 770 candidates to screen-test for the Larry Wilcox replacement role on the television series CHiPs. Although he did not get the job, he did get a small film part and had the lead in an MTV video documentary called Wild Rides, narrated by Matt Dillon. He also hosted On the Move for ESPN and the Miss Teen America Pageant in Dallas.\n\nParagraph 7: On 1 January 2023, the Makiivka military quarters shelling occurred. It was reported by both Russian and Ukrainian sources that a Ukrainian strike on Russian military forces based at a vocational school in Makiivka resulted in significant casualties, particularly among conscripts. First Deputy Minister of Information of the Donetsk People's Republic Daniil Bezsonov stated that the strike took place at exactly 00:01 Moscow Time and made use of the M142 HIMARS rocket system. Russian officials claimed that at least 25 HIMARS rockets were fired at the school, resulting in at least 15 casualties. Officials of the Donetsk People's Republic stated that the reason for the strike was the use of mobile phones by Russian serviceman at the school, which revealed their location to the Ukrainian military. The Armed Forces of Ukraine announced on the same day that 400 Russian forces had been killed in the strike, with a further 300 wounded, resulting in 700 total casualties. Igor Girkin, the former commander of separatist forces in the Donbas, said about the attack, \"the number of dead and wounded runs into many hundreds\". This number was, however, also challenged by others; Russian presenter Vladimir Solovyov claimed that while casualties were high, they were not close to 400. An unnamed source in Donetsk told Reuters that fewer than 100 people had died in the attack.\n\nParagraph 8: The Deutschland Tour was the final Pro Tour stage race of the season for Quick Step. Leading the team was defending champion Patrik Sinkewitz he would be racing against big names such as Jan Ullrich, Alexandre Vinokourov, Levi Leipheimer and Cadel Evans. Stage 1 was a 170 km hilly stage, after 30 km of racing Bram Tankink, Bernhard Eisel and Juan José Cobo attacked and formed a breakaway. They stayed away from the peloton for the whole stage at one point having a 10-minute advantage. With 16 kilometers to go Tankink attacked his companions and soloed to victory 48 seconds in front of Cobo and 3 minutes in front of the peloton. Stage 2 was a flat stage with two category 2 climbs at the end. These two climbs meant that when the race got to the finish line only 29 riders remained and most of them were climbers. Filippo Pozzato took the reduced bunch sprint only millimeters in front of Jörg Jaksche. Tankink lost just under 3 minutes to Pozzato, this meant that going into stage 3 Tankink held the leaders jersey with 13 seconds back to now second placed Pozzato. 23 seconds down was team leader Sinkewitz sitting at the same time as the other contenders. Stage 3 was a day for the sprinters with a small breakaway going up the road but the team rode on the front the whole stage keeping their leaders out of trouble. With 30 km to go many riders tried to attack and get away from the peoloton but Quick Step slowly wound them back in. With 2 km to go the race was going to end in a bunch sprint  was riding on the front for their sprinter Pagliarini. Lampre's Bennati was able to sprint to victory with Pozzato coming second. Stage 4 was the first Mountain stage of the tour as the riders reached the final climb the pace was too much for Sinkewitz and he struggled to keep up, as did many contenders. He was able to limit his losses and finish 10th on the stage moving him to 9th overall, 3 minutes down on stage winner Leipheimer. On Stage 5 Pozzato placed 9th during the sprint finish. The second Mountain stage, 7, was a tough one for the team with leader Sinkewitz losing 1:48 to Evans, dropping to 11th overall, and Pozzato pulling out. The decisive stage 8 time-trial was won by Ulrich with Sinkewitz finishing in 24th 2:34 down. Although he lost time on the leaders he gained one place on the Overall which he held through stage 9.\n\nParagraph 9: The Sin-Eater is later resurrected for Kindred's next plot against Spider-Man. While in their safehouse, the Inner Demons were attacked by the revived Sin-Eater as Overdrive took his car and drove away wishing that his attacker was the Punisher. Overdrive raced for three days trying to avoid the Sin-Eater. On the day where Spider-Man's dream predicted his death, Overdrive found Spider-Man and asked for his protection only to be shot by the Sin-Eater using a special gun. Carlie Cooper examined his body in the morgue when Overdrive somehow returned to life and found no bodily damages on him. When the Lethal Legion (consisting of Count Nefaria, Grey Gargoyle, Living Laser, and Whirlwind) attacked Empire State University and fought Spider-Man, Sin-Eater crashed the battle. Upon using his special gun on Grey Gargoyle and Whirlwind, the Sin-Eater copied Grey Gargoyle's powers and immobilized Spider-Man. Then he used his gun on Living Laser and Count Nefaria. When the Lethal Legion was at Ravencroft, Norah Winters interviewed Count Nefaria at the approval of Norman Osborn where Norah learned that they have suddenly regretted their sins. Due to the Sin-Eater having taken away his powers, Overdrive was placed on life support as Carlie keeps an eye on him. Spider-Man wonders how Overdrive can be in critical condition while everyone else that the Sin-Eater \"cleansed\" were sent to Ravencroft. Norah was later confronted in her car by the Sin-Eater. Acting in self-defense, Norah shoots the Sin-Eater point blank only for it to not harm him. The Sin-Eater does allow her to record a manifesto. After showing it to J. Jonah Jameson who was apprehensive about it, Norah posts the Sin-Eater's manifesto anyway. After cleansing some low-level criminals, the Sin-Eater taunts Spider-Man again while overpowering him with the stolen powers while stating who his next target is. When a riot occurs at Ravencroft, Osborn is informed by Count Nefaria that the Sin-Eater is coming for him. The Sin-Eater and his followers start purging those who have committed bad acts of their sins as Spider-Man learns that he is going after Osborn. Arriving at Ravencroft, the Sin-Eater dispenses the powers he has stolen onto his followers and sends them after Osborn. Spider-Man was able to get to him and fight off the Sin-Eater's followers. Having stolen Mister Negative's powers, the Sin-Eater corrupts the guards to his side. Then he corrupts a clone of Ashley Kafka to release Juggernaut so that he can steal his powers. Using Juggernaut's powers, the Sin-Eater and his followers pursue Spider-Man and Osborn as the Order of the Web considers waiting for the Sin-Eater to cleanse Osborn before intervening. As Spider-Man and Osborn escape underground, the Sin-Eater catches up to them. As Spider-Man holds onto the Sin-Eater to restrain him, Osborn activates an EMP to liquefy the floor beneath them. After freeing himself, the Sin-Eater caught up to Osborn and purged him of his sins. Kindred shows up and berates the Sin-Eater for his own crimes. Then Kindred presumably kills the Sin-Eater by erupting him of demonic energy after he served his purpose. The Sin-Eater's followers were later arrested by the police.\n\nParagraph 10: Reviews ranged from positive to mixed. Giving three out of four bones, the VideoHound's Golden Movie Retriever highlighted the parodies in the film, and noted that \"Parents will be [as] equally entertained [as children] by the level of humor and fast-paced action\". Film critic Leonard Maltin gave the film two and a half stars out of four, saying the film was \"[e]pisodic,\" but praised the voice cast, songs and \"funny business\". TV Guide called the film a \"firecracker\", citing the film's many jokes. The book Videos for Kids: The Essential, Indispensable Parent's Guide to Children's Movies on Video praised the \"tongue-in-cheek humor\" and celebrity caricatures but issued warning to parents, stating that the film may not be appropriate for \"children too young to identify satire\" because the characters in the film \"are rude and combative\" and may not be positive role models. Videos for Kids still concluded that the film \"should provide an enjoyable viewing experience for the whole family\". Dennis Hunt of the Los Angeles Times said that the format of a direct-video film was \"unusual\", but that some parts of the film were \"hilarious\", especially the scenes which make fun of Walt Disney World. Since its release, How I Spent My Vacation has been rated as one of the \"Top 20 (U.S.-Produced) Direct-to-Video Animated Films\" by The Animated Movie Guide.\n\nParagraph 11: The movement was caused by Premier Zhou Enlai's death on 8 January 1976 and the Qingming festival on April 5 that year. The Gang of Four, anticipating that people would use the Qingming festival to commemorate Zhou's death, as many felt he had not been properly honored immediately after his death. On March 25, the Shanghai newspaper Wenhui Bao, controlled by the Gang of Four, published an article criticizing Deng Xiaoping, with implied attacks on Zhou as Deng's \"backer\", for capitalist ideas. This resulted in large crowds of protesters, including former Red Guards, surrounding the newspaper's offices. In Nanjing, similar protests spread from Nanjing University to the city streets, with people carrying wreaths to the Yuhuatai Memorial. Gang of Four supporters later removed the wreaths and suppressed news of the protest in official media channels, but news still spread to other cities. In response to the protests, Deng was criticized at a Politburo meeting for leading capitalists and attempting to seize power.\n\nParagraph 12: In the sixth reading, Isaac blessed Jacob, asking God to give him abundance, make peoples serve him, make him master over his brothers, curse those who cursed him, and bless those who blessed him. Just as Jacob left, Esau returned from the hunt, prepared a dish for Isaac, and asked Isaac for his blessing. Isaac asked who he was, and Esau said that it was he. Isaac trembled and asked who it was then who had served him, received his blessing, and now must remain blessed. Esau burst into sobbing, and asked Isaac to bless him too, but Isaac answered that Jacob had taken Esau's blessing with guile. Esau asked whether Jacob had been so named that he might supplant Esau twice, first taking his birthright and now his blessing. Esau asked Isaac whether he had not reserved a blessing for Esau, but Isaac answered that he had made Jacob master over him and sustained him with grain and wine, and asked what, then, he could still do for Esau. Esau wept and pressed Isaac to bless him, too, so Isaac blessed him to enjoy the fat of the earth and the dew of heaven, to live by his sword and to serve his brother, but also to break his yoke. Esau harbored a grudge against Jacob, and told himself that he would kill Jacob upon Isaac's death. When Esau's words reached Rebekah, she told Jacob to flee to Haran and her brother Laban and remain there until Esau's fury subsided and Rebekah fetched him from there, so that Rebekah would not lose both sons in one day. Rebekah told Isaac her disgust with the idea that Jacob might marry a Hittite woman, so Isaac sent for Jacob, blessed him, and instructed him not to take a Canaanite wife, but to go to Padan-aram and the house of Bethuel to take a wife from among Laban's daughters. And Isaac blessed Jacob with fertility and the blessing of Abraham, that he might possess the land that God had assigned to Abraham. The sixth reading ends here.\n\nParagraph 13: Limb and girdle elements from the left and right sides of the body closely match each other in size and are the appropriate size to belong to the same individual as the vertebrae and ribs. The disposition of bones in the quarry is approximately as expected if the animal were lying on its left side in an opisthotonic pose, but nearly all bones show some disorientation and disarticulation: the cervical vertebrae are arranged along a curved line, and extending along this tight curve (approximately) sit two of the dorsal vertebrae followed by the sacrum and caudal vertebrae. The sacrum and first three caudal vertebrae were found in articulation and in line with the remaining articulated caudal vertebrae; others are present after a gap of about . Twenty-seven caudal vertebrae are shown on the quarry map, but 30 were found in the collection, and pre-restoration photos indicate that 32 were originally present. Many of the chevrons were found articulated with their respective caudal vertebrae. The left and right scapulae were recovered on the left and right sides of the body, respectively. The left radius was found about midway between the pectoral girdle elements. Left and right femora, pubes, and ilia were located close to one another and all of these were found near the sacrum. The sacrum is depicted with its left side facing upwards on the quarry map, but this might have been an error because the left side of the sacrum is damaged and the left ilium is missing. The elements of the left and right crura were found in close association. Dorsal rib fragments were scattered across the quarry area. In sum, some degree of dispositioning occurred to HBV-20001 before or during burial, resulting in loss and disarticulation of some elements, but the disposition, overall agreement in size, and lack of duplication of bones suggests the presence of a single sauropod individual at this locality.\n\nParagraph 14:  Sufficient circumference to distribute the force comfortably and safely over the hand.  An example where this requirement is almost the sole purpose for a handle's existence is the handle that consists of two pieces: a hollow wooden cylinder about the diameter of a finger and a bit longer than one hand-width, and a stiff wire that passes through the center of the cylinder, has two right angles, and is shaped into a hook at each end. This handle permits comfortable carrying, with otherwise bare hands, of a heavy package, suspended on a tight string that passes around the top and bottom of it: the string is strong enough to support it, but the pressure the string would exert on fingers that grasped it directly would often be unacceptable.", "answers": ["Paragraph 11"], "length": 3532, "dataset": "passage_retrieval_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "f499993290da21987d19ce8b47d71a699649d282ee281564"}
{"input": "The text explains that \"Son of Man\" is a novel that explores the complex relationship between God and humanity through the experiences of two characters who question Jewish and Christian beliefs. The novel consists of two parts: a detective story and an unpublished manuscript written by a murder victim. The manuscript tells the story of Ahasuerus, the Wandering Jew, who embarks on a journey to understand religious ideologies across the ancient world. He concludes that these beliefs are influenced by political intrigue and the fears of the people. Ahasuerus later meets Jesus and challenges him on the laws and promises of Yahweh. The manuscript provides clues to solve the murder of its author, Min Yoseop. Both Yoseop and Ahasuerus are consumed by their philosophical ideals, and the tragic outcome reflects the author's pessimism about people's ability to save themselves. The novel is seen as a critique of Protestant Christianity in South Korea after the Korean war, influenced by the author's Confucian upbringing. It has been revised multiple times, with footnotes to enhance the reader's understanding. Overall, \"Son of Man\" fills a void in Korean literature regarding comparative religion and incorporates elements of apocrypha, Gnosticism, and Minjung theology.", "context": "Paragraph 1: The amphitheater is surrounded by a colonnade, with main entrances at the east and west axes. The capitals of the columns are Doric, but rest on an Attic base. The entablature above the columns, however, is Ionic to allow for inscriptions. These inscriptions, on the exterior of the entablature, list 44 major battles from the American Revolutionary War through the Spanish–American War. Low, backless marble benches in concentric circles face the semi-circular main stage, which has three levels. The lowest level features a klismos, a form of ancient Greek informal chair meant for rulers. The klismos chair faces the audience, much as a cathedra (or bishop's chair) does. Hastings intended the klismos chair to remind the audience of the missing heroes honored by the amphitheater. The second level of the stage has a podium. The stage and amphitheater are designed so that any speaker must look down at the klismos chair while addressing the audience, and must look at the USS Maine Mast Memorial if looking up. The third and uppermost level of the stage contains a semi-circular seating area for about 100 people and an apse in the back. The interior dome of the apse is richly carved, and the square pilasters on either side of the stage list the names of famous American generals (left, as you face the stage) and admirals (right) from the American Revolutionary War through the Spanish–American War. A quote from General George Washington's June 26, 1775, letter to the Continental Congress is inscribed inside the apse: \"When we assumed the soldier we did not lay aside the citizen.\" A quote from President Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address is inscribed above the stage:  \"We here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain.\" Decorative  tall urns carved with eagles, rams' heads, and snakes were placed on pedestals in niches on either side of the stage.\n\nParagraph 2: Son of Man explores the theme of the complex relationship between God and humanity through the eyes of two characters who are doubtful of the Jewish and Christian worldviews. The work consists of two novels, a detective story and the unpublished manuscript of a novel written by the victim of a murder. The latter, the inner story and core of the work, imagines the character of Ahasuerus, the Wandering Jew. In the first half of the story, Ahasuerus leaves his home in Judea and embarks on a quest to understand the meanings of religious ideologies from across the ancient world. As described in a Korean Literature Now review, his travels to the centers of religious thought lead him to conclude that all were the product of \"political intrigue and the base desires of a frightened populace\" In the second half of the story, he returns to his homeland. He undertakes a fast in the desert where he meets the Great Spirit, an opponent of the Jewish god, Yahweh. In an alternate telling of the gospel story of the Temptation of Jesus, he also finds Jesus, who is similarly fasting, and attempts to convince him of the unreasonableness of the laws of Yahweh, with respect to free will, human suffering and punishment for sin. Ahasuerus petitions Jesus to turn rocks into bread to feed a suffering humanity, to no avail. A similar confrontation occurs when Jesus is giving the Sermon on the Mount, when Ahasuerus accuses Jesus of offering \"empty promises of paradise\". Finally, he meets Jesus on his way to Calvary and refuses to aid him. This act leads him to be sentenced to wander the earth forever, a fate which allows him to continue his search for truth. The unpublished manuscript of the novel was written by a former theology student, Min Yoseop, who has been murdered. He left seminary, disillusioned by the perceived hypocrisy he found there and, together with a devoted follower, attempts to relieve the suffering of downtrodden Koreans (so prevalent after the Korean war) in a more direct way. The text of the manuscript provides clues to solving the murder. There are strong parallels between Min Yoseop and Ahasuerus, both of whom are consumed by their philosophical ideals. The tragic outcome was considered an expression of Yi's pessimism concerning the ability of people to save themselves.  Brother Anthony, who translated this work, noted that, in his view, the work represents criticism of Protestant Christianity in South Korea after the Korean war. At the time, some pastors preyed on the vulnerability of their parishioners for their own economic advantage. He suggested that Yi's views may have been influenced by his upbringing which was steeped in Confucianism. The work has been revised several times, most recently in 2020. In an interview that was conducted while that revision was underway, Yi stated that when the original book was published, the Korean public had very little knowledge of comparative religion and he believed that his work helped to fill that void. It was well documented with 335 footnotes, although these were not included in the English translation.  An academic review concluded that it was derived from apocrypha, Gnosticism and the perspective of Korean Minjung theology (literally the peoples' theology).\n\nParagraph 3: The former mayor of the City of Frank and the secondary antagonist of Osmosis Jones. Responsible for Frank's unhealthy eating habits, he wanted to be reelected for his own selfish benefits, but in the end, he lost to his political opponent, Tom Colonic. Whenever reporters enter his office, he would always deny all the various problems in Frank's body, trying to assure them that his body is in perfect shape. After Frank ingested the tainted hard-boiled egg that caused him to contract Thrax, Phlegmming went out of his way to ignore and downplay the issue as nothing more but a cold, but Ozzy tried to warn him it was a lot serious than that, let alone deadly, with Phlegmming threatening  to put him in the next nosebleed if he ever spoke of it. He would also illegally control Frank's thoughts on a few occasions and made him take a cold pill against the wishes of his secretary, Leah, which is how Ozzy met, and joined forces with, Drix to stop Thrax's plan. After Ozzy and Drix uncovered Thrax's scheme after destroying a nightclub inside a zit on Frank's forehead, Phlegmming continued to ignore the warnings and fired Jones from the police force and ordered Drix to leave Frank's body by being peed out. Ozzy and Drix later reconciled and defied Phlegmming's orders to stop Thrax. After Leah tells him off for not caring about Frank's health and only caring about himself and his own selfish interests, including the election, Thrax infiltrates Frank's brain and steals a DNA chromosome from his hypothalamus gland, causing his body temperature to reach to a hazardous 108 degrees and sending him into a deadly coma. A trip to a chicken wing festival in Buffalo, New York, was Phlegmming's only shot of being reelected, but due to Thrax destroying the city and causing Frank's coma, it was quickly shot down when Frank was rushed to the hospital and all he could do was look on as the city burned to the ground. Ozzy later chases Thrax onto Frank's daughter, Shane's fake eyelash, where he recovers the DNA bead and traps Thrax on the eyelash, which falls into a vial of rubbing alcohol, dissolving Thrax to death, at which point he returns the stolen bead to its rightful place and Frank recovers from his fever, resulting in him getting his job back and making Drix his new partner. As for Phlegmming, Thrax's rampage resulted in a massive scandal that led up to his impeachment and removal from office, with Colonic winning the election in a landslide. Following his impeachment, Phlegmming was reduced to working as a custodian in Frank's bowels and while doing so, he accidentally presses a button that ejects himself from Frank's body via flatulence, causing his own implied demise.\n\nParagraph 4: Publius reminds Titus that it is time to go to the public games; however, Titus says he cannot leave until he has learned the Senate's decision regarding Sextus. Titus cannot bring himself to believe Sextus a traitor and sends out Publius to bring back the verdict. As Publius leaves, he tells Titus that his own good nature blinds him to the corrupt hearts of men (Publius: \"Tardi s'avvede\"). Annius enters, now exonerated, followed by Publius with the verdict: Sextus has confessed and the Senate has condemned all conspirators to the lions. Publius gives the decree to Titus, which awaits his signature. Titus sends away Annius and Publius. Annius begs mercy for Sextus before leaving (Annius: \"Pietà, signor, di lui\"). Alone, Titus decides to hear Sextus speak before signing the death sentence, hoping to learn of some exonerating circumstance like Annius before. He calls back Publius to bring Sextus before him. Sextus enters and Titus sends out Publius with the guards to be alone with him. Titus attempts to learn the motive for his betrayal, but Sextus will only confirm that he is guilty and deserves to die. Frustrated, Titus says that's precisely what he'll get and calls back the guards to take him away. Before leaving, Sextus acknowledges his impending death and expresses regret at his betrayal (Sextus: \"Vo disperato a morte\"). Titus wrestles with the idea of sentencing Sextus to death. He ultimately decides to follow his own merciful nature and tears up the sentence. He calls back Publius and announces that he has decided Sextus's fate and is ready to go to the arena. Before leaving, Titus acknowledges to himself that if a hard heart is required to be emperor, the gods will have to either give him another heart or take away his empire (Titus: \"Se all'impero, amici Dei\"). Vitellia arrives and is told by Publius that Sextus has been sentenced to death and Titus has already left for the arena. Before Publius leaves for the arena himself, Vitellia attempts to ascertain what Sextus has revealed to Titus. She becomes convinced that her guilt has been exposed. Servilia and Annius appear, from whom she learns that she is still to become Empress of Rome. Servilia and Annius ask Vitellia to come with them to beg for Sextus's life, but she declines saying that she will come later. Annius leaves. Servilia angrily tells Vitellia that her tears are useless if she won't act, then follows Annius (Servilia: \"Se altro che lagrime\"). Alone, Vitellia recognizes that she cannot live with herself if she does not attempt to save Sextus and decides to go confess her crimes before Titus. Acknowledging her hopes of marriage to be over, she compares her situation to that of a boatman who must occasionally throw goods overboard to weather a storm (Vitellia: \"Getta il nocchier talora\").\n\nParagraph 5: In the early hours of September 24, 2021, a day after Jones was inducted into the UFC Hall of Fame for his fight with Alexander Gustafsson at UFC 165, police were called to the Caesars Palace resort hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada, responding to a domestic incident. According to a police report obtained by news site MMA Fighting, a 911 call was made by a hotel security guard when Jones' youngest daughter requested help, claiming there was a domestic incident between Jones and his fiancée, Jessie Moses. Cops arrived in minutes, cutting Jones off as he was attempting to flee the scene. Officers detained Jones and began to investigate the situation. While officers detained Jones, others went to the room to further investigate and get Moses' side of the story. When they arrived to the room, they observed her with blood on her face and clothing, and with a bump on her lip, consistent with someone who had been struck. Moses stated that Jones had left the hotel to go out with friends while Moses and their children went to sleep, and that when Jones returned, he was belligerent, became agitated, and pulled her hair. She claims that the hair pulling was the extent of the physicality between the two, and claimed that the blood on her face and clothing was from chapped lips. She also declined a temporary protective order against Jones. Police stated that while he was being detained, a belligerent Jones headbutted the hood of the patrol vehicle, leaving a dent, they claimed Jones had made threats and challenged the arresting officers to a fight, and that Jones had said he could break free from the handcuffs. No attempts at a fight were followed through on, however, and Jones was placed under arrest peacefully after the investigation concluded. He was taken to the Clark County jail where he was charged with one count of domestic battery, a misdemeanor, and one count of tampering with a police vehicle, a felony. His bail was set at $16,000. Jones posted bail approximately twelve hours after his arrest and was due to be arraigned in court on October 26. Four days after his arrest, Jones posted an Instagram video of himself lifting weights, with the caption saying “I have way too much trauma to consume alcohol, my brain simply can't handle it anymore. I will leave alcohol in my past forever.” Three weeks after the arrest, Jones was banned from entering Jackson Wink MMA gym by his coach, Mike Winkeljohn, where Jones had been training since 2009. On December 16, it was revealed that the domestic battery charge against Jones was dropped. As for the felony tampering with a police vehicle charge, Jones pleaded no contest and was ordered to pay $750 in restitution, attend anger management therapy, and was given a court order to stay out of any and all legal trouble.\n\nParagraph 6: He moved on to the Under 21 team in 1998 lining out at Full Back in the Munster semi final game with Clare, a game Kerry ran out winnings in a close game on a 0-10 to 0-07 scoreline. This set up a Munster Under-21 Football Championship final with Tipperary. In another close game Kerry ended on the right side of a 3-10 to 1-11 scoreline to give O'Sullivan a first Munster title in the grade. The All Ireland semi final paired Kerry with Ulster championships Armagh. Unlike during Munster Kerry ran out comfortable winners on a 1-14 to 0-09 point scoreline, with O'Sullivan once again at Full Back. This set up an All Ireland final with Laois. Despite fielding a number of players who had won All Ireland minor titles the 2 previous years O'Sullivan's side won 2-08 to 0-11 scoreline to give Kerry their 3 title in 4 years and a first for O'Sullivan. O'Sullivan was back in the no 3 jersey for the start of the 1999 championship as Kerry ran out easy winners in the first round on a 1-22 to 1-04 scoreline against Waterford. This set up a semi final with Limerick. Despite having appeared in 2 Munster minor finals in the years before Kerry had little trouble overcoming them on a 3-12 to 0-06 scoreline. That result set up a Munster final with Cork. Despite being closer than the first two games O'Sullivan's side still ran out comfortable 1-10 to 0-07 winners, giving O Sullivn his second Munster title. In the semi final Kerry had yet another comfortable win this time over Roscommon on a 3-15 to 109 scoreline. In the final Kerry would face Leinster surprise package Weastmeath. Having not been tested all year Kerry went into the game as huge favorites. However at the final whistle Kerry found themselves at the wrong end of a 1-12 to 0-09 scoreline in one of the biggest shocks in the history of the championship. O'Sullivan played 9 games in total for the Under 21s during his 2 years all at Full Back.\n\nParagraph 7: Since the ninth century, the Duchy of Croatia (later Kingdom) engaged in naval battles, struggling to maintain control over the eastern Adriatic coast and Adriatic merchant routes. Commemorating the first recorded Croat naval victory, when the subjects of Croatian duke Branimir defeated the Venetian naval expedition on September 18, 887, the Croatian Navy Day is celebrated yearly on September 18. Croatian fleet was particularly active under duke Domagoj and king Petar Krešimir IV. Royal Croatian-Dalmatian navy with 12-15 galleys existed under Louis I in central Dalmatia in the 14th century. Afterwards Venetian Republic established control over most of Croatian coast until 1797. Modern foundations of Croatian Navy can be traced back to Austro-Hungarian Navy (1797–1918) and Yugoslav Navy (1918–1941, 1942–1991) when Croatia was a constituent part of these states.\n\nParagraph 8: In 1904, Cutler Fairchild was asked by the President of the American Library Association to prepare a statistical statement on “Women in American Libraries” which was published in the December 1904 issue of the Library Journal.  She opened the article by showing the growing prominence of women in American libraries through comparison of three conferences of the American Library Association.  “At the first meeting of the Association in Philadelphia, 1876, only 12 of the 103 members present were women; at the Chicago meeting in 1893, 166 of the 305 members present were women; at Magnolia in 1902, the largest conference yet held, 736 out of 1018 members present were women”.  To further illustrate her opinion that there was no discrimination in regard to sex in the American Library Association, she refers to Miss Caroline M. Hewins, librarian of the Hartford Public Library, who was the first woman to ask a question before a meeting of the American Library Association in 1877, the association's second meeting, and Miss Mary A. Bean, the librarian of the Brookline Public Library, who was the first woman to appear on a library program, by reading a paper on “The evil of unlimited freedom in the use of juvenile fiction” in the 1879 meeting in Boston.   Cutler Fairchild credits the open-minded attitude of the men in the library movement for contributing to the lack of self-consciousness displayed by women in association meetings by taking what women said or wrote at its actual value.  However, she noted that participation by women in American Library Association meetings was disproportionate to their attendance. Cutler Fairchild continued her evaluation of women in libraries by surveying 100 representative libraries to access the number of professional and non-professional positions and their salaries held by women as compared to those held by men.  The results of her inquiries proved that women greatly outnumbered men in the libraries selected, holding a large proportion of administrative positions but with little administrative responsibility, and outnumbered men in non-administrative responsible positions, but seldom held positions with the most responsibility.  In addition, women did not hold positions offering the highest salaries, but rather appeared to perform the same level of work for less compensation.  The following reasons were given for this discrepancy:\n\nParagraph 9: In 1977, Tamm appeared on the MacNeil/Leher Report (now PBS NewsHour) on the topic of DOJ indictments of FBI agents as a result of a New York Times story on \"illegal break‐ins, mail openings and wiretaps committed by F.B.I. agents in New York between 1971 and 1973 while pursuing radical fugitives\".   Tamm said:    I think this question of indictment of FBI agents goes far beyond the agent and the small individual represented by the first indictment. In order to present my case, might I point out that I'm rather unique in the fact that I am speaking in defense of the FBI because of my previous relationship with J. Edgar Hoover, the Director, and the fact that I was the first person, probably, in this country to actively criticize and oppose J. Edgar Hoover for some of the things he was doing. But I have a great and tremendous respect for the FBI organization and the people in it. I think they are being singled out; I can't understand why, but I noticed that the Department of Justice on January the fourteenth offered all sorts of explanation as to why they had not prosecuted CIA for the same, identical reasons or crime that the FBI is now being accused of in the same period of time...  I think it was a plausible reason years ago when Hoover was alive, but I do not think it's a plausible reason now. I think that the FBI is completely and totally under the control of the Attorney General and the Department of Justice. But that goes back to the point that the FBI agents who are now being accused of these crimes were doing them under order from the officials in the government. And the position taken by the Department of Justice in the CIA case was the fact that there was no firm program delineating the extent to which people could go in cases of national security or foreign threats; and for a variety of reasons of that type the Department decided not to prosecute CIA agents. And they said in part: \"In such circumstances prosecution takes on an air of hypocrisy and may appear to be the sacrifice of a scapegoat, and to reach down into the middle of the echelon of the FBI and to ignore the upper echelon of government.\" And this goes into the White House, it goes into the Attorneys General, it goes into the Congress and the Senators.\n\nParagraph 10: Lincoln Financial also acquired Jefferson-Pilot's television and radio operations, which were renamed Lincoln Financial Media. Jefferson Standard Insurance put WBTV in Charlotte on the air on Channel 3 in 1949.  At the time, Jefferson Standard Insurance also had a 16.5% interest in the Greensboro News Company, licensee of WFMY, which signed on from Greensboro two months after WBTV. Jefferson Standard had purchased WBT radio from CBS in 1947. In 1970, the media interests were folded into a new subsidiary, Jefferson-Pilot Communications, still owned by the insurance company.  The broadcasting subsidiary acquired several other radio and television stations across the country, with WBTV serving as the company's flagship station. The group owned 18 radio stations in Miami, Florida; San Diego, California; Denver, Colorado; and Atlanta, Georgia.  It also owned WBTV, the CBS affiliate in Charlotte; WCSC-TV, the CBS affiliate in Charleston, South Carolina and WWBT, the NBC affiliate in Richmond, Virginia.  In June 2007, the company publicly announced it would explore a sale of this division, and hired Merrill Lynch to assess its strategic options.  It was announced on November 12 that Raycom Media purchased the three TV stations, including its sports production division, which was the co-holder to football and basketball games in the Atlantic Coast Conference with Raycom and sole rightsholders to the Southeastern Conference until 2009, when ESPNPlus and CBS Sports acquired the rights.  The Raycom Sports brand was merged with LFS as of January 1, 2008.", "answers": ["Paragraph 2"], "length": 3991, "dataset": "passage_retrieval_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "d5bd5d2ad15e7edc9fd2520b1969650c3c53e472f8784275"}

However, she struggles to be accepted by her peers at Shinyo Academy due to her unusual interests. She befriends Kinoshita Kyoko and dismisses rumors about a figure called Boogiepop, but becomes intrigued after witnessing Nagi Kirima interrogate Kinoshita. Suema tries to learn more about Kirima's involvement with the serial killer but their relationship remains distant. In another installment, Suema meets Touka Miyashita and they become close friends, focusing on their studies. Later, Suema helps Kotoe Kinukawa investigate a relative named Jin Asukai and realizes something unusual is happening. She encourages Aya Orihata to enjoy life and pursue her goals. Throughout these events, the theme of childhood trauma and its impact on personal growth is explored.", "context": "Paragraph 1: By the time Smith left Virginia in 1609, the fragile peace between colonists and Algonquians was already beginning to fray. Soon conflict led to the First Anglo-Powhatan War, and further English colonial settlement beyond Jamestown and into Powhatan's territory. The colonists effectively destroyed two subtribes, the Kecoughtan and the Paspahegh, at the beginning of this war.  Powhatan sent Nemattanew to operate against English colonists on the upper James River, though they held out at Henricus. With the capture of Pocahontas by Captain Samuel Argall in 1613, Powhatan sued for peace.  It came about after her alliance in marriage on April 5, 1614, to John Rolfe, a leading tobacco planter. John Rolfe was one of Pocahontas's many Jamestown teachers before their marriage; he instructed her in matters of the new culture she was being assimilated into, and he also taught her all about Christianity. According to various accounts, Pocahontas and John Rolfe did, in fact, fall in love with each other—it was a consensual relationship.  This might, at least in part, explain Pocahontas's apparent willingness to assimilate, convert to Christianity and remain with the colonists: she wanted to be with Rolfe. Rolfe's longtime friend, Reverend Richard Buck, presided the wedding.  Prior to the wedding, Reverend Alexander Whitaker converted Pocahontas and renamed her \"Rebecca\" at her baptism.\n\nParagraph 2: At the Bretton Woods Conference, the US representative, Harry Dexter White, insisted that the world reserve currency be the United States dollar instead of a proposed new international unit of currency and that the IMF and World Bank be under the purview of the United States. The Reagan administration and US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, and Donald Trump as a private citizen, made identical claims in the 1980s when Japan was undergoing its economic miracle which led Japan to signing the Plaza Accord. Like the TPP, it has been argued that the trade war is simply a more direct attempt to stifle China's development and is indicative of a shift in the US public perception of China as a \"rival nation to be contained and beaten\" among the two major political parties in Congress, the general public and even the business sector. It has been argued however that employing the Cold War playbook for the seemingly destined-to-fail Soviet Union, a state-run and largely closed economy will not work in the case of China because of its sheer size, growing wealth and vibrant economy. To halt development progress, particularly the Made in China 2025 plan, the US has responded by making it harder for Chinese tech companies from obtaining US technologies by investing in or acquiring US tech companies, and even attempting to stifle specific companies, namely Huawei, ZTE and ByteDance, from doing business domestically and abroad allegedly due to unspecified or speculative national security risks. With senior Trump administration officials such as John Bolton, Peter Navarro and Robert Lighthizer demanding any comprehensive trade deal feature \"structural changes\" which would essentially entail China surrendering its sovereignty over its economic system and planning (its Made in China 2025 industrial plan) and permanently ceding technology leadership to the US-an untenable situation to the Chinese- some see trade tensions continuing long into the future.\n\nParagraph 3:  Having once been marked as the next target of a serial killer, Suema develops an unusual interest and knowledge in criminal and abnormal psychology, as well as the desire to not let anything occur around her without her knowing. Suema struggles to find acceptance among her peers at Shinyo Academy. They look upon her as weird and exclude her, as a result of her unusual interests, though she is friends with Kinoshita Kyoko. In Boogiepop and Others, Suema first hears the rumours about Boogiepop, but dismisses them as fantasy, although she investigates a possible sighting of the shinigami. After seeing Nagi Kirima interrogate Kinoshita, Suema searches for Kirima's house and tries to learn what she can from her. She comes to learn that Kirima was involved with stopping the serial killer who had been stalking her, but was surprised to hear the claim that it was Boogiepop who saved her. Their relationship remains distant, despite Suema's efforts to change this. In Boogiepop Phantom, Suema meets Touka Miyashita for the first time and they quickly become close friends. She is relatively unaware of events as they unfold, and is entirely focused on studying for her University entrance exams with Miyashita. Suema appreciates how she is so unconditionally accepting of her and looks out for her friend. In Boogiepop Returns: VS Imaginator Part 1, we learn that Suema and Niitoki Kei are on friendly terms. Suema is approached by Kotoe Kinukawa, who seeks her help in regard to her relative, Jin Asukai. Suema investigates him and realises that something unusual is happening. After seeing a sketch of Suiko Minahoshi in Asukai's office, she goes to the place where Minahoshi had died, only to meet Aya Orihata for the first time and encourage her to take pleasure in life and fulfill her goals. Suema repeatedly just misses learning about what is really going on in the city. Throughout her story, the major theme is how a childhood trauma can influence the growth of an individual. Her backstory, where Suema was stalked by the serial killer, is described in full detail in Boogiepop at Dawn.\n\nParagraph 4: The village grew out of a mainly pastoral industry (mostly sheep farming and dairy produce).  It has a parish church (Anglican), a Nonconformist chapel (Independent), and a local pub (Ye Olde Bull Inn) which served J.W. Lees real ale (from a Manchester brewery). In the 1960s, the village's only shop used to be a bakery and post office also, but the post office has been discontinued. The public house closed its doors to the public as a J.W. Lees owned pub for the last time in May 2018. On the 27th September 2019 the pub re-opened as a Free house.\n\nParagraph 5: A narrative known as the Euthymiaca Historia (written probably by Cyril of Scythopolis in the 5th century) relates how the Emperor Marcian and his wife, Pulcheria, requested the relics of the Virgin Mary from Juvenal, the Patriarch of Jerusalem, while he was attending the Council of Chalcedon (451). According to the account, Juvenal replied that, on the third day after her burial, Mary's tomb was discovered to be empty, only her shroud being preserved in the church of Gethsemane. In 452 the shroud was sent to Constantinople, where it was kept in the Church of Our Lady of Blachernae (Panagia Blacherniotissa).\n\nParagraph 6: Already in his youth, as Lew Sapieha’s courtier, he was involved in affairs of state. In 1600, as member of Lew Sapieha's retinue, he played a significant role in the negotiations with the Tsardom of Russia, editing the planned alliance acts between Poland-Lithuania with the Russian state. In 1602 as District-Governor of Wieliż, he attended the drawing of the border between Poland-Lithuania and Moscovia and later became famous repelling a Russian attack on his own district. During the wars of Sigismund III Vasa against his uncle Charles IX of Sweden, the King of Sweden, he served in the Lithuanian army. In 1605, he fought at the Battle of Kircholm. In 1606, as a member of the retinue of Mikołaj Oleśnicki, he escorted Maryna Mniszchówna to Moscow, where he led negotiations for an alliance with False Dmitriy I.\n\nParagraph 7: As they are driving, a luxurious roadside estate bursts into flames.  The girls park the car and make sure that no one is trapped inside. In doing so, Nancy sees someone fleeing the property, and discovers an anonymous Swedish diary on the ground. She picks up this clue, and as firefighters and gawkers arrive on the scene, she notices an attractive young man moving her car away from the flying embers. At first suspicious of Ned Nickerson, Nancy warms to him when he helps her out of a jam.  Ned proves to be a good friend, and is a perennial admirer of Nancy's from then on.  Meanwhile, Mrs. Swenson's husband is missing, and she identifies his diary as the one picked up at the fire. To top it all off, the owner of the burned house, Felix Raybolt, is missing, and his wife claims Joe Swenson has murdered her husband. Raybolt, it turns out, swindles inventors like Swenson out of their patents and copyrights, and used one such invention to start the fire.\n\nParagraph 8: Some in the Protestant Episcopal Church saw Cummins' decision as schismatic. Others, however, disagreed. One correspondent of the publication \"The Episcopalian\" said, \"If we say that this new church has begun in schism, the church of Rome alleges the same things against us. The real question is, which party is guilty of the schism, the party which separates and goes out?  or the party that forces the separation, by making binding on the conscience what Christ has not made binding?\"  Rather than characterize this as schism, Bishop Cummins and his fellow reformers portrayed themselves as providing a Protestant, Anglican identity under which there could be a 'closer union of all Evangelical Christendom.' \"The Reformed Episcopal Church would be what the Protestant Episcopal Church might have become had it not been paralyzed by the Tractarian virus.\"  The term \"Reformed\" was never intended to denote any Calvinistic sense of Reformed theology, but was intended to convey Cummins' purpose of an Episcopal Church that had been reformed against Catholic influences [the founders of the church would often stylise the name as The Re-Formed Episcopal Church, for disambiguation so that it was known this was the Episcopal Church Re-Formed and not of a reformed theology].  Bishop Cummins was in attendance at a Convention on 21 October 1868 and was greatly disappointed by the \"Catholic\" practices which he witnessed: \"[a]ltars erected, with super-altars, with burning candles, and floating clouds of incense; the communion service set in a Roman framework ... there is a departure from the doctrinal basis of the Reformation.\"  Cummins' feelings grew stronger after reading an essay titled \"Are There Romanising Germs in the Prayer Book?\" which asserted that the Romanisation of the church and the Holy Eucharistic service was not an influence from the outside but, rather came from inside the church – it was in the Prayer Book itself, thus; Cummins started pushing stronger against the \"Roman germs\" which sadly, caused him to lose friends on both sides: Anglo-Catholics and Evangelicals alike.\n\nParagraph 9:  Lead (Pb): In the mid-1970s, lead was listed as a criteria air pollutant that required NAAQS regulation.  In 1977, the EPA published a document which detailed the Air Quality Criteria for lead.  This document was based on the scientific assessments of lead at the time.  Based on this report (1977 Lead AQCD), the EPA established a \"1.5 µg/m3 (maximum quarterly calendar average) Pb NAAQS in 1978.\" The Clean Air Act requires periodic review of NAAQS, and new scientific data published after 1977 made it necessary to revise the standards previously established in the 1977 Lead AQCD document.  An Addendum to the document was published in 1986 and then again as a Supplement to the 1986 AQCD/Addendum in 1990. In 1990, a Lead Staff Paper was prepared by the EPA's Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards (OPQPS), which was based on information presented in the 1986 Lead/AQCD/Addendum and 1990 Supplement, in addition to other OAQPS sponsored lead exposure/risk analyses.  In this paper, it was proposed that the Pb NAAQS be revised further and presented options for revision to the EPA.  The EPA elected to not modify the Pb NAAQS further, but decided to instead focus on the 1991 U.S. EPA Strategy for Reducing Lead Exposure.  The EPA concentrated on regulatory and remedial clean-up efforts to minimize Pb exposure from numerous non-air sources that caused more severe public health risks, and undertook actions to reduce air emissions.\n\nParagraph 10: McDonald made his competitive debut for Celtic in the first leg of the UEFA Champions League third qualifying-round match against Spartak Moscow at Luzhniki Stadium, assisting Paul Hartley for Celtic's goal as the game finished 1–1. His first goal for the club came in the second leg of the tie at Celtic Park. A mistake by Spartak defender Roman Shishkin allowed McDonald to slip in and hit the ball first time past Stipe Pletikosa. This match also ended 1–1, but Celtic won 4–3 on penalties. Just days later in an away league match against St Mirren, McDonald latched onto a long Gary Caldwell pass to lob Chris Smith from a tight angle and score his first SPL goal for the club. He followed that up with the winning goal in the final minute of their 2–1 UEFA Champions League group-stage win against A.C. Milan on 3 October and another last minute winner just days later at Gretna. In a pulsating clash with Old Firm rivals Rangers on 16 April 2008, McDonald set up his Dutch strike partner Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink for a last minute goal that kept Celtic in the 2007–08 SPL title race, before scoring a double and winning a penalty scored by Barry Robson in another vital 3–2 Old Firm victory eleven days later. At the end of the season, McDonald was rewarded with a new five-year deal at Parkhead and was nominated for SPL Player of the Year. He scored 25 goals in 36 league appearances in his first season at Celtic and was the top goalscorer during the 2007–08 season, beating the next highest goalscorer and strike partner Vennegoor of Hesselink by 10 goals. This breakthrough season included two hat-tricks; against Dundee United and former club Motherwell. In total, McDonald scored 31 times in his first season at Parkhead.\n\nParagraph 11: Barnette's solo show Compland at Fort Gansevoort in New York City in 2017, included a group of five framed COINTELPRO documents, selections from her ongoing project My Father’s FBI File, 2016-, vinyl lettering, and photocollages. The title of the exhibition, Compland, invoked \"a fictive space sublating Compton and Oakland, California, '90s hip-hop, and '60s Black Power.\" In this exhibition, as in all of her work, blackness and the African American identity and experience is explored. Chloe Wyma of ArtForum writes of Barnette's Fort Gansevoort exhibition:Blackness – its social constructions, structures of signification, material cultures, oppressions, and modes of resistance – is pronounced and urgent in Barnette’s work. The color pink also presents again and again, from baby to bubble-gum to hot fuchsia, in the pulsating chevrons of Barnette’s tessellated photo-wallpaper that showed a child sitting in a wicker “Huey Newton” chair; in the bags of Hello Kitty cotton candy strewn around the gallery; and in an acrylic glitter bar – part object, part sculpture – installed on the third floor. Pink spelled out PRESTO DINERO (I LEND MONEY) on a Spanish-language payday loan sign, supplied the ground in the abstract painting Untitled (Black dots on pink), 2016, and popped from behind a chain-link fence embellished with Swarovski crystals in the photograph Untitled (Pink fence sparkle), 2017.For her first major traveling exhibition, \"Sadie Barnette: Dear 1968,...\" (2018) Barnette pulled from her personal and family history by using family photographs and selections from the FBI files on her father Rodney Barnette, compiled on him after he joined the Black Panther Party in 1968. For this exhibition Barnette, responds to the intimate details of the FBI files by intervening in them by redacting information with stickers, paint splashes, and spray paint, while also embellishing with glitter, vinyl, and rhinestones. As reported on in Hyperallergic, \"such child-like embellishments are whimsical touches that draw the viewer in, but these add-ons are only playing dress-up on much wilder realities.\" These interventions are an attempt to reclaim her family history. Included in the exhibition is a black and white wallpapered wall created from signatures and seals found in the file. On this wallpaper hang a pair of photographs of her father, Rodney Barnette, \"in one photograph, he is in Navy uniform pre-Vietnam era. In another, his black leather jacket, turtleneck, and beret signal his role as founder of the Compton Chapter of the Black Panther party in “Untitled (Dad, 1966 and 1968)” (2016).\" Through this exhibition \"the work proposes changing the conditions of the world, turning the past of racial profiling into a loyal tribute to her dad.\"\n\nParagraph 12: When in 1830 the Polish November Uprising led by Michał Gedeon Radziwiłł broke out at Warsaw in Russian Congress Poland, his brother Antoni Radziwiłł was dismissed as Duke-Governor of the Prussian Grand Duchy of Posen by King Frederick William III and the sole rule passed to Flottwell as the new Oberpräsident. He was a strong supporter of Germanisation and standardised schooling policies, which by some was seen as directed against ethnic Polish Prussians in the region. In 1843 in \"Anerkennung der Hilfe nach dem großen Hamburger Brand\" (acknowledgment of the assistance after the great Hamburg fire), he was named an honorary citizen of Hamburg.\n\nParagraph 13: In the Marvel Comics canon, Michael Morbius is a famous biochemist who contracts a rare blood disease which he then tries to cure by using a combination of experimental chemicals, electroshock therapy, and genetic samples of vampire bats. The experiment mutates him into a \"pseudo-vampire\" or \"living vampire\", a life form with abilities and traits resembling, but not identical to, those of truly supernatural and \"undead\" creatures such as vampires (which exist in the Marvel Universe). To keep his blood disease in remission, Morbius must now regularly feed on fresh human blood or face rapid illness followed by death. Initially, Morbius's mutation affects his ability to reason while experiencing hunger. This leads to blackouts and acts of violence that result in murder and villainy, occasionally followed by lucid periods during which he regrets causing harm. A mixture of electricity and Spider-Man's blood restores his humanity for several years, but he later reverts to being a pseudo-vampire. During the \"Rise of the Midnight Sons\", a mixture of poison and genuine demon blood alters Morbius' physiology slightly while also restoring his mental capacity, allowing him greater control and awareness even while experiencing bloodlust. A new \"anti-viral\" serum involving Spider-Man's blood also allows him to regain humanity for hours at a time. Concluding he now has greater control over his condition and wishing to regain some semblance of a normal life, Morbius creates a new cover identity of Dr. Morgan Michaels, while at night secretly acting as a lethal vigilante who only feeds on \"the blood of the guilty.\" Later on, another mutagenic serum saves his life but results in Morbius once again being vulnerable to temporary madness and a loss of his faculties when his bloodlust is too strong. As a result, he abandons his Morgan Michaels identity and becomes a fugitive again.", "answers": ["Paragraph 3"], "length": 3266, "dataset": "passage_retrieval_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "8c7047997447850eb5acd4ae683572e97283cc6080506384"}
{"input": "The text is a summary of events involving a person named Kim and her relationships with Glanville, Foster, and Kyle. Kim helps Glanville pack, spies on Glanville's ex, and opens up about her ex-husband's health. Kim takes her daughter wedding dress shopping and later celebrates her own wedding day. She goes to a spa day in Santa Barbara that threatens her sobriety, has erratic behavior at a poker night, and is admitted to the hospital for a broken rib. Kim is visited by Kyle and Glanville separately, causing tension and she-said-she-said situations. Kim attends a mediated lunch with Kyle but accuses her of not caring enough to keep things private. In Amsterdam, Kim has arguments with Davidson and Rinna, insinuating Rinna has an eating disorder. Kim confronts Kyle about Glanville's negative comments about her sobriety.

Johnson authorized an increase in U.S. troop strength in South Vietnam and the 27th Marines was one of the units sent. On 10 and 12 February, the 1st Battalion, 27th Marines, at Hawaii had embarked on board the ,  and the  to participate in two landing exercises on Okinawa, but with the new orders the ships proceeded to Da Nang. Between 14 and 21 February, the rest of regimental landing team (RLT) 27 deployed by sea and air from Camp Pendleton to Da Nang. Military Airlift Command planes flew more than 3,300 men of the regiment from California to Vietnam. By 17 February, the 27th Marines headquarters, together with those of battalion landing teams (BLT) 2/27 and 3/27 opened their command posts at Da Nang. The forces arriving as part of RLT 27 also included personnel from the artillery battalion, 2nd Battalion, 13th Marines. On 21 February, the  departed Naval Base San Diego with the surface elements of the RLT, some 200 personnel and over 5,000 tons of equipment. By the end of the month, the 1st Battalion had joined the other two battalions of the regiment at Da Nang. By the end of February, the 2nd Battalion relieved the 3rd Battalion, 5th Marines and the 3rd Battalion relieved the 2nd Battalion, 3rd Marines in the southwest Da Nang tactical area of responsibility (TAOR). During March the 1/27th Marines remained in reserve while the other two battalions conducted over 2,900 small unit patrols throughout its TAOR resulting in about 310 contacts, 182 initiated by the Marines and the remainder by the Vietcong (VC). At the end of March 1/27th Marines was moved north to provide security of Route 1 between Huế and Phu Bai Combat Base and the protection of Tân Mỹ Base.\n\nParagraph 2: Dioxane has an  of 5170 mg/kg in rats. It is irritating to the eyes and respiratory tract. Exposure may cause damage to the central nervous system, liver and kidneys. In a 1978 mortality study conducted on workers exposed to 1,4-dioxane, the observed number deaths from cancer was not significantly different from the expected number. Dioxane is classified by the National Toxicology Program as \"reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen\". It is also classified by the IARC as a Group 2B carcinogen: possibly carcinogenic to humans because it is a known carcinogen in other animals. The United States Environmental Protection Agency classifies dioxane as a probable human carcinogen (having observed an increased incidence of cancer in controlled animal studies, but not in epidemiological studies of workers using the compound), and a known irritant (with a no-observed-adverse-effects level of 400 milligrams per cubic meter) at concentrations significantly higher than those found in commercial products. Under California Proposition 65, dioxane is classified in the U.S. State of California to cause cancer. Animal studies in rats suggest that the greatest health risk is associated with inhalation of vapors in the pure form. The State of New York has adopted a first-in-the-nation drinking water standard for 1,4-Dioxane and set the maximum contaminant level of 1 part per billion.\n\nParagraph 3: An \"Alternative Thought for the Day\" was offered by Unitarian minister Andrew Pakula on Boxing Day 2013, at the request of guest editor Sir Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web and a Unitarian himself. Berners-Lee had wished Pakula to present his thoughts within Thought for the Day, but the BBC hierarchy claimed this was not appropriate, since Pakula describes himself as an atheist. Instead he was allowed to deliver his message an hour earlier, with a theistic Unitarian minister appearing in the actual Thought for the Day slot. Pakula used his message to reflect on the underlying meaning of Christmas. In a brief discussion with Today host Mishal Husain, Pakula said, \"The BBC talks about not allowing people of 'no faith' to present Thought for the Day, well, what does 'no faith' mean? Here I am, I'm a minister of religion, leading a congregation talking about peace and love, and I'm considered a person of no faith because I say I'm an atheist.\" The controversy was covered in Britain's main broadsheets such as The Guardian, The Independent and Daily Telegraph and as far afield as Australia. Since 2007, the website Platitude of the Day has offered a daily humorous, critical counter to Thought for the Day.\n\nParagraph 4: Section 24 of the Australian Constitution requires that the number of members in the House of Representatives be, as nearly as possible, twice the number of members in the Senate. The most important effect of the \"nexus\" in the Australian Constitution is to prevent the dilution of the collective voting power of the Senate, which represents the Australian states equally, in any joint sitting of both houses following a double dissolution election. The nexus ensures that Senators will always have about one-third of the votes in a joint sitting, and Members of the House of Representatives about two-thirds. The referendum question asked the public to vote on whether \"the number of members of the House of Representatives may be increased without necessarily increasing the number of Senators\". It was defeated, with 59.75% of voters voting \"No\" to this question.\n\nParagraph 5: Revealed to be one of the scenarios Master Xehanort devised, the Organization was established when Terra-Xehanort turned himself, his supporter Braig, and the disciples of Ansem the Wise into Nobodies with Terra-Xehanort's Nobody Xemnas as the group's leader. Originally numbered at eight, the Organization recruited a quartet of Nobodies, who were hand-picked by Xehanort as their original selves were time-displaced Keyblade users from the aftermath of the Keyblade War, before recruiting Roxas as their final member with Xion as an unofficial member. Each member is given a cloak made of a special material that allows them to pass through the Corridors of Darkness into other worlds safely without being attacked by the Heartless there. Members are given titles indicating both their role in Organization XIII and their personality, as well as their own breed of lesser Nobodies to control, usually suited to their fighting style and unique themed powers. As Nobodies, they lack emotion and morality, and are unable to feel guilt and remorse for their actions. However, most of the members' personalities are based from what memories they have of their original selves. Six of the Organization's members were introduced in Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories, with the remaining members introduced in Kingdom Hearts II. In Chain of Memories, the series' protagonist Sora and his friends Donald Duck and Goofy are led to a mysterious fortress called Castle Oblivion by Marluxia, who intends to turn Sora into his pawn by manipulating his memories. Sora's friend Riku also arrives at Castle Oblivion, but in the basement where he encounters other Organization members. Sora and Riku traverse the levels of the castle to reach the top, fighting and defeating several members along the way. By Kingdom Hearts II, the actions of Sora and Riku, along with Roxas' resignation, reduce the Organization to seven members, who seek to use the power of Kingdom Hearts—a repository of knowledge and power, and the source of all hearts—to become complete beings.\n\nParagraph 6: A collection of  bits may have  states: see binary number for details. Number of states of a collection of discrete variables depends exponentially on the number of variables, and only as a power law on number of states of each variable. Ten bits have more () states than three decimal digits ().  bits are more than sufficient to represent an information (a number or anything else) that requires  decimal digits, so information contained in discrete variables with 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10... states can be ever superseded by allocating two, three, or four times more bits. So, the use of any other small number than 2 does not provide an advantage.\n\nParagraph 7: The present day sense of health being a public concern for the state began in the Middle Ages. A few state interventions include maintaining clean towns, enforcing quarantines during epidemics and supervising sewer systems. Private corporations also played a role in public health. The funding for research and the institutions for them to work were funded by governments and private firms. Epidemics were the cause of most government interventions. The early goal of public health was reactionary whereas the modern goal is to prevent disease before it becomes a problem. Despite the overall improvement of world health, there still has not been any decrease in the health gap between the affluent and the impoverished. Today, society is more likely to blame health issues on the individual rather than society as a whole. This was the prevailing view in the late 20th century. In the 1980s the Black Report, published in the United Kingdom, went against this view and argued that the true root of the problem was material deprivation. This report proposed a comprehensive anti-poverty strategy to address these issues. Since this did not parallel the views of the Conservative government, it did not go into action immediately. The Conservative government was criticized by the Labour Party for not implementing the suggestions that the Black Report listed. This criticism gave the Black Report the exposure it needed and its arguments were considered a valid explanation for health inequality. There is also a debate over whether poverty causes ill-health or if ill-health causes poverty. Arguments by the National Health Service gave considerable emphasis to poverty and lack of access to health care. It has also been found that heredity has more of a bearing on health than social environment, but research has also proved that there is indeed a positive correlation between socioeconomic inequalities and illness.\n\nParagraph 8: In the summer of 1915, after attending officer training camp in Plattsburgh, New York, for a proposed volunteer army (an outgrowth of the movement to prepare the United States for entry into World War I) and earning a commendation as a marksman, Heidelberger traveled to Lake Kezar in Maine for a vacation. After performing Pergolese's Nina there, his piano accompanist exclaimed, \"meet Nina,\" and in walked a young lady, Nina Tachau. They were married in 1916 to the strains of a wedding march composed by Heidelberger. She was a writer and activist for the New York chapter of the League of Women Voters and, during the 1940s, for the American Association for the United Nations. After her death from cancer in 1946, Heidelberger continued her work on behalf of the United Nations, and was a member of the U.S. delegation to meetings of the World Federation of United Nations Organizations in Prague, Bangkok, and other cities. He met his second wife Charlotte Rosen at a concert. She was the violist in a Mozart trio in which Heidelberger performed. They married in 1956. For ten years prior to her death in 1988, he took care of her at home while she suffered from Alzheimer's disease.\n\nParagraph 9: Kim, who has bonded even more with Glanville, heads to Glanville's house to help pack. Later the pair dress up to spy of Glanville's ex. Kim and Foster, who have also become closer, meet to ride horses. Kim opens up about her ex-husband, who is still her best friend, revealing he isn't well. Kim then takes her daughter, Brooke, wedding dress shopping and later celebrates her wedding day. Kim heads up the coast to Santa Barbara for a relaxing spa day they may end up comprising her sobriety. During a Poker night at Davidson's home Kim displays some erratic behavior that has everyone worried, especially her sister Kyle. After Kyle's questioning, it leads to an explosive argument with Glanville escorting Kim away from the house. Kim is admitted to hospital after not feeling well and having a cough. It turns out she has a broken rib, and the night of the poker party she took something for the pain. She is released from hospital and is visited by Kyle and Glanville at separate times and finds herself in a game of she-said-she-said. At Kyle's gay mixer, Kim is put in the middle of Kyle and Glanville's argument and her struggle with her sobriety is revealed and she is left taking Glanville's side and claims she is defending herself. Kim attends a lunch with Kyle that is mediated by Davidson in attempts to move forward, but Kim insists that Kyle doesn't care enough to keep things private. On the way to Amsterdam, Kim confronts Rinna on her recent conversation with Glanville insinuating that Kim has relapsed. While in Amsterdam, Kim feels attacked by both Davidson and Rinna. She calls them out on their judgment which results in to an explosive argument. Kim insinuates Rinna has an eating disorder and brings up Rinna's husband which provokes Rinna into smashing a wine glass. Kim meets with Kyle in Palm Springs where Kyle addressing the issue of Glanville. Kyle claims Glanville is speaking about Kim's sobriety negatively but Kim believes Kyle is lying. Kim later requests answers from Glanville and ends up believing her over her sister. During the reunion part three, Kim admitted to taking one of her ex-husband's pills. She claims she hasn't slipped or relapsed. After the reunion, Kim appeared on a Dr. Phil special discussing her relapse and recent drunken arrest admitting that she drank while the series was airing and prior to the reunion. Her son revealed that she also takes pills and smokes pot.\n\nParagraph 10: The music video opens with Ed Sheeran who is first seen sitting down in a lonely dark room save for the sunlight that shines beside him with footages featuring his love interest and fellow boxer (Jennie Pegouskie) and his upcoming match. As the song begins, we see Sheeran shadowboxing while Pegouskie is already at the gym ready for the workout. She hangs herself at the punching bag doing sit-up and stretches herself. A little while later, Pegouskie shadowboxes and punches a punching bag when Sheeran lately arrives at the training carrying a bag with him. After Sheeran places his bag at the closet, he proceeds to train himself for his upcoming match trained by a personal trainer along with Pegouskie who still warms up herself. Later, Sheeran and Pegouskie head out of the gym towards a restaurant while bonding each other. Upon arriving, the couple eat and shared foods like canoodling over a fried chicken as they have an intimate conversation with each other, although their dialogue is entirely mute. Afterwards, Sheeran and his girlfriend ride a taxi and make out at the back seat while the taxi driver does not notice this as he is focusing on driving. Back at the gym, Sheeran and Pegouskie physically trained hard doing various training exercises. While training, the couple embraced each other and teach one other, eventually falling in love with each other in the process. Later, Pegouskie leaves a picture and a box to Sheeran in a closet and seemingly abandons him. The scene cuts back to Sheeran who discovers a picture and a black box both seen earlier with the latter containing a blue mouthguard featuring a \"÷\" symbol at the front. Realizing that his girlfriend had left him (unbeknownst to him, she already is at a passenger ship), He starts to search for her to no avail. In response to her disappointing departure, Sheeran lets out his frustration and proceeds to an intense workout that includes tire-flipping, shadowboxing, sit-up, running and push-up. Later, Sheeran participates a match he has anticipated throughout the clip but he unexpectedly encounters a Rikishi or a sumo wrestler (Yamamotoyama Ryūta), much to his shock. During the match, Sheeran is seen almost always avoiding Yama who constantly chases him and the latter fails to defeat the Rikishi. Sheeran ends up getting defeated and is thrown at the edge of the ring crying in agony with the crowd encouraging him to stand up. Towards the end of the video, Yama wins the match but Pegouskie emerges the scene among the crowd flying into the ring with a karate kick in the air aiming towards Yama as the scene cuts to black with the text that reads “DIRECTED BY: JASON KOENIG”.

Unfortunately, his family is mostly indifferent towards his creative streak, which is a constant source of frustration for him. Ian is intelligent, if somewhat naive, he has a very large imagination, and often gets lost in daydreams (many of which are parodies of famous films). His ultimate dream is to win an Academy Award, to the point that he constantly practices his acceptance speech, just so he will not be caught speechless if and when it ever does happen. Aside from this, Ian is a typical sitcom child; most plots involve him either failing at an elaborate scheme or trying desperately to survive in a world that does not seem to fit his ideals. According to the episode \"Being Principal Bill\", Ian's middle name is James, a reference to Ian James Corlett, whom he is based on. He has a crush on Sandi as seen in various animated thoughts. \n\nParagraph 2: For the past years, researchers have been trying to reduce the price of solar cells while maximizing efficiency. Thin-film solar cell is a cost-effective second generation solar cell with much reduced thickness at the expense of light absorption efficiency. Efforts to maximize light absorption efficiency with reduced thickness have been made. Surface texturing is one of techniques used to reduce optical losses to maximize light absorbed. Currently, surface texturing techniques on silicon photovoltaics are drawing much attention. Surface texturing could be done in multiple ways. Etching single crystalline silicon substrate can produce randomly distributed square based pyramids on the surface using anisotropic etchants. Recent studies show that c-Si wafers could be etched down to form nano-scale inverted pyramids. Multicrystalline silicon solar cells, due to poorer crystallographic quality, are less effective than single crystal solar cells, but mc-Si solar cells are still being used widely due to less manufacturing difficulties. It is reported that multicrystalline solar cells can be surface-textured to yield solar energy conversion efficiency comparable to that of monocrystalline silicon cells, through isotropic etching or photolithography techniques. Incident light rays onto a textured surface do not reflect back out to the air as opposed to rays onto a flat surface. Rather some light rays are bounced back onto the other surface again due to the geometry of the surface. This process significantly improves light to electricity conversion efficiency, due to increased light absorption. This texture effect as well as the interaction with other interfaces in the PV module is a challenging optical simulation task. A particularly efficient method for modeling and optimization is the OPTOS formalism. In 2012, researchers at MIT reported that c-Si films textured with nanoscale inverted pyramids could achieve light absorption comparable to 30 times thicker planar c-Si. In combination with anti-reflective coating, surface texturing technique can effectively trap light rays within a thin film silicon solar cell. Consequently, required thickness for solar cells decreases with the increased absorption of light rays.\n\nParagraph 3: Following the action-romance flick Thirumalai in 2003, Ghilli, a film directed by S. Dharani and produced by A. M. Rathnam, was released. It co-starred Trisha and Prakash Raj with Vijay as the lead. Ghilli was the first Tamil film of all time to gross over 500 million, or 50 crore, in the domestic box office.  The film grossed nearly $500,000 in the Malaysian market. Ghilli also broke the record for the most people seeing a movie in the first week of its release, previously held by M. G. Ramachandran's Adimai Penn (1969). Ghilli received favourable reviews. The Hindu stated that \"Vijay, the hero whom the masses today identify with, and Prakash Raj, the inimitable villain in tow, this flick, \"Ghilli\"...on a winning track\".\n\nParagraph 4: By now recognised as a potential senior commander, and in common with a number of other relatively junior officers who had fought in France, in late January 1941 he handed over command of the 17th Brigade, which he had now commanded for almost sixteen months, to Brigadier G. W. B. Tarleton and was made GOC of the 56th (London) Infantry Division, in succession to Major General Claude Liardet, soon receiving a promotion to the acting major general. A first line Territorial Army (TA) formation, formerly the 1st London Division, the 56th Division − comprising the 167th, 168th and 169th Infantry Brigades and supporting divisional troops − was serving in Kent, the most vulnerable part of the country to invasion, as one of three divisions in XII Corps, then commanded by Lieutenant General Andrew Thorne until April when he was replaced by Lieutenant General Bernard Montgomery. The two other divisions in XII Corps were the 43rd (Wessex) and 44th (Home Counties) Divisions, commanded respectively by Major Generals Charles Allfrey (from late February) and Brian Horrocks (from late June), both of whom were known to Stopford, having been fellow instructors at the Staff College, Camberley before the war. Thanks to his predecessor, Major General Liardet, a TA officer who had been GOC for well over three years, the division, which had not seen action in France, was relatively well trained and reasonably well-equipped and, with the arrival of Montgomery as the new corps commander, large-scale exercises became common, getting progressively more difficult each week. Montgomery, already well known for his tendency to dismiss senior officers who failed to live up to his standards, appears to have formed a high opinion of Stopford, as the latter was not sacked, and may well have secured for him his next appointment, as Commandant of the Staff College, Camberley, handing over command of the 56th Division to Major General Eric Miles in early October.\n\nParagraph 5: Black Stallion is a monster truck that races on the USHRA circuit and for other promoters.  Black Stallion started out as a stock 1982 Ford F350 back in 1982, owned and modified by Michael Vaters.  The first modification was a homemade 12\" lift kit, since such kits were unavailable at the time.  Mike then later added two sunroofs, an Alpine stereo system, a Ford 460 Engine, Rockwell 5 ton toploaders, Clark 20 ton planetaries, 66\" terra tires, a 9\" television and later on, a 1988 Ford F series front end.  Between 1990 and 1991, Mike realized the future of monster trucks, which was racing.  To be competitive, Mike replaced the leaf springs with airbags, the old heavy split ring rims with lightweight one piece rims, fiberglass body pieces, cutting the tires, gutting the interior out, 4 linking the truck and putting in a bigger engine.  The modifications proved to be beneficial to Mike, with close races with First Blood, and competing in some Pendaliner Special Events racing events.  After a violent rollover in Bloomsburg Pennsylvania in 1991, Mike decided to put King shocks on the truck, which he later added coil springs in 1992.  Along with the coil springs, Mike also removed the airbags.  Mike is credited as the first owner to use bypass shocks. Also for 1992, Mike changed the front clip to a 1992 Ford F-series front end.  Mike rarely ran this truck after he built the popular Boogey Van in 1993, driven by his then wife, Pam Vaters.  Due to this, the truck was nicknamed Rodney, after the comedian, Rodney Dangerfield.  Mike then built a truck for the 1996 season for research and development, named Black Stallion 2000, since his crew members joked about Mike not building a new truck for himself until the new millennium.  This chassis is still running strong to this day.  For his 20th anniversary, Mike decided to repaint Black stallion, with the front of the truck yellow, going into black with a horse face painted on.  The truck currently has the same paint scheme. The drivers for 2016 are Michael Vaters & Matt Cody. Vaters will compete in the Fox Sports 1 Championship Series. Cody will travel to Birmingham, Toronto, Newark, Charleston, Columbia, Worcester, Wheeling & Baton Rouge.\n\nParagraph 6: The setting moves backward to 1908. Two figures appear in Tokyo at exactly the same time. One is Yasumasa Hirai, a master onmyoji, a direct descendant of Abe no Seimei and leader of the Tsuchimikado Family; who has come to give advice to Baron Eiichi Shibusawa on how to make Tokyo the most blessed and successful city in the East. The other figure is Yasunori Kato, an evil Onmyoji who wishes to destroy Tokyo completely to appease his ancestors, the indigenous tribes of Japan who fought against the Imperial court in ancient times.Yasumasa Hirai: There is no Kato family in Ryujin Village. There is no Kato in the ancient documents. However, this village is close to the place where ascetics have trained, and there were many rumors in that village about strangers who sometimes appeared in the nearby mountains and used magic. I believe Kato is the descendent of the ancient people who never obeyed the founder, and he inherited both the curse and the magic of the Kibi. (Doomed Megalopolis) Toei Animation Studio, Translated by ADV, 2003 Kato plans to do this by awakening the raging spirit of Taira no Masakado as a weapon to demolish the city. To do this, he kidnaps a young woman (Yukari Tatsumiya), who is blessed with psychic powers, to use as a medium for Masakado's spirit. Hirai discovers this and attempts to stop Kato and save Yukari with his own magic. Hirai takes Yukari to the Tsuchimikado temple to perform the monoimi ceremony (recreating the events of one of Abe no Seimei's famous tales from the Uji Shūi Monogatari). In the meantime, Yukari's friends fight Kato's shikigami outside the temple so Hirai can complete the ceremony. But Kato still infiltrates Hirai's protective circle with a magical intruder, stopping the ceremony. In a final act of desperation Hirai grabs a sacred hamaya and fires it at Kato; but Kato magically reflects it back, mortally injuring Hirai. With Hirai defeated, Kato escapes with Yukari.\n\nParagraph 7: Bearer shares are called securities, an anonymous holder of which is recognized from the legal point of view as a full-fledged shareholder of the company with all relevant rights. This document does not contain any indication of the name and name of the owner. The rights certified by the bearer act are actually owned by the owner of this document. The owner of the bearer certificate is considered the owner of shares certified by a certificate. Neither the company nor the chairman of the meeting of shareholders entered in the company's register, nor the director, any official of the company and no other authorized person is required to find out the circumstances under which the certificate was placed by its owner, or to raise the question of the validity or eligibility of any company, any actions of the owner of the certificate of such action. A shareholder is a person who actually owns a share (a share certificate). Bearer shares are transferred by simply delivering the certificate to a new holder. When the bearer shares are sold, it is not required to make any transfer inscriptions on the share certificate: The share is transferred by the physical transfer of the certificate from the seller (the bearer of the share certificate) to the buyer. The transfer of the bearer shares means the transfer of the relevant rights to the company. In contrast, a registered share contains an indication of the identity of the shareholder - only this person and no one else can be a shareholder of the company. The names of the owners are entered in the register of the company's shareholders (owners of bearer shares are not registered in the company's register), and any transfer of shares from one owner to another is carried out on the basis of a written document (for example, a contract of sale between the seller and the buyer). Information on the change of owners of registered shares is also reflected in the shareholder register.\n\nParagraph 8: On 30 December, S-6 and SubDiv 12 arrived at Mare Island, California. They operated along the West Coast until 15 February 1927; in the Panama Canal area in March–April; then returned to New London on 3 May to operate along the New England coast. On 17 December,  — another S-boat of SubDiv 12 — sank after colliding with the Coast Guard cutter  off Provincetown, Massachusetts. S-6 then served as a training model to familiarize divers preparing to raise the sunken sub. S-4 was raised on 17 March 1928 and S-6 resumed normal operations with her division. She conducted winter maneuvers in the Panama Canal area in 1929-1930, but primarily operated out of New London until decommissioned on 10 April 1931, at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. She was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 25 January 1937.\n\nParagraph 9: The first modern theoretical models for soil consolidation were proposed in the 1920s by Terzaghi and Fillunger, according to two substantially different approaches. The former was based on diffusion equations in eulerian notation, whereas the latter considered the local Newton’s law for both liquid and solid phases, in which main variables, such as partial pressure, porosity, local velocity etc., were involved by means of the mixture theory. Terzaghi had an engineering approach to the problem of soil consolidation and provided simplified models that are still widely used in engineering practice today, whereas, on the other hand, Fillunger had a rigorous approach to the above problems and provided rigorous mathematical models that paid particular attention to the methods of local averaging of the involved variables. Fillunger’s model was very abstract and involved variables that were difficult to detect experimentally, and, therefore, it was not applicable to the study of real cases by engineers and/or designers. Nevertheless, this provided the basis for advanced theoretical studies of particularly complex problems. Due to the different approach to the problem of consolidation by the two scientists, a bitter scientific dispute arose between them, and this unfortunately led to a tragic ending in 1937. After Fillunger’s suicide, his theoretical results were forgotten for decades, whereas the methods proposed by Terzaghi found widespread diffusion among scientists and professionals. In the following decades Biot fully developed the three-dimensional soil consolidation theory, extending the one-dimensional model previously proposed by Terzaghi to more general hypotheses and introducing the set of basic equations of poroelasticity. Today, the Terzaghis’ one dimensional model is still the most utilized by engineers for its conceptual simplicity and because it is based on experimental data, such as oedometer tests, which are relatively simple, reliable and inexpensive and for which theoretical solutions in closed form are well known. According to the \"father of soil mechanics\", Karl von Terzaghi, consolidation is \"any process which involves a decrease in water content of saturated soil without replacement of water by air\". More generally, consolidation refers to the process by which soils change volume in response to a change in pressure, encompassing both compaction and swelling.\n\nParagraph 10: In his 1977 book The Comprehensive Guide to Board Wargaming, Nicholas Palmer noted the long game times (3–9 hours), calling the game \"Interesting, varied and challenging, but not for the impatient.\" In his 1980 sequel, The Best of Board Wargaming, Palmer included a review by Tom Oleson (the designer), who said, \"the best feature of Anzio may not be apparent in one or two playings; this is the satisfying realism with which a multi-unit battle is simulated. It's hard to think of a comparable game which does it better\" although \"the worst aspects of the game are the inevitable long periods when, in faithful simulation of the campaign, little happens\". \"Paradoxically, the game's most admired feature — the colourful and handsome mapboard — is functionally its weakest point\" because not only are Sicily and the heel and toe of Italy omitted, but there are some points of obscurity (e.g. roads which nick the corner of a hexagon). He also criticizes the crudeness with which the decisive Allied airstrikes, which in reality took place over a period of six to eight weeks in the spring of 1944, are simulated in a single turn (likened by some players to a thermonuclear attack on the German lines - although the resulting collapse of the German positions is accurate) and an anomaly whereby weak enemy units left near the front line can be destroyed in combat, thus generating  extra exploitation movement for the victorious attacker. Palmer then commented that Oleson's review of his own game is \"scrupulously fair\" and added that the game takes time to play as it features high counter density in a small map area (he gives the game an \"excitement\" grade of only 50%). Palmer likened it to Rise and Decline of the Third Reich in that it deals out \"terrible retribution for small oversights\" and is thus best suited to specialist players who wish to develop expertise gradually.\n\nParagraph 11: The former US 441 Alternate begins at the intersection of US 301/US 441 across from the intersection of Old Anthony Road, where it branches off to the northwest, just northwest of the northern terminus of County Road Old 441 (North Magnolia Avenue). The first sites that it passes by are the state branch of the United Pentecostal Church, and then a local school that contains a school bus parking lot of the Marion County Public School system. It ran through Northwest 27th Avenue Road and Northwest 63rd Street Kendrick, where it then made a reverse curve to the left and then right, just before intersecting SR 326 in Zuber, which connects SR 40 in Silver Springs to Interstate 75 (I-75). North of there, the road remains generally at the same northwest angle passing by many of the farms and wooded areas typical of northwestern rural Florida. Shortly after a used truck dealership across from the intersection of Northwest 89th Street is a dirt racing track previously known as the Ocala Speedway, now known as the Bubba Raceway Park A gas station can be found south of Northwest 100th Street in Martin, but it is the most notable landmark along the route. Just north of this is an otherwise non-descript field used by the Greater Ocala Dog Club. Later it passes by the Marion County Correctional Institute, then passes through the grounds of the Lowell Correctional Institution and across from the northern edge of that the Florida State Fire College North of the territory of the Fire College the route ran over a bridge over a former Atlantic Coast Line Railroad line that in recent times has been truncated in the next town, which happens to be Lowell where US 441 Alternate curved straight north had an intersection with County Road 329. US 441 Alternate continued this straight south-to-north pattern through Reddick where the road encounters an all-way stop intersection with County Road 316 which also provides access to I-75 from communities such as Citra, Fort McCoy, and Salt Springs. The straight trajectory continued until the intersection with Northwest 153rd Street, and then the route curved to the northwest again. During this curve, a former segment of that road called Northwest 44th Avenue Road branches off to the west and runs parallel to the route. After the intersection with Northwest 160th Street, the route straightened out again, and NW 44th Avenue Rd terminates with the old route. The road passes the Millwood Cemetery, and then curves northwest once again before finally terminating at an at-grade interchange with US 441.", "answers": ["Paragraph 1"], "length": 3344, "dataset": "passage_retrieval_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "2583defc05b3391a278f0344456fa63c2102f91dc7a9871f"}

Irving Ltd. to purchase 131.7 miles of physical railway assets of the Canadian Pacific Railway within the province of New Brunswick; these being the 84.4 mile McAdam Subdivision, the 5.6 mile section of the Mattawamkeag Subdivision within Canada, as well as the West Saint John Spur, Milltown Spur, and the St. Stephen Subdivision. The actual land forming the right of way that CPR's tracks were located on was actually already owned by J.D. Irving Ltd. CPR sold all of its land holdings in New Brunswick (but not the tracks and buildings) in 1941 when it reached an agreement that saw industrialist K.C. Irving purchase the New Brunswick Railway Company Limited. This arrangement allowed J.D. Irving Ltd. to use New Brunswick Railway Co. Ltd. as a holding company to own both the NBSR as well as its U.S. sister EMRY. Ownership of the tracks in New Brunswick extends to the Canada–United States border at the midpoints of two crossings of the St. Croix River; these being the Saint Croix-Vanceboro Railway Bridge at St. Croix shared with the EMRY, as well as an unnamed railway bridge at St. Stephen shared with Pan Am Railways .\n\nParagraph 3: But if either House passes any such proposed law by an absolute majority, and the other House rejects or fails to pass it, or passes it with any amendment to which the first‑mentioned House will not agree, and if after an interval of three months the first‑mentioned House in the same or the next session again passes the proposed law by an absolute majority with or without any amendment which has been made or agreed to by the other House, and such other House rejects or fails to pass it or passes it with any amendment to which the first‑mentioned House will not agree, the Governor‑General may submit the proposed law as last proposed by the first‑mentioned House, and either with or without any amendments subsequently agreed to by both Houses, to the electors in each State qualified to vote for the election of the House of Representatives.\n\nParagraph 4: Fabulous Histories (later known as The Story of the Robins), Trimmer's most popular work, was first published in 1786, and remained in print until the beginning of the 20th century. It tells the story of two families, a robin family and a human family, who learn to live together congenially. Most importantly, the human children and the baby robins must learn to adopt virtue and to shun vice. For Trimmer, practising kindness to animals as a child would hopefully lead one to \"universal benevolence\" as an adult. According to Samuel Pickering, Jr., a scholar of 18th-century children's literature, \"in its depiction of 18th-century attitudes toward animals, Mrs. Trimmer's Fabulous Histories was the most representative children's book of the period\". The text expresses most of the themes that would come to dominate Trimmer's later works, such as her emphasis on retaining social hierarchies; as Tess Cosslett, a scholar of children's literature explains, \"the notion of hierarchy that underpins Fabulous Histories is relatively stable and fixed. Parents are above children in terms of authority, and humans above animals, in terms both of dominion and compassion: poor people should be fed before hungry animals… [but] the hierarchical relation of men and women is not so clearly enforced.\" Moira Ferguson, a scholar of the 18th and 19th centuries, places these themes in a larger historical context, arguing that \"the fears of the author and her class about an industrial revolution in ascendance and its repercussions are evident. Hence, [the] text attacks cruelty to birds and animals while affirming British aggression abroad.  …The text subtly opts for conservative solutions: maintenance of order and established values, resignation and compliance from the poor at home, expatriation for foreigners who do not assimilate easily.\" A second overarching theme in the text is rationality; Trimmer expresses the common fear of the power of fiction in her preface, explaining to her childish readers that her fable is not real and that animals cannot really speak. Like many social critics during the 18th century, Trimmer was concerned about fiction's potentially damaging impact on young readers. With the rise of the novel and its concomitant private reading, there was a great fear that young people and especially women would read racy and adventurous stories without the knowledge of their parents and, perhaps even more worrisome, interpret the books as they pleased. Trimmer therefore always referred to her text as Fabulous Histories and never as The Story of the Robins in order to emphasize its reality; moreover, she did not allow the book to be illustrated within her lifetime—pictures of talking birds would only have reinforced the paradox of the book (it was fiction parading as a history). Yarde has also speculated that most of the characters in the text are drawn from Trimmer's own acquaintances and family.\n\nParagraph 5: PA 42 begins at an intersection with PA 61 in the borough of Centralia in Columbia County, which has largely been abandoned because of the Centralia mine fire. From PA 61, the route heads north on two-lane undivided Locust Avenue. The road passes through abandoned areas of the town which have been overgrown with trees. The route turns east and crosses into Conyngham Township, becoming South Main Street and heading into forested areas. PA 42 widens to a four-lane road and heads to the northwest, passing through the residential community of Aristes, where it narrows back to two lanes. The road curves to the northeast and becomes Numidia Drive, heading into the Weiser State Forest and turning to the northwest as it crosses Big Mountain. The route turns west and northwest through more dense forests, passing to the east of Shamokin Reservoir. Continuing to the west-northwest, PA 42 enters Locust Township as it crosses Little Mountain, leaving the state forest and turning to the north. The road heads into open agricultural areas with some woods and residences. The route briefly turns northwest before heading north again and passing through the community of Numidia. PA 42 curves to the northwest as it heads through more rural areas, crossing the Roaring Creek and continuing into Catawissa Township. The road runs through a mix of farmland and woodland with some homes, gaining a second northbound lane. The route becomes a four-lane road in a wooded area before turning into a three-lane road with one northbound lane and two southbound lanes. PA 42 comes to an intersection with PA 487, at which point that route joins PA 42 for a concurrency, with the two routes heading north through more woodland as a two-lane road. The road crosses the Catawissa Creek into the borough of Catawissa and becomes Mill Street, heading northwest into residential areas. PA 42 splits from PA 487 by heading west-northwest on Main Street, heading through the commercial downtown of Catawissa. The road crosses Norfolk Southern's Sunbury Line before heading across the Susquehanna River, at which point the road becomes Rupert Drive and heads into Montour Township. Here, the route turns north and crosses the North Shore Railroad. PA 42 runs through wooded areas immediately to the west of the railroad tracks with the Susquehanna River a short distance to the east. The road turns north-northwest away from the railroad tracks and heads through the residential community of Rupert. The route passes through more woodland with some homes before reaching an interchange with US 11.\n\nParagraph 6: In 1106, when the head or coarb of the see of Armagh had been handed from layman to layman of the Ui Sinaich family, Celsus (Ceallach or Ceallach) became the eighth in line. He wanted to end that tradition of lay control of the episcopal see, and so he became first a priest and then was consecrated a bishop, becoming Archbishop of Armagh. He assumed his right to this position as a bishop, but renounced his right to it as a layman. Fearing that his relatives would try to displace him and take away the attributes of his power, he brought the Bachal Isu to Ballyboughal around 1113. When Celsus died in 1129, he named an Archbishop not related to him. His choice: Maelmhaedhoc O'Morgair, the eventual St. Malachy. He also send Malachy the Bachal Isu, but it was seized by Morrough, a cousin of Celsus, who turned the staff over to Flann Ui Sinaich for safe-keeping, preventing Malachy from assuming his position. Morrough died in 1134 and was succeeded as lay lord of Armagh by Celsus's brother Niall, but his own family now saw \"the degradation and disgrace brought upon the diocese by this lay claim\"  and drove out Niall. In 1135 Flann Ui Sinaich died, and St. Malachy was able to purchase the Bachal Isu from his successor and to retrieve it on 7 July of that year from a cave where it had been hidden away, becoming finally archbishop. In 1137, Malachy resigned his archbishopric to Gelasius, who apparently returned the Bachal Isu to Ballyboughal, where in 1113 Bishop Samuel U h-Aingli had set aside land for the preservation and protection of the staff. In 1173, Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke removed the staff from Ballyboughal and sent it to Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin.\n\nParagraph 7: Safer was born to an Austrian Jewish family in Toronto, Ontario, the son of Anna (née Cohn) and Max Safer, an upholsterer. He had an older brother, Leon Safer, and an older sister, Esther Safer. After reading works by Ernest Hemingway, he had decided in his youth that, like Hemingway, he wanted to be a foreign correspondent. He attended Harbord Collegiate Institute and Bloor Collegiate Institute in Toronto, Ontario, and briefly attended the University of Western Ontario before he dropped out to become a newspaper reporter. He said, \"I was a reporter on the street at 19 and never went to college.\"\n\nParagraph 8: Season of Flame received generally favorable reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. Steve Steinberg of GameSpy praised the game's \"challenging and varied gameplay\" and \"colorful graphics\". Anise Hollingshead of GameZone, while criticizing the game's short length and the \"sameness\" of the minigames, said that it is \"a great game for everyone in the family\". Craig Harris of IGN and Frank Provo of GameSpot declared that the game was superior to its predecessor in a number of areas. Four-Eyed Dragon of GamePro cited the \"tricky controls\" as the only negative point of the game, saying that \"the digital directional pad doesn't allow for smooth diagonal movement, which Spyro does a lot in each world.\" Ben Kosmina of Nintendo World Report also found fault in the controls, stating that they have not improved from Spyro: Season of Ice and that it is \"still incredibly awkward trying to control him while gliding, as he'll go zooming off all over the place with the slightest touch.\" Game Informer, while concluding that exploring the worlds was enjoyable, said that \"the jumping portions of the game are still a little iffy, and I killed myself quite a lot from misreading the view\". Scott Alan Marriott of AllGame (\"All Game Guide\" at the time) cited that the graphics, humor and puzzles were \"engaging enough to warrant a purchase for devotees of the purple dragon\", but added that the game would benefit from better controls and more varied objectives. Nintendo Power noted that the game was presented in the same style and shown from the same isometric perspective as Spyro: Season of Ice. Martin Taylor of Eurogamer cited \"boredom\" as the game's major flaw, saying that nothing in the game \"really makes you want to carry on the story through to its end because none of it is particularly fun.\"\n\nParagraph 9: Detection of pathogens using ELISA relies on the interaction between the antigen and specific antibodies and has become a popular and cost-effective means of routine detection. In an ELISA the solid phase can be coated with the sample of interest containing the antigen. The efficiency to which the antigen binds to the solid phase is dependent on temperature, length of exposure as well as concentration. Solid phases used include nitrocellulose membranes, paper, glass, agarose and polystyrene or polyvinylchloride microtiter plates. Microtiter plates are the most widely used solid phase because they are easy to handle, allow for automation and for analysis using microtiter plate readers. A drawback of these plates is that they are highly absorptive and this increases the incidence of non-specific binding of components used in the ELISA. Non-specific binding to the plates is reduced through the use of buffers containing proteins such as casein and non-ionic detergents such as Tween 20. After coating, excess sample is removed and the plate typically treated with a 1% casein containing solution. Subsequent to this the solid phase is treated with antibodies raised against the antigen of interest. After each incubation step the plate is washed with Tween 20 containing PBS. These washing steps are aimed to wash away any non-specifically bound components. Nonspecifically bound components are less strongly bound than the specific bound ones. Detection is achieved either through the addition of an enzyme-coupled antibody or the addition and detection of a biotinylated antibody. In a system using an enzyme-coupled antibody the subsequent addition of an appropriate substrate results in the formation of a colour proportional to the amount of antigen. Alternatively the plate can be coated with antibody followed by incubation with the sample that is to be detected. This, in turn, can be detected as described above and is then referred to as the double antibody sandwich (DAS) ELISA. Both of these systems, however, have a disadvantage in that coupling of the enzyme to the antibody may result in steric hindrance which in turn may result in a loss in function of the antibody and/or the enzyme. This may be overcome through the use of a biotin-avidin or biotin-streptavidin bridge. In this type of system biotin is coupled to the antibody. The biotin molecule has no influence on the working of the antibodies and is easily detectedusing avidin or streptavidin conjugated to a suitable enzyme. Streptavidin has an extremely high affinity for biotin which results in even a higher degree of specificity than a system in which the enzyme is coupled directly the antigen. To establish whether or not the antigen is present, a substrate specific for the enzyme used is added. The enzyme then converts the substrate to a coloured product and the colour intensity can be correlated to the amount of antibodies bound and thus the amount of antigen present. A DAS-ELISA has the advantage that it can increase the specificity of the ELISA and reduce the occurrence of non-specific binding. As a result, the DAS-ELISA principle is commonly employed in ELISA’s for the detection of plant pathogens in plant sap without prior purification of the pathogen.\n\nParagraph 10: In Mexico, Guerrero joined a gym with the intention to learn to box, but instead learned lucha libre from Diablo Velasco and El Indio Mejía. He wrestled his first professional wrestling match on September 14, 1937, jobbing to El Rojo. He began his career in Mexico working under the ring name Joe Morgan, but later changed his name to Gory Guerrero—a reference to his bloody matches. He made his debut for the Mexico City promotion Empresa Mexicana de la Lucha Libre (EMLL) in 1943 and was named \"Rookie of the Year\" later that year. In 1945, he briefly held the Mexican National Welterweight Championship. Several months later, he won the Mexican National Middleweight Championship, which he held for approximately one year. Guerrero and his brothers also feuded with Cavernario Galindo and his brothers. In the late 1940s, Guerrero began tag teaming with El Santo as the undefeated La Pareja Atómica (The Atomic Pair). Guerrero also appeared in some of El Santo's films. He also feuded with Enrique Llanes and his tag team partner Tarzán López. He defeated Lopez for the NWA Middleweight title. In 1954, he wrestled a championship match against NWA World Heavyweight Champion Lou Thesz but did not win the title.\n\nParagraph 11: KLMG-TV made national news as its founding owner, Clara McLaughlin, was the first African American woman ever to own a television station in the United States. McLaughlin bought a vacant school building located near Interstate 20 in Longview and had it renovated into a studio facility for the station. KLMG was intended to be part of a network of stations serving East Texas that would be known as the \"East Texas Television Network.\" To this end, McLaughlin also held construction permits for KLNL on channel 19 in Nacogdoches, KLPH-TV on channel 42 in Paris, and KLDS on channel 20 in Denison. However, this plan did not come to fruition and none of the other stations ever signed on the air. KLMG wound up filing for bankruptcy just a few years later, and shut down its news department.\n\nParagraph 12: Fox then made his way to Indianopolis, where he hung around a boxing gym until he was offered a fight.  Fox accepted and was on his way. He relocated in Terre Haute, Indiana to train under bantamweight champion Bud Taylor and became the \"Indiana colored heavyweight champion.\" He fought frequently for the next nine years without losing a bout.  His first loss was by a split decision to light heavyweight champion Maxie Rosenbloom.  Fox claimed he engaged in over 300 fights, but many were not recorded.  He claimed that he never fought a preliminary bout in his career, just main events.\n\nParagraph 13: In 1939, after the German invasion of Poland and the start of the Second World War, Kot escaped to Romania, then through Hungary and Switzerland to France, where in October 1939 he took part in forming the Polish Government in Exile. That December he became its Deputy Prime Minister or Deputy Secretary of State. He worked closely with Prime Minister Władysław Sikorski and was a vocal opponent of Sanation, which was now in the political opposition. In February 1940, Kot met in Paris with the resistance envoy Jan Karski, who had just arrived from Poland. Karski's report stated that German policies were oppressive, and that the Polish Jewish community was being singled out for especially harsh treatment. In the spring of 1940, meeting with representatives of British Jewry in France, Kot criticized the bulk of Poland's Jews for failing to assimilate into Polish society and suggested that, after the war, most Jews would have to leave Poland. From October 1940 to August 1941 Kot was Minister of the Interior. He was also active in preserving Polish culture, supporting Polish artists, educators, and scholars through the Fund for National Culture. In New York City in 1942, he cofounded the Polish Institute of Arts and Sciences of America (PIASA).", "answers": ["Paragraph 8"], "length": 3352, "dataset": "passage_retrieval_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "e000641ea859405cfea09c7ca509e38e4afc118e2fc0495b"}

In January 1945 she was again renamed Orion and was used to take refugees from Germany's eastern provinces across the Baltic Sea to ports in northern Germany and occupied Denmark. On her way to Copenhagen on 4 May 1945, after she had picked up the crew of the old battleship , Orion was hit by two bombs dropped by aircraft of the Soviet 51st Mine-Torpedo Aviation Regiment off Swinemünde. The crew managed to beach the fiercely burning ship on a sandbank, but more than 150 passengers and crew were killed. The hulk was scrapped in 1952.\n\nParagraph 2: Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 60% of 20 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 5.7/10. Metacritic rated it 45/100 based on eight reviews. Frank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter called it \"a playfully self-reflexive exercise whose endless in-jokes will best be appreciated by only the most ardent genre aficionados\".  Maitland McDonagh of Film Journal International wrote, \"A meta-variation on Clive Barker's Nightbreed, Digging Up the Marrow tackles all the same questions–what makes a monster, are they good or bad, et al.—with considerably less grace and intelligence.\"  Michael Rechtshaffen of the Los Angeles Times called it \"more mind-numbing than bone-chilling\".  Nick Schager of The Village Voice wrote that after poking fun at found footage films, it becomes \"the very dull, clichéd thing it mocks.\"  Ignatiy Vishnevetsky of The A.V. Club rated it B− and called it \"more playful than genuinely creepy\" and said that it does not live up to its potential. Ken W. Hanley of Fangoria rated it 2.5/4 stars and described its ambition as both its greatest asset and downfall.  Simon Abrams of RogerEbert.com rated it 1.5/4 stars and wrote, \"Digging Up the Marrow is a decent idea, but beyond some fun creature effects, and a surprisingly grounded performance from character actor Ray Wise, the film just sits there.\"  Wes Greene of Slant Magazine rated it 2/4 stars and said that it \"ultimately becomes the shopworn horror story that Green purports to upend with plenty of self-aware snark\".  Matt Donato of We Got This Covered rated it 3.5/5 stars and called it \"a tense, confident, and gorgeously terrifying monster movie that turns Alex Pardee's artistry into vibrant, eye-catching horrors.\"  Mike D'Angelo of The Dissolve rated it 3/5 stars and called it \"more of an affectionate comedy than a horror movie, despite a third act that features some tense moments and hostile critters.\"  Patrick Cooper of Bloody Disgusting rated it 2/5 stars and wrote that the film \"can be very fun at times, but overall Digging Up the Marrow is a tiresome and exasperatingly self-aggrandizing trip.\"  Scott Hallam of Dread Central rated it 4/5 stars and wrote, \"Not only is it an extremely clever and unique movie experience, it gives Green’s fans exactly what they want: more Adam Green.\"  Patrick Bromley of Daily Dead rated it 4/5 stars and wrote, \"Digging Up the Marrow isn't just a terrific horror movie; it's a movie about why we are drawn to horror movies.\"\n\nParagraph 3: Most abelisauroid were found in Madagascar, Asia, or sometimes in Africa. Abelisauridae thrived during the Cretaceous period, on the ancient southern supercontinent of Gondwana, and today their fossil remains are found on the modern continents of Africa and South America, as well as on the Indian subcontinent and the island of Madagascar. In Madagascar, what are known as \"Majungasaurus\" were discovered by French paleontologist Charles Depéret. Majungasaurus was the most common abelisauroid which we know. Studies of the abelisauridae Majungasaurus indicate that it was a much slower-growing dinosaur than other theropods, taking nearly 20 years to reach adult size. Not only Majungasaurus was found in Madagascar but also Masiakasaurus which was the most complete fossil noasauridae found. Similar studies on other abelisaurid genera indicate that this slow maturation may have been a common trait to the whole of the Abelisauridae. Noasaurines are Late Cretaceous noasaurids known exclusively from southern continents and islands such as South America, Madagascar, and India which was an island near Madagascar during the Cretaceous. Elaphrosaurines were lightly built theropods, with small skulls and long necks and legs. If Limusaurus is any indication, adult elaphrosaurines were completely toothless, and their mouths were probably edged with a horny beak. It is likely that Limusaurus and other elaphrosaurines were primarily herbivorous as adults, due to mature Limusaurus specimens preserving gastroliths and chemical signatures resembling those of herbivorous dinosaurs. In South America, many abelisauroids were discovered such as Skorpiovenator, Tarasscosaurus, Erikasaurus, Quilmesaurus, Aucasarus, Ilokelesia, Pycnonemosaurus etc. In Africa, we can find many abelisauroid which were Rugops, Kryptops, etc. Many abelisauroid can grow in South America, because they can evolve in a fruitful place. Kurupi itaata represents the first formally named vertebrate of the Marília Formation (Bauru Group, Bauru Basin) and one of the few theropod records for the Maastrichtian of the Bauru Basin. Its abelisauridae affinities are well established based on the anatomy of the pelvis and anterior caudal vertebrae; however, closer relationships with other abelisauridae are still unclear. The specimens provide new information on abelisauroids which are still poorly known in the Brazilian fossil record, and on the distribution of this diverse group of theropod dinosaurs in South America. These discoveries indicate that abelisauroids were the most common large predatory dinosaurs in the outcrops where they come from.\n\nParagraph 4: where Ω(d) is d-form as a functional of the nonintegrated fields and is linear in ε. Let us make the further assumption (which turns out to be valid in all the cases of interest) that this functional is local (i.e. Ω(d)(x) only depends upon the values of the fields and their derivatives at x) and that it can be expressed as the exterior product of p-forms. If the spacetime Md is closed (i.e. without boundary) and oriented, then it is the boundary of some d+1 dimensional oriented manifold Md+1. If we then arbitrarily extend the fields (including ε) as defined on Md to Md+1 with the only condition being they match on the boundaries and the expression Ω(d), being the exterior product of p-forms, can be extended and defined in the interior, then\n\nParagraph 5: Mitchell had not kept a catalogue of his collection, and as a result, cataloguing was an early priority for librarians in the Mitchell Library. A research department was established as part of the public library in the 1920s under the direction of Nita Kibble, while Ida Leeson as Head of Acquisitions researched gaps in the library's collections. Kibble's research department was later used as a model by other State Libraries when establishing similar services. Mitchell's bequest also included funding for collection acquisition; expanding the library's collection (particularly in the area of Australiana and Pacific material) was a priority for both Wright and William Ifould, who was appointed Principal Librarian in 1912. Ifould envisioned the library as a repository of material relating to the history of Australia, not just New South Wales, and led efforts to collect material. The library acquired the papers of Lachlan Macquarie and his family in 1914, Matthew Flinders in 1922, and Abel Tasman's journal in 1926, and after World War I collected journals of soldiers from that conflict. The Commonwealth Parliamentary Library (now the National Library of Australia), established in 1901, was also collecting Australiana material. This led to conflict over the acquisition of the papers of James Cook, which were offered at auction in London in 1923. The Trustees chose not to bid for the papers as doing so would have limited the library's Australiana acquisitions budget for several years and Ifould, already in London with hopes of purchasing the papers for the Mitchell Library, was directed instead to purchase them on behalf of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Library and the Public Library of New South Wales using funds provided by the Federal Government.\n\nParagraph 6: The Emperor wore a golden robe, purple trousers and wore his hair in a bun fastened with a golden brooch. The court officials and aristocrats wore a dark tunic having four flaps, closely buttoned collar, dark trousers, and wore a bun with an iron brooch. On their heads they wore a black gauze chuddar and peaked cap. They also wore leather sandals and carried fans of stork feathers. The military uniforms were “dau mau” cap covering the ears, knee-length tunic, neatly sewn sleeves tightly fitted around the wrist. The whole of the frock was covered with small pieces of armor plate full of spiral designs, or patterns of multiple large petalled flowers at the chest. In addition, there were patterns of parallel curved brims or spiral designs below which hung small bells, drooping fringes, and finally a line of bells. For some other kinds of frocks, the shoulder straps were adorned with bells, and the two shoulder bands and waistband decorated with tiger-face designs. The surface of the frock was decorated with prominent small multi-petalled flowers. The fabric had a tiled or scaled pattern, which might have been embroidered or woven into the fabric. A waistband made of cloth was tied with the ends dropping to the front. If a leather waistband was worn, it would be tightly fastened around the belly to reveal the body muscles. The boots reached up to the knee and were simply decorated. Female dancers had a “skyward” bun, a decorative fringe of hair on the forehead, with flowers adorning the hair. They wore bracelets, strings of beads, as well as multi-pleated short skirts. The musician's costumes were quite original. A cap fully covered the hair, with a high and zigzag-fringed top. The inner shirt was with long sleeves, tight at the wrist. Added to that, there was a short-sleeved shirt, with vân kiên shards. They wore wide embroidered and fringed strips of cloth around the waist. On their calves were leggings, and covering the feet were pointed-toe canvas shoes.\n\nParagraph 7: The Middlesbrough club record of 59 League goals in 37 games and 63 goals in all competitions in one season is held by Camsell. He accomplished this feat in the 1926–27 season, his first full season with Middlesbrough. After he had initially struggled for game time and almost joined Barnsley, he made his first appearance of the season on 18 September 1926 after Jimmy McClelland had suffered an injury. Having failed to score on that day, Camsell would only fail to score on two more occasions in the following 25 matches, taking in a run of 12 successive matches in which he scored at least once. He scored five on Christmas Day, 1926 against Manchester City and two more in the return fixture on 27 December. In February 1927, Camsell broke the record for league goals in a season by a player, having overtaken Jimmy Cookson's haul of 44 (for Chesterfield in 1925–26). 59 remains the second-highest number of league goals scored and the equal highest number in all competitions in one English league season, behind Dixie Dean's 60 league and 100 total a year later. The nine hat-tricks Camsell scored that season remains an English record for most in a League season.\n\nParagraph 8:  The main protagonist in the series. He is the only son of Crown Prince Sado and Lady Hyegyeong. Extremely kind and generous, he makes frequent trips under disguise to see how the common people are doing. The series spans from San's childhood at the age of eleven, when Crown Prince Sado is being executed, to about 40 years later, when San himself reigned as King. It was during the beginning of the series when San met Seong Song-yeon and Park Dae-su. In episode 1, he disguises himself as a junior eunuch and sneaks into the courtyard where his father was imprisoned in a rice chest. With the help of Dae-su and Song-yeon, he manages to see him and obey his father's last wish. The friendship that developed as a result would last the entire series. The plot then fast-forwards ten years, when San is an adult. San is a filial child who loved his father unconditionally despite the opposition, and never denied his father's innocence, which caused him to get into trouble several times. He also never bore a grudge against King Yeongjo, his grandfather, despite Yeongjo's sometimes unfair and harsh treatment towards him. San loved his grandfather deeply. Loyal to his subjects and people, he hates it when someone risks their own life for his, and always tries to protect them instead. While he is still Crown Prince, he falls in love with Song-yeon who became his source of comfort and warmth. Later, when he becomes King, Song-yeon is finally made his concubine. Although San tries to hide it, he never liked the other concubines his mother brought in and hardly ever spent time with them, only doing so once in a while out of a sense of duty as a King, a fact which he is bitter about. San likes practicing martial arts with the Royal Guards and traveling incognito in order to feel the experience of the people. When doing so, he adopts the pseudonym Yi Mu-duk. He suffered severe pain and heartbreak when Song-yeon passes away. While he gravely misses and thinks of her every day, he continued to keep his promise to her that he will withstand everything and be a good King. He is implied to be together with Song-yeon again in their afterlife, where he is finally at peace and happy to spend the rest of eternity with the woman he loves.\n\nParagraph 9: Retired from Senior pro (NBL-\"A\"/ABA-\"AA\"): July 1987 Aged 29. He couldn't find a factory sponsorship for the expensive national circuit which even with the resources of his bikeshop Stu Thomsen's Family Cycle Center. A combination of him being let go by Huffy and the depressed economic state of BMX which resulted in a dearth of sponsorship offers despite his looking; and a shoulder injury that he himself didn't let heal properly due to his competitiveness. At 29 he had largely made his goal to race until he was thirty years old. However, he did race in large races that was both close to his Yorba Linda home and had large purses. For example, he did race at least once in 1988 at the ABA Winter Nationals at Chandler, Arizona, with a 4th and 7th in Pro Cruiser at the two races over that weekend. This is in addition to him racing locally close to his home. He raced in the 1990 ABA Fall Nationals and made the Pro Open Main in the Sunday race, coming in sixth. He also raced the 1991 ABA Fall Nationals as well along with fellow \"retired\" pros Eric Rupe and Harry Leary but did not make any of the Mains. He raced the Fall nationals again a year later reclassifying to \"A\" pro (along with Harry Leary) coming in third in Pro Cruiser on Day 2 (October 24). In 1993 he resumed racing on a serious level in Pro Cruiser and in the then new ABA Veteran Pro class for a few years. Today he still races occasionally as an amateur in the ABA 45-50 cruiser and 36 & Over Expert 20\" class sponsored by Redline. His last Senior Pro win in the 20\" division before retiring from serious Senior pro competition appeared to had been at the NBL National in Sarasota, Florida, on March 28, 1986.\n\nParagraph 10: The Hungarians amassed an immense Crusader Force. The Bosnians didn't want to give up their religion for another, under Hungarian sword, so they organized resistance. Soon the Crusaders, led by Croatia's Herzog Coloman, stormed Bosnia. As Ban Matej didn't have the strength to oppose, he retreated to the impassable mountains and primeval forests. The war lasted for almost five years and was exhausting for both sides as can be seen in the fact that Bishop Wildeshausen begged the Pope to relief him from his duty. Ninoslav put up a staunch defense. Prince Sibislav of Usora joined the fight against Ninoslav soon. Many of the Bosnian noblemen under Sibislav crossed to the Hungarian side, while others were simply too afraid to act. On 26 April 1238, it seemed that Coloman had destroyed the heretic strength in Bosnia, reporting to the pope that Bosnia had been cleansed. On 23 December 1238, Coloman continued to amass victories against the heretic side. Although the Crusaders managed to freely overrun the Western Areas and the Hum they could never get a permanent hold of Bosnia proper. In 1237, deemed incapable, Bishop Wildeshausen was replaced by the Pope with a Hungarian Dominican, that conducted terror by burning the Bogomils on stakes. Matej had to retreat to Dubrovnik in 1240, after the numerous crusaders overran his realm.\n\nParagraph 11:  Eimeria chelydrae Eimeria christenseni Eimeria clarkei Eimeria clethrionomyis Eimeria coecicola Eimeria colchici Eimeria columbae Eimeria columbarum Eimeria contorta Eimeria coturnicus Eimeria couesii Eimeria crandallis Eimeria crassa Eimeria curvata Eimeria cylindrica Eimeria cynomysis Eimeria cyprini Eimeria dammahensis Eimeria danailovi Eimeria danielle Eimeria debliecki Eimeria deserticola Eimeria dispersa Eimeria dolichotis Eimeria dromedarii Eimeria duszynskii Eimeria ellipsoidalis Eimeria elongata Eimeria etheostomae Eimeria eutamiae Eimeria exigua Eimeria falciformis Eimeria fanthami Eimeria farasanii Eimeria farra Eimeria faurei Eimeria fernandoae Eimeria ferrisi Eimeria filamentifera Eimeria franklinii Eimeria fraterculae Eimeria freemani Eimeria fulva Eimeria funduli Eimeria gallatii Eimeria gallopavonis Eimeria gasterostei Eimeria gilruthi Eimeria glenorensis Eimeria gokaki Eimeria gonzalei Eimeria gorakhpuri Eimeria granulosa Eimeria grenieri Eimeria guevarai Eimeria hagani Eimeria haneki Eimeria hasei Eimeria hawkinsi Eimeria hermani Eimeria hindlei Eimeria hirci Eimeria hoffmani Eimeria hoffmeisteri Eimeria hybognathi Eimeria ictaluri Eimeria illinoisensis Eimeria innocua Eimeria intestinalis Eimeria intricata Eimeria iroquoina Eimeria irresidua Eimeria ivitaensis Eimeria judoviciani Eimeria kinsellai Eimeria koganae Eimeria kotlani Eimeria krijgsmanni Eimeria krylovi Eimeria kunmingensis Eimeria lagopodi Eimeria lamae Eimeria langebarteli Eimeria larimerensis Eimeria lateralis Eimeria laureleus Eimeria lepidosirenis Eimeria leucisci Eimeria ludoviciani Eimeria macusaniensis Eimeria magnalabia Eimeria marconii Eimeria maxima Eimeria melanuri Eimeria meleagridis Eimeria menzbieri Eimeria micropteri Eimeria minasensis Eimeria mitis Eimeria monacis Eimeria morainensis Eimeria moronei Eimeria mulardi Eimeria muta Eimeria myoxi Eimeria myoxocephali Eimeria natricis Eimeria necatrix Eimeria neitzi Eimeria nieschulzi Eimeria nigricani Eimeria nocens Eimeria nyroca Eimeria ojastii Eimeria ojibwana Eimeria onychomysis Eimeria oryzomysi Eimeria oryxae Eimeria os Eimeria osmeri Eimeria ovata Eimeria ovinoidalis Eimeria palustris Eimeria papillata Eimeria parvula Eimeria pigra Eimeria pilarensis Eimeria pileata Eimeria pipistrellus Eimeria phocae Eimeria praecox Eimeria prionotemni Eimeria pseudospermophili Eimeria pulchella Eimeria pungitii Eimeria punonensis Eimeria ranae Eimeria reedi Eimeria reichenowi Eimeria ribarrensis Eimeria rjupa Eimeria rutili Eimeria salvelini Eimeria saitamae Eimeria saudiensis Eimeria separata Eimeria schachdagica Eimeria sevilletensis Eimeria sinensis Eimeria sipedon Eimeria somateriae Eimeria spermophili Eimeria squali Eimeria stiedai Eimeria stigmosa Eimeria striata Eimeria subepithelialis Eimeria surki Eimeria tamiasciuri Eimeria tedlai Eimeria tenella Eimeria truncata Eimeria truttae Eimeria uekii Eimeria uniungulati Eimeria ursini Eimeria vilasi Eimeria weddelli Eimeria weybridgensis Eimeria witcheri Eimeria vanasi Eimeria vermiformis Eimeria volgensis Eimeria wobati Eimeria wyomingensis Eimeria yemenensae Eimeria yukonensis Eimeria zuernii''\n\nParagraph 12: Perhaps Croft's most notable legacy is the suite of Funeral Sentences which have been described as a \"glorious work of near genius\". First published as part of the Burial Service in Musica Sacra, the date and purpose of their composition is uncertain. The seven Sentences themselves are from the Book of Common Prayer and are verses from various books of the Bible, intended to be said or sung during an Anglican funeral. One of the sentences, Thou knowest, Lord, the secrets of our hearts, was not composed by Croft, but by Henry Purcell, part of his 1695 Music for the Funeral of Queen Mary.

However, it notes that part of this cost is due to the advanced geometry of the panels and associated research costs. The final stage of this process can also involve manufacturing the finished product.", "context": "Paragraph 1: The 2nd Battalion, Devonshire Regiment was a Regular Army unit that was serving on the island of Malta as part of the 1st Malta Infantry Brigade (redesignated as the 231st Infantry Brigade in April 1943) and was involved in the siege of Malta from June 1940 until November 1942. In July 1943 the battalion, together with the 231st Brigade, fought in the Allied invasion of Sicily, and, briefly, in the Allied invasion of Italy in September. After Italy the brigade was withdrawn to Sicily and then the United Kingdom where it became permanently part of the veteran 50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division and trained with them in preparation for the Allied invasion of Normandy. On D-Day, 6 June 1944, it was intended that the battalion, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Cosmo Nevill, should land at Le Hamel, on Gold Beach, behind the 1st Hampshires. However, owing to adverse sea conditions and an unexpectedly high tidal surge, three of the four rifle companies were carried over a mile to the east before they could make landfall and had to make their way to their assigned assembly point on foot. Of the four company commanders, two were wounded and one was killed. The battalion continued to fight well throughout the Battle of Normandy and the liberation of North-West Europe. However, in December 1944, the 50th Division was disbanded, due to a severe shortage of infantrymen in the British Army at the time, and the battalion was transferred to the 131st (Lorried) Infantry Brigade, part of the 7th Armoured Division, The Desert Rats, and remained with them for the rest of the war, participating in Operation Blackcock in January 1945 followed by Operation Plunder where they crossed the River Rhine. The division advanced on its destination of the city of Hamburg, Germany, as part of the Western Allied invasion of Germany, taking part in the Battle of Hamburg in late April 1945.\n\nParagraph 2: During a user trial on 20 January 2009, BrahMos was tested with a new navigation system but it failed to hit the target. BrahMos Aerospace Corporation's director Dr A. Sivathanu Pillai said, \"The missile performance was absolutely normal until the last phase, but the missile missed the target, though it maintained the direction.\" and that \"The problem was in the software, not hardware\". The Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) said that there were \"small hitches\" in the last stage of the test firing due to delay in input of satellite navigation input to the Inertial Navigation System, the missile travelled for 112 seconds instead of the slated 84 seconds and fell 7 km away from the target. According to BrahMos Corporation, another test of the new missile was to be conducted within one month, but it was eventually conducted on 4 March 2009 and was deemed successful. BrahMos was test-fired again on 29 March 2009. For the test, the missile had to identify a building among a cluster of buildings in an urban environment. BrahMos successfully hit the intended target in two and a half minutes of launch. According to official sources, \"The new seeker is unique and would help us to hit our targets, which are insignificant in terms of size, in a cluster of large buildings. India is now the only nation in the world with this advanced technology\". After the third test, Lt Gen Noble Thamburaj, said that the Indian Army wanted the BrahMos to achieve high standards of accuracy and congratulated the scientists on behalf of the Indian Army. The Indian Army confirmed that the test was successful and the army is satisfied with the missile. This marking the completion of the development phase of BrahMos Block-II, and it was ready for induction.\n\nParagraph 3: Virginia's decision to secede from the Union had been ratified by popular vote on May 23, and Confederate Col. (later Maj. Gen.) John B. Magruder was sent down the peninsula to deter any advance on the state capital Richmond by Union troops based at the well-defended post of Fort Monroe. This garrison was commanded by Maj Gen. Benjamin Butler, a former Massachusetts lawyer and politician, who established a new camp at nearby Hampton and another at Newport News. Magruder had also established two camps, within range of the Union lines, at Big Bethel and Little Bethel, as a lure to draw his opponent into a premature action.\n\nParagraph 4: Salmon is a proponent of the theory of direct reference. Salmon has provided accounts both of propositional attitudes and of Frege's puzzle about true identifications, i.e., truths of the form \"a = b\". Salmon maintains that co-designative proper names are inter-substitutable with preservation of semantic content. Thus, on his view the sentence \"Samuel Clemens was witty\" expresses exactly the same content as \"Mark Twain was witty\", whether or not the competent user of these sentences recognizes it. Therefore, a person who believes that Mark Twain was witty ipso facto believes that Samuel Clemens was witty, even if he or she also believes, inconsistently, that Clemens was not witty. Salmon argues that this is made palatable by recognizing that to believe a proposition is to be cognitively disposed in a particular manner toward that proposition when taking it by means of some proposition-guise or other, and that one may be so disposed relative to one proposition-guise while not being so disposed relative to another. Salmon applies this apparatus to solve a variety of famous philosophical puzzles, including Frege's puzzle, Kripke's puzzle about so-called de dicto belief, and W. V. O. Quine's puzzle about de re belief. For example, Quine describes a scenario in which Ralph believes that Ortcutt is no spy, yet Ralph also believes that the man in the brown hat is a spy, when unbeknownst to Ralph the man in the hat is none other than Ortcutt. Under these circumstances, is Ortcutt believed by Ralph to be a spy? The grounds for an affirmative or negative judgment seem equally balanced. On Salmon's account Ortcutt is believed by Ralph to be a spy, since Ralph is appropriately cognitively disposed toward the proposition about Ortcutt that he is a spy when taking that proposition by means of one proposition-guise, even though Ralph is not so disposed relative to an alternative, equally relevant proposition-guise.\n\nParagraph 5: Pringle worked his way up the Republican hierarchy in the Assembly. After the Assembly Republicans won a majority in the 1994 election, Pringle, the Assistant Republican Leader at the time, also was appointed the Chair of the Assembly Appropriations Committee.  He served in that capacity for most of 1995, when the Assembly operated under a power sharing agreement with a split house.  Later in 1995, Pringle was elected the Assembly Republican Leader and became the Majority Leader of the Assembly, before being elected Speaker in January 1996. In 1996, Assemblywoman Doris Allen was recalled from office in a in as tough campaign between Republicans and several Democrats.  This recall campaign was marred by the tactic of some Republicans to aid Democratic primary decoy candidate Laurie Campbell in an attempt to split the Democratic ticket and thus weaken the candidacy of Democrat Linda Moulton-Patterson who was running against Republican Scott Baugh for Allen's former seat. Mark Richard Denny, an aide to Pringle admitted that he illegally circulated election nominating petitions for Campbell in order to split the Democratic vote. In addition, Jeff Gibson, another campaign aide to Pringle, also pleaded guilty to illegally gathering nomination signatures for the Campbell campaign.\n\nParagraph 6: For the first time, shutter information was displayed via an internal liquid crystal display (LCD) inside the viewfinder. Aperture information was relayed through Nikon's \"ADR\" (Aperture Direct Readout) which was a window at the top center of the viewfinder that got its information from a micro-prism that read small numbers at the top of the mounted lens, of which type 'AI' (Aperture Indexing) or 'AIS' (Aperture Indexing Shutter Priority) lenses had printed behind the normal aperture numbers. Though widely used today, LCDs were very hi-tech at the time. They proved somewhat difficult to see at night, so Nikon installed a button-operated light for use at night. The LCD is one of the few problem areas of the F3 design, since with age, LCDs lose contrast, blur, and become inoperative after a number of years. Fortunately, unlike modern autofocus cameras with LCD 'Command Center' panels, malfunction of the F3's LCD viewfinder display does not prevent full operation of the camera, since this is accomplished with manual dials and indicators. Many F3 cameras built in the 1980s were never used professionally, and therefore are still in perfect working order, including the LCD.  On early production models the autoexposure lock button, originally a simple push-in part, is often missing; Nikon later redesigned this part so it was securely attached from inside the body.  The later part can be fitted to early bodies but a partial stripdown is required.\n\nParagraph 7: In 1939, while he was performing his military service in the Navy, he took part in several matches in the team of the Navy, played on the field of basins, putting on a good display, despite weighing 90 kg. He was noted by some observers of Venezia, who after various stresses succeeded in getting him to tryout; according to another source, a naval officer who was a fan of Venezia, admired the skill of Valentino and offered him to the Lagunari. At the trial, which he showed up and played barefoot, having left his boots intentionally at home not to ruin them. He convinced everyone, especially the manager Giuseppe Girani to purchase him. After a few months in the reserve team, which participated in its own championship, he was hired on 1 January 1940 for 50,000 lire. He made his debut in Serie A on 31 March 1940, in a 1–0 defeat away to Lazio, entering as a substitute for the center forward Francesco Pernigo, and kept his place in the starting lineup on his own merits. He played in all five of the remaining league games, often in the middle of the attack, creating a goal on the penultimate day against Bari, guaranteeing Venezia mathematical safety from relegation. In a Coppa Italia round of 16 defeat against Modena that ended 3–1, he would also score his team's only goal.\n\nParagraph 8: Among his books, the one on Political Science published in 1952 can be said to be his tour de force. The rich experience he earned through years of keen observation of state administration, deep study of books of important western political thinkers and his own political formulations have gone into the making of this book. This is the first book of its kind to be published in Kannada. It deals with a variety of subjects relating to formation of state, characteristics of a responsible government, the concept of freedom, freedom of the people, weaknesses of democracy, impact of franchise, fundamental rights and economic policies and principles. A comprehensive coverage apart, the book contained forthright expression of opinions, and is occupying libraries even now as an ideal book of reference for students of political science. In fact, D. V. Gundappa established the Gokhale Institute of Public Affairs (GIPA) at Bengaluru to facilitate a central meeting place for intellectuals, common folk, people with dissenting ideas and ideologies and critics to assemble under one roof to deliberate upon and discuss social issues with a democratic spirit. Gokhale Institute of Public Affairs is today chaired and managed by noted intellectual, writer and journalist S. R. Ramaswamy who shared a close proximity to D. V. G. for several years.\n\nParagraph 9: Five octaves above the intermezzo's end note, a fortissimo tirade pounces out of the sky, written in  but with a repeating pattern seven quavers long (accented as ). After six bars it settles down in the vicinity of middle C. Running up to an acid semitonal acciaccatura in both hands, the piano goes over into a sprint of octave-chords and single notes, jumping manically up and down the keyboard twice a bar. An audible theme is picked out, and during a piano and staccato repetition of the theme, the strings and flutes rush up, bringing the music to the briefest of halts. A moment later the piano goes back to forte and the sprint sets off anew. It is repeated three more times in total before the piano performs a stormy gallop of triads (tempestoso), the hands flying apart more or less symmetrically, while the strings throw in a frantic accompaniment of regular staccato eighths. The piano puts a momentary end to its own fury with a barely feasible manoeuvre, both hands jumping up three or four octaves simultaneously and fortissimo in the time of a semiquaver. But by then the sprint has transformed into a \"fearful pursuit with an obsessively repeated triplet motif [first heard fleetingly in the Scherzo movement] overshadowed by the baleful roars of tuba and trombones\". Only moments later, the orchestra has reached a halt and the piano, unaccompanied, plays soft but dissonant chords which, Jaffé suggests, are \"reminiscent of the bell-like chords which open the final piece in Schoenberg's Six Little Piano Pieces, Op. 19\" which were composed in homage to Mahler shortly after his death. (Jaffé points out that Prokofiev had introduced Schoenberg's music to Russia by playing the Op. 11 pieces, and suggests that Prokofiev may have known and been inspired by Schoenberg's Op. 19 to use a similar bell motif to commemorate Schmidthof.)\n\nParagraph 10: Third, the voids are gradually filled by forcing a carbon-forming gas such as acetylene through the material at a high temperature, over the course of several days. This long heat treatment process also allows the carbon to form into larger graphite crystals, and is the major reason for the material's high cost. The gray \"Reinforced Carbon–Carbon (RCC)\" panels on the space shuttle's wing leading edges and nose cone cost NASA $100,000/sq ft to produce, although much of this cost was a result of the advanced geometry and research costs associated with the panels. This stage can also include manufacturing of the finished product.\n\nParagraph 11: Morford gained publicity for his column \"Is Obama an Enlightened Being?\", published in June 2008 about then-presidential candidate Barack Obama, in which he wrote, \"Many spiritually advanced people I know (not coweringly religious, mind you, but deeply spiritual) identify Obama as a Lightworker, that rare kind of attuned being who has the ability to lead us not merely to new foreign policies or health care plans or whatnot, but who can actually help usher in a new way of being on the planet, of relating and connecting and engaging with this bizarre earthly experiment.\" The column, and specifically the term \"Lightworker\", were mocked in publications including National Review, The American Spectator and SF Weekly.\n\nParagraph 12: Although Aylesbury were relegated at the end of the first season in the division, dropping into the Isthmian League Premier Division, a 1–0 defeat of Waterlooville saw them reach the second round of the FA Cup for the first time, where they lost 1–0 to Sutton United. They remained in the Isthmian League's Premier Division for eleven seasons, finishing as runners-up in 1998–99, and advancing to the first round of the FA Cup in every season between 1989 and 1995; the 1989–90 season saw them beat Football League opposition for the first time when they defeated Southend United 1–0, before losing by the same scoreline to Northampton Town in a second round replay. After being beaten by Walsall in the first round in 1990–91, they reached the second round again in 1991–92, eventually losing 3–2 to Hereford United. Another first round defeat took place in 1992–93 when they were beaten 8–0 at West Bromwich Albion, but the 1994–95 season saw their best performance to date, reaching the third round after defeating fellow non-League clubs Newport (IOW) and Kingstonian before losing 4–0 at QPR. The run included the \"duck walk\" celebration by Cliff Hercules, the club's record appearance holder and goalscorer, which was featured on the BBC's They Think It's All Over programme. In the same season they won the Isthmian League Cup.", "answers": ["Paragraph 10"], "length": 2801, "dataset": "passage_retrieval_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "bb0168a6df65a94b8d59c2cf43301e5221e42adfb523e6e3"}
{"input": "In this text, Wittgenstein introduces the concept of a language-game and emphasizes that language is used in various ways. He gives examples of how a word can have different meanings and functions depending on the language-game in which it is used. For instance, the word \"game\" can refer to board games, betting games, sports, or \"war games.\" Similarly, the word \"water\" can be used as an exclamation, order, request, or answer to a question, with its meaning determined by the specific language-game. Wittgenstein argues that the meaning of a word is derived from its use within a language-game and that it has no independent meaning outside of that context.", "context": "Paragraph 1: Central to Crossan's methodology is the dating of texts. This is laid out more or less fully in The Historical Jesus in one of the appendices. He dates part of the Coptic Gospel of Thomas to the 50s CE, as well as the first layer of the hypothetical Q Document (in this he is heavily dependent on the work of John Kloppenborg). He also assigns a portion of the Gospel of Peter, which he calls the \"Cross Gospel\", to a date preceding the synoptic gospels, the reasoning of which is laid out more fully in The Cross that Spoke: The Origin of the Passion Narratives. He believes the \"Cross Gospel\" was the forerunner to the passion narratives in the canonical gospels. He does not date the synoptics until the mid to late 70s CE, starting with the Gospel of Mark and ending with Luke in the 90s. As for the Gospel of John, he believes part was constructed at the beginning, and another part closer to the middle, of the 2nd century CE. Following Rudolf Bultmann, he believes there is an earlier \"Signs Source\" for John as well. His dating methods and conclusions are quite controversial, particularly regarding the dating of Thomas and the \"Cross Gospel\".\n\nParagraph 2: The Croydon Canal was constructed in the early 19th century, running from New Cross to the site of West Croydon station. As it passed through South Norwood, pubs sprang up near its course. The Jolly Sailor still stands at the intersection of South Norwood Hill and High Street. The Ship, a few yards to the east, was beside the loading point for bricks from a nearby brick field across what is now the High Street. The passageway through which bricks passed to the canal is still there. The Goat House pub (which has since been demolished) was said to have been named after an island in the canal on which goats were kept.\n\nParagraph 3: Holar was the Episcopal see for northern Iceland (whereas Skálholt served the same function for southern Iceland), and a cultural and educational centre for almost seven centuries (1106-1798). It was founded as a diocese in 1106 by bishop Jón Ögmundsson and soon became one of Iceland's two main centers of learning. It played an important part in the medieval politics of Iceland, and was the seat of Guðmundur Arason in his struggle with Icelandic chieftains during the time of the commonwealth. Under Jón Arason, Hólar was the last remaining stronghold of Catholicism in Iceland during the Reformation. The religious conflict was brutally resolved in 1550 when the last Catholic bishop, Jón Arason, was taken to the south of Iceland and beheaded, with his two sons, in Skálholt. The best known Lutheran bishop of Hólar was Guðbrandur Þorláksson. The construction of the present church is believed to have been completed in 1763.\n\nParagraph 4: Music researcher William Echard states that \"Heart Full of Soul\" by the Yardbirds, which was released in June 1965, \"is frequently cited as a key text in starting the trend\" towards incorporating Indian-inspired elements in rock music. An Indian sitarist and a tabla player accompanied the Yardbirds on a demo recording of the song, but only the tabla part was deemed usable. Instead, Jeff Beck emulated the sitar figure, tone and accompanying drone on the electric guitar for the master recording. The song reached number 2 on the UK chart and number 9 in the US. According to Chapman, the other record \"chiefly credited with introducing raga motifs into Western pop\" is the Kinks' July 1965 single \"See My Friends\", which was another top-ten hit in the UK. Written by Ray Davies and inspired by a visit to India, the song used open-tuned guitars to imitate the drone produced by an Indian tambura. Davies' vocal affectations added to the track's Indian quality; in author Peter Lavezzoli's description, \"See My Friends\" was \"the first pop song to evoke an Indian feel\". Before either of these examples, the Beatles' April 1965 single \"Ticket to Ride\", which was number 1 in many countries around the world, featured a melody that author Ian MacDonald terms \"raga-like\" over a subtle Indian drone produced by electric guitars.\n\nParagraph 5: In 798, for reasons lost to history, Wu Shaocheng, whose circuit had been renamed Zhangyi by this point, sent troops to pillage Huoshan County (霍山, in modern Lu'an, Anhui), belonging to Shou Prefecture (壽州, in modern Lu'an) of Huai'nan Circuit (淮南, headquartered in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu), killing Huoshan's defender Xie Xiang () and occupying Huoshan.  In 799, he further attacked Tang Prefecture (唐州, in modern Zhumadian), belonging to Shannan East Circuit, killing its prefect Zhang Jiayu () and eunuch monitor Shao Guochao () and capturing over 1,000 residents.  When Qu Huan () the military governor of Chenxu Circuit (陳許, headquartered in modern Xuchang, Henan) died in the fall that year, Wu further attacked Chenxu, putting its capital Xu Prefecture under siege, although his attacks were eventually repelled.  (Wu had made a secret pact with then-military governor of Xuanwu, Liu Quanliang (), to attack Chenxu together and divide its territory, but Liu died around that time as well, and Liu's successor Han Hong refused to follow the pact and further sent troops to help the defense against Wu's attack.)  In response, Emperor Dezong stripped Wu of all of his offices and ordered the circuits around his to attack him.  Subsequently, Han, along with Yu Di the military governor of Shannan East Circuit, Yi Shen () the military governor of Anhuang Circuit (安黃, headquartered in modern Xiaogan, Hubei), Chenxu's new military governor Shangguan Shui (), and Shou Prefecture's prefect Wang Zong (), attacked Wu together, initially enjoying some successes.  However, as the imperial forces lacked a supreme commander, they did not coordinate their operations and did not look out for each other.  Late in 799, for reasons unknown, the imperial forces suddenly collapsed themselves, abandoning their camp site at Little Yin River (小殷水, flowing through Luohe, Henan), and Wu was able to take over their supplies after they abandoned their camp.  After forces sent from Chengde (成德, headquartered in modern Shijiazhuang, Hebei), Yiwu (義武, headquartered in modern Baoding, Hebei), Chenxu, and Heyang (河陽, headquartered in modern Luoyang, Henan) were also defeated by Wu in spring 800, Emperor Dezong commissioned Han Quanyi () the military governor of Xiasui Circuit (夏綏, headquartered in modern Yulin, Shaanxi) as the overall commander of the forces against Wu.  However, Han Quanyi was also unsuccessful against Wu and later in 800 was defeated at Wulou (五樓, in modern Zhumadian).  After Wu withdrew back to Cai Prefecture in winter 800, Emperor Dezong, at the advice of the general Wei Gao and the chancellor Jia Dan, considered pardoning Wu.  Wu also sent letters to nearby imperial eunuch messengers, requesting exoneration.  Emperor Dezong thus pardoned Wu and his soldiers, restoring them to their titles.  It was said that Wu, meanwhile, strengthened the resolve of the people of Zhangyi against imperial forces by showing them letters addressed to Han Quanyi that he captured in the Battle of Wulou, falsely claiming that those were requests by imperial officials requesting Han to pillage Zhangyi and seizing women to serve as the officials' concubines.  He further had his soldiers' armors be inscribed with magical writing intended to curse the imperial troops.\n\nParagraph 6: Comparing players from different generations using PER presents several problems, this is primarily due to the rule changes and the changes in statistical data collected from different eras (although many other factors could be taken into consideration, even down to the increased sample size as the NBA grew through incorporating more teams). Some of the more important rule changes that should be considered include; some of the players on this list, such as Wilt Chamberlain and Bill Russell, played before the three-point shot, blocks, and steals stats were officially recorded. Blocked shots and steals were first officially recorded in the NBA during the 1973–74 season. The three-point shot entered the league in 1979–80 season. During the 1990s and 2000s numerous rule changes were incorporated, the \"three point foul\" and \"clear path\" rules were both introduced in the 1995–96 season with the effect of increasing the number of free throws, hand-checking (the amount of contact a defender may make with an opposing player) was banned in 1994 and the use of elbows was banned in 1997 (both rules had seen various degrees of limitation by earlier rule changes) although neither was fully implemented until 2004. The 2004 rule changes, which also included calling the defensive 3 second rule (\"[...] a defensive player may not station himself in the key area longer than three seconds\"—a longstanding rule which had been ignored by referees) had a major effect, opening up the game and allowing a more free-flowing offense; it encouraged aggressive inside attack based plays (to draw fouls), and has increased the number of fouls given when contact is made on players who drive to the basket.\n\nParagraph 7: From late March to mid May, Page did not wrestle for GCW due to lockdowns arising from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, but he returned to the promotion on June 20, at The Wrld On GCW Part 2, held in Indianapolis, Indiana. He teamed with Cogar, defeating The Second Gear Crew (Mance Warner and Matthew Justice). On July 25, at Homecoming Part 1, after Page had defeated Homicide, SHLAK came out to brawl with the members of 44.OH who had earlier interfered in his match, before being hit with a lariat from Page. Gage came out from the back and told Page that he would put his career on the line for a title shot. In response, Page told Gage that if any of his crew pinned a member of 44.OH, he would get a anytime, anywhere title shot. The following day, at Homecoming Part 2, Team MDK defeated 44.OH, and despite Gage suffering from an achilles injury (having wrestled for Beyond that afternoon), he was able to pin Ryan to win the title shot. On August 28, Page participated in his first Tournament of Survival. After defeating Jimmy Lloyd and fellow stablemate Ryan, Page faced Alex Colon in the final, who had won the tournament the year before. Colon overcame recurring interference from 44.OH, and won the match by hitting a Spanish Fly off the top rope and through a light tube tower of which Page was underneath. In the autumn, Page continued wrestling non-title matches like he did at the start of the year, where he defeated Justice and Blake Christian, but lost to Orange Cassidy in an upset. On November 7, at the Nick Gage Invitational, 44.OH jumped Mance Warner, who had just won the tournament, by attacking him with light tubes. Gage came out to make the save and told Page that he would fight him there and then, but Page refused and put his title on the line against Warner. The next night at So Much Fun, Page defeated Warner, which would be his last defence of the year. On January 31, 2021, at Fight Forever: The Wrld On GCW Part III, Page defeated Christian, who had put his GCW career on the line. On March 7, at Take Kare, Page defeated Janela, and in doing so, earned the right to the Spring Break name. However, Gage appeared and challenged Page to a rematch between the two, at rSpring Break on April 9. At the event, Page hit a chokebreaker on Gage and then the referee, which allowed Cogar to interfere in the match. While Page and Cogar set up glass panes in the ring, Lauderdale made the save, smashing Cogar in the head with a stack of light tubes. Gage then piledrived Page through the glass, but Page kicked out. Gage quickly hit Page with a chokebreaker for the win, ending his reign at 488 days.\n\nParagraph 8: Wittgenstein develops this discussion of games into the key notion of a language-game. He introduces the term using simple examples, but intends it to be used for the many ways in which we use language. The central component of language games is that they are uses of language, and language is used in multifarious ways. For example, in one language-game, a word might be used to stand for (or refer to) an object, but in another the same word might be used for giving orders, or for asking questions, and so on. The famous example is the meaning of the word \"game\". We speak of various kinds of games: board games, betting games, sports, \"war games\". These are all different uses of the word \"games\". Wittgenstein also gives the example of \"Water!\", which can be used as an exclamation, an order, a request, or an answer to a question. The meaning of the word depends on the language-game within which it is being used. Another way Wittgenstein puts the point is that the word \"water\" has no meaning apart from its use within a language-game. One might use the word as an order to have someone else bring you a glass of water. But it can also be used to warn someone that the water has been poisoned. One might even use the word as code by members of a secret society.\n\nParagraph 9: When the Anglo-Boer War broke out on 10 October 1899, the boer forces had 21,000 men ready to invade the Colony of Natal. Ranged against them, the British had 13,000 men.  The Boers, under the command of General Petrus Joubert, crossed the border into the Natal Colony and rapidly advanced to the Tugela river, laying siege to Ladysmith, some  north of the river and entrapping some 8,000 British regulars. On 15 November a raiding party ambushed an armoured train at Frere,  south of Colenso taking 70 prisoners including Winston Churchill. After another raiding party was surprised on 23 November at Willow Grange,  to the south of Colenso, the Boers withdrew to a position behind the Tugela River.\n\nParagraph 10: PA 53 begins at an interchange with the US 219 freeway in Croyle Township, Cambria County, heading east-northeast on four-lane divided Railroad Street. The road narrows into a two-lane undivided road as it heads through wooded areas to the south of Norfolk Southern's Pittsburgh Line, crossing the Little Conemaugh River into the borough of Summerhill. The route passes homes and a few businesses, heading northeast and crossing the river again before curving east and crossing back into Croyle Township. PA 53 becomes Portage Street and runs through more woodland to the south of the railroad tracks, crossing the Little Conemaugh River twice. The road heads into Summerhill Township and heads across the river again as it passes through farm fields and turns to the north, becoming the border between Summerhill Township to the west and the borough of Wilmore to the east. The route heads into wooded areas again and crosses under the Pittsburgh Line, turning northeast to fully enter Wilmore and pass near residences. PA 53 intersects PA 160 and passes homes and businesses before heading back into Summerhill Township. Here, the road runs through wooded areas with a few residences, crossing into Portage Township. The route becomes the border between Portage Township to the north and the borough of Portage to the south as it heads into commercial areas, gaining a center left-turn lane. PA 53 intersects PA 164 and forms a short concurrency with that route, fully entering Portage Township before PA 164 splits to the north. The road becomes two lanes again and heads northeast into woods, turning to the southeast as it passes through the residential community of Jamestown. The route heads into woods again and crosses under the Pittsburgh Line, turning north and crossing the former Bens Creek Culvert of the Allegheny Portage Railroad before entering Washington Township. PA 53 winds northeast through more woodland with some homes, passing through Plane Bank before heading into the borough of Lilly. Here, the route heads into residential areas, crossing the former Lilly Culvert of the Allegheny Portage Railroad before turning west onto Cleveland Street and then turning north onto Main Street. PA 53 splits northwest onto Evergreen Street and curves to the north, crossing back into Washington Township. The road heads into woodland, curving northeast and continuing into Cresson Township, becoming West 2nd Street. The route widens into a divided highway as it comes to an interchange with the US 22 freeway.  \n\nParagraph 11: Désilets wanted to move away from the lead character being a prince simply waiting for his reign to start, but a character that wanted to strive to be a king. He came upon one of his university books on secret societies and its first material related to the Order of Assassins and recognized that he could have the lead character in the game as the second-highest Assassin, seeking to be the leader of the group. The game began work under the title  Prince of Persia: Assassin, or Prince of Persia: Assassins, inspired by Hassan-i Sabbah's life and making heavy use of Vladimir Bartol's novel Alamut. The Assassin character was fleshed out throughout the game's three-year development in an iterative fashion. The team had some idea of how the character dressed from Alamut and other historical works in all-white robes and a red belt but had to envision how to detail this in the game. One of the first concept sketches, drawn by animator Khai Nguyen, suggested the concept of a bird of prey, which resonated with the team. The Assassin was named Altaïr, meaning \"bird of prey\" in Arabic, and eagle imagery was used heavily in connection to the Assassins. The team took some creative routes to meet narrative goals and avoid the technical limitations of the consoles. Altaïr was to be a heroic character with a bit of a badass edge, and the artist borrowed elements of the G.I. Joe character Storm Shadow, a similarly skilled hero. Rendering long flowing robes was impossible on the newer hardware, so they shortened the robe and gave it a more feathered look, resonating the bird of prey imagery. Similar routes were taken with other parts of the gameplay to take liberties with accuracy to make the game fun to play. The team wanted Altaïr's parkour moves to look believable but sacrificed realism for gameplay value, allowing the player to make maneuvers otherwise seemingly impossible in real-life. Having leaps of faiths from high vantage points into hay piles and using hay piles to hide from guards was a similar concept borrowed from Hollywood films; Désilets observed that Alamut described similar actions that the Assassins had undertaken.\n\nParagraph 12: In an interview in October 2001, Mundine said of the 11 September terrorist attacks, \"They call it an act of terrorism, but if you can understand religion, and our way of life, it’s not about terrorism. It’s about fighting for God’s law, and America’s brought it upon themselves\". Offering some insight into his tendency to make controversial comments in the media, Mundine stated, \"If you want to toe the line, if you want to be some corporate guy and say the right things, do the right things, you might be okay in the media's eye, but it won't be real for me\". Mundine later claimed he was taken out of context: \"Those comments were just spun around like I was clapping my hands. I have a family too, I know what it is like to suffer the loss of someone close to me, and I would never wish that upon anyone. The point I was trying to get across was that it was in a war state of mind, and there is always going to be tit for tat, so why put yourself in a situation where you can endanger people. I have got nothing against any American, I have got nothing against any human being. It breaks my heart that people think I would even have that line of thought about being happy about people dying. That is crap and I want to clarify that because it is wrong\".\n\nParagraph 13: The school board victory led to calls for a return of the Rebel nickname, and increased tensions within the school. On February 4, 1976, the school board held an unannounced election in which students were allowed to vote to either keep the name as \"Raiders\" or change the name back to \"Rebels\", if 3/4 of the student body approved. The students who preferred \"Rebels\" failed to secure a supermajority needed to win the ballot, by approximately 30 votes.  However over 300 students had been absent on the day of the vote and they were not allowed to cast ballots.  The next day, a peaceful protest to guarantee a vote to students who had not been allowed to vote the prior day degenerated into a riot which lasted over four hours in the school day. Four students were shot in the violence and twenty-six students were injured by rocks and debris while the calamity involved students smashing windows and trophy cases, as well as fighting with other students. It was estimated that three-quarters of the 2,523 students who attended Escambia High were involved in the riot. In the aftermath, crosses were burned on many school board members' yards, with one member, who was black, specifically targeted with a gunshot which went through his window. A human relations board member as well as a state legislator also had their homes torched. After all the retaliatory violence both at the school and in the community, members from the Florida Highway Patrol and numerous local law enforcement agencies combined to patrol the school until the end of the year.  While waiting for a final determination from the courts and the school board; the student body selected the nickname \"Patriots\" to be used at school sponsored events during the 1976–77 academic year. In the spring of 1977, after hearing the courts final decision that \"Rebels\" was not to be reinstated the students chose \"Gators\" as the permanent nickname. On July 13, 1977, the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) petitioned the Escambia County School Board to hold a meeting at Escambia High School. The Escambia High School Student Body president, John Davis, successfully argued against the petition before the board. The board voted 5–1 against the petition.\n\nParagraph 14: The second installment of the Bulgarian Interior Troops is from 1985 in connection to the Revival Process. A wave of terror attacks in the first half of the 1980s, including a bomb attack on a special passenger train coach for mothers traveling with little children on March 9, 1985, at Bunovo railway station, organized by the Turkish National-Liberation Movement terror organization, called for the re-establishment of a dedicated counter-insurgency paramilitary force in the structure of the Ministry of the Interior, to deal with the internal terror threat in cooperation with the State Security (Държавна Сигурност (ДС)) and the People's Militsiya (Народна Милиция (НМ)). The Interior Troops were tasked with counter-insurgency in mountainous and woodland terrain, riot control and security of locations of particular and strategic importance. The force was reinstated in 1985 and at the Boyana Roundtable Conference in the first half of 1990 convened between the Bulgarian Communist Party (recently renamed to Bulgarian Socialist Party) and the Union of Democratic Forces to reach an agreement about the reform of the country in light of radical changes in Eastern Europe it was publicly made clear (in response to a question about that), that the Interior Troops number 2 000 men in 6 battalions, plus the SOBT. The latter however is incorrect. The Specialized Counter-Terrorism Force (abbreviated SOBT in Bulgarian) has from its formation to present day (2017) been the premier counter-terrorism unit of the country, strategically subordinated directly to the Minister of the Interior as an independent agency in its own right. The confusion comes from the fact, that a security regiment of the IT has been based in Vranya, near the former Vrana Palace in barracks recently vacated by the State Security's Fifth Department (Department for Safety and Protection) (Пето управление (Управление за безопасност и охрана (УБО)), the higher state functionaries' close protection service. Since the abolition of the Bulgarian monarchy the palace has been turned into an official residence with permanent presence from the Ministry of the Interior. The battalion in question was the quick reaction paramilitary force for the capital Sofia. In fact the Vranya Battalion and the SOBT are located in adjacent barracks, which causes the confusion. The Interior Troops battalions were organised as rifle battalions with BTR-60s, trucks, automatic rifles, machine guns, mortars and anti-tank rockets. In 1990-91 the Border and the Interior Troops were amalgamated into the Troops of the Ministry of the Interior (Войски на МВР), then separated again. In 1993 the Interior Troops were renamed into Gendarmery, the traditional name from the time of the monarchy, banned after that for their role in hunting down communist partizans. Recently the Gendarmery has been absorbed into the Ministry of the Interior's Main Directorate \"National Police\" and as of 2017 the former Interior Troops and Gendarmery after that exist in the form of Specialized Police Forces (Специализирани Полицейски Сили) within the National Police. In 1989 they consisted of:\n\nParagraph 15: Vocalist and rhythm guitarist Ade Blackburn and lead guitarist Jonathan Hartley formed the earliest incarnation of the band around 1984, initially known as Sunny Rainy Afterlife, and offering home-made demo cassettes through a local free-circulation magazine. By the late 1980s, the band had renamed itself Jellystone Park, with Blackburn and Hartley joined by drummer Steve \"Captain\" Dougherty, who later went on to join Creation signings One Lady Owner, and bassist Derek Finn. Following a brief hiatus, and a one-off appearance by Blackburn and Hartley in a covers act, Sean Durney's L-Ego, supporting the post-A Flock of Seagulls combo An Almighty Atmosphere, Dougherty was replaced in 1988 by Sean Durney, previously drummer with an acoustic agit-pop outfit also part of a mini-scene centred on the Birkey pub in Crosby, Liverpool. The band by this time was based in a former storage room at the Regent Bingo Hall in Crosby (now St Mary's College Sports Centre), where Blackburn was a bingo caller. Finn departed and was replaced by Rich Stevens, and following his departure, for a short period by Paul Entwhistle, also of Liverpool band Spontaneous Cattle Combustion. Entwhistle was subsequently replaced by Brian Campbell after Durney spotted him playing in a band at The Crosby Squash Club. The band recorded two demos in 1991 (both of which were released as digital downloads by Museum Records under the name of Jellystone Park  in 2011, and The Dark Side of the Birkey  in 2012) along with a flexi-disc in 1992. Durney also departed in 1993, being replaced on the drums by Carl Turney, an associate of Campbell, and the band renamed itself Pure Morning, recording an album, Two Inch Helium Buddah, for Radar Records in 1996.\n\nParagraph 16: The concept of computer ethics originated in the 1940s with MIT professor Norbert Wiener, the American mathematician and philosopher. While working on anti-aircraft artillery during World War II, Wiener and his fellow engineers developed a system of communication between the part of a cannon that tracked a warplane, the part that performed calculations to estimate a trajectory, and the part responsible for firing. Wiener termed the science of such information feedback systems, \"cybernetics,\" and he discussed this new field with its related ethical concerns in his 1948 book, Cybernetics. In 1950, Wiener's second book, The Human Use of Human Beings, delved deeper into the ethical issues surrounding information technology and laid out the basic foundations of computer ethics.\n\nParagraph 17: In the seventh century the Northumbrian church was increasingly influenced by the Roman form of Christianity. The careers of St. Wilfred (active from the 660s until his death in 709), abbot of the monastery at Ripon and Bishop of Northumbria, and Benedict Biscop (c. 628–690), founder of the monasteries of Jarrow and Wearmouth, intensified ties with Rome. Wilfred was the major spokesman for the Roman case at the Synod of Whitby in 664, which was called by king Oswiu of Northumbria to decide which form of observance would be used in his kingdom, and where he decided in favour of the Roman form of tonsure and of calculating Easter. In this period the Kingdom of Northumbria was expanding into what is now Lowland Scotland. A bishopric established at Abercorn in the region of West Lothian, is presumed to have adopted Roman forms of Christianity after the Synod of Whitby. However, the Pictish victory at the Battle of Dunnichen in 685, ended the Northumbrian dominance of the region and the Bishop and his followers were ejected. Nechtan mac Der-Ilei, king of the Picts from 706, seems to have attempted to establish links with the church in Northumbria. Before 714 he wrote to Ceolfrith, abbot of Wearmouth, asking for a formal refutation of the Irish position over the calculation of the date of Easter and for help in building a stone church \"in the manner of the Romans\". A. A. M. Duncan has suggested that there was a \"Romanising group\" among Nechtan's clergy, perhaps led by Bishop Curitan, who took the name Latin name Boniface. This is also suggested by the presence of a church at Rosemarkie in Ross and Cromarty, dedicated to St Peter, seen as the first Bishop of Rome, by the early eighth century, and subsequent similar dedications in Pictish territory.\n\nParagraph 18: In addition, while he was the Vatican's chief astronomer, Fr. George Coyne issued a statement on 18 November 2005 saying that \"Intelligent design isn't science even though it pretends to be. If you want to teach it in schools, intelligent design should be taught when religion or cultural history is taught, not science.\" Cardinal Paul Poupard added that \"the faithful have the obligation to listen to that which secular modern science has to offer, just as we ask that knowledge of the faith be taken in consideration as an expert voice in humanity.\" He also warned of the permanent lesson we have learned from the Galileo affair, and that \"we also know the dangers of a religion that severs its links with reason and becomes prey to fundamentalism.\" Fiorenzo Facchini, professor of evolutionary biology at the University of Bologna, called intelligent design unscientific, and wrote in the January 16–17, 2006 edition L'Osservatore Romano: \"But it is not correct from a methodological point of view to stray from the field of science while pretending to do science. ...It only creates confusion between the scientific plane and those that are philosophical or religious.\" Kenneth R. Miller is another prominent Catholic scientist widely known for opposing Young Earth Creationism and Intelligent Design. He writes, concerning Emeritus pope Benedict XVI, that \"The Holy Father's concerns are not with evolution per se, but with how evolution is to be understood in our modern world. Biological evolution fits neatly into a traditional Catholic understanding of how contingent natural processes can be seen as part of God's plan ...a careful reading suggests that the new pope will give quarter neither to the enemies of spirituality nor the enemies of evolutionary science. And that's exactly as it should be.\"\n\nParagraph 19: Danny Rapp (lead), Frank Maffei (2nd tenor), Joe Terranova (baritone) (aka Joe Terry), and Dave White Tricker (first tenor) (aka Dave White) met at John Bartram High School and started singing together in the mid 1950s. Known as the Juvenaires at the time, they sang at school parties and other local events. Local record producer John Madara, took notice of them and introduced them to local DJs Larry Brown and Artie Singer, who had a record label known as Singular Records. In 1957, they recorded a John Madara and Dave White penned song \"Do the Bop\", recording the song as Johnny Madara and The Juvenaires. Singer took it to a fellow DJ named Dick Clark. Clark liked it and suggested changing their name to the Juniors and renaming their song. The song was recorded as \"At The Hop', this time with Danny Rapp on the lead vocal. Changing \"Let's all do the Bop\" to \"Let's go to the Hop\" proved to be successful, and it became a local hit in June 1957. In December 1957, they received a call from Dick Clark to be a last-minute substitution for a no-show band on American Bandstand, and they performed it for a national audience. The song became a nationwide hit after ABC Paramount bought the master recording and issued it in January 1958. They soon appeared on The Pat Boone Chevy Showroom and other national TV shows. Soon after, they recorded  \"Rock and Roll Is Here To Stay\" and \"Dottie\", both of which charted. In the fall of 1957, David began attending Temple University and was on the Gym Team, but quit school when the group started making personal appearances.\n\nParagraph 20: Immediately upon entering the gates of Oakland is found the original  purchased for use as the Atlanta Cemetery in 1850. The gates and perimeter walls were not erected until 1896, the date engraved on the keystone of the gates' highest arch. After a short distance along a brick walkway, Oakland's first resident since its establishment can be found. Dr. James Nissen was a medical doctor visiting Atlanta who fell ill and died in 1850. Legend has it that Dr. Nissen shared a common fear of the day, being buried alive. Therefore, before his death he asked that his jugular vein be cut prior to his burial to ensure he did not wake up later under the ground. Being the oldest grave in Oakland since its designation as a city cemetery, Nissen's headstone is nearly completely worn away by the passage of time and the elements. The inscription is only known due to an extensive survey of Atlanta cemeteries performed in the 1930s by Franklin Garrett. Back towards the main gates of Oakland on a plot donated by the City of Atlanta lies Martha Lumpkin Compton. The daughter of Governor Wilson Lumpkin, from 1843 until 1845 Atlanta was known as \"Marthasville\" in her honor.\n\nParagraph 21: \"La Conchita\", Spanish for little conch shell, was first used as the name of a spur on the Southern Pacific railroad line in the 1880s and it was a name generally used to describe a broader area than the present day village. During this time until 1923, the small beach settlement was named \"Punta\" and the street names still carried today (San Fernando, Ojai, Bakersfield, Carpinteria, etc.) commemorated the home town areas of the railroad workers who settled in the town while building the Southern Pacific line. The name change and designated area then known as La Conchita are crucially important to any understanding of the region today and its geologic history. Up through the 1930s as historically documented, the area from Bates Road down to Mussel Shoals (then known as Mussel Rock) was referred to as La Conchita.\n\nParagraph 22: The 1939 World's Fair had two seasons: one each in 1939 and 1940, which ended in the fall months of the year. Service for the first season ended on November 1, 1939, and during this season the line's ridership was 7,066,966. The IND World's Fair Line was closed between seasons, and at the end of the Fair the line was set to be demolished. The last train ran on October 28, 1940, the day after the closure of the Fair. While most of the fairgrounds were torn down soon after the event, the line remained intact for several months afterward. Queens borough president George U. Harvey proposed extending the line to serve the then-developing neighborhoods of Flushing, College Point, and Whitestone, along with the recently opened Queens College. This plan was supported by the local communities, elected officials in Queens, and the president of Queens College. It was deemed to be unfeasible, however, by the Board of Transportation due to the fact that the trestle was constructed to be temporary, and due to regulations at the time which required permanent lines for subway service to be built underground. Parks and highway commissioner Robert Moses, meanwhile, wished to utilize the right-of-way for the further development of Flushing Meadows Park and the extension of the Van Wyck Expressway towards the Whitestone Expressway and the Whitestone Bridge. Demolition of the line was authorized in December 1940, and on January 15, 1941, removal of the line commenced. The right-of-way was replaced with an extension of 136th Street, and eventually the northern portion of the Van Wyck Expressway which formed today's Interstate 678. Seven train signals that were modified for the World's Fair Line still exist along the Jamaica Yard's track connections to the Queens Boulevard Line. Instead of controlling the speeds of passenger trains, these signals are now used to control the speeds of yard traffic.\n\nParagraph 23: The crux of the matter regarding quasispecies implications is that at any given time, the viral population includes a reservoir not only of genotypic but also of phenotypic variants, conferring upon the population some adaptive pluripotency. Accumulating laboratory and clinical evidence renders untenable that minority components of mutant spectra should be dismissed on the grounds of their being neutral. They can participate in selective processes and cannot be excluded from interpretations of virus behavior. Variation universally involves point mutations and it can also include recombination (in its replicative and non-replicative modes), and genome segment reassortment. All modes of molecular variation are compatible, only restricted by the scope of mechanisms accessible to the replicative machinery, and for the need for viral genomes to remain functional. David Evans and colleagues identified many recombination events associated with enterovirus replication, and only a few recombinants made their way towards continued replication. Recombination can mediate adaptability and virulence. High mutation and recombination rates have led to the conceptual distinction between mechanistically unavoidable and evolutionarily relevant variation, in connection with the issue of clonal versus non-clonal nature of virus evolution (microbial evolution in general). Only a minority of the nascent variation during replication can be successfully propagated. Within limits that are set by biological constraints, each population is made of an array of variant genomes, with a total number which is commensurate with the virus population size. To infect a plant, animal or cell culture with 103 infectious units can have very different consequences than to infect with 1010 infectious units, not only because the host defense systems may be overwhelmed by the high infectious dose, but also because the mutant repertoire that engages in adaptive explorations is larger. Part of the variants of a mutant spectrum, either in isolation or in consortium with others, may perform better than other members of the same population in the event of an environmental change. Selective pressures favor replication of some components of a mutant spectrum over others, despite all of them being interconnected by mutation.  Differential performance can be at the level of viral genomes (during replication, intracellular gene expression, interaction with host factors, etc.) or viral particles (for thermal stability, entry into or exit from cells, to withstand neutralizing antibodies, etc.).  Adaptability of RNA viruses is linked to parameters that facilitate exploration of sequence space: genome size (1.8 to 33 Kb), population size (variable but that can attain an impressive 1012 individual genomes in an infected host at a given time), replication rate, mutation rate, fecundity (yield of viral particles per cell), and number of mutations required for a phenotypic change (surprisingly low for several relevant traits).\n\nParagraph 24: Despite being a US historical ally, Colombia did not support the US-Led boycott of the 1980 Moscow Olympics. Initially the then President of Colombia Julio Turbay supported the boycott, but the then president of Comité Olímpico Colombiano Fidel Mendoza did not abide the president's order and gave green light to 23 Colombian athletes to participate. Competing in the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles, shooter Helmut Bellingrodt won his second silver medal in the same event he won his first medal back in 1972, making him the first Colombian athlete to won two olympic medals; his medal was the only one the Colombian contingent won at those Games. At the 1988 Olympics in Seoul, another Colombian boxer won a bronze medal: Jorge Eliécer Julio made it to the Bantamweight category semifinals and faced Bulgaria's Aleksandar Khristov; the Colombian was seen as dominating his opponent, but in the end three out of five judges declared the Bulgarian as winner of the bout, prompting protests from fans who were attending the boxing competitions at that moment. Ximena Restrepo became the first Colombian woman to win an Olympic medal, by winning a bronze medal in the women's 400 m. at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics. She found out she won a medal minutes later after crossing the line. Her 49.64 seconds mark still stands as the South American record for that event. Ximena Restrepo became the first Colombian woman to win an Olympic medal, by winning a bronze medal in the women's 400 m. at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics. She found out she won a medal minutes later after crossing the line. Her 49.64 seconds mark still stands as the South American record for that event. The country failed to win a medal at the 1996 Centennial Olympics in Atlanta, although marathon runner Carlos Grisales ranked eleventh in the men's event, the highest position a Colombian athlete has ever achieved in an olympic marathon race so far. The story was different four years later in Sydney 2000, as Weightlifter María Isabel Urrutia won the nation's first olympic gold medal at the 75 kg. category. Urrutia lifted the same weight than silver and bronze medal winners Nigeria's Ruth Ogbeifo and Taiwan's Kuo Yi-hang respectively, but she won gold due her body weight being less than that of her rivals. Señal Colombia broadcast her victory and when the event ended, the narrators mistakenly believed she won bronze as they saw on screen the results of the clean and jerk phase. Seconds after, the final results were screened and they realized their error and Urrutia's accomplishment.\n\nParagraph 25: In the Soviet Union, including Tajikistan, beginning in the 1970s, Jews who were able, began to emigrate to Israel, as well as to the United States. By the late 1980s, many of Tajikistan's Jews had left. After  the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, Tajikistan gained independence and the country fell into a state of civil war between the government and Islamist forces. Continuous military conflict kept Tajik Jews in severe poverty and in fear for their lives. In 1992-1993 most of the country's Jews were evacuated to Israel or the US. Between 1989 and 2002, all but 197 of the country's almost 15,000 Jews emigrated, largely to Israel. Those Jews who emigrated were stripped of their Tajik citizenship and no longer hold a connection to the country.", "answers": ["Paragraph 8"], "length": 7257, "dataset": "passage_retrieval_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "80f5922b0e4edfbcf94b81ab942f21dc5b3c7fc0b9f9e7a5"}

Anne Jean Marie René Savary, the Minister of Police and Clarke's main rival by 1812, was arrested by Malet and Clarke moved in to provide military police powers. Napoleon, however, was alarmed by Clarke's assumption of power in his absence and upon his return to Paris in December 1812 reappointed Savary. Although he needed Clarke's centralized Ministry in 1813, he never fully trusted Clarke after the Malet affair, and in November 1813 appointed an equally strong administrator, Pierre Daru, as Minister of War Administration. Daru began building his own authority, and during 1814 the army suffered as both Clarke and Daru sparred over administrative responsibilities and authority. As the Allies approached Paris, Clarke found himself with the responsibility to defend the capital but with split authority; not only was he charged with producing manpower for Napoleon, a duty he shared with Daru, but he was also responsible for the population and civil defense. He found himself organizing hospitals and mobilizing the population. In the end, his efforts at defense were ineffectual and he was one of the generals pressing for Napoleon's abdication. After Napoleon's abdication he was replaced as Minister of War by Dupont de l'Étang but Louis XVIII of France made him a Peer of France. When Napoleon landed in Southern France in March 1815 to reclaim his throne (the \"Hundred Days\"), Clarke was again made Minister of War and served until the Bourbon government fled. When the King fled to Ghent, Clarke followed him. After Napoleon's second abdication, Clarke was made Minister of War once more and served in that capacity until 1817 when Gouvion Saint-Cyr took over. He was then given command of the 15th Military Division.\n\nParagraph 2: The first sports Corvette was designed and constructed by Duntov in 1956, who built 3 copies. The SR1 and SR2 projects met with Harley Earl's approval, which led to Duntov's proposal to establish the Corvette racing team being accepted with his promotion to the post of director of the high-performance car department in 1957. Duntov's new project was the Corvette SS with a magnesium body for the 24-hour Le Mans race. For preliminary testing of the car, the American counterpart, \"12 hours of Sebring\" was chosen. The difficulty was in the timing, since before the annual Sebring there were only 6 months left. According to rumors, in order to be in time, Duntov copied the frame for the new Corvette from the Mercedes 300SLR. To test the joint work of all the components, Duntov built a second car with a fiberglass body as a test mule. The results shown were positive, the team gained confidence in the victory. Later, the mule more than once proved its usefulness during the development and testing of new, improved versions. However, there was not enough time to fully test the racing Corvette. Therefore, having arrived in Sebring and joining the Corvette core team, SS pilot John Fitch still could not figure out the brake lock problem. The start of the race looked positive for the SS, but the problem with the brakes only intensified. By the end of the third lap, the pilot could no longer control the front axle of his car. After a quick tire change, Fitch continued to race, but already on the 23rd lap, the Corvette SS was forced to leave the track due to suspension and other mechanical problems. Despite the development setbacks of the SS, the new development of the Corvette attracted a lot of public attention, including setting a new lap record. But for Chevrolet, it became clear that with Le Mans would have to wait. Shortly after the race in Sebring, the situation for Duntov and his entire unit became more complicated.\n\nParagraph 3: They signed for Alan McGee's Creation Records in 1997, at a time when the label was riding high on the Britpop-fuelled success of Oasis, and stayed until the label's demise in 1999, releasing two albums, the first (The Barn Tapes) originally recorded in a barn in Kent as demos for the label, and the second (Hillside) much lauded by critics. Hillside Album was released on 13 July 1998. They toured the United States in 1998 before returning to the UK to tour with Neil Finn followed by dates supporting Bernard Butler. They subsequently signed for McGee's next label, Poptones and were joined by Rob Arriss (guitar and keyboards) and Dave Hill (drums) before releasing the album Bahama in 2001.\n\nParagraph 4: Selected by the Los Angeles Lakers in the third round of the 1978 NBA draft with the 60th overall pick, Cooper became an integral part of their Showtime teams of the 1980s with his defensive skills. In a twelve-year career, he was named to the NBA All Defensive Team eight times, including five first-team selections. Cooper and Norm Van Lier have the most defensive selections of any player to not be inducted into the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame. He was named a finalist in 2022. He won the NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award in 1987. He, along with Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Magic Johnson, was a member of five Lakers championship teams in 1980, 1982, 1985, 1987, and 1988.\n\nParagraph 5: Two days after arriving in port,  joined I Scouting Group. In June, she steamed to Vlissingen in the Netherlands, where she embarked Crown Prince Wilhelm and his wife Cecilie to take them to attend the coronation of King George V of the United Kingdom. The ceremonies included a Fleet Review at Spithead that lasted from 20 to 29 June, where  represented Germany. The battlecruiser then carried the Crown Prince and Princess back to Germany. She returned to operations with the fleet in August, and on 29 September, she became the flagship of I Scouting Group, replacing  in that role. The unit was at that time commanded by  (Vice Admiral) Gustav Bachmann. In July 1912, while  was undergoing an engine overhaul, the new battlecruiser  replaced  as flagship. KzS Max Hahn replaced Mischke as the ship's captain in September. She briefly served as the flagship of the deputy commander,  (Rear Admiral) Franz von Hipper, from 21 to 26 September. On 1 October,  became the flagship of the 3rd Admiral of Reconnaissance Forces, KAdm Felix Funke; on 1 March 1914, Funke was transferred to command III Battle Squadron and he was replaced by KzS Arthur Tapken, who was soon promoted to  on the 22nd.\n\nParagraph 6: Malaysian Army is also rapidly mechanising its current inventory - 267 units locally manufactured DefTech ACV-300 Adnan IFVs were acquired by the army in 2004 and 111 units K200 KIFV also purchased from South Korea. Following the procurement of the Pakistani Bakhtar-Shikan anti-armor missile launcher and these were installed on the ACV-300 Adnans. The locally manufactured AV-4 Lipanbara 4x4 armoured vehicles by DefTech that were intended to be stationed in east Malaysia were also purchased after an agreement with a Thai company. Malaysia also locally produce AV-8 Gempita 8x8 by DefTech company with technology assistance from Turkey. While another Malaysian company AVP Engineering has teamed up with a South Korean-defence company Doosan DST to offer Black Fox 6x6 wheeled armoured vehicle if it was selected by the Malaysian government. In 2017, Malaysian Army acquired IAG Guardian armoured vehicle for uses in peacekeeping missions in Lebanon. There are also planned to replace the retired FV101 Scorpion and Alvis Stormer with the new armoured vehicle. Malaysian Army planned to add locally made light armoured vehicle in their inventory. In 2019, Malaysian government issues a tender for the new multipurpose light armoured vehicle. The variants sought for this new vehicle is the fitted for radio, mortar carrier, anti-tank guided missile carrier and light assault vehicle or special operation vehicle. This new light armoured vehicle is uses to augment the fleets of URO VAMTAC and Weststar GK-M1. In August 2020, the Ministry of Defence is preparing for an open competition to find the replacement for the APC to replace Condor APC and SIBMAS IFV. About 250-400 Armoured Fighting Vehicle were request by the army, specifically 4x4 and 6x6. In January 2021, Malaysian company Mildef International Technologies has launched its new Mildef Tarantula HMAV intended for local market and export. Another local company, Cendana Auto also ready to deliver its new Cendana Auto Rover to the Malaysian Army starting in 2021. In Defence Services Asia (DSA) 2022 exhibition, Mildef International Technologies has launched its second armoured vehicle called Mildef Rentaka 4x4. In same exhibition also, Malaysia signed a contract to purchase Ejder Yalcin for Malaysian Army.\n\nParagraph 7: His predecessor, Pope John VI of Alexandria, the 74th Pope of Alexandria, died in 1216 in grief over the conversion of the entire population of Pentapolis in Eastern Libya from Christianity to Islam, even though he had ordained a bishop for Pentapolis (the five western cities) after a long period where there was no bishop for this area (in hopes of strengthening the church there). John VI came from a rich family before his ordination, but he lived a simple life and used his family wealth to pay for his expenses and for the expenses of the Patriarchate and those of his aids. He did not want to burden the church or its people with his expenses, but he lived all his days supporting himself and his companions, and he gave charity to the poor of his own money and refused to answer the demands of the Church leaders in Alexandria for payments out of the church coffers (as was the custom before him). Thus, in his time, sufficient money accumulated in the Church coffers. This attracted the attention of a powerful monk and a priest named David (Dawoud) of Fayyum ibn Laqlaq (داود بن لقلق - داود الفيومي) who desired to seize this money. John VI was patriarch for 27 years [1189-1216 AD]. This simple pope had predicted before his departure that \"pain would befall the church and its people and the Lord would establish a man who would come from where they did not know\". John VI died unhappy about the state of affairs of the Church and wary of the plans of Dawoud ibn Laqlaq.\n\nParagraph 8: Mo'Nique's first play was Eve Ensler's Obie Award-winning production of The Vagina Monologues in March 2002. Mo'Nique, Ella Joyce (Roc); Wendy Raquel Robinson (The Steve Harvey Show and The Game) and Vanessa Bell Calloway (What's Love Got to Do with It), were the first all black celebrity cast to perform The Vagina Monologues. Produced by YYP & Associates, the show was directed by playwright and director Yetta Young as well as co-produced by Kellie R. Griffin, Lisa D. Washington and Anita Cal. Mo'Nique is the author of the best-selling book Skinny Women Are Evil: Notes of a Bigg Girl in a Small-Minded World. She also released a 2006 cookbook called Skinny Cooks Can't Be Trusted. Mo'nique was part of the Washington, D.C., WHUR radio show with George Wilborn. In 2006, she occasionally filled in for afternoon personality Michael Baisden when his contract with ABC Radio was in the process of getting renewed.\n\nParagraph 9: In his early career between 1978 and 1982, the antagonistic roles he played were often henchman to the main villain M. N. Nambiar and other villains and his role would be minor, while the main lead was Sivaji Ganesan, Jaishankar, Kamal Haasan, Rajinikanth and Vijayakanth. His college friend Manivannan directed Sathyaraj for the first time in the Tamil film January 1 in 1984, where Sathyaraj had a supporting role. Manivannan directed Sathyaraj in about 25 films from 1984 to 2013 and of them 18 had Sathyaraj as the main lead. His screen space as a villain increased after 24 Mani Neram (1984), directed by Manivannan, in which Sathyaraj's role was on par with that of lead actor Mohan. His acting skills in the film were noticed by many and he became famous among the Tamil film audience. Sathyaraj also felt that his villainous roles in  Nooravathu Naal and Anbin Mugavari, both again directed by Manivannan, had better footage than that of Vijayakanth's and Mohan's. In Needhiyin Nizhal (1985), which featured Prabhu in the lead role, Sathyaraj had a minuscule supporting role and played second fiddle to the main villain M. N. Nambiar. Sathyaraj started receiving offers to act as the hero in Tamil films from 1985.  Directors were reluctant to cast him as the protagonist as his second film as a lead actor Iravu Pookkal (1985) was not a success. Most of the films he was part of were of the action genre in this period.\n\nParagraph 10: Laser roughening of titanium surfaces for epoxy bonding is a good option when abrasives and chemical agents are restricted in the manufacturing area.  The process is also more repeatable and consistent than the often manual abrasive blasting.  Other advantages over abrasives are touch time and maintenance.  The drawback of laser roughening is the cost of the equipment and tooling.  Also, the laser will heat the material depending on its power output and number of passes. It will remove material from the surface and create regions of hardened material that get relocated within the surface. Neodymium doped yttrium aluminum garnet (Nd:YAG), CO2, green, femtosecond lasers can be used depending on the workpiece and adhesion requirements.  YAG or fiber laser markers that anneal the titanium surface are the low cost solution while the femtosecond laser is on the high end of the cost scale. Surface roughness of laser roughened surfaces is best measured using a three-dimensional scanning laser microscope or a non-contact profilometer.  XPS and SEM analysis of alloyed titanium, like grade 5, will show the segregation of the aluminum and vanadium.  Oftentimes, the laser roughening is done in ambient conditions with or without argon shielding gas.  Ambient elements that play no role in bonding like carbon and nitrogen can be ignored from the surface analysis.  Laser roughening of grade 5 titanium will show that the vanadium will segregate to the bulk of the alloy and appear at the surface with an increased oxygen level. Lap shear tests have shown that this segregation does not affect surface adhesion.  The increase of laser power has shown to increase oxidation of grade 5 titanium which has been correlated to increase bond strength.  Also, producing alumina at the surface has shown to improve bonding.  Dimples created by multiple laser pulses increase the surface area for adhesion, but the center of the topography will have reduced oxide formation because of the laser-induced plasma.   Depending on the grade of titanium and the adhesive used, the laser parameters of power, frequency, and pattern can be tailored to the loading requirements and the aforementioned surface elemental beneficial conditions.  Unwanted metal oxide can occur when higher laser powers and multiple passes are employed.  These can be removed with a lower powered laser pass or a titanium brush, post roughening.  The grain size will affect the surface roughness, hardness, and wettability of the surface.  On grade 2 titanium, a smaller grain structure improved these surface prep characteristics. As with abrasives, a silane primer application is used to seal the laser roughened surface.\n\nParagraph 11:   Savannah Township was originally settled after the Indian Removal Act of 1830.  The first settlers in the area were homesteaders, and they built their farmsteads in the valley and hills located in the area.  The area has several cemeteries and churches, the origins of which go back to this period of time.  The present church buildings are much more modern than the originals, though.  The valley was formed over millions of years by the erosive power of Savannah Creek, which flows north-west, following the course of US 441 and later NC 116 before emptying into the Tuckasegee River near Webster.  The area was home to several small communities, some with their own school, store, community center, and post office.  Greens Creek, Gay, Viewpoint, Olivet, and East Fork were the five communities that made up Savannah.  In the 1920s, new schools at Greens Creek and Gay opened, consolidating three one-room schools in each community.  The 1920s also led to the opening up of the Savannah Communities to the outside world, via the two-lane paved US 441 built during the decade, near the present five-lane road.  US 441 was a modern two-lane and paved highway from Franklin to Dillsboro at the time.  The 1920s also exposed the inequality that existed between rural schools and the town schools, it was said in the Jackson County Journal, May 9, 1924 Issue \"Sylva Students complete the 7th Grade at age 13, Savannah students complete the 7th Grade at 15 years of age.  The only children that can complete a grade a year are those who live in the wealthy districts where it is possible to maintain an eight-month term.  Only 45% of the children in the county can had the benefit of a term of eight months.  The children in the schools with a shorter term must spend one to two years more in the Elementary School than they should.  The result of this is that hundreds of boys and girls drop out of school before they graduate Elementary School.  If they manage to complete Elementary School, they are so over age and handicapped that more than half of them drop out before completing their first year of high school.\" This was partially fixed in 1936, with the opening of the old Webster Rock School and fixed once and for all when a consolidated school for the Greens Creek & Savannah Townships opened in 1940, the grades 1–7 school was named Savannah Consolidated School.  It was a seven-classroom school with a lunchroom and a gym/auditorium.  For the first time ever, students in the Savannah Township could enjoy modern conveniences, such as electric lights, indoor restrooms, and a very modern building.  But the school wasn't without its problems.  It was overcrowded from the start, due to the unanticipated level of students attending it because they had been attending school in Webster, Sylva, or Dillsboro, due to the better buildings there before 1940.  The School was still a great building, and it didn't absolutely require expansion until 1955.  In 1955, four new classrooms and a new set of restrooms, as well as a water tower on top of the red-brick flat-roof addition was added to the school, easing overcrowding and allowing expansion of the lunch room and raising the number of classrooms to 10.  The school served around 300 students until it closed due to consolidation in 1973.  Since that time, it has been converted to an Antique Mall with boards covering much of the windows.\n\nParagraph 12: As American settlers moved west along the Oregon Trail, some traveled through the northern part of the Oregon Territory and settled in the Puget Sound area. The first European settlement in the Puget Sound area in the west of present-day Washington State came in 1833 at the British Hudson's Bay Company's Fort Nisqually, a farm and fur-trading post later operated by the Puget's Sound Agricultural Company (incorporated in 1840), a subsidiary of the Hudson's Bay Company. Washington's pioneer founder, Michael Simmons, along with the black pioneer George Washington Bush and his Caucasian wife, Isabella James Bush, from Missouri and Tennessee, respectively, led four white families into the territory and settled New Market, now known as Tumwater, in 1846. They settled in Washington to avoid Oregon's racist settlement-laws. After them, many more settlers, migrating overland along the Oregon trail, wandered north to settle in the Puget Sound area. In contrast with other American settlements in the West, there was comparatively little violence between settlers and Native Americans, though several exceptions, such as the extensive campaigns of Territorial Governor Isaac Ingalls Stevens (in office: 1853 to 1857) to force Indians into ceding lands and rights, are notable. The Puget Sound War of 1855-1856, the Cayuse War of 1847 to 1855, the Yakima War of 1855 to 1858, and the Spokane War of 1858 were the largest conflicts between the new American authorities and indigenous governments in the area. Raids by Haida,  Tlingit and other northern tribes from British and  Russian territory terrorized Native Americans and settlers alike in Puget Sound in the 1850s (note the events associated with Port Gamble in 1856-1857). Miners bound for the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush in British Columbia in 1858 using the Okanagan Trail traveled under arms, and many instances of violence occurred along the route.\n\nParagraph 13: After overhearing a conversation between Buzz and Coop, Lizzie learned that Coop had been accepted to study at Oxford. She is heartbroken at the prospect of losing him, Lizzie made a secret phone call, fully determined to move ahead with the wedding. She then asked Coop to meet her since she’d planned a trip for them to Cancun. Coop was thrilled, unaware that Lizzie planned to bring him to the altar instead. Although Alex uncovered Lizzie’s plot, she ultimately gave Lizzie her blessing when Lizzie made it clear she was doing it all for love. To her chagrin, Coop didn’t show up at the airport on time, leading Lizzie to think he’d backed out. Finally, an injured Coop did arrive. Learning that Coop had a strange accident while he was working on his car (tires fell on him and he knocked over a gas pipe), Lizzie was sure that Beth and Alan were to blame for trying to keep Coop away from her. Later, Coop found out Lizzie was planning a wedding and confronted her. Lizzie apologized but reminded Coop he kept a secret from her too about his offer at Oxford. Coop apologized and they both resolve to trust each other more. Coop then decided to remain in Springfield rather than go to Oxford. Later, Lizzie received word that Alan was at the hospital and confronted him about sending someone after Coop. Realizing she needed to play hard ball, Lizzie had Beth’s plane rerouted so that she’d miss the Spaulding board meeting in which a new CEO was being elected. Without Beth to intervene a surprising new CEO was elected—Harley! Meanwhile, unable to answer to a boss, Lizzie quit her new job at the television station, but Coop stood up for her when Beth tried to stir up trouble between them. Later, a grateful Lizzie promised she’d find a way to solve their cash-flow problem.\n\nParagraph 14: Dale Earnhardt Jr. took the lead from Stewart with four laps to go and held off a hard charging Jeff Gordon to score his first career win at Martinsville Speedway. “Oh, man, been trying to win here for so many years,” Earnhardt said. “Real emotional win. I can’t believe we won here. We’re going to drink a lot of beer tonight. It’s a real emotional win. This team on pit road was great and Steve (Letarte, crew chief) and the guys did a real good job all day. They gave me a great shot at it there with the call at the end to take tires. I can’t believe we won here. This means so much to all of us. It’s just real emotional.” \"That means so much to Hendrick Motorsports,\" Gordon said. \"That's the best way you can possibly pay tribute to those that we lost 10 years ago. To have a 1-2 finish, that's pretty awesome. I would have loved to have gotten that win to move on to Homestead, but this is certainly a great start for us.\" \"I thought we had the car to beat,\" Gordon said. \"Those last couple of laps were just wild. This means so much to Hendrick Motorsports. It's the best way to pay tribute to everyone we lost 10 years ago. I would have loved to get that win to move on to Homestead. But I'm real happy for Dale. I know this means so much to him.\" \"We struggled a little bit with the balance all day long, being really, really tight, like really, really tight,\" said Ryan Newman. \"The guys did a good job of adjusting it. Kept getting it better and better. Still never really got it right. But the strategy of two tires there at the end worked out good for us. Right number of laps with the guys that stayed out, kept the guys behind us that had four tires.\" \"I'm really surprised that we made it to the end without another caution,\" he continued. \"The guys that were out front there with no tires, it was really just a replay. At least had the anticipation of it to be a replay of the race I won when I took tires a few years ago. We were fortunate to make it up from eighth to third there. Had a pretty good restart. Got down to the bottom when I needed to. Those guys were kind of all jumbled up. I got into the back of Clint (Bowyer) a little bit there. I apologize to him. But I had the 22 (Joey Logano) pushing me all the way through the corner. I don't know there was a whole lot I could have done any different. In the end it was a crazy restart at Martinsville, which we all expected.\"\n\nParagraph 15: On June 22, 2006, Duncan unexpectedly dropped out of the race citing a diagnosis of clinical depression. During the brief announcement of his withdrawal, he said that he had at first thought he was simply experiencing physical and mental fatigue associated with campaigning, but that the symptoms had progressed beyond simple fatigue, and sought medical treatment which resulted in the depression diagnosis. He cited a family history of the disease as a factor in the diagnosis, and a number of aides and political associates were quoted in the press saying that Duncan was noticeably unhappy in the period leading up to his withdrawal. During his withdrawal announcement, Duncan endorsed his Democratic primary opponent, Martin O'Malley, in the latter's race against incumbent Republican Governor Robert Ehrlich. At the time of the announcement, polls showed Duncan closing in on O'Malley even as his fundraising was beginning to decline. This weakness in fundraising had led to speculation that Duncan would drop out during the summer, even before the announcement of the depression diagnosis. Reports at the time suggested that his dropping out would have a significant effect on state politics, making it easier for O'Malley to unseat Ehrlich and lowering turnout in the Democratic primary, thereby affecting down ballot races as well. O'Malley won the election and became governor.\n\nParagraph 16: Vickers pioneered the use of common rail injection in submarine engines. Vickers engines with the common rail fuel system were first used in 1916 in the G-class submarines. It used four plunger pumps to deliver a pressure up to  every 90° of rotation to keep the fuel pressure adequately constant in the rail. Fuel delivery to individual cylinders could be shut off by valves in the injector lines. Doxford Engines used a common rail system in their opposed-piston marine engines from 1921 to 1980, where a multicylinder reciprocating fuel pump generated a pressure around , with the fuel being stored in accumulator bottles.  Pressure control was achieved by an adjustable pump discharge stroke and a \"spill valve\".  Camshaft-operated mechanical timing valves were used to supply the spring-loaded Brice/CAV/Lucas injectors, which injected through the side of the cylinder into the chamber formed between the pistons. Early engines had a pair of timing cams, one for ahead running and one for astern. Later engines had two injectors per cylinder, and the final series of constant-pressure turbocharged engines was fitted with four injectors per cylinder. This system was used for the injection of both diesel and heavy fuel oil (600cSt heated to a temperature near 130 °C).\n\nParagraph 17: Undine joined the Mississippi Squadron and, in May 1864, was deployed in the Mississippi River between Fort Adams and Natchez, Mississippi. She soon left the Mississippi and operated during early July in the Tennessee River in support of Union forces ashore. While standing off Clifton, Tennessee, Undine, Acting Master John L. Bryant in command, struck a snag and partially sank on 25 July. Her crew was able to transfer the ship's guns ashore to defend Clifton from Confederate attack before taking measures to raise the vessel. Undine was successfully refloated on 1 August after the arrival of the pump steamer Little Champion on 31 July.\n\nParagraph 18: All India Federation of Trade Unions, a central trade union federation in India. AIFTU was launched in 1992, as the trade union wing of Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) Janashakti. Following the breakdown of CPI (ML) Janashakti into various splinter groups and the withdrawal of many of them from open mass work, AIFTU declined. An attempt to reorganization was made, and the federation has been reconstructed under the leadership of the president P. K. Murthy and general secretary Burgula Pradeep, who had been elected by the 1992 founding conference. This AIFTU is today not affiliated with any specific political party. There are also some minor splinter groups using the name.\n\nParagraph 19: The Turkish company Gökis Getränkegroßhandel became a new shirt sponsor for the 2007–08 season. The sponsorship contract was worth 25,000 Euros. The manager of Gökis Getränkegroßhandel Gökhan Kazan had regularly been to the stadium and was now a member of the club's Economic Council. BFC Dynamo recruited midfielder Sebastian Ilic from Reinickendorfer Füchse as well as forward Christian Rauch and midfielder Max Gerhard from Ludwigsfelder FC. The Chairman of the Economic Council Peter Meyer wanted to rehabilitate the club. BFC Dynamo played a friendly match against Hertha BSC at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark on 31 July 2007. The match was played under the motto \"Against violence and racism\". A banner on the pitch displayed the motto. A comprehensive security concept  hade been developed for the match. Meyer stated that the club did not want people who cannot follow the rules and that anyone who shouts Nazi slogans will be thrown out of the stadium. The first half of the 2007-08 NOFV-Oberliga Nord was quite successful. The team had been undefeated in 11 consecutive league matches before the last matchday of the first half of the season. One loss to SV Yeşilyurt had been uncounted for because SV Yeşilyurt had withdrawn from the league due to financial problems and plans for a merger with Berliner AK 07. About 1,200 supporters of BFC Dynamo traveled to Rostock to support the team in the last matchday before the winter break against FC Hansa Rostock II on 8 December 2008. The match ended in a 1–1 draw. BFC Dynamo had only suffered one loss during the first half of the season and was in third place in the league before the winter break. The contract with coach Uluc was extended to 2011. The second half of the season began with three losses. BFC Dynamo had slipped down to a seventh place in the league after the 18th matchday. BFC Dynamo played a 1–1 draw at home against second-placed Türkiyemspor Berlin in the 19th matchday on 16 March 2008. The team then defeated local rival Tennis Borussia Berlin 2–1 at home in the 20th matchday on 29 March 2008. Robert Rudwaleit and Benjamin Griesert scored one goal each in the match. BFC Dynamo eventually finished 2007-08 NOFV-Oberliga in fifth place. Jörn Lenz retired and Dennis Kutrieb left for Ludwigsfelder FC after the season. Lenz had played a total of 374 matches in BFC Dynamo since 1988, according to club statistics. He had been a key player in the team since the late 1990s, with the exception of a break at VfB Leipzig, and would continue in the club as team manager.\n\nParagraph 20: Also for reasons of historical verisimilitude, factions, provinces on the campaign map and factions' family members have been given vernacular names in Europa Barbarorum, rather than having Latinised or Anglicised ones, as in Rome: Total War. So, for instance, the original game's Armenia faction is known as Hayasdan in Europa Barbarorum, and Germania as the Sweboz. Instead of having to play one's first campaign as a Roman faction and only subsequently unlock playable campaigns as non-Romans by defeating them in the Roman campaign, all twenty of Europa Barbarorums playable factions can be accessed by the player from the start. Furthermore, the one unplayable and three playable Roman factions of the original have been combined into a single playable faction in Europa Barbarorum, the Romani. Dissatisfied with the homogeneity of the factions of the original Rome: Total War, the Europa Barbarorum development team have sought to differentiate the playing experiences of the game's different factions. So, for example, Rome: Total Wars trait-acquisition system, where the player's faction's family members acquire certain characteristics and talents which make them more or less adept at certain tasks such as city management or military leadership, has been made more faction-specific in Europa Barbarorum, with Hellenic characters' traits, for instance, being based on Theophrastos' Characters and Aristotle's teachings on the Golden Mean, and Romans' traits being partially based on the moral tales of Valerius Maximus. There are sometimes additional requirements for a family member to be able to gain a new trait: in order for them to compete in one of the Panhellenic Games, for instance, the player must ensure that they are stationed in the appropriate city on the campaign map in the year that the competition is scheduled to take place. One reviewer has commented that Europa Barbarorums expansions upon the original Rome: Total Wars trait system have served to add a role-playing element to the game.\n\nParagraph 21: Vice President João Goulart from PTB (at that time, Brazilians would vote for president and Vice President separately) then took office. As soon as 1962, some elements of UDN began to conspire with military officers to topple him. A political protégé of Vargas, Goulart launched a Basic Reforms plan, predicting education reform, land reform, urban reform, electoral reform and tax reform. That was labelled by UDN as a Soviet influence on Brazilian politics. Goulart's reforms alienated some members of the moderate PSD, leading to withdraw of its support to the Goulart government in the National Congress, thus leaving the President in a complicated situation. In April 1964, Goulart was deposed by a US-backed military coup d'état, which had the support of many UDN members. Lacerda, then governor of the Guanabara State, hoped to win the scheduled presidential election of 1965. However, the military regime cancelled this election and suppressed all the political parties, including UDN, during the creation of the Institutional Act Number 2, leading to the creation of the Frente Ampla (Broad Front), a short-lived and ill-fated political movement compromising of Carlos Lacerda himself and former rivals then-deposed President João Goulart and former President Juscelino Kubitschek. The makeshift alliance aimed at the re-establishment of democratic elections in Brazil and the deposition of the recently installed Military Regime. By then, however, many of UDN's members and Lacerda's coreligionists had already joined the National Renewal Alliance Party (Aliança Renovadora Nacional – Arena), a new party created to endorse and support the military regime, along with some members of Goulart's and Kubitschek's parties, dooming the movement to effective extinction after the creation of Institutional Act Number Five, the forced exile of many of its supporters and the establishment of the newly created Brazilian Democratic Movement (Movimento Democrático Brasileiro - MDB) as the official and legal opposition to the regime, which counted with little but existent participation of some elements in the former UDN.\n\nParagraph 22: CR 549 begins at an intersection with Route 166 and the southern terminus of CR 527 in Toms River, Ocean County, heading east on four-lane undivided Water Street. The road runs through the commercial downtown of Toms River a short distance to the north of the Toms River. The route turns north onto Hooper Avenue, which passes through more of the downtown area before heading into residential areas and narrowing to two lanes. Upon crossing Route 37, CR 549 becomes a six-lane divided highway with jughandles that passes through commercial areas, narrowing to four lanes. The road heads to the west of the Seacourt Pavilion shopping center and intersects CR 571 at an at-grade cloverleaf interchange. Following this, the roadway passes to the west of the Ocean County Mall, widening to six lanes again. The road narrows back to four lanes at the CR 94 intersection as it passes more shopping centers, turning more to the northeast. CR 549 enters wooded areas as it passes an entrance to Ocean County College and comes to an intersection with the northern terminus of the southern CR 549 Spur. Past this intersection, the route makes a turn to the north again and enters more commercial areas, crossing CR 620 before entering Brick Township. Here, CR 549 becomes Brick Boulevard and intersects CR 631 before continuing past more development with three northbound lanes and two southbound lanes. After the CR 66 junction, the road carries two lanes in each direction as it reaches intersections with CR 624 and CR 528, turning more to the northeast. CR 549 comes to an intersection with CR 631, at which point CR 549 splits from Brick Boulevard by heading northwest on Chambers Bridge Road, with CR 631 continuing north on Brick Boulevard. The four-lane undivided road passes shopping centers and crosses Route 70. After this intersection, CR 549 widens into a four-lane divided highway again and passes more businesses, turning into an undivided road again as it comes to a partial interchange with the Garden State Parkway that has access to and from the southbound direction of the parkway.\n\nParagraph 23: A collection of artifacts related to the battle is present in the state museum Kulikovo Polye, and a significant amount of finds is open to the public in other Russian museums. The first relics were discovered on the Kulikovo field in the late 17th and early 18th centuries, though their fate is hitherto unknown; fragments of weapons were reported to have been frequently discovered by 18th-century peasants during plowing, and it is known that at the time some of the finds were collected by economist Vasily Lyovshin, who had a personal interest in the history of the battle. A large number of antiquities were discovered in the 19th century and their relatively large number led to the publication of the first catalogue of Kulikovo artifacts by Ivan Sakharov, Secretary of the Department of Russian and Slavic Archaeology of the Imperial Russian Archaeological Society. Historian Stepan Nechayev noted in his writings that during their agricultural operations local peasants discovered old weapons, crosses, chainmails, and used to find human bones before; some of those finds were purchased by him, and their description appeared on the pages of Vestnik Evropy. In 1825, it was reported by a famous Russian adventurer that the \"precious things\" from the field, once numerous, were \"scattered across Russia\" and formed private collections, such as those of Nechayev, Countess Bobrinskaya and other noble persons. The fate of these collections is not always clear and not all of them have been preserved to this day; General Governor Alexander Balashov and educator  pointed to the fact that in their time iron objects were often collected, melted down by peasants and used for their purposes. One of such cases occurred recently, in 2009, when a Persian blade dug out from the field was discovered in the house of a local family and transferred to the Kulikovo field museum. After visiting the field and the village of Monastyrschina, Tikhomirov noted that \"swords, axes, arrows, spears, crosses, coins and other similar things\" that were of value were frequently found there and owned by private persons. Numerous fragments of weapons, crosses and armour were also noted by the famous 19th-century Tula historian , who suggested building a museum for these artifacts. Some of the finds are known to have been sent as gifts to government officials and members of the Imperial family; in 1839 and 1843, the head of a mace and the blade of a sword were gifted to Emperor Nicholas I by a Kulikovo nobleman. While preparing his work \"Parishes and Churches of the Tula Diocese\" (1895), editor Pavel Malitsky received reports from inhabitants of the Tula Oblast, who had found spearheads, poleaxes and crosses on the field. Spears and arrows dug out by the locals are also mentioned in the worksheets of the Tula provincial academic archival commission. Many artifacts were collected by noble families that owned Kulikovo, such the Oltufyevs, the Safonovs, the Nechayevs and the Chebyshevs, whose rich collections were still remembered by local citizens in the 1920–1930s. Their estates were situated around the village of Monastyrschina, close to the site of the battle, but during the Civil War most of their collections were lost and only a significant part of the Nechayevs’ collection survived the revolutionary period, whereas the extensive use of agricultural machinery in the field contributed to a loss of remaining artifacts. A number of antiquities, however, were found and transferred to museums in the late 20th and early 21st centuries.\n\nParagraph 24: Hewitt began his career in the North West of England, playing with his brother Nick in Misadventure, before leaving in 1988 to join The Mystic Deckchairs. Two of The Mystic Deckchairs' tracks, \"For The Day\" and \"Keep Your Head On\", appeared on the 1989 compilation LP Drunk released by Emergency Records. Hewitt joined fellow local musician Tim Burgess in Electric Crayons, prior to Burgess joining The Charlatans in 1989. Hewitt also joined Breed at the age of 17 and linked up with the band for a German tour after spying an advert placed by the band in Affleck's Palace. Following the completion of the tour, Hewitt joined The Boo Radleys on a temporary basis and played on the band's 1990 debut album, Ichabod and I. Hewitt rejoined Breed in 1991 and played on the albums Grin in 1991 and Violet Sentimental in 1993. Despite a support slot on Nick Cave's Let Love In tour, Breed found commercial success elusive and following a disastrous gig at the Bull & Gate in London in 1996, the band split. While in Breed, Hewitt also played for house act K-Klass. The need for money during these years saw Hewitt take on session work in London, recording jingles and appearing on releases by Baby June and Sharkboy. On 6 December 2004, Breed reformed for a one-off gig at Lock 17 in Camden Lock Market, London.", "answers": ["Paragraph 22"], "length": 7254, "dataset": "passage_retrieval_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "8e14dccc08e40bb309d48d155645f1cc5252d94a6c90041d"}

He was the  ninth son of Nani Amma of \"Karatt\" family and Kunhikrishna Menon of Kunnath Ravunnyarath at Vallengi. He had nine brothers and one sister. In  his childhood, Brahmananda Sivayogi was called Govindankutty. His mother was a devout Nair lady who strictly followed the tenets of religion. He lived with his mother in her house as per the existing custom of matrilineal families. His parents and other family members naturally influenced him towards conservatism. Govindankutty accepted all  the traditional life of a Nair boy. He visited temples, worshipped individual Gods, involved in prayers, offerings and other religious customs. He was sent to a nearby school, the Kollankode Board Elementary School. Several changes had occurred in the field of education in Kerala during this time. But majority were unaware of the importance of English education. Sanskrit scholars were respected everywhere. The students usually had gone to the residence of Sanskrit scholars to master the language. The well-known scholar Padmanabha Sastri was the Sanskrit Guru who gave guidance to Govindankutty. His father Kunhikrishna Menon sent his son to Koodalloor Sastrikal for higher course in Sanskrit. He studied grammar, poetry and poetics from his guru. His grasping power was extraordinary. He had expressed his poetic genius during this time. By this time he became well versed in Hindu scriptures  and Tamil language. There was nothing spectacular or any sign of his later beliefs of rationalism or atheism in his early life or childhood.\n\nParagraph 2: ...I found a gathering of thirty to forty people, men and women, in a well-furnished hall lined with French paper. As these were relatives and close friends, there was no luxury in attire. The women were dressed simply and decently; most of the young men wore tails and white pants. They danced waltzes, contradances, and Spanish dances; some of the ladies played the piano, others sang beautifully accompanied by guitar, and the soiree ended with ballroom games. I found different manners in all the people of the society. The ladies talked to the men without embarrassment; the men surrounded them with kindness, but they did not show any concern or desire to please, a quality, by the way, that is almost exclusive to the French. Since I have been in Brazil I have not seen a similar gathering. In the countryside, as I have said hundreds of times, women hide themselves away; they are the first slaves of the house, and the men have no idea of the pleasures that can be enjoyed with decency. Among the ladies, whom I saw at Mr. Patricio's house, there were some beautiful ones, mostly very white, with dark brown hair and black eyes; some were graceful, but without that vivacity that characterizes French women. The men, generally very light in color and with hair and eyes the same color as the women's, were large and well made, resourceful, but without the gentleness that characterizes the miners.On April 26, 1821 the first public manifestation of political contestation broke out in the city, when the Chamber, disobeying the determinations of the Portuguese Constitution that had been sworn by the Regent Prince Dom Pedro, elected a ministerial board, which governed from February 22 to March 8, 1822. On April 14 of this year, by decree of D. Pedro I, the town became a city. Two years later the first German immigrants arrived in the city, as part of the Crown's project to promote colonization in the south, and to help in the local agriculture. They were received with honors in the capital and soon were provided with equipment to start their farms, along with lots of land in the Real Feitoria do Linho Cânhamo, which had been deactivated, although some remained near the urban area, giving rise to the neighborhood of Navegantes. In 1831, new city limits were established through the publication of the first Municipal Ordinances, dealing in particular with the urban police. Arsène Isabelle, visiting the city between 1833 and 1834, reported that there were already five churches, but only two elementary school. On the other hand, several newspapers circulated, and he noted the influence of French culture and the political division between the monarchists and the farroupilhas, who defended a republican government project.\n\nParagraph 3: On January 4, 2010, at Wrestle Kingdom IV in Tokyo Dome, Takashi Sugiura successfully defended his GHC Heavyweight Championship against Goto. In March, Goto defeated Yujiro Takahashi, Masato Tanaka and Togi Makabe to win the 2010 New Japan Cup for the second year in a row. Goto went on to challenge the IWGP Heavyweight Champion Shinsuke Nakamura on April 4, but would once again fail in his attempt to win the title. On June 28, 2010, Goto, teaming up with Prince Devitt and Ryusuke Taguchi entered the J Sports Crown Openweight 6 Man Tag Tournament. Two days later the trio defeated Hiroshi Tanahashi, Tajiri and Kushida in the finals to win the tournament. During August's G1 Climax Goto debuted a new finishing maneuver, a cross-legged cradle, which he initially titled as Goto Special but was later renamed Goto-Shiki Hold (Goto Style Hold), has earned him pinfall victories over former IWGP Heavyweight Champions Yuji Nagata and Shinsuke Nakamura, but a loss to eventual G1 winner Satoshi Kojima on the final day of the tournament dropped him fourth in his block, narrowly missing the finals. On October 11 Goto defeated Shinsuke Nakamura to earn the right to challenge for the IWGP Heavyweight Championship. However, the reigning IWGP Heavyweight Champion Satoshi Kojima vetoed the result of the match and named Nakamura his first challenger for the belt. On December 11, while Kojima successfully defended his title against Nakamura, Goto was derailed from his quest to win the IWGP Heavyweight Championship with a loss against Hiroshi Tanahashi. The following day Kojima defeated Goto in a non–title match, ending Goto's dream of main eventing Wrestle Kingdom V in Tokyo Dome. Instead, Goto teamed with the returning Kazuchika Okada in a tag team match, where they were defeated by Pro Wrestling Noah representatives Yoshihiro Takayama and Takashi Sugiura. On March 6 Goto began his quest to win his third New Japan Cup in a row, but was defeated in the first round by Shinsuke Nakamura. On March 20, the final day of the tournament, Goto turned heel by abandoning IWGP Heavyweight Champion Hiroshi Tanahashi during a tag team match against Satoshi Kojima and MVP. This marked Goto's final appearance for New Japan, before leaving for his second excursion to Mexico.\n\nParagraph 4: Later in 644, when Emperor Taizong launched a major attack against Goguryeo, he had the generals Li Shiji and Li Daozong lead the forward forces, while commanding the main forces himself, assisted by Zhangsun, Cen, and Yang Shidao.  In summer 645, at a major battle against the main Goguryeo forces commanded by the generals Go Yeonsu () and Go Hyezin () engaged Tang forces, Emperor Taizong had Li Shiji command 15,000 men to serve as decoy, and when Goguryeo forces attacked Li Shiji, Zhangsun Wuji attacked them from behind with 11,000 men, and Li Shiji and Zhangsun, as well as Emperor Taizong himself, defeated Goguryeo forces, forcing their surrender. He then considered directly attacking Goguryeo's capital Pyongyang itself, but Li Shiji believed that if Ansi (, in modern Anshan, Liaoning) was not captured first, the general in command of Ansi (a capable general known in Korean popular legends as Yang Manchun, although whether that was his real name is unknown), might attack Tang forces from the rear.  Emperor Taizong agreed, and therefore put Ansi under siege again. However, the commander at Ansi was a capable defender, and the resolve of the defenders was strengthened when Li Shiji, in anger, declared that after the fall of the city all residents would be slaughtered.  With the Tang forces bogged down in sieging Ansi, a number of officials suggested skipping past Ansi and attacking Ogol (, in modern Dandong, Liaoning) and then head toward Pyongyang.  Zhangsun opposed, believing the strategy to be too risky without first capturing Ansi and Geonan (, in modern Yingkou, Liaoning) first.  Emperor Taizong agreed and continued sieging Ansi, but still could not capture it.  In fall 645, with winter approaching, Emperor Taizong was forced to withdraw.  (The Song Dynasty historian Hu Sanxing, the commentator to the Zizhi Tongjian, commented that overcautiousness was what cost Emperor Taizong the victory, indirectly blaming Zhangsun for opposing the strategy to attack Pyongyang directly.)  As the army retreated, Zhangsun was responsible for building a temporary bridge over the Liao River to allow the army to cross.\n\nParagraph 5: \"Remember the Time\" was generally well received by contemporary music critics. Chris Lacy from Albumism noted that \"the warmth and nostalgia\" of the song \"harkens back to Jackson's Motown roots\". Stephen Thomas Erlewine, a writer for AllMusic, commented that Dangerous had \"plenty\" of \"professional craftsmanship at its peak\" because of \"such fine singles\" like \"In the Closet\" and \"Remember the Time\". Erlewine also listed it as being a highlight from the album. Larry Flick from Billboard said the song \"shows the King of Pop downplaying his signature whoops and shrieks in favor a decidedly soulful and affecting vocal performance. Insinuating new-jack grooves work well, encasing an immediately memorable hook.\" A reviewer from Cashbox noted, \"This smooth dance ballad sounds like it could have come from the Off The Wall album and has more of the mouth noise, whoops and hollers that we guess will take Mr. Jackson several more albums to out-grow.\" Pan-European magazine Music & Media wrote that it is a \"danceable multi-format smash, dedicated to his mentor Diana Ross.\" Jon Parales of The New York Times commented that \"titles like 'Remember the Time', 'She Drives Me Wild' and 'Give in to Me'\" tell the lyrics' \"whole story - though they don't suggest the wretched tone he has when he sings them.\" A writer from People Magazine said that \"the strength of this record stems from bouncy, up-tempo pop\" like \"Remember the Time\". Alan Light, a writer for Rolling Stone, stated that he felt it was the \"most lighthearted musical track on the album\" and described the song's lyrics as telling of a \"blissful romance only to ask, 'So why did it end?'\" Richard Harrington, a writer for The Washington Post, described \"Remember the Time\" as being \"wistful,\" commenting that he felt that the song featured Jackson's \"least affected vocal performance\" but that it \"builds an engaging, radio-friendly momentum\".\n\nParagraph 6: These comics were separate from the continuity of the regular comics featuring the characters. Hanna Barbera also produced two animated television series (a refreshing of the venerable Super Friends concept), called Super Friends: The Legendary Super Powers Show and The Super Powers Team: Galactic Guardians. Warner Home Video used the opportunity to issue episodes of Superman, Batman, Superboy, and Aquaman produced by Filmation in 1966 on VHS and Betamax video cassette in 1985 under the Super Powers label (and also as part of the 50th anniversary celebrations of their sister company DC Comics), reissuing them again on VHS in 1996 (and were still available into the early 2000s until the end of the VHS format). Other tie-in products were produced, including lunchboxes, 3-D puffy stickers, party supplies, paintable figurines, Underoos, coloring and activity books (Secret of the Frozen City, Superman, Lex Luthor, The Joker, Batman, The Penguin, Wonder Woman, Villains, Superman and Batman, and Superman and the Super Powers), The Super Powers Anti-Coloring Book by Susan Striker, Stain-A-Sticker, Justice League of America Skyscraper Caper game, sunglasses, playhouses, belt buckles, sneakers, signature stamp sets, coloring play mats, drinking glasses/tumblers, model kits, soap, stain painting sets, calendars, Play-Doh sets, cube game, jointed wall figures, wrist watches, jigsaw puzzles (Jaymar and Craftmaster), Give-A-Show projectors, backpacks, gym bags, Valentine's Day paraphernalia, kites, pajamas, card games, sticker albums, sleeping bags, wall cling decorations, inflatable punching bop bags, bed sheets, clothes, windsocks, greeting cards, View-Master theatre sets, nut and fruit mix, sidewalk artist sets, temporary tattoos, SunShiners, galoshes, Nerf wrist flyers, duffel bags, lip balm, slippers, crayon sets, planners, school supplies, belts, baseball caps, flashlights, bumper stickers, pins, jewelry, embroidered patches, and posters. Kenner offered several mail-in promotions including a flexible vinyl record called The Darkseid Saga, child-size Superman plastic cape, and an 18\" by 24 \" color poster.\n\nParagraph 7: The NROOGD Tradition of the Craft originated in 1967 with a group of friends (including e.l.f. Silverlocke, Glen Turner, Judy Greenwood, and Aidan Kelly). e.l.f. Silverlocke was taking a class at San Francisco State College, which gave her the assignment of creating and leading a ritual. She came up with the idea of recreating a Witches' Sabbath, using published sources from Robert Graves, Margaret Murray and Gerald Gardner, a ritual was composed that has served as the basis of NROOGD practice ever since. After repeat performances of this rite yielded results on a number of occasions, a decision was made to create a group identity and train others in its performance.\n\nParagraph 8: The way Ned Flanders prepares the cocktails at the party is similar to actor Tom Cruise's bartending stunts in the 1988 film Cocktail. Songs heard at the party include Tom Jones's \"It's Not Unusual\" (1965), Dusty Springfield's \"The Look of Love\" (1967), KC and the Sunshine Band's \"That's the Way (I Like It)\" (1975), and Glen Campbell's \"Wichita Lineman\" (1968). Homer's false memory of the party the following day (in which he imagines himself as being erudite and witty instead of drunk) is a reference to the Algonquin Round Table, a group of New York City writers, critics, actors, and wits. The animation style and color scheme matches a typical cover of The New Yorker featuring the magazine's Eustace Tilley character. The \"Mexican Hat Dance\" song is heard when Marge turns on the radio in the car to mute the conversation between herself and Homer so the children cannot hear them fight. When Homer comes into the church late, while looking for his chair, a character who strikes a resemblance to Adolf Hitler is seen. In a flashback sequence, Bart remembers chasing away a screaming babysitter with the car as a toddler. This sequence and the music in it are references to a scene in the 1976 film The Omen, in which the Devil's child Damien makes animals shriek in terror as Damien approaches. The picture of General Sherman at the bait shop is a reference to the famous hoax picture of the Loch Ness Monster. John and Gloria are a reference to George and Martha from Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? Homer's attempt at catching General Sherman, his bludgeoning of the fish and the line \"I love you but I have to kill you\" are all based on Santiago's fight with the marlin in Ernest Hemingway's novel The Old Man and the Sea. The battle between Homer and General Sherman is also reminiscent of Captain Ahab's battle with the white whale Moby-Dick in the novel Moby-Dick.\n\nParagraph 9: Prior to the creation of the Kingdom of Italy, the Heraldic Court of Milan (the legal body empowered to decide on matters regarding titles of nobility) awarded and registered the term nobile as a title of nobility, until Napoléon's army overran the Austrian Habsburg-controlled Duchy of Milan in 1796. When such a title was granted, the coat of arms of the new “nobile” was entered into the Book of Coat of Arms of Maria Teresa of Austria (subsequently kept at the State Archives of Milan {ASMi}), along with a painting of the arms concerned. The records of such grants and the depictions of their corresponding arms show that, at that period, the title of nobile did not include a corresponding coronet of rank.\n\nParagraph 10: Bart unsuccessfully seeks advice from Homer on dating. He then shows Lisa a hologram of the prom, and tells her love can be painful; she agrees, noting she broke up with Milhouse and he had an Incredible Hulk-style meltdown. Lisa suggests that to get Jenda back, he must show her he can provide for her. Bart decides to take Lisa's advice and gets a job at the Kwik-E-Mart. While delivering groceries to Mr. Burns, he rescues him from a robbery by Snake Jailbird. As a reward, Burns gives Lisa's scholarship to Bart. He accepts it, seeing it as a way to get Jenda back. He then tells Lisa about the scholarship causing present and future Lisa to both get angry at Bart. Bart reconciles with Jenda, and now has a good future. That night, Jenda again wants to have sex with Bart, but then he goes into Professor Frink's basement and sees Lisa's bleak future with Milhouse on Frink's machine. Jenda is furious at Bart (she notes she never had any problems sparking romance with Todd Flanders), and gives him an ultimatum: leave and they are finished. Bart does head out and saves Lisa from accepting Milhouse's dismal proposal, then tells his sister he is giving her scholarship back and will find a woman who loves him for himself. Professor Frink then tells present Bart he will get one at age 83, then die one minute later, and his brain would be buried in a pauper's grave.\n\nParagraph 11: While the mounted troops pursued the beaten enemy, 74th (Y) Division paused and re-equipped with winter clothing for the next phase of the campaign. By 25 November the division was about four days' march behind the fighting line, but it was brought up for the advance into the Judaean Hills towards Jerusalem. The Turks launched strong counter-attacks on 27 and 28 November, and 74th (Y) Division began arriving to reinforce the position on 29 November, 231st Bde having marched 12 out of the previous 18 hours. Coming under 52nd (L) Division the brigade took over scattered positions from the remnants of 8th Mounted Brigade. 25th (Montgomery and Welsh Horse Yeomanry) Battalion, Royal Welch Fusiliers, of 231st Bde was ordered to advance through Et Tire and occupy a line from 'Point 1750' (which did not exist) to the village of Foqa (which 52nd (L) Divisional HQ did not realise had been abandoned the previous night). A company of 24th Welsh was sent up in support. After a gallant defence, 25th RWF was driven back out of Foqa and Et Tire. 24th Welsh was ordered to fill the gap between the presumed Point 1750 and the 10th (Shropshire & Cheshire Yeomanry) Bn King's Shropshire Light Infantry (KSLI), and then to recapture Et Tire in the morning. After a long night march on 30 November the battalion attacked and temporarily recaptured Et Tire next day, but was under enfilade fire and the position was untenable. 24th Welsh fell back to the high ground and began building a defensive line of stone sangars. 231st and 229th Bdes had difficulty forming a solid defensive front in the confused country. However, on 8 December the EEF launched its final attack on Jerusalem. 74th (Y) Division's surprise attack on a narrow front was supported by flanking fire from 231st Bde in the Nebi Samwil defences (confused by the fact that there were also Turkish machine guns concealed in the ruined village). Next day Jerusalem surrendered and the division was then engaged in road-making for most of the month while the EEF defended Jerusalem against Turkish counter-attacks. 74th (Y) Division resumed its advance on 27 December, 24th Welsh launching an attack on Hill 1910. They were driven off it before they could consolidate the position, but renewed the attack and held the hill after fierce hand-to-hand fighting. By 31 December the EEF had established a strong defence line covering Jerusalem. The division then went into reserve and resumed roadbuilding. The 24th Welsh remained guarding Jerusalem and Bethlehem while the rest of 231st Bde played a minor role in the capture of Jericho on 19–20 February 1918.\n\nParagraph 12: Starting in 1878, Cornell's Ithaca campus offered a pre-medical school curriculum, although most medical students enrolled in medical school directly after high school. In 1896, three New York City institutions, the University Medical College, the Loomis Laboratory and the Bellevue Hospital Medical College united with the goal of affiliating with New York University (NYU). Unfortunately, NYU imposed a number of surprising new policies including limiting faculty to what they would have otherwise earned in private practice. The faculty revolted in 1897 and sought the return of the property of the three former institutions, with a resulting lawsuit. On March 22, 1904 and April 5, 1904, the New York State Court of Appeals ordered NYU to return property to Loomis Laboratory because the NYU Dean had breached oral promises made to form the merger. Having won their separation from NYU, the medical faculties sought a new university affiliation, and on April 14, 1898, Cornell's Board of Trustees voted to create a medical school and elected former NYU professors as its dean and faculty. The school opened on October 4, 1898 in the Loomis Laboratory facilities. In 1900, a new campus on First Avenue on the Upper East Side of Manhattan opened which was donated by Oliver Hazard Payne. Cornell also began a program in the fall of 1898 to allow students to take their first two years of medical school in Ithaca, with Stimson Hall being constructed to house that program. The building opened in 1903. The M.D. degree program was open to both men and women, but women were required to study in Ithaca for their first two years. In 1908, Cornell was one of the early medical schools to require an undergraduate degree as a prerequisite to admission to the M.D. program. In 1913, Cornell's medical school affiliated with New York Hospital as its teaching hospital. Unlike the New York branch of the medical school which was well endowed, the Ithaca branch was subsidized by the University, and the Trustees reduced its scope to just first year students in 1910, and eventually phased it out.\n\nParagraph 13: Gary \"Gaz\" Wilkinson: Born in 1980, Gaz has two sisters (Julie and Tasha) and a half-brother, Munch. He works as a mechanic at Brindley Autos, originally owned by his father until it was sold to Donna. Gaz is a stereotypical \"blokey bloke\" who likes football (supporting Manchester City), and also beer, sex, Hollyoaks and Monarch of the Glen. He is an avid collector and user of pornography and has a phobia of sheep. In a late series 5 episode, Gaz and Donna plan to move to a house in Knowsley, but on a visit to check out the house he spots a sheep in the field and is too terrified to want to live there anymore. In the episode when Donna moves into Gaz's flat, she notices that he has some strange habits, such as only using bread from the middle of the loaf when making toast. His favourite books include The Lust of the Mohicans, Pleasure Island, Macbiff and The Count of Monte Cristo (although the cover doesn't actually say \"Count\"). He is the person responsible for splitting up Jonny and Kate, much to the happiness of Janet. At one point, he cheats on Donna by sleeping with Janet. This secret is kept quiet for a while, until he accidentally reveals his betrayal to Donna one night in bed. After this, he and Donna split up for a while, until they get back together after he is involved in a road accident. Gaz finds out he has a low sperm count after deciding to become a sperm donor because he feels broody; this supposedly proves that Jonny is Corinthian Keogh's father. He proposes to Donna numerous times throughout Series 6 before the two of them finally get engaged, and they eventually marry in Series 7. After the marriage ceremony, Louise finds out that Gaz is Corinthian's real father and, despite trying to keep it secret, informs him, to his delight; but she decides not to tell Janet, who is still dealing with the loss of Jonny. Gaz and Janet finally realise they belong together, and at the end of series 7, Donna leaves them to be together. In series 8, Donna returns and Gaz is happy with Janet, but cannot resist having sex with Donna for old times' sake; eventually, Janet and Donna give him an ultimatum to choose between them. Gaz decides that he loves Donna after all, and drives to her, crashing a car on the way. He wakes up in hospital, to find Donna at his bedside. This result was chosen by viewers in an online poll. In series 9, Gaz is in a wheelchair following the car accident, after a year-long coma. Throughout the next series Gaz struggles to come to terms with being disabled and tells Donna that he will walk again; with a little help from her he manages to take his first steps. In the final episode, Gaz turns 30 and realising he has never been outside Runcorn he decides to travel the world with Donna. She, however, finding out she may have cancer, tells Gaz she won't be coming with him, but doesn't tell him the reason. Gaz then says an emotional farewell to her at the airport before leaving to start his new life. Janet is currently unaware that Gaz is the father of her son, due to Jonny taking a paternity test before he died, but Gaz has previously tried to tell Janet this, however; realising it may upset her, Gaz decides to keep the paternity of Corinthian from Janet.\n\nParagraph 14: The most recent summer event was the 2019 Summer Universiade in Naples, Italy. The most recent winter event was the 2023 Winter World University Games held in Lake Placid, United States from 11–21 January 2023, after the 2021 edition scheduled to be held in Lucerne, Switzerland was cancelled due the COVID-19 pandemic. The 2021 Summer World University Games were scheduled to be held in Chengdu, China, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic has been postponed three times and will now be held in 2023, after the 2023 Summer World University Games, set to be held in Yekaterinburg, Russia, were postponed after the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. At this moment the 2023 Summer World University Games has the postponed status according to the official FISU website.\n\nParagraph 15: Pata prefers to change guitars on stage as little as possible. He uses four or five with X Japan due to their different tunings, but only about two for Ra:IN; one for regular tuning and one for drop tuning. Pata previously used D'Addario 011-049 strings, but found it difficult to bend the top string. While recording Art of Life (1993) in America, he happened to buy La Bella HRS-010-048 strings at a local music shop and has used them ever since. Similarly, he bought a Dunlop 0.73mm nylon guitar pick at the same time, and has used them ever since. Although he sometimes uses a slightly stiffer one for acoustic guitar. Pata uses two old Marshall guitar amplifiers, which originally did not have master volume knobs, but have been altered to have them. Because the bass tends to get \"muddy\" when using distortion, the older amp on top is used for the main melody, while the bottom amp is used to correct the bass. Pata uses minimal effects pedals. As of 2022, he had an MXR Phase 100 phaser, an MK.4.23 booster, a Free the Tone delay, and a Vox wah pedal. Toru Saito has been his guitar tech since X Japan's 1991 Violence in Jealousy Tour.\n\nParagraph 16: Its main church, to the invocation of Nossa Senhora da Apresentação (Our Lady of the Presentation) was raised on the ruins of an older priory and concluded in 1780. Similarly, the church of Nossa Senhora da Conceição, built on the orders of Captain Agostinho de Medeiros Costa, in the 17th century, and reconstructed and expanded in 1830. Although Capelas may not have been named for the religious sanctuaries that were erected there, there are many to speak of, including the chapels of Anjo da Guarda, Santa Rita, Nossa Senhora do Rosário and Nossa Senhora de Santana, as well as many smaller hermitages to the invocation of the Holy Spirit.\n\nParagraph 17: In 1927, the City of Madison purchased 290 acres of land for $35,380. Previously a cabbage patch for a nearby sauerkraut factory, the newly-acquired land would later become the present-day home of the Dane County Regional Airport. In January 1936, the city council voted to accept a Works Progress Administration grant for the construction of four runways and an airplane hangar. Additional grants financed the terminal and administrative building as well as electric floodlights. The development price tag was $1 million – 10% paid by the city and the remainder by the federal government (MSN Airport, 2012). In September 1938, Barnstormer Howard Morey of Chicago; Edgar Quinn; and J.J. McMannamy organized the Madison Airways Corporation.\n\nParagraph 18: Beginning in 2004, the USMLE program undertook a comprehensive review of the USMLE, referred to as the Comprehensive Review of USMLE (CRU). The review was overseen by the committee to Evaluate the USMLE Program (CEUP),  which was composed of students, residents, clinicians, and members of the licensing, graduate, and undergraduate education communities. The goal of the committee was to determine if the mission and purpose of USMLE were effectively and efficiently supported by the current design, structure, and format of the USMLE. This process was to be guided, in part, by an analysis of information gathered from stakeholders, and was to result in recommendations to USMLE governance. The CEUP worked from 2006 to early 2008.  The CEUP's final report states that \"none of the feedback (received from other stakeholders) seemed to indicate that USMLE is broken, but there was considerable interest in enhancing and improving the program.\" Additionally, the report states that \"there appeared to be very strong reactions to Step 2 CS, and CEUP felt that survey and stakeholder meeting data on this component needed to be interpreted in a special way by attempting to separate (but still be attentive to) issues related to the mechanics and costs of Step 2 CS versus the value of what the exam is intended to measure. On the issue of mechanics and costs, CEUP recognized that USMLE must be very attentive to the burden put on examinees by this testing format and that the impact on examinees must be considered when proposing future directions. Concerning the skills measured by Step 2 CS, there seemed to be legitimate concerns about content. Many people wanted to see the exam begin to assess whether the examinee can detect and interpret abnormal findings and handle challenging communication issues. There was a frequently expressed sentiment that this exam was ripe for enhancement and that many of the more advanced communication skills and other competencies could be assessed through this vehicle.\" In response to the feedback gathered, the CEUP recommended that \"the assessment of clinical skills remain a component of USMLE, but that USMLE consider ways to further enhance the testing methods currently used, in order to address additional skills im-portant to medical practice. It is also recommended that the administrative challenges and costs to examinees associated with related testing formats be given substantial weight in the consideration of future changes.\"\n\nParagraph 19: Lucille Wexler soon found out that her housekeeper Jennifer was the long lost Jane Marie Stafford, when she paid a visit to the Springfield Arms hotel and to Jane Marie's older brother, Chet Stafford. Lucille, who had continued to drive a wedge between Ben McFarren and her \"daughter\", Amanda and their new marriage (including trying to still kill Ben), became increasingly paranoid that someone would find out that Amanda wasn't her biological daughter but Jennifer and Alan's. After Lucille made anonymous threatening phone calls to Amanda, Lucille arrived home to find Jennifer playing the piano (Alan and Jane Marie's favorite song, Misty by Johnny Mathis) and tried to kill Jennifer, shouting, \"JANE MARIE!\". Jennifer quickly whirled around to find Lucille behind her about to stab her, and Jennifer started fighting with the older woman. When Amanda came home with Ross, Lucille had ended up stabbing herself, and on her deathbed Lucille falsely told Amanda that Jennifer had stabbed her in cold blood. When Mike defended Jennifer of murder charges, with Ross now District Attorney and out for blood, Jennifer wouldn't offer any defense. Jennifer also refused to meet with either Alan or Jane Marie's brother, Chet. In January 1981, after Derek (now working for Mike) investigated and found Alan's new private investigator in Chet's hotel room, Mike decided to put Jennifer on the witness stand in her own defense while Derek brought both Alan and Chet into the courtroom. In emotional scenes (interrupted by CBS News reports of the end of the Iran hostage crisis; the producers later showed these scenes due to the amount of phone calls into CBS's switchboard angry with the interruption), it was revealed that Amanda was the biological daughter of both Alan and Jennifer. Amanda suffered a miscarriage (of Ben's baby) due to the stress of finding out the truth (in 1997, in a major rewrite, Amanda learned that her father was Brandon Spaulding and Alan was her brother—a move that was unpopular with many long time viewers).\n\nParagraph 20: Davenport was born in  Pawnee City, Nebraska to John and Minnie Davenport. He came to Spokane from Nebraska at the age of 20 in March 1889. He first worked at a restaurant owned by his uncle Elijah, called the Pride of Spokane. It burned down in the great fire of August 1889 and Louis started his own business, called Davenport's Restaurant, three days after the fire with two tents and salvaged furniture. Soon his establishment was one of the most renowned restaurants in the Northwest. Over the years, many celebrities traveled to Spokane and dined at Davenport's, including President William Howard Taft in 1909. He added onto the establishment with more dining rooms, a larger kitchen, and more ballrooms. In 1906, his restaurant was popular enough to garner the following review in the national magazine The Philistine:  \"The best example of Spokane spirit, crystalized, is Davenport's restaurant... [it] is the best, the most unique and nearest perfect restaurant in America - perhaps the world.\" That same year a group of businessmen in Spokane had a vision to accommodate the vast number of travelers to the booming Spokane area with a large, grand hotel and asked Louis Davenport to build and oversee it. Davenport agreed and enlisted the aid of famed local architect Kirtland Cutter to design the hotel adjoining his restaurant. At an estimated cost of $2,000,000, the Davenport Hotel finally opened in August 1914. With its spacious Spanish Renaissance-styled main lobby, Isabella dining hall, Italian Gardens restaurant, Marie Antoinette Ballroom, and ornate Hall of Doges, the Davenport was widely considered one of America's grandest hotels and remained so for many years. Louis Davenport was very particular about his hotel and worked tirelessly the creation and management of his establishment, which was known for its excellent service and elegance at a reasonable rate.\n\nParagraph 21: Steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) occurred historically in Adobe Creek. The earliest report touted the trout in the Sportsman's Gazetteer in 1877. This very early report makes rumors that Adobe Creek's trout were introduced extremely unlikely since the first trout hatcheries in California did not propagate any trout until the 1870s, and much of their production was shipped to hatcheries out of state. A physical specimen was collected in 1893 by Wilbur Wilson Thoburn, Stanford University Professor of Bionomics, and is preserved in the California Academy of Sciences collection. In 1898 John Otterbein Snyder, ichthyologist and Stanford Professor of Zoology, also collected steelhead trout specimens in San Antonio Creek (now Adobe Creek). A 1909 land office brochure promoted Los Altos for its \"never-failing mountain trout stream, trout caught a few feet from kitchen doors\". The reaches upstream from Hidden Villa have been judged excellent trout spawning habitat. Josephine Duveneck wrote, \"Before the era of concrete, fish used to swim up to spawn and native trout lured many a small boy to seek out the deeper pools carrying his home-made fishing pole and can of worms.\" Local historian Florence Fava also reported that \"the creeks which lace the (Hidden Villa) property and join Adobe Creek were originally full of fish\". According to old-timer accounts, locations below Hidden Villa that held spawning steelhead included the large cement pieces downstream from the Foothill Junior College paint shop outflow and cut banks below Interstate 280, in the perennial reaches of Adobe Creek stretching downstream to just above Redwood Grove. A 27-inch steelhead trout (see main photo) caught by boys in June, 1956 about two blocks from Van Buren Avenue (now Van Buren Street) is the last historical record of this salmonid ascending Adobe Creek to spawn upstream of El Camino Real. Steelhead spawning runs were partially blocked by construction of the tidal gate in the Palo Alto Flood Basin at the mouth of Adobe Creek in 1957. This barrier was only partial, as according to the California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG), steelhead were caught by local fishermen during 1985, 1986 and 1987 in Mayfield Slough at the confluence of Matadero and Adobe Creeks; and at least six steelhead were noted passing the tidal gates at Mayfield Slough in the Palo Alto Flood Basin in April 1987. In 1959, steelhead trout spawning runs were completely blocked by another flood control project on Adobe Creek, when the Santa Clara Valley Water District transformed the natural stream channel into a concrete trapezoidal chute with eight foot drop and dysfunctional fish ladder below El Camino Real. The  long concrete trapezoidal channel structure from El Camino Real northward to Highway 101 stops fish with thin sheets of rapid horizontal flow during winter. Today there are additional upstream barriers to fish passage, including drop structures below the culverts under Interstate 280 and Foothill Expressway. Additional barriers occur at the O'Keefe Lane and Hidden Villa bridges, and the creek suffers from significant bank erosion, failing channel stabilization structures, and sedimentation. Finally, the trash rack at the tidal gate at the mouth of Mayfield Slough in the Palo Alto Flood Basin continues as an intermittent complete barrier to fish passage when it is closed.\n\nParagraph 22: In June 2018, MassDOT's North South Rail Link Feasibility Reassessment described the costs and benefits of several alternatives, including adding tunnels in various configurations or doing nothing. The tunnel options included a $21.5 billion four-track maximum-service plan and three double-track routes ranging in cost from $12.3 billion to $14.7 billion. (These costs are in 2028 dollars and include purchasing additional rolling stock, other required infrastructure improvements, and a 3.5% annual inflation.) The presentation noted that a planned expansion of South Station would cost an estimated $4.7 billion, not including the purchase of rolling stock, electrifying the system, and renovating Tower 1.", "answers": ["Paragraph 14"], "length": 6605, "dataset": "passage_retrieval_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "655a606b442004ce01f02fd3060d8d243c5659a44908178e"}
{"input": "In the third round of a soccer match, the teams were drawn without any seeding, allowing any team to face off against another. The team from the lower league was given the advantage of playing at home. Basel was drawn to play against Wil at the Stadion Bergholz. Basel's head coach gave some players a break, but a newly signed player, Philipp Degen, was on the bench. Basel started strong and took the lead in the 8th minute. They dominated the first half, but Wil stepped up in the second half. In the 60th minute, Basel's goalkeeper was sent off for a foul, and Wil was awarded a penalty. However, they failed to convert it. Wil managed to equalize in the 84th minute, sending the game into extra time. Basel's Philipp Degen made a comeback and scored a goal in the 111th minute. However, Basel's lead was short-lived as Wil equalized again. Basel took the lead once more in the 114th minute and held on to win the match 3-2. There was a scuffle in the final minute of the game, resulting in red cards for players from both teams.", "context": "Paragraph 1: On the September 4, 2006 episode of Raw, a series of vignettes began airing, hyping the debut of Cryme Tyme (Gaspard and The Neighborhoodie, with Neighborhoodie's ring name changing to JTG). On the October 16 episode of Raw, Cryme Tyme made their in-ring debut by defeating then-World Tag Team Champions The Spirit Squad (Mikey and Johnny) in a non-title match. The duo made their pay-per-view debut at Cyber Sunday, where Cryme Tyme defeated Lance Cade and Trevor Murdoch, Charlie Haas and Viscera and The Highlanders (Robbie McAllister and Rory McAllister) in a Texas Tornado match (as voted by the fans). A few months later at the New Year's Revolution pay-per-view, Cryme Tyme won a Tag Team Turmoil Match against The Highlanders, The World's Greatest Tag Team (Charlie Haas and Shelton Benjamin), Lance Cade and Trevor Murdoch, and Jim Duggan and Super Crazy, earning them a shot at the World Tag Team Championships. On April 1, 2007, at WrestleMania 23, Cryme Tyme made a cameo appearance and started a dance party with Eugene and some WWE legends in the backstage area. On the June 29 episode of SmackDown!, Deuce 'n Domino (with Cherry) defeated Cryme Tyme in an inter-brand match tag match. While Deuce, Domino and Cherry celebrated their victory, Cryme Tyme appeared on the titantron and kayfabe stole their car, taking it to Brisco Brothers Auto Shop to sell it for parts chanting \"Money, money, yeah, yeah\". In July, Cryme Tyme returned to OVW and regained the OVW Southern Tag Team Championship on July 21 from The James Boys (KC James and Kassidy James), becoming two-time tag team champions, but they lost the titles back to them the following day.\n\nParagraph 2: Provisions of the 1933 Banking Act that were later repealed or replaced include (1) Sections 5(c) and 19, which required an owner of more than 50% of a Federal Reserve System member bank's stock to receive a permit from (and submit to inspection by) the Federal Reserve Board to vote that stock (replaced by the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956); (2) Section 8, which established the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) made up of representatives from each of the 12 Federal Reserve Banks (revised by the Federal Reserve Board-dominated FOMC established by the Banking Act of 1935 and later amended in 1942); (3) Section 11(b), which prohibited interest payments on demand deposits (repealed by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 and allowing interest-bearing demand accounts beginning July 21, 2011) and authorized the Federal Reserve Board to limit interest rates on time deposits (phased out by the Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act of 1980 by 1986), both of which interest limitations were incorporated into Regulation Q,  and (4) Section 12, which prohibited Federal Reserve System member bank loans to their executive officers and required the repayment of outstanding loans (replaced by the 1935 Banking Act's regulation of such loans and modified by later legislation).\n\nParagraph 3: The plumbeous kite was formally described in 1788 by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in his revised and expanded edition of Carl Linnaeus's Systema Naturae. He placed it with the eagles, hawks and relatives in the genus Falco and coined the binomial name Falco plumbeus. Gmelin based his description on the \"spotted-tailed hawk\" that had been described in 1781 by the English ornithologist John Latham from a specimen from Cayenne in a private collection in London. It is now placed with the Mississippi kite in the genus Ictinia that was introduced in 1816 by the French ornithologist Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot. The genus name is from the Ancient Greek iktinos for a kite. The specific epithet plumbea is from Latin plumbeus meaning \"leaded\", \"plumbeous\" or \"lead-coloured\". The species is monotypic: no subspecies are recognised.\n\nParagraph 4: By September 1864, the Confederacy had essentially no chance of a military victory, and incumbent President of the United States Abraham Lincoln had an edge over George B. McClellan  who supported ending the war in the 1864 United States presidential election.  With the situation east of the Mississippi River collapsing, General Edmund Kirby Smith, commander of the Confederate Trans-Mississippi Department, was ordered to send his infantry across the river to more important areas of the war.  This movement proved to be impossible, as a large-scale crossing of the Mississippi was prevented by Union Navy control of the river.  Instead, Smith decided to attack the Union forces within his area of responsibility, despite having limited resources.  Confederate Major General Sterling Price and Thomas Caute Reynolds, who had replaced Jackson as the head of the Confederate government of Missouri in February 1863 after the latter's death, proposed an invasion of Missouri.  Smith approved of the plan and placed Price in command of the offensive. It was hoped that the invasion would start a popular uprising against Union control of the state, draw Union troops away from more important theaters of the war, and improve McClellan's chance of defeating Lincoln.\n\nParagraph 5: Panevėžys was first mentioned evidently on 7 September 1503 in documents signed by the Grand Duke Alexander Jagiellon, who granted the town building rights to construct a church and other structures. Alexander Jagiellon is considered as the founder of the city, which celebrated its 500th anniversary in 2003; two renowned monuments were built in the city for this anniversary, one of which is dedicated to Alexander Jagiellon. The city lies on the old plain of the river Nevėžis and the city name means \"along the Nevėžis.\" Panevėžys Mound with a flat top and 1.5 – 2 meters high embankments previously stood at the confluence of river Nevėžis and stream Sirupis (destroyed in the 19th – 20th centuries). Throughout the 16th century, the city maintained a status of a Royal town. Communities of Poles inhabit the area from the 13th century, and Karaites, settled in the area as early as the 14th century. A Karaite Kenesa, and a Polish Gymnasium, existed in Panevėžys until the Second World War (the Polish version of the name of the city was ). In the 16th century, the part of the city on the left bank of the river started to develop and expand further. In 1727, the Piarists, who moved to the western part of Panevėžys, built a Church of the Holy Trinity, established a monastery and a college. In 1791, Panevėžys was granted a conditional privilege to elect the city government.\n\nParagraph 6: Krishnam acted in Bantrotu Bharya, which marks the first collaboration of Krishnam Raju with Dasari Narayana Rao. Later he acted in the critically acclaimed film Krishnaveni opposite Vanisri, directed by V. Madhusudhana Rao. The film marks the debut of Krishnam Raju as a producer under his own production house Gopi Krishna Movies. Later he acted in Parivartana opposite Jamuna, Kanchana and Lakshmi and in Bharati opposite Jamuna, Iddaru Iddare and Yavvanam Katesindi. Later he acted in Bhakta Kannappa portraying the roles of Arjuna and Kannappa Nayanar directed by Bapu, which is the unique Telugu film to win the National Film Award for Best Audiography. Later he acted in Kurukshetram portraying the role of Karna, directed by Kamalakara Kameswara Rao. Later he acted in Amaradeepam, which marks the first collaboration of Krishnam Raju with K. Raghavendra Rao. The film earned him the Filmfare Best Actor Award (Telugu) and the Nandi Award for Best Actor for the year 1977. Later he acted in films such as Jeevana Teeralu, Manushulu Chesina Dongalu and Sati Savitri. Later he acted in the lavishly made Katakataala Rudraiah, which grossed , made on a budget of . Later he acted in Mana Voori Pandavulu, produced by him and Jaya Krishna. The film garnered the Filmfare Best Film Award (Telugu) for the year 1978 and Krishnam Raju shared the award with Jaya Krishna. Katakataala Rudraiah and Mana Voori Pandavulu were released within a gap of 10 days and both the films became blockbusters. Later he acted in films such as Ramabanam, Andadu Aagadu in which he acts in a role of a spy which is parallel to James Bond and the film became a smash hit. Later he acted in Rangoon Rowdy, Shri Vinayaka Vijayamu portraying the role of Lord Shiva.

Later he acted in Nijam Chebite Nerama!, Adavi Simhalu, Puli Bebbuli, Kotikokkadu and Dharmaatmudu.\n\nParagraph 7: Soups, often featuring egg noodles, are characteristic of the Pennsylvania Dutch. Pennsylvanian Dutch homes have traditionally had many broths on hand (vegetable, fish, poultry, and other meats) from the saving of any extra liquids available: \"The Pennsylvania Dutch developed soup making to such a high art that complete cookbooks could be written about their soups alone; there was an appropriate soup for every day of the year, including a variety of hot and cold fruit soups.\" Soups were traditionally divided into different categories, including Sippli or \"little soup\" (a light broth), Koppsupper or \"cup soups\", Suppe (thick, chowder soups, often served as a meal with bread), and G'schmorte (a soup with no broth, often like a Brieh (Brei) or gravy).\n\nParagraph 8: The liberation of histamine is a dose-dependent phenomenon such that, with increasing doses administered at the same rate, there is a greater propensity for eliciting histamine release and its ensuing sequelae. Most commonly, the histamine release following administration of these agents is associated with observable cutaneous flushing (facial face and arms, commonly), hypotension and a consequent reflex tachycardia. These sequelae are very transient effects: the total duration of the cardiovascular effects is no more than one to two minutes while the facial flush may take around 3–4 minutes to dissipate—(note: half-life of plasma histamine is ~2 minutes). Because these effects are so transient, there is no reason to administer adjunctive therapy to ameliorate either the cutaneous or cardiovascular effects. Thus, in the fierce battle to win market share for sales of the \"steroidal\" versus the terahydroisoquinolinium class of neuromuscular blocking agents, fact and information pertaining to adverse events were distorted to suit partisan taste, and, consequently, much misinformation was deliberately disseminated regarding histamine release and its effects: this was particularly so in the 1980s and 1990s shortly after the near simultaneous competitive clinical introduction of atracurium (Tracrium—a bis-benzyltetrahydroisoquinolinium (BBTHIQ) neuromuscular blocking agent marketed by Burroughs Wellcome Co., now subsumed into GlaxoSmithKline) and vecuronium (Norcuron—a steroidal neuromuscular blocking agent marketed by Organon, now subsumed into Merck & Co. Inc.). The most common misinformation seeded into the minds of anesthesiologists was the failure to categorically state that the cardiovascular effects following histamine release were transient: instead, the marketing focus was single-mindedly to regurgitate and emphasize that the tetrahydroisoquinolinium class elicited histamine release that could prove to be a danger to the cardiovascular stability of the patient during surgical procedures. There was complete failure to disseminate the true picture that these effects were not only transient but that the extent of the hypotensive effect and the reflex tachycardia were rarely of clinical significance and therefore did not require adjunctive therapy, as evidenced by the complete lack of any clinical literature advocating the need for adjunctive antihistamine use concomitantly with the administration of tetrahydroisoquinolinium neuromuscular blocking agents. Unfortunately, these ill-willed beguiling marketing notions have persisted through the decades and become ingrained with each successive generation of newly qualified anesthesiologists and CRNAs (certified registered nurse anesthetists) to the extent that the mere mention of \"benzylisoquinolines\" (the erroneous but commonly used class name for tetrahydroisoquinolinium neuromuscular blocking agents) immediately conjures images of histamine release, cardiovascular instability and generates unnecessary anxiety.\n\nParagraph 9: His first novel, The South, was published in 1990. The Blackwater Lightship was shortlisted for the Booker Prize. The Master (a fictionalised version of the inner life of Henry James) was also shortlisted for the Booker Prize and won the 2006 International Dublin Literary Award, securing for Toíbín a bounty of thousands of euro as it is one of the richest literary awards in the world. Nora Webster won the Hawthornden Prize, whilst The Magician (a fictionalised version of the life of Thomas Mann) won the Folio Prize. His fellow artists elected him to Aosdána and he won the  \"UK and Ireland Nobel\" David Cohen Prize in 2021.\n\nParagraph 10: About 75% of paragangliomas are sporadic; the remaining 25% are hereditary (and have an increased likelihood of being multiple and of developing at an earlier age). Mutations of the genes for the succinate dehydrogenase, SDHD (previously known as PGL1), SDHA, SDHC (previously PGL3) and SDHB have been identified as causing familial head and neck paragangliomas. Mutations of SDHB play an important role in familial adrenal pheochromocytoma and extra-adrenal paraganglioma (of abdomen and thorax), although there is considerable overlap in the types of tumors associated with SDHB and SDHD gene mutations. Paragangliomas may also occur in MEN type 2A and 2B. Other genes related to familial paraganglioma are SDHAF2, VHL, NF1, TMEM127, MAX and SLC25A11.\n\nParagraph 11: Ivy was considered \"one of the nation’s top physiologists\" and \"the conscience of U.S. Science\" at the time of the Nuremberg trials in 1946, according to an article in Time magazine. At the Nuremberg trials, the German physician, Dr. Werner Leibbrant was interrogated on the stand and it became evident that the Germans questioning him were attempting to identify parallels between the medical research they did during the war and the human subjects research taking place in the states especially at Stateville, Illinois. This was unexpected by the United States, and the biggest challenge for disputing these attempts was that there were no concrete guidelines or written documentation for the ethics of human medical experimentation. After Ivy initially appeared at the Nuremberg courtroom in January 1947 and heard these proceedings, he went back to Illinois and asked the state Governor, Dwight H. Green, to set up a committee with him as the lead to assess the ethicality of the prisoner experiments that took place at Stateville. The governor agreed and sent out letters to potential candidates to join him on the committee. The committee search resulted in six members, and it was collectively called the \"Green committee\". During the questioning of Ivy at the stand in June 1947 at the trials, the same attorney who had questioned Leibbrant to get his point across regarding the equivalence of the U.S. human experimentation at Stateville, also probed Ivy, but with more focus on the Green committee. After the trials, Ivy had returned to Illinois and wrote a letter to his fellow Green committee members to tell them the details of the testimony. For the next few months, the Green committee met and worked on a final report to submit to the governor regarding their determination of ethics at Statesville. Their major conclusions were that the \"all subjects [prisoners at Stateville] have been volunteers in the absence of coercion in any form.\" The report was submitted to The Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA). The report was published in February 1948 and it represented an important support for future prisoner experimentation in the United States. The conclusions drawn in the report, which praised the practices taking place in the research at Stateville, denounced all criticism of the work and would encourage it more. Additionally, Ivy would generate new ethical guidelines for human research including the embryonic code of August 1946 which supported the use of animal experiments for protecting human life and the November 1947 statement which pleaded for physiologists and doctors to be against antivivisectionists in order to promote medical progress and human welfare. Altogether, the important points of his principles for human experimentation included 1) a need for consent, 2) carefully designing and planning experiments based on the results of animal experimentation in order to benefit society, and 3) performing these experiments by trained personnel to avoid mishaps and injuries that may result in a disability for the subject.\n\nParagraph 12: In 1920, Spanknöbel was ordained as a minister on the Seventh-day Adventist Church Reform Movement in Würzburg. He was admitted to the US as a minister in 1929, but his relationship with religion was dubious while he was in the country. Spanknöbel was a member of the Free Society of Teutonia and an employee of the Ford Motor Company. Initial support for American fascist organizations came from Germany. In May 1933, Nazi Deputy Führer Rudolf Hess gave Spanknöbel authority to form an American Nazi organization. Shortly thereafter, with help from the German consul in New York City, Spanknöbel formed the Friends of New Germany by merging two older organizations in the United States— the Society of American Friends of Germany (formed from the dissolved Gauleitung-USA or Gau-USA) and the Free Society of Teutonia; which were both small groups with only a few hundred members each. The Friends of New Germany was headquartered in Yorkville, Manhattan, but had a strong presence in Chicago.\n\nParagraph 13: Sixteen civilians were taken by coach to a military training facility in Florida, and were quickly subjected to the four drill instructors' aggressive induction processing. After receiving haircuts more suitable for the military, the recruits were taken to their Barracks where they would sleep and eat for the rest of the process. Within five hours of arrival, Katherine was already having doubts about being in Boot Camp and after feigning illness, decided to quit the game. Meyer immediately became seen as a troublemaker, finding it hard to take the process seriously, and was soon disliked by the most of the squad, but after encouragement from Thomson, prepared a damage limitation speech, apologizing and asking the others for a second chance over breakfast. Although many of the female recruits were convinced by the speech, the males were more skeptical. After a random selection process, Wolf was named as the first Squad Leader. On a 1.5-mile run, Haar's physical limitations became clear to the others, but despite a struggle she pushed through and completed the run. During the mission, the core group of strong males – Wolf, Moretti, Jackson and Park - upset Brown, who felt that they were treating the females as inferiors, and along with Meyer, she rallied the women to vote out Park in order to prevent themselves from being picked off by the stronger members of the squad. Park confronted Meyer, leading to the men agreeing to target him. At Dismissal Hill, the vote was close, but eventually Meyer and Brown's campaigning paid off, and Park became the first to be dismissed in a vote of 7-6-1-1. Due to Katherine leaving the game, Park was not given the chance to discharge any of the remaining members of the squad.\n\nParagraph 14: His father departed on the Albigensian Crusade in 1209. It is unknown when Amaury joined him in the south, but he could possibly arrive in spring 1210, when his mother came there bringing reinforcements for his father. He was knighted on 24 June 1213 in Castelnaudary in the course of a particularly solemn ceremony and continued to fight under his father's command until his death at Toulouse on 25 June 1218. As his father's successor, he inherited the County of Toulouse (that his father had taken from Raymond VI of Toulouse as a reward for his role in the Crusade) and other titles and lands in Languedoc.\n\nParagraph 15: In the third round, the ties were drawn, there was no seeding, everyone could meet everyone. The home advantage was granted to the team from the lower league, otherwise to the team that was drawn first. Basel were drawn at away against Wil from the Challenge League. The match was played at the Stadion Bergholz in front of 4,400 spectators. Basel's head coach Thorsten Fink had given David Abraham, Benjamin Huggel and Marco Streller a free week-end, but the newly signed Philipp Degen was on the bench, ready to make his comeback. Even without these regular players in their starting line-up, Basel started well and in 8th minute after a short-played corner kick, Granit Xhaka played a cross into the centre and Fabian Frei ran into the space jumped high and headed his team into the lead. Basel dominated the game in the first half, a long range shot from the forwards moving defender Markus Steinhöfer was punched out by keeper Guillaume Faivre. As the second half began the hosts took over the game, created chances but were not successful. In the 60th minute a long ball into the Basel penalty area, from a quickly played free-kick for Wil and suddenly the attacking mid-fielder Sandro Lombardi collected the ball and was able to challenge Basel keeper Yann Sommer. However, the keeper felled the on running player and subsequently the whistle, and he was shown the red card, and the penalty was given. Granit Xhaka was called out and second keeper Massimo Colomba was substituted in before the penalty-kick could be taken. Džengis Čavušević took the spot-kick, but failed as Colomba reacted well and parried, to cause frustration for Čavušević. Basel had another good chance, but Jacques Zoua kicked his shot against the cross bar. Wil did not give up and in the 84th minute a long ball was not cleared by the Basel defence, Lombardi caught the loose ball and equalised with a low shot. The game went into extra time and Philipp Degen gave his comeback. In the 111th minute, the afore mentioned Čavušević, with a sly one-two pass, was played clear and he put the hosts a goal up. His frustration was relieved. However, two minutes later a free kick taken by Alexander Frei flew high into the goal mouth and was headed away, but not cleared. Degen controlled the loose ball and shot left footed beyond everybody in front of him into the goal for the 2–2 equaliser. Again a few minutes later, Park Joo-Ho's quick ball to Scott Chipperfield was sent on to Alex Frei, who lifted the ball over advancing keeper Faivre to give Basel the lead. In the last minute of the game the frustration was again great and players from both sides were involved in a scuffle and a number of players were pushed onto the ground. Basel's Genséric Kusunga and Wil's Čavušević were both shown the straight red card, but the result remained with Basel's 3–2 away win.\n\nParagraph 16: On 8 May 2014, Sydney FC announced its new head coach for the 2014–15 A-League season. With retirements to Brett Emerton in January and Terry McFlynn, and the contract expirations of marquee player Alessandro Del Piero, foreign player Ranko Despotovic and former Socceroo Richard Garcia, there was a lot of experience to be filled by the club. Arnold announced his first signing on 12 May 2014, acquiring the services of his former Mariner winger Bernie Ibini-Isei. Sydney FC then announced signings of prolific A-League goalscorer Shane Smeltz and Socceroo Alex Brosque. After months of searching Arnold found his new marquee man in Austria national football team captain Marc Janko. On 8 October 2014, Brosque was announced as the captain of Sydney FC for the 2014–15 A-League season, alongside vice-captains Saša Ognenovski and Nikola Petković. Sydney FC's season began with the highly anticipated match-up against the newly re-branded Melbourne City FC and guest superstar David Villa. Whilst not starting the game, Villa came on early in the second half to claim the equalising goal, the result ending 1–1. Sydney FC continued on an eight-game undefeated streak that ended when Perth Glory came from behind to score two goals in the final seven minutes to claim victory at Allianz Stadium. The following week saw another thrilling Big Blue in Melbourne ending 3–3. Sydney FC struggled for form as they moved closer to the January break for the AFC Asian Cup, not scoring in four consecutive matches. During this break, Sydney FC were able to bolster their stocks, signing Senegalese internationals Mickael Tavares and Jacques Faty as injury replacement players. Upon resumption, Sydney FC posted 19 (out of a possible 21) points in the next seven rounds. Whilst slipping up twice at home to Melbourne City and Adelaide United (with scores of 0–1 in both games) during the final six rounds, Sydney FC managed to win all four other games away from home to finish second on the ladder with 50 points for the season. By the end of the regular season, Sydney FC had broken many records including a record club home season attendance (41,213 vs. Western Sydney Wanderers FC) and a league record number of away games undefeated in a season, as well as becoming the first club to score three or more goals in five consecutive games. Marquee Marc Janko also set his own A-League record for most consecutive goalscoring appearances with seven. After having the first week of the finals off, Sydney FC met Adelaide in the semi-finals at home. A brace from Alex Brosque set Sydney up for a 4–1 win. Ultimately, Sydney FC were outplayed in the 2015 A-League Grand Final, defeated by Melbourne Victory 3–0 at AAMI Park.", "answers": ["Paragraph 15"], "length": 4442, "dataset": "passage_retrieval_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "2bb1002fdbce02944e4226abeaa9f429bac2497eb0435fb6"}
{"input": "This text provides a summary of the path of the Leach river. It starts in a limestone valley and reaches the first settlement called Northleach. In Northleach, it flows out of a Victorian conduit and is also known as the Seven Springs. The first watermill on the river is located in a part of Northleach called Mill End. The river runs along a section of mill race stonework close to the churchyard, marking the town boundary. It can be seen again at a road bridge at the end of the town, still small in size. The river then continues down the valley, passing through the hamlet of Eastington alongside a lane. Eventually, it flows through a culvert and grazing land.", "context": "Paragraph 1: \"The pastoral Somali have few large ceremonies and little ritual. For its interest, therefore I reproduce here a summary of a very full account of the traditional Gadabuursi installation ceremony given me by Sheikh 'Abdarahmaan Sheikh Nuur, the present Government Kadi of Borama. Clansmen gather for the ceremony in a well-wooded and watered place. There is singing and dancing, then stock are slaughtered for feasting and sacrifice. The stars are carefully watched to determine a propitious time, and then future  Ugaas is chosen by divination. Candidates must be sons or brothers of the former Ugaas and the issue of a woman who has been only married once. She should not be a woman who has been divorced or a widow. Early on a Monday morning a man of the Reer Nuur (the laandeer of the Gadabuursi) plucks a flower or leaf and throws it upon the Ugaas. Everyone else then follows his example. The man who starts the `aleemasaar acclamation must be a man rich in livestock, with four wives, and many sons. Men of the Mahad Muuse lineage then brings four vessels of milk. One contains camels' milk, one cows' milk, one sheeps' milk, and the last goats' milk. These are offered to the Ugaas who selects one and drinks a little from it. If he drinks the camels' milk, camels will be blessed and prosper, if he drinks, the goats' milk, goats will prosper, and so on. After this, a large four-year-old ram is slaughtered in front of him. His hair is cut by a man of the Gadabuursi and he casts off his old clothes and dons new clothes as Ugaas. A man of Reer Yuunis puts a white turban round his head, and his old clothes are carried off by men of the Jibra'iin... The Ugaas then mounts his best horse and rides to a well called Bugay, near Geris, towards the coast. The well contains deliciously fresh water. Above the well are white pebbles and on these he sits. He is washed by a brother or other close kinsman as he sits on top of the stones. Then he returns to the assembled people and is again acclaimed and crowned with leaves. Dancing and feasting recommence. The Ugaas makes a speech in which he blesses his people and asks God to grant peace, abundant milk, and rain--all symbols of peace and prosperity (nabad iyo 'aano). If rain falls after this, people will know that his reign will be prosperous. That the ceremony is customarily performed during the karan rainy season makes this all the more likely. The Ugaas is given a new house with entirely new effects and furnishings and a bride is sought for him. She must be of good family, and the child of a woman who has had only one husband. Her bride-wealth is paid by all the Gadabuursi collectively, as they thus ensure for themselves successors to the title. Rifles or other fire-arms are not included in the bride-wealth. Everything connected with the accession must be peaceful and propitious.\"\n\nParagraph 2: Designed to be \"harder and wilder\" than the original Mega Man, Zero's design ultimately resembled X in several ways due to his initial character concept, Inafune's insistence on drawing the character, and input from other project artists. In the X series, Zero has red and white armor with twin \"horns\" on his helmet. Zero also has his signature long blonde hair. Starting with Mega Man X2, Zero received a slight redesign. His shoulders were given plating with a \"Z\" symbol on his left shoulder, his armor was made to be slightly bulkier, and his chest and foot parts got additional gold plating. Zero also started wielding his signature weapon, the Z-Saber, an energy-based sword that introduced melee combat to the Mega Man games. His original, now secondary weapon is the Z-Buster, a cannon mounted at the end of his right arm, similar to X's X-Buster. A tertiary weapon that would orbit around Zero was also considered, but left uncompleted. Unlike the original Mega Man, who had a full head of hair under his helmet, Zero has a smooth secondary helmet, intended to imply the characters were older. In Mega Man X4, Zero was going to receive his own enhanced armor in the same way X does, but the development team decided not to finish it.\n\nParagraph 3: In contemporary history first Muslim refugees from eastern Bosnia settled in Gunja in 1942 during the World War II in Yugoslavia. They returned to Bosnia, but once they witnessed the extent of destruction some of them returned once again to Gunja. Some 50 Muslim families from Velika Kladuša settled in Gunja after the Cazin rebellion. During the existence of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia Muslim community in Gunja increased to 2,500. 70 Muslim families moved to Gunja from Srebrenica in 1970's. Gunja was an attractive location for Muslim settlers from Bosnia as it functioned as a de facto suburb of the city of Brčko across the Sava river. Local džemat was established in 1957 and was led by hodža Abdurahman Ramo Hodžić from Ustikolina, who later returned to Ustikolina for health reasons. He was succeeded by hodža Hazim ef. Hodžić from Vražići (who was earlier a prisoner for his membership in Young Muslims) but he also left for Bijeljina leading local community to unite with the one in the Sava Mosque in Brčko. At the same time the community decided to form an initiative to build a mosque and started the process once all permissions were issued. 3134 square meters of land for the new mosque was granted by the Čandić family. The Mosque in Gunja was completed in 1969 after 14 months and functioned as the only active mosque in Croatia until Zagreb Mosque was completed in 1987. Current dome of the Gunja Mosque was constructed in 1999 based on the Neo-Ottoman design done by Faruk Muzurović which strictly followed historical examples of Ottoman architecture in Balkans leading to some criticism over the lack of creativity. The Mosque in Gunja was damaged during the 2014 Southeast Europe floods. The site was visited by ambassadors of Azerbaijan, Indonesia and Iran to Croatia who were led by mufti of Zagreb. While local religious leadership requested and expressed dissatisfaction over the lack of reconstruction funding from the Government of Croatia, object was ultimately reconstructed by an 165,000 € donation of the Republic of Turkey. Since 2017 the mosque organizes annual Evenings of Spiritual Music in which students from elementary school in Gunja as well as representatives of Serbian Orthodox and Roman Catholic community from the village and the rest of the region take part. On the occasion of 50th anniversary of the Gunja Mosque local Muslim religious leader hodža Idriz ef. Bešić received life achievement award of the Vukovar-Srijem County for 38 years of his service in Gunja.\n\nParagraph 4: On 2 October 2016 (see: 2016 Kashmir unrest) the Srinagar-based Kashmiri newspaper, Kashmir Reader was asked to stop production by the Jammu and Kashmir government. The ban order, issued by the Deputy Commissioner of Srinagar Farooq Ahmad Lone cited that the reason for this was that the newspaper contains \"material and content which tends to incite acts of violence and disturb public peace and tranquility\" The ban came after weeks of unrest in the Kashmir valley, following the killing of the commander of a terrorist group Hizbul Mujahideen (designated a terrorist group by India, the European Union and the United States) Burhan Wani. Journalists have decried this as a clampdown on freedom of expression and democracy in Kashmir, as a part of the massive media censorship of the unrest undertaken by the central government. Working journalists protested the ban by marching to the Directorate of Information and Public Relations while the Kashmir Editors Guild (KEG) held an emergency meeting in Srinagar, thereafter asking the government to revoke the ban immediately, and asking for the intervention of the Press Council of India. The move has been criticised by a variety of individuals, academic and civil groups in Kashmir and international rights groups, such as Jammu and Kashmir Coalition of Civil Society (JKCCS), Kashmir Economic Alliance (KEA), the Kashmir Center for Social and Development Studies (KCSDS) and Amnesty International, among others. Most of the major Kashmiri dailies have also rallied behind the KR, while claiming that the move represented a political vendetta against the newspaper for reporting events in the unrest as they happened on the ground. Hurriyat leaders, known to champion the cause of Kashmiri independence, also recorded their protests against the banning of the newspaper. Amnesty International released a statement saying that \"the government has a duty to respect the freedom of the press, and the right of people to receive information,\" while criticising the government for shutting down a newspaper for opposing it. The journalists associated with the paper allege that, contrary to the claims of the J&K government, they had not been issued a notice or warning, and had been asked to stop production suddenly, which was only one manifestation of the wider media gag on Kashmir. Previously, the state government had banned newspapers for a few days in July, calling the move a \"temporary measure to address an extraordinary situation\", only to deflect the blame onto the police upon facing a tremendous backlash, and thereafter asking the presses to resume publication. On 28 December 2016, the newspaper resumed publication after the government lifted the ban after nearly three months.\n\nParagraph 5: According to information in The Fifth Field: The Story of the 96 American Soldiers Sentenced to Death and Executed in Europe and North Africa in World War II (Schiffer Publishing, 2013) author Colonel French L. MacLean, US Army Retired, had access to the complete court-martial record of the case to include witness statements and found that a Private James Thomas, who was tried separately, made a statement that he watched Louis Till and co-defendant Fred McMurray take 20 minutes to plan the home invasion; he stated that the men wore US Navy weather masks; he stated Till and McMurray had sex with the two women, both of whom had miscarriages later (one had been 8 months pregnant.) Investigators found a letter envelope at the scene of the crime addressed to Fred McMurray. McMurray made a statement at trial that just before the attack, Till said, \"Everybody follow me: If anybody turns back I'll blast him.\" McMurray, who was also on trial, said that he begged Till not to shoot, but Till fired a shot into the house anyway: Signora Anna Zanchi was shot in the stomach and died several hours later at a U.S. Army hospital. Colonel Claudius O. Wolfe, the Staff Judge Advocate for the Peninsula Base Section (PBS) in Italy, reported that the record of trial was legally sufficient to support the findings of guilty. Brigadier General Francis H. Oxx, the Commander of the PBS, approved the findings. Colonel Adam Richmond, the Mediterranean Theater Judge Advocate, was said to have found no significant discrepancies and recommended that the sentence for each of the accused be confirmed. General Joseph T. McNarney, Commanding General of the Mediterranean Theater of Operations (MTO), confirmed the sentences for both men; Judge Advocates Irion, Sessions and Remick of the Branch Office of The JAG with the MTO found the trial to have been satisfactory and that Private Thomas' testimony had been corroborated in most of its important aspects.\n\nParagraph 6: This is the voice of Vrillon, a representative of the Ashtar Galactic Command, speaking to you. For many years you have seen us as lights in the skies. We speak to you now in peace and wisdom as we have done to your brothers and sisters all over this, your planet Earth. We come to warn you of the destiny of your race and your world so that you may communicate to your fellow beings the course you must take to avoid the disaster which threatens your world, and the beings on our worlds around you. This is in order that you may share in the great awakening, as the planet passes into the New Age of Aquarius. The New Age can be a time of great peace and evolution for your race, but only if your rulers are made aware of the evil forces that can overshadow their judgments. Be still now and listen, for your chance may not come again. All your weapons of evil must be removed. The time for conflict is now past and the race of which you are a part may proceed to the higher stages of its evolution if you show yourselves worthy to do this. You have but a short time to learn to live together in peace and goodwill. Small groups all over the planet are learning this, and exist to pass on the light of the dawning New Age to you all. You are free to accept or reject their teachings, but only those who learn to live in peace will pass to the higher realms of spiritual evolution. Hear now the voice of Vrillon, a representative of the Ashtar Galactic Command, speaking to you. Be aware also that there are many false prophets and guides at present operating on your world. They will suck your energy from you – the energy you call money and will put it to evil ends and give you worthless dross in return. Your inner divine self will protect you from this. You must learn to be sensitive to the voice within that can tell you what is truth, and what is confusion, chaos and untruth. Learn to listen to the voice of truth which is within you and you will lead yourselves onto the path of evolution. This is our message to our dear friends. We have watched you growing for many years as you too have watched our lights in your skies. You know now that we are here, and that there are more beings on and around your Earth than your scientists admit. We are deeply concerned about you and your path towards the light and will do all we can to help you. Have no fear, seek only to know yourselves, and live in harmony with the ways of your planet Earth. We here at the Ashtar Galactic Command thank you for your attention. We are now leaving the planes of your existence. May you be blessed by the supreme love and truth of the cosmos.\n\nParagraph 7: The land on which the church stands was donated by Pascoe St Leger Grenfell along with 40 acres of country land for a cemetery and \"glebe\" lands. Pascoe St Leger Grenfell, the holder of a preliminary land order, Raikes Currie and the Reverend Sir Henry Robert Dukinfield of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts (SPG) who held the collective funds and, thirdly, the men to whom they were transferring their powers, namely James Hurtle Fisher, Osmond Gilles and Charles Mann. Fisher was to be resident commissioner in South Australia of the Colonisation Commission, having responsibility independent of the governor for the administration of land in the new colony; Gilles was to be the treasurer and Mann the advocate general or principal legal officer of the colony. Grenfell transferred control over order no. 171 for a town acre and over 40 acres of country land to be selected in conjunction with the town acre, later known as Trinity Gardens. The conveyance did not have to specify that Currie and Dukinfield hand over money and the portable church, but it may be presumed they did so — alternatively they may have entrusted these resources to John Morphett, appointed as SPG's attorney in the colony. The objects of the trust were to use the town acre as a site for \"the erection of a church where Divine Service could be celebrated according to the rites and ceremonies of the Church of England\". The same acre was also to provide space for a schoolroom and a parsonage and garden for the minister of the church. The country land was to provide six to eight acres for a cemetery and the remainder to be \"glebe land\", in the familiar phrase of the Church of England, to provide income for the support of the minister.\n\nParagraph 8: On May 22, 2014, Ollie signed a new five-year contract with UConn, worth $2.8 million per year.  He was fired with just cause on March 10, 2018 due to an investigation by the NCAA which lead to a three-year show cause order from the NCAA for violations that took place over a four-year period ending in 2017.  Ollie was charged with “failure to monitor” his program and not promoting an atmosphere of compliance.  Connecticut also lost one scholarship for the 2019-2020 class, was put on two years’ probation, was fined $5,000 and will receive various minor recruiting restrictions. The team will also have to vacate victories in which an ineligible player participated during the 2016–17 and 2017–18 season. Ollie was charged with three Level I violations stemming from the following: summer pick-up games that should have counted toward allowable team activities, a video coordinator engaging in impermissible coaching instruction and a booster providing extra benefits to student-athletes. The extra benefits were provided by a private trainer and included training, lodging, meals and local transportation. Ollie, 46, filed a grievance following his firing, seeking to get $10 million in back pay. The dispute has since gone to arbitration.\n\nParagraph 9: The Quincy Railway was commenced under the following circumstances: The 'Bunker Hill Monument Association' had been formed, and funds enough collected to commence the foundation of the monument in the spring of eighteen hundred and twenty-five. I aided the architect in preparing the foundation, and on the seventeenth day of June following, the corner-stone was laid by General de La Fayette, and I had the honor to assist as master builder at the ceremony. I had, previous to this, purchased a stone quarry (the funds being furnished by Dr. John C. Warren) for the express purpose of procuring the granite for constructing this monument. This quarry was in Quincy, nearly four miles from water-carriage. This suggested to me the idea of a railroad (the Manchester and Liverpool Railroad being in contemplation at that time, but was not begun until the spring following); accordingly, in the fall of eighteen hundred and twenty-five, I consulted Thomas H. Perkins, William Sullivan, Amos Lawrence, Isaac T. Davis, and David Moody, all of Boston, in reference to it. These gentlemen thought the project visionary and chimerical, but, being anxious to aid the Bunker Hill Monument, consented that I might see what could be done. I awaited the meeting of our Legislature in the winter of eighteen hundred and twenty-five and six, and after every delay and obstruction that could be thrown in the way, I finally obtained a charter, although there was great opposition in the House. The questions were asked: 'What do we know about rail-roads? Who ever heard of such a thing? Is it right to take people's land for a project that no one knows anything about? We have corporations enough already.' Such and similar objections were made, and onerous restrictions were imposed, but it finally passed by a small majority only. Unfavorable as the charter was, it was admitted that it was obtained by my exertions; but it was owing to the munificence and public spirit of Colonel T. H. Perkins that we were indebted for the whole enterprise. None of the first named gentlemen ever paid any assessments, and the whole stock finally fell into the hands of Colonel Perkins.\n\nParagraph 10: After running a mile down its limestone valley, the Leach reaches Northleach, the first settlement to which it gives its name. The river enters Northleach to the south west, where it gushes out of a Victorian conduit just below the Fosse Way. At this point it is also known as the Seven Springs. The site of the first watermill on the river is in a part of Northleach called Mill End. A section of the river is confined into mill race type stonework, close to the churchyard and runs behind houses marking the town boundary. The river can next be seen at a road bridge at the end of the town. It is still little more than ditch-sized, and as such continues down the valley to the hamlet of Eastington running alongside a lane before passing through a culvert and away through grazing land.\n\nParagraph 11: In the episode \"Rendition\", in the woods, Daryl flees the Reaper attack with Dog. A Reaper tries to stop him, throwing Dog down a hill, but Daryl fights them off. Another Reaper stops their companions from attacking Daryl, allowing him to escape. The following morning, Daryl finds Dog sitting next to a Reaper, who reveals herself to be Leah, Daryl's former romantic partner and Dog's former owner. Leah asks Daryl if he is with Maggie's group. Daryl lies and says he only bumped into them on the road, but Leah is unconvinced. Daryl tries to take Dog and leave, but Dog refuses to leave Leah's side as a group of Reapers surround them. Daryl is taken to Meridian and tied to a chair in a shed. Daryl confides to Leah that he came back and looked everywhere for her before Leah puts him unconscious. Daryl soon wakes up gasping for air as Reapers waterboard him for information about Maggie's group, and they continue to torture him until Leah orders them to stop. Daryl is locked in a nearby cell, and Leah again orders Daryl to surrender any information lest he face the wrath of the her leader, Pope. At Pope's quarters, Leah learns that another Reaper, Michael, was found dead. Leah returns to Daryl's cell as Frost is taken away for interrogation, and confides her grief over Michael, who she saw as a younger brother. Daryl again says that he returned to her cabin to be with her, but she wasn't there. Leah admits she still has feelings for Daryl, who says he would help her if he could and claims he is telling the truth about not being part of Maggie's group. Daryl offers vague details, and Leah reports back to Pope, and convinces Pope to let Daryl join them. That night, Daryl and Leah are left alone in the interrogation room, only to be locked inside; the shed is set on fire and the room is engulfed in flames. Daryl is able to break through a window and helps Leah out of the burning room, and follows her to safety outside, where they find all of the Reapers gathered. Pope, impressed that Daryl not only escaped but saved Leah before himself, welcomes Daryl into the group. In his quarters, Pope explains how the Reapers are veterans traumatized during the War in Afghanistan. Struggling to cope with civilian life after finishing their deployment, they became mercenaries until society fell. After the fall, the politicians who hired them tried to exterminate them in a fire, but they survived, believing to be chosen by God. In the episode \"On the Inside\", Daryl remains at the Reapers' hideout, where he witnesses Carver interrogate Frost. Pope tasks Daryl with continuing the interrogation. Frost reveals that they're meeting up at a yellow house when Daryl cuts one of his fingers off, and Leah agrees to lead a team to investigate the house. Leah asks Daryl to come with them, which upsets Carver. When Leah's search party arrives at the yellow house, Daryl covertly signals Maggie, Negan, Gabriel, and Elijah, who hide in a compartment in the floor to avoid the Reapers. The Reapers search until they come upon Maggie's house. Carver questions if Daryl is loyal to the Reapers, but Leah suggests they check the remaining houses. Carver finds the hidden door but upon lifting up the carpet, it is empty. After checking all the buildings, Leah's group arrive back at Meridian and tell Pope that they didn't find anyone. They see Frost's dead body tied to a pole, and Pope says that he got everything he needed out of Frost, before bringing Carver inside Meridian. In the episode \"Promises Broken\", two Reapers return to Meridian and inform Pope that they couldn't find Maggie's group. Pope is infuriated, but Leah intervenes and takes the blame. Pope angrily orders Leah and Daryl to scout the area again. While walking alone, Daryl asks Leah about the Reapers' history; Leah says they took Meridian because they needed a place to stay, and that they are only hunting Maggie so she doesn't try to take revenge. Leah confides in Daryl that she sees Pope as a father figure and that his recent behavior is unusual. Daryl and Leah come across a lone survivor, who claims he is looking for supplies for his sick wife. Leah radios Pope and asks what to do, and Pope orders them to kill the survivor and his family. The survivor leads Leah and Daryl to his hideout, where his sick wife and son are. Leah tells the man to leave with his son and never return, and he obliges as Daryl mercy kills his wife when Leah can't bring herself to do it.\n\nParagraph 12: The 2017 off-season saw the departure of Dean Demopoulos and the hiring of Dean Vickerman as head coach. Under Demopoulos, United underachieved due to a one-dimensional game plan and a lack of direction at the defensive end. With Vickerman came a cultural shift based around sharing the wealth offensively and leading from within. With a returning cast of Goulding, Ware, Boone, Wesley, Andersen, Barlow and Majok, United acquired the services of Casey Prather, a swingman coming off back-to-back championships with the Perth Wildcats. United also signed former one-time Melbourne Tiger Daniel Dillon, but an Achilles injury to Dillon forced the team to sign Peter Hooley in his place. United were title favourites at the start of the 2017–18 season, but fell to a 2–3 record following a loss to the Brisbane Bullets in Round 4. In December, Prather went down with a possible season-ending elbow injury and was replaced by Carrick Felix. With defensive-minded Felix in the line-up, United went 9–1. Felix was removed from Melbourne's active roster in mid-February following Prather's return from injury. United finished the regular season as minor premiers for the second time in three years, earning a 20–8 record. They went on to sweep the Breakers in the semi-finals to reach the 2018 NBL Grand Final series. There they faced the Adelaide 36ers. With the series tied at 2–2 heading into the deciding Game 5, Ware and Goulding each scored 23 points with Prather adding 19 points, 11 rebounds and five steals to lead United to a 100–82 win, as the franchise claimed their first NBL Championship under the new moniker. Goulding was named grand final MVP.\n\nParagraph 13: The label's first success was with Suede, whose debut album, Suede (1993), debuted at the top of the UK Albums Chart, and was the fastest-selling debut album since Frankie Goes To Hollywood's Welcome to the Pleasuredome almost ten years earlier. The band went on to win the Mercury Prize that year, and received five Brit Awards nominations.  They had three No. 1 hit albums in the UK Albums Chart. Other artists with chart success signed to the label included the Scottish band Geneva, who had Top 20 success with their debut album Further; Black Box Recorder who also achieved a Top 20 hit single and album with The Facts of Life (2000); plus chart album hits for Ultrasound, Lowgold, and Billy Mackenzie.\n\nParagraph 14: Thus Benjamin Herder's activity as a publisher was always a faithful mirror of the Catholic revival in Germany in the nineteenth century, and furthermore a powerful lever exerted in favour of the Catholic cause. This was so much the more creditable, since Herder was not merely the agent, but also in general the originator of his enterprises. Possessing a clear and profound knowledge of the needs of Catholic literature, it was usually he who selected the themes for literary treatment. When he once recognized a project to be right, he clung to it tenaciously until conditions proved favourable, although decades elapsed before his scheme could be realized. Almost always on the watch for competent collaborators, he discovered the majority by his own exertions, personal acquaintance usually developing into lifelong friendship. In no undertaking did he allow material gain to be the deciding factor; even in times of crisis–and of such he encountered more than one, beginning with the Baden uprising of 1848, right through the wars which raged between 1859 and 1871, down to the dreary years of the Kulturkampf which crippled the resources of both clergy and people–the end in view alone determined his decision. Thoroughly alive to his grave responsibility as a publisher, he devoted extraordinary care to the training of capable and conscientious assistants. His partner, Franz Joseph Hutter (b. at Ravensburg, 25 November 1840) issued from the ranks of these \"pupils\". His essentially practical nature happily complemented Benjamin's idealism, which even repeated warnings had not been able to shake. New branches were established to open a wider market than the older establishments at Freiburg and Strasburg afforded. In 1873 were founded the St. Louis (U. S. A.) branch, under the management of Joseph Gummersbach, and the Munich branch under Herder's brother-in-law, Adolf Streber, and in 1886 that at Vienna, while enterprises of even greater promise were contemplated. In 1863 Herder married Emilie Streber, the accomplished daughter of Franz Seraph Streber, professor at the Munich University, and celebrated as a numismatist. His alliance with the Streber family introduced Herder to a circle of men who played an important part in the Catholic revival in Germany. It was also contemporaneous with a more active movement in the Church, in which Herder took a notable part. Though handicapped throughout by great physical sufferings, he bore all to the end without complaining, striving unceasingly onwards and upwards.", "answers": ["Paragraph 10"], "length": 5138, "dataset": "passage_retrieval_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "2f6ead24e100e1ae4b0a7bcc6d437927033643acb271f911"}
{"input": "This text outlines a series of military actions and operations undertaken by a group called the 6th Kentucky Cavalry during the American Civil War. These actions occurred at various locations in Kentucky, Ohio, and Tennessee, as well as during the Atlanta Campaign. Some notable events include the pursuit of Morgan's Raid, the Siege of Knoxville, and the Battle of Jonesboro. The group also participated in the Burnside's march into eastern Tennessee and later engaged in operations in Virginia and North Carolina. The summary concludes by mentioning their return to Tennessee and subsequent duty at Sweetwater.", "context": "Paragraph 1: Team Homan made it to the quarterfinals of their first slam of the year, the 2021 Masters, where they were beaten by Alina Kovaleva. Two weeks later, they played in the 2021 National, where they were eliminated in the quarters again, this time by Anna Hasselborg. Next for Team Homan was the 2021 Canadian Olympic Curling Trials where they attempted to qualify for the Olympics again. The team, however, did not have a successful week, finishing with a 2–6 record. Team Homan's record over the season was not good enough to give them an automatic qualifying spot at the 2022 Ontario Scotties Tournament of Hearts, forcing them to play in an open qualifier. The team did qualify at the Open Qualifier, but the Ontario Scotties were postponed due to new COVID-19 regulations put into place by the province, shutting down sports event. With the postponement of the Ontario Scotties, CurlON announced that they would be selecting Team Hollie Duncan over Team Homan to represent Ontario if Homan was selected to represent Canada in the mixed doubles event at the 2022 Olympics (as the Trials had been cancelled). However, if Homan wasn't selected, then CurlON would select Team Homan to play in the Scotties instead. This plan of action was considered confusion and disappointing to the teams involved. Homan would end up being selected to represent Canada at the Olympics, giving Team Duncan the right to represent Ontario at the 2022 Scotties. However, the rest of Team Homan qualified for the Scotties as Team Wild Card #3. For the Tournament of Hearts, Wilkes, Emma Miskew and Joanne Courtney added Allison Flaxey to their lineup. At the championship, the team finished with a 4–4 round robin record, not advancing to the playoff round. Team Homan had to wait until April 2022 to play in the postponed Ontario Hearts, which they ended up winning, beating Carly Howard in the final. The team wrapped up their season with the two final slams, making it to the semifinals at the 2022 Players' Championship where they lost to Anna Hasselborg, and the quarters of the 2022 Champions Cup, where they lost to Kerri Einarson. In March 2022, after Joanne Courtney announced she would be stepping back from competitive curling, it was announced that Tracy Fleury would be joining the team for the 2022–23 season. With the addition of Fleury on the back-end, Miskew shifted down to play second while Wilkes moved to the lead position.\n\nParagraph 2: On August 1, Phish began debuting a brand new cover song at nearly every show, starting with \"Ramble On\" by Led Zeppelin at a show at Alpine Valley in East Troy, Wisconsin. Covers by Cole Porter, Smashing Pumpkins, Van Halen, the Velvet Underground, Allen Toussaint and the Beastie Boys, followed by a rendition of the Grateful Dead's Terrapin Station as the band stopped in Virginia Beach on August 9, the third anniversary of the death of Jerry Garcia. These were in addition to covers by Ween, Corneille, 2Pac, Los Lobos, Johnny Winter, Dry Bread, ZZ Top (x2), the Who (x2), Marvin Gaye, Son Seals, the Blues Brothers, the Rolling Stones (x2), Edgar Winter, Led Zeppelin (not Ramble On), Jimi Hendrix (x2), Neil Young, Robert Palmer, Steve Earle, Talking Heads (x2), Jane's Addiction, Richard Strauss, Stevie Wonder, Syd Barrett, Neil Diamond, Bob Marley, Little Feat, B.B. King, Blues Image and Henry Mancini at points throughout the tour as well. Phish had been relentlessly compared to the Dead throughout their career and often cited as the apparent heir to the Dead's throne, resulting in Phish making a strong effort to distance themselves from the Dead. The band had not performed a Grateful Dead song in concert since April 1, 1986 – twelve years earlier – when they were a five-man college band that had yet to play outside of Vermont. For the encore in Virginia Beach, Phish performed the Dead's multi-part suite \"Terrapin Station\". Former members of the Grateful Dead extended a \"thank you\" to Phish in their quarterly newsletter. A few months later, Dead bassist Phil Lesh reached out to Trey Anastasio and Page McConnell to join him, former Dead vocalist Donna Jean Godchaux and others to perform three nights of Dead and Phish music in April 1999. Members of Phish and the Dead now have a strong relationship, with Trey having played guitar in the Dead's 50th anniversary \"Fare Thee Well\" lineup, and bands such as Rhythm Devils and SerialPod containing members of both bands.\n\nParagraph 3: Shapley was arguing in favor of the Milky Way as the entirety of the universe. He believed that \"spiral nebulae\" such as Andromeda were simply part of the Milky Way. He could back up this claim by citing relative sizes—if Andromeda were not part of the Milky Way, then its distance must have been on the order of 108 light years—a span most contemporary astronomers would not accept. Adriaan van Maanen, a well-respected astronomer of the time, also provided evidence supporting Shapley's argument. Van Maanen claimed he had observed the Pinwheel Galaxy rotating, and that if the Pinwheel Galaxy were in fact a distinct galaxy and could be observed to be rotating on a timescale of years, its orbital velocity would be enormous and there would be a violation of the universal speed limit, the speed of light. Shapley also backed up his claims with the observation of a nova in the Andromeda \"nebula\" that had briefly outshone the entire nebula, constituting a seemingly impossible output of energy were Andromeda in fact a separate galaxy.\n\nParagraph 4: It developed in north India, principally during the Mughal Empire, when the Persian language exerted a strong influence on the Western Hindi languages of central India; this contact between the Hindu and Muslim cultures resulted in the core Indo-Aryan vocabulary of the Indian dialect of Hindi spoken in Delhi, whose earliest form is known as Old Hindi, being enriched with Persian loanwords. Rekhta, or \"mixed\" speech, which came to be known as Hindustani, Hindi, Hindavi, and Urdu (derived from Zabaan-i-Ordu by Mashafi meaning \"language of the Horde\".), also locally known as Lashkari or Lashkari Zaban in long form, was thus created. This form was elevated to the status of a literary language, and after the partition of colonial India and independence this collection of dialects became the basis for modern standard Hindi and Urdu. Although these official languages are distinct registers with regards to their formal aspects, such as modern technical vocabulary, they continue to be all but indistinguishable in their vernacular form.\n\nParagraph 5: Action at Owensboro, Kentucky, September 18, 1862.

He comments on the setting: \"The intoxicating mix of big names and big city makes this an ideal starting point for new gamers. The heroes are solid role models for players to follow, while this archetypal fantasy city is easy for novices to picture mentally. Add to this a set of 'simplified' AD&D rules, a starter adventure and a wodge of background information on fantasy's greatest (if most error-prone) double-act, and you've got what could be a perfect set of 'trainer wheels' for any wannabe adventurers out there.\" He added: \"Lankhmar is designed to introduce players to the joys of roleplaying. It aims to strip away the more involved rules to leave a leaner, faster and more approachable game that can be played by pretty much anybody. Indeed, the box proudly boasts that all you need to play are pencils, paper and a standard set of AD&D dice. This is factually true, if a little optimistic - there's a huge amount of reading to do before any dice will be rolled.\" Webb continued: \"What will drag both referees and players through their respective tomes is the freewheeling, 'devil may care' spirit of adventure that underpins the whole Fafhrd and Mouser myth. These boys are thieves, cuckolds and suckers who spend as much time leaping from bedroom windows as they do righting wrongs or fighting horrific beasts. It is this instinctive sense of action that these abridged rules try hard to foster with the introduction of Luck dice and petitioning DMs to be just a little less lethal.\" He continued: \"The action is compressed by this large but comprehensible city. Lankhmar is the kind of town you expect to find in fantasy, packed with cults, guilds, markets and honest-to-goodness intrigue. Most importantly, the names are pronounceable and the district system logical, which enables players to gain a geographical grasp of the world they now have the opportunity to explore.\" Webb added: \"And such orientation is vital if players of Fritz Leiber's Lankhmar are to have fun because, while simplified, the rules will still be far more complex than any conventional game they'll have played before. The balance that has been struck between ease of play and enjoyable complexity almost works, but the monumental AD&D rules system does not reduce easily. So, Lankhmar is still packed with proficiencies and modifiers, which means that many players will spend far more time scouring their character sheets than the streets of the city.\" He continued: \"The above-mentioned problems are compounded by the necessary brevity of the rulebooks and player guides. These have to be brisk, but this often leaves complicated concepts only functionally explained. Which is fine if you get the point first time round, but if you don't then there's precious little support material available and few examples to help you get to grips with how it all works.\" Webb concluded his review by saying: \"As a result Lankhmar will prove frustrating for game groups composed solely of beginners. However, it will be perfect for any AD&D players who fancy cutting their teeth as a DM, or for experienced DMs who want to initiate a new circle of friends to roleplay. In these cases their familiarity would definitely be enough to carry the party through the inevitably testing start-up and into some seriously rollicking, relaxed and relatively rule-free adventures.\"\n\nParagraph 7: Ptolemy states in the letter that, \"this division of the law (that is, god's own law) was established neither by the perfect god, as we have taught, nor surely by the devil -which it would be wrong to say- then the establisher of this division is distinct from them. And he is the craftsman and maker of this universe or world and the things within it.\" This excerpt reflects Ptolemy's gnostic view that the god that created the world is not the Perfect God, but rather an inferior god who incorrectly believed that he was the one true God, which is what he is trying to convey to Flora.\n\nParagraph 8: On May 8, 2017, Sinclair entered into an agreement to acquire Chicago-based Tribune Media – which, through a shared services agreement with owner Dreamcatcher Broadcasting, has operated ABC affiliate WNEP-TV (channel 16) since December 2013 – for $3.9 billion, plus the assumption of $2.7 billion in debt held by Tribune. The complicated SSA relationships that Sinclair has in the Scranton–Wilkes–Barre market with WOLF, WSWB and WQMY – the former two of which are currently the only legal television duopoly in the market – created an ownership entanglement, as WNEP and WOLF rank among the market's four highest-rated stations, and the market has too few independently owned full-power stations to permit a second legal duopoly in any event. (Sinclair CEO Christopher Ripley cited Scranton–Wilkes–Barre as one of three markets, out of fourteen where ownership conflicts exist between the two groups, where the proposed acquisition would likely result in divestitures). To alleviate some of the regulatory issues that the deal incurred by selling certain stations to both independent and affiliated third-party companies, on April 24, 2018, Sinclair announced that it would sell the non-license assets of WOLF-TV, WQMY, and WSWB and the full assets of eight other stations – Sinclair-operated KOKH-TV in Oklahoma City, WRLH-TV in Richmond, KDSM-TV in Des Moines and WXLV-TV in Greensboro/Winston-Salem/High Point, and Tribune-owned WPMT in Harrisburg and WXMI in Grand Rapids – to Standard Media Group (an independent broadcast holding company formed by private equity firm Standard General to assume ownership of and absolve ownership conflicts involving the aforementioned stations) for $441.1 million. Sinclair concurrently exercised its option to buy WOLF-TV and WQMY – the latter of which, for regulatory purposes, will continue to be licensed as a satellite of WOLF-TV – to allow Standard Media Group to acquire the stations outright; Standard will concurrently acquire the WOLF-TV license, which is permitted under Federal Communications Commission (FCC) ownership regulations as WSWB is not ranked as one of the top-four stations in the market.\n\nParagraph 9: Agam's work is usually abstract, kinetic art, with movement, viewer participation and frequent use of light and sound. His works are placed in many public places. His best-known pieces include Double Metamorphosis III (1965), Visual Music Orchestration (1989), the fountain at the La Défense district in Paris (1975) and the Fire and Water Fountain in the Dizengoff Square in Tel Aviv (1986). He is also known for a type of print known as an \"Agamograph\", which uses barrier-grid animation to present radically different images, depending on the angle from which it is viewed. The lenticular technique was executed in large scale in the  square \"Complex Vision\" (1969), mounted on the facade of the Callahan Eye Foundation Hospital in Birmingham, Alabama.\n\nParagraph 10: Almost 3,000 years ago, at the start of the post-glacial era, the Kavir was a series of vast lakes: the Asian monsoon reached deep into central Iran, bringing heavy summer rain that formed numerous lakes in the closed basins of the central Iranian Plateau that today comprises the Kavir and other deserts in the area. There are inscriptions at teppeh Sialk noting that a local queen had traveled to visit the ruler of a town (identified as Tell-i Bakun, southeast of Yazd) by \"sailing the sea\". Copious shorelines at various elevations still extant in the Kavir are telltale signs of the post-glacial, monsoonal lakes in central Iran, where desert now dominates.\n\nParagraph 11: The Ljubljanica has become a popular site for archaeologists and treasure hunters to dive for lost relics and artifacts. Locations in the river between Ljubljana and Vrhnika have offered up pieces of history from the Stone Age to the Renaissance, belonging to a variety of groups, from local ancient cultures to more well-known groups like the Romans and the Celts. One of the more significant findings is a yew spearhead, found in 2009 in Sinja Gorica. It has been dated to about 35,000 to 45,000 before present, the Szeletian period, and supplements the scant data about the presence of Stone Age hunters in the Ljubljana Marsh area.\n\nParagraph 12: Accuracy of glucose meters is a common topic of clinical concern. Blood glucose meters must meet accuracy standards set by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). According to ISO 15197 Blood glucose meters must provide results that are within ±15% of a laboratory standard for concentrations above 100 mg/dL or within ±15 mg/dL for concentrations below 100 mg/dL at least 95% of the time. However, a variety of factors can affect the accuracy of a test. Factors affecting accuracy of various meters include calibration of meter, ambient temperature, pressure use to wipe off strip (if applicable), size and quality of blood sample, high levels of certain substances (such as ascorbic acid) in blood, hematocrit, dirt on meter, humidity, and aging of test strips. Models vary in their susceptibility to these factors and in their ability to prevent or warn of inaccurate results with error messages. The Clarke Error Grid has been a common way of analyzing and displaying accuracy of readings related to management consequences. More recently an improved version of the Clarke Error Grid has come into use: It is known as the Consensus Error Grid. Older blood glucose meters often need to be \"coded\" with the lot of test strips used, otherwise, the accuracy of the blood glucose meter may be compromised due to lack of calibration.\n\nParagraph 13: For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity in action at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty. Lt. Col. Jackson distinguished himself as pilot of a C-123 aircraft. Lt. Col. Jackson volunteered to attempt the rescue of a 3-man USAF Combat Control Team from the Special Forces camp at Kham Duc. Hostile forces had overrun the forward outpost and established gun positions on the airstrip. They were raking the camp with small arms, mortars, light and heavy automatic weapons, and recoilless rifle fire. The camp was engulfed in flames and ammunition dumps were continuously exploding and littering the runway with debris. In addition, eight aircraft had been destroyed by the intense enemy fire and one aircraft remained on the runway reducing its usable length to only 2,200 feet. To further complicate the landing, the weather was deteriorating rapidly, thereby permitting only one air strike prior to his landing. Although fully aware of the extreme danger and likely failure of such an attempt. Lt. Col. Jackson elected to land his aircraft and attempt to rescue. Displaying superb airmanship and extraordinary heroism, he landed his aircraft near the point where the combat control team was reported to be hiding. While on the ground, his aircraft was the target of intense hostile fire. A rocket landed in front of the nose of the aircraft but failed to explode. Once the combat control team was aboard, Lt. Col. Jackson succeeded in getting airborne despite the hostile fire directed across the runway in front of his aircraft. Lt. Col. Jackson's profound concern for his fellow men, at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty are in keeping with the highest traditions of the U.S. Air Force and reflect great credit upon himself, and the Armed Forces of his country.\n\nParagraph 14: On December 3, 2018, Nexstar announced it would acquire the assets of Chicago-based Tribune Media—which has owned Fox affiliate KSTU (channel 13) since December 2013—for $6.4 billion in cash and debt. Nexstar is precluded from acquiring KSTU directly or indirectly, as FCC regulations prohibit common ownership of more than two stations in the same media market, or two or more of the four highest-rated stations in the market. (Furthermore, any attempt by Nexstar to assume the operations of KSTU through local marketing or shared services agreements may be subject to regulatory hurdles that could delay completion of the FCC and Justice Department's review and approval process for the acquisition.) As such, Nexstar will be required to sell either KSTU or KTVX to a separate, unrelated company to address the ownership conflict. (In the case of KSTU, reports preceding the purchase announcement stated that, as it did during the group's failed purchase by Sinclair, Fox Television Stations would seek to acquire certain Fox-affiliated stations owned by Tribune from the eventual buyer of that group. Also, as KUCW does not rank among the top four in total-day viewership and therefore is not in conflict with existing FCC in-market ownership rules, that station optionally can be retained by Nexstar regardless of whether it chooses to retain ownership of KTVX or sell KTVX in order to acquire KSTU or, should it be divested, be sold to the prospective buyer of KTVX.) On March 20, 2019, it was announced that Nexstar would keep the KTVX/KUCW duopoly and sell KSTU to the Cincinnati-based E. W. Scripps Company, marking Scripps' entry into Utah, as part of the company's sale of nineteen Nexstar- and Tribune-operated stations to Scripps and Tegna Inc. in separate deals worth $1.32 billion. The sale received FCC approval on September 16, 2019 and was ultimately consummated three days later.\n\nParagraph 15: Doreen begins her college career at Empire State University, majoring in computer science. Upon arriving, she ends up fighting Kraven the Hunter, who was lashing out at the local squirrels including Tippy Toe, whom he caught and was about to kill. She stops him by informing him of the existence of sea monsters like Giganto and challenges him to hunt them. Later, she discovers that Galactus is heading to Earth to devour it, and she steals Iron Man's armor and heads to the Moon with Tippy-Toe. On their way, they defeat Whiplash, who had attacked Squirrel Girl, mistaking her for Iron Man. She and Tippy-Toe surprisingly befriend Galactus instead of fighting him, and afterwards tell him of a planet that could sustain him even better than the Earth. This planet is devoid of intelligent life but rich in nuts, which Galactus has developed a new liking for. He then sends the two back home, and he leaves the Earth to live another day. When she arrives back home, her roommate Nancy Whitehead tells her that she has figured out she is a superhero, but promises not to tell anyone, the two becoming good friends. Later, Squirrel Girl and other superheroes defeat Mysterion, who was attacking Liberty Island with an army of robot dinosaurs. Shortly thereafter, while attempting to stop Hippo from robbing a bank, she meets Chipmunk Hunk and Koi Boi, both of whom have the ability to speak to different animals. Nancy reveals their secret identities (Tomas Lara-Perez and Ken Shiga, respectively) to her, since she easily recognized them under their masks. They later encounter a monstrous Asgardian squirrel god, Ratatoskr, who had been causing mayhem on the city by trash-talking its citizens during their sleep, but is defeated with help from Loki and the current and former Thor.\n\nParagraph 16: According to an article in The Essex Countryside of May 1965 by GC Harper, the house was once moated, and takes its name from its first owner who had it built, Robert de Fitzwilliam le Moigne in the early C14, but little but the SW wing remains from C15. It remained in that family for 200 years, then passed by marriage to William Gent. His son Thomas became MP for Maldon in 1571 and a 'trusted assistant' to Sir Francis Walsingham, Elizabeth 1's Secretary of State & spymaster, whence he rose to 2nd Baron of the Exchequer.  He sat in judgement at the trial of the conspirators of the Babington Plot to assassinate the Queen and replace her with Mary Queen of Scots. His wealth & status led him to rebuild the west front, completed by his son Henry, as he died in 1593. Thomas signed a petition to Walsingham requesting he write to the governors of the Dutch congregation in Colchester & demand that 20-30 families return to Halstead to resume the cloth trade there, but to no avail. George Gent d. 1818 was a magistrate for more than 60 years. The right to appoint the headmaster of the school in Steeple Bumpstead belonged until c.1835 to the owner of Moyns. The Moyns occupancy ceased in 1879 when it was sold to Major General Cecil Robert St John Ives, whose grandson John Bryce occupied it in the 1960s.  The gardens of the  200-acre estate had yew topiary, and the paths were said to be planted to a plan by Lord Bacon, with a bowling green one of the oldest.\n\nParagraph 17: In 1869, Adele Spitzeder founded her private bank in Dachauer Straße, which became known as Dachauer Banken. On 21 October 1876, the first Munich horse tram passed on its route from Promenadeplatz to Nymphenburger Straße/Burgfriedensgrenze (Maillingerstraße) the Dachauer Straße between Bahnhofplatz and Stiglmaierplatz. In 1898, the west bordering cemetery was built. In 1900 the tram route from 1876 was made electric. On the western side opposite the Bundeswehrverwaltungszentrum München (Army Administrative Center Munich), the Association for the Improvement of Housing in Munich built a small residential complex in the Ebenau district even before the First World War, which was used as one of the early examples of non-profit housing construction in Munich. In 1905, the current Heinz Naumann House (number 25) was built by Michael Reifenstuel, which then served as a posthospital. After the former gas works on the Thalkirchner road and the Kirchstein (now Vogelweideplatz) could not keep up with the growing gas demand of the city, the construction of the gas works Moosach, now number 148, began in 1906. On 25 July 1909, the new tram connection from Stiglmaier to Leonrodplatz was first used. In the restaurant \"Zum Deutschen Reich\", located on Dachauer Straße, the German Workers' Party organized meetings in 1919 and 1920, with Adolf Hitler as speaker. Between 1924 and 1929, the Borstei was built north of the Middle Ring. In 1928, depot 5 for trams was completed in the Dachauer Straße 104, which was put back into service in 1949 after the damages from the war were repaired and then shut down in 1977. After request of the realm aviation ministry from 1936, development too place on the current factory premises of MTU Aero Engines (Dachauer Straße 665) and MAN commercial vehicles (Dachauer Straße 667) another BMW factory, which produced the 801 engine starting in 1942. During the period of National Socialism, innumerable so-called protective prisoners were deported via the Dachauer Straße to the Dachau concentration camp. After a bomb attack by the Allies in 1943, the gas plant was severely damaged. The ordered demolition of the plant was prevented by the factory management. After the war, the plant had to be shut down for half a year because of the damages caused by the war. After the conversion of the gas supply to Roherd gas took place on 10 November 1975, the plant was closed. In 2008, sections of the tram tracks in Dachauer Straße were renewed.\n\nParagraph 18: After the first four episodes of Supernatural aired in 2005, the WB decided to pick up the series for a full season of 22 episodes. During those first episodes, the series was ranked third in males aged 18–34 and 12–34. It also posted an increase of 73% in males aged 18–49 from the year before, although it only gained 4% in total viewers, and retained 91% of viewers from its lead-in, Gilmore Girls. Supernatural had low ratings during its second season, with viewers consisting mainly of teen girls, and the CW trying to attract more male viewers. The show's future was in doubt at the end of the second season. Despite mediocre ratings in the previous year, it was back for a third season. Although its third season's rating were low, it did well with viewers aged 18–49. In this category, it ranked eighth of all returning series broadcast by a major network. The show received an early pickup for its fourth season. The show's ratings increased in its fourth season. The fourth-season premiere aired on September 18, 2008, averaging its highest rating ever since its debut on The CW with 3.96 million viewers, a 33% surge over the season three premiere and a 1.7/5 in adults 18–49, up 42% from one year earlier. On October 16, 2008, the show was watched by 3.06 million viewers, making the lowest rating for the season. On October 30, 2008, the show climbed to its best performance in adults 18–34 (1.4/4), adults 18–49 (1.5/4) and total viewers (3.6mil) since its season premiere on September 18, 2008. For the fifth-season premiere, viewership increased by 6% in women 18–34 (1.7/5) over the fourth-season premiere. However, taking DVR viewings into account with new Live-Plus 7 Day data, total viewership for the premiere increased 38%, with women 18–34 increasing by 35% and adults 18–34 by 47%.\n\nParagraph 19: Harry Wills (May 15, 1889 – December 21, 1958) was a heavyweight boxer who held the World Colored Heavyweight Championship three times. Many boxing historians consider Wills the most egregious victim of the \"color line\" drawn by white heavyweight champions.  Wills fought for over twenty years (1911–1932), and was ranked as the number one challenger for the throne, but was denied the opportunity to fight for the title. Of all the black contenders between the heavyweight championship reigns of Jack Johnson and Joe Louis, Wills came closest to securing a title shot. BoxRec ranks him among 10 best heavyweights in the world from 1913 to 1924, and as No.1 heavyweight from 1915 to 1917.\n\nParagraph 20: In 1868 before the birth of Dr. Jose Rizal, some settler of this place transferred their residence to the shoreline until the Balangiga Massacre happened on September 28, 1901. Some settlers from Balangiga transferred to the inhabitants community for they were afraid that the American forces might retaliate against them. The Population of this place increased in number and there came a man named SINGOY AMANTILLO, blessed with five children, namely BICARIO, MAURICIO ENRIQUE or “ IKING”, JACOBO alias “KA BUTA” and one known as LAMI. Then the family of a known man YSIDRO MISTA FERERAS came and settled here too. During the Spanish regime until late before the establishment of the commonwealth Republic, YSIDRO encouraged ENGRACIO AMANTILLO and MAURICIO AMANTILLO to change the name Umhanan to tinawgan to sitio Lipata, because of its numerous Lipata trees growing around and later on because of its recognition, As the gradual transition of time, leaping incidents continued its way for another generation of men. There came another famous man, BICARIO AMNATILLO, the famous fierce and brave soldier who was widely known throughout the Province of Samar as a revolutionary leader during the Filipino-American Revolution. He organized the resident of sitio Lipata for mutual defense against the Muslim bandits and other enemies. He worked also for the improvements of the sitio until the time of his capture. His right-hand man. YSIDRO M. FERRERAS, the contemporary revolutionary leaderalso fierce, diplomatic and gallant magistrate, succeeded him. He successfully worked for the improvement of this sitio for the welfare of this fellowmen. After the defeat of the Filipino by the American soldiers during the revolutionary era, civil government of the Philippine started as well as the American regime. The growth of the population in sitio Lipata has rapidly increased where in prominent figures came under the leadership of YSIDRO. They decided to settle in a barrio called Hilaba instead of sitio Lipata due to its considerable wider level of land area and hill in the middle where it was available for a church to be constructed. However, majority of the residents of sitio Lipata retracted the proposal on the ground that it was more difficult especially for bancas to reach the ashore at low tide. Finally Ysidro decided to convert sitio Lipata into the barrio Sto Niño of Basey Samar. Ysidro was elected as Mayor of basey, while Engracio was elected as Municipal Vice-Mayor and likewise, Mauricio was elected as the Cabeza del Barrio Sto. Niño. When the world war 11 broke out on December 7, 1941, the elementary Education in Barrio Sto. Niño was temporarily closed until the war ended in the year 1944. Early in 1949, the same mayor showed his never ending spirit of leadership when he submitted a proposal to President Elpidio Quirino for the conversion of Barrio Sto. Niño into a Municipality. On July 22, 1949, through the help of the late speaker of the house of Representative, Hon. Lorenzo Perez, Executive Order No. 247 was issued and signed by the President Creating the Municipality of Marabut, Samar in Honor of the late Cogressman SERAFIN MARABUT, a native of Basey, Samar. Ysidro M. Ferreras was elected as the first Municipal Mayor and Engracio Amantillo as the vice Mayor. Municipality of Marabut is composed of 14 barangays. Namely; San Roque, Tag-Alag, Legaspi, Caluayan, Tinabanan, Osmena, Canyoyo, Binocyahan, Odoc, Pinana-an, Sto. Nino (Pobl), Lipata, Amambucale, and Pinamitinan. A year later during the time of late mayor Macario Ferreras, through Municipal Ordinance, Poblacion Marabut was divided into four barangays. Amantillo, Sto. Nino, Catato, and Lipata. Brgy. Pinamitinan was divided into three barangays, Sta. Rita and Malobago, Brgy. Odoc was divided into two barangays, the brgy. Ferreras, Brgy. Binocyahan was divided into two barangays, brgy. Logero. Osmenia was divided into four, brgy. Mabuhay, Rono, and Panan-awan. Legaspi was divided into two, brgy. Veloso. Now Marabut has 24 barangays after all. The first barangay captain of brgy. Amantillo was Amado A. Opena. Henceforth, Brgy. Amantillo, Marabut has produced sons and daughters who are committed to hold the dreams of their forefather and turn them into magnificent realties.\n\nParagraph 21: Christmas traditions for many nations include the installing and lighting of Christmas trees, the hanging of Advent wreaths, Christmas stockings, candy canes, setting out cookies and milk, and the creation of Nativity scenes depicting the birth of Jesus Christ. Christmas carols may be sung and stories told about such figures as the Baby Jesus, St Nicholas, Santa Claus, Father Christmas, Christkind or Grandfather Frost. The sending and exchange of Christmas card greetings, observance of fasting and special religious observances such as a midnight Mass or Vespers on Christmas Eve, the burning of a Yule log, and the giving and receiving of presents are also common practice. Along with Easter, Christmas is one of the most important periods on the Christian calendar, and is often closely connected to other holidays at this time of year, such as Advent, the Feast of the Immaculate Conception, St Nicholas Day, St. Stephen's Day, New Year's, and the Feast of the Epiphany.\n\nParagraph 22: Jalaluddin Al-Suyuti, co-author of the classical Sunni tafsīr known as Tafsir al-Jalalayn, suggests that some of the sūrahs have been named using incipits (i.e. the first few words of the surah). Hamiduddin Farahi a celebrated Islamic scholar of Indian subcontinent is known for his groundbreaking work on the concept of Nazm, or Coherence, in the Quran. He writes that Some sūrahs have been given names after some conspicuous words used in them. The Surah takes its name from its first word al-qariah. This is not only a name but also the title of its subject matter, for the Surah is devoted to the day of Resurrection -Abul A'la Maududi.\n\nParagraph 23: The Imperial Gazetteer defined the architectural design of the cathedral as \"Indo-Gothic\", to mean a Gothic architectural style built to meet the climatic conditions of India. It was also called a \"spurious gothic adapted to the exigencies of the Indian climate.\" The cathedral's design, otherwise known as Gothic Revival style, includes three stained-glass windows and two frescoes in the Florentine Renaissance style; the West Window was created by Morris & Co. to a design by Sir Edward Burne-Jones. The nave of the cathedral is very long at , and its width is . The nave is fitted with well-crafted wooden pews and chairs. The central spire rises to a height of , and the tower on which it stands is square in shape and was patterned on the lines of the 12th-century Canterbury Cathedral, England. The tower was fitted with five clocks, each of which weighed about three tons. The stained-glass windows on the western side were the creation of Sir Edward Burne-Jones, a pre-Raphaelite master, which were fitted in half-sunk arches; these were designed in 1880 in memory of Lord Mayo who was assassinated in the Andaman Islands. When completed in 1847, the cathedral as a whole was compared to Norwich Cathedral in England. The East window, which had original stained glass, was destroyed by a cyclone in 1964. It was replaced with a new one in 1968. The roof of the cathedral (it was the largest span when built) is in the shape of a shallow curve arching over iron trusses decorated with Gothic tracery. The nave of the cathedral is built spaciously without any aisles on its flanks. The materials used in the construction of the cathedral consisted of special bricks, light in weight and with good compression strength. The ashlars used were of Chunar stone. The external and internal surfaces of the cathedral were plastered with fine chunam (lime plaster) in the form of stucco.\n\nParagraph 24: Ankober was formerly the capital of the Ethiopian kingdom of Shewa founded by Yekuno Amlak in the thirteenth century. Buildings that survive from the Shewa period include the Kidus Mikael Church, built by Sahle Selassie. According to Philip Briggs, all that survives of Menelik's palace, which he had built on the site of his father's palace, is \"one long stone-and-mortar wall measuring some 1.5m high.\" Briggs comments that it is \"difficult to say why this one wall should have survived virtually intact when the rest of the palace crumbled into virtual oblivion.\" Ankober is also known as where the endemic Ankober serin was first observed by ornithologists in 1979.\n\nParagraph 25: Predecessor units trace their origins to 1795, and since 1949 Royal Newfoundland Regiment has been a unit of the Canadian Army. During the First World War the battalion-sized Newfoundland Regiment was the only North American unit to fight in the Gallipoli campaign of 1915. Later in the war the regiment was virtually wiped out at Beaumont Hamel on July 1, 1916, the first day of the Battle of the Somme, but was rebuilt and continued to serve throughout France and Belgium until the armistice, serving as part of the British Army of the Rhine in 1919. In December 1917, George V bestowed the regiment with the right to use the prefix royal before its name. It was the only military unit to receive this honour during the First World War.\n\nParagraph 26: Elephunk is a hip hop and pop album which incorporates an array of genres, such as R&B, Latin, funk, dancehall, rock and dance. It explores lyrical themes such as partying, sex, infatuation and, to a lesser extent, social issues. The album opens with the horn-infused \"Southern-fried rapid rap\" song \"Hands Up\". The trumpet-driven \"Labor Day (It's a Holiday)\" lyrically celebrates an alcohol and sex-filled three-day weekend. \"Let's Get Retarded\" encourages its listeners to party with lines such as \"Lose your mind, this is the time / Y'all can't stand still, twist and bang your spine / Bob your head like epilepsy / Up inside the club or in your Bentley\". Its censored version \"Let's Get It Started\" replaces the terms \"retarded\" and \"epilepsy\", and replaces the original track on the 2022 reissue. The dancehall track \"Hey Mama\" features a male protagonist expressing his attraction to a woman. \"Shut Up\" details an argument between two lovers leading up to the end of their relationship. The sixth track \"Smells Like Funk\" describes an odor-filled environment and insinuates cannabis consumption. \"Latin Girls\" is a guitar riff-laced song incorporating Latin piano and percussion, and lyrically celebrates Hispanic women. Jazz-influenced \"Sexy\" sees the male protagonist express his love and admiration towards his female love interest prior to having sex with her.", "answers": ["Paragraph 5"], "length": 7068, "dataset": "passage_retrieval_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "75af1e1d5ca8b10eaaef234354b68ae5a94ec40041bfeb97"}
{"input": "The text provides a chronological list of various bands and artists that have performed at New Brookland Tavern, a concert venue in South Carolina, from 2010 to 2022. It includes artists from different genres, such as rock, punk, metal, and electronic. Due to COVID-19, several concerts were canceled, and the venue held online live stream concerts instead. Some notable performers mentioned include Anberlin, Hawthorne Heights, The Red Jumpsuit Apparatus, Saliva, Underoath, Tenille Townes, The Casualties, Bad Brains, and Corey Feldman.", "context": "Paragraph 1: Sakurai took responsibility for writing the game's story and script himself. With video game stories, Sakurai believes that developers lack an ability to balance story-based gameplay hindrances with the prerequisite of victory over enemies. To this end, he was obsessed with striking that balance with Uprising, and so wrote the entire story script himself. He did this so he could write a story that \"jibed\" with the flow and style of gameplay. The characters' roles and personalities were shaped by their roles in the game and the game structure itself. He also wanted the dialogue to mesh perfectly with the story and music: by writing the script himself, Sakurai was able to sidestep the necessity of explaining to another writer all the time. This also made fine tuning much easier for him. While retaining the first game's Greek mythic influences, the mythology itself had no direct influence on the story of Uprising. Sakurai also wanted to make sure that the game's Greek influence did not stray in the same direction as the God of War series. For the main story, Sakurai avoided portraying a simple good versus evil situation; instead, he had the various factions coming into conflict due to clashing views rather than openly malicious intentions, with their overlapping conflicts creating escalating levels of chaos for players to experience. Rather than relying on standalone cutscenes, the majority of story dialogue was incorporated into gameplay. What cutscenes there were, were made as short as possible. Events after Chapter 6 were deliberately kept secret during the run-up to release so players would be taken by surprise by what they experienced. The character of Palutena, a damsel in distress in the original game, was reworked as Pit's partner and support. The original idea was for Pit to have a mascot character as his support, but was abandoned in favor of Palutena. Pit and Palutena's dialogue was influenced by the traditions of Japanese double acts. Dark Pit was written as a mirror image of Pit rather than an evil twin. A key element was retaining the humorous elements from the first game, such as anachronistic elements and silly enemy designs. This attitude, as observed by Sakurai, contrasted sharply with the weighty or grim character stories present in the greater majority of video games. The story was originally three chapters longer than the final version, but these additional parts needed to be cut during early development.\n\nParagraph 2: The course is  in length, meaning full runners ran two laps and half runners ran one lap before entering the 1.54 mile oval.  The course started in the parking lot behind the Jimmie Johnson Grandstand (had been known as the Winners before June 2020; named for the 2019 Boston Marathon celebrity finisher) on Mount Pleasant Road.  Runners take the start in the parking lot on Mount Pleasant Road, crossing Perimeter Road, before starting the lap by turning right on Speedway Boulevard before a right turn on Wilkins Road, going south before crossing the turnaround past Perimeter Road and run north up Wilkins Road, running north, leaving Speedway premises before another turnaround just past Mount Pleasant Road where runners again run on the opposite direction, turning right on Speedway Boulevard and passing through Atlanta Speedway Airport.  Runners follow Speedway before turning left at Lower Woolsey Road, where runners proceed to the entrance ramp from Georgia 20, where another turnaround occurs.  From Lower Woolsey, runners jut right into the Weaver parking lot where the course splits on the second and third laps.  On the first two laps, runners then turn right on Speedway Boulevard where before turning right at the Turn 3 tunnel access road before a quick left to Richard Petty Boulevard.  From Richard Petty Boulevard, runners turn left to Perimeter Road where the course turns left where runners cross the Tara Place condominiums and run on the road before making a right and a left past the end of the frontstretch grandstands.  Returning to Outer Perimeter Road to concluded the lap, full marathoners turned right on Speedway Boulevard to start the second lap.  At the end of the second lap, runners turn left to Speedway Boulevard and follow it to Lower Woolsey Road and continue route as the previous two laps until they reach the Weaver parking lot.  Instead of turning right on Speedway Boulevard, they turn left to follow a service vehicle road that rings around Turns 1 and 2 of the speedway oval before turning left on the service vehicle road, followed by a turnaround that allows runners to access the Turn 1-2 tunnel that enters the speedway, making a short run through the Flock Brothers Corral infield camping area before entering the speedway at the road course exit for a traditional finish to the marathon reminiscent of athletics, with runners making 1 3/4 laps around the speedway, returning to pit lane where the finish line runs parallel to the start-finish line of the speedway.\n\nParagraph 3: Later she returns to her kingdom after being called by her dying father, King Olaf, who wants to make her his successor to the throne of their kingdom when he dies. However her father passes away during his sleep and is Ice's brother, Ewald, that becomes the successor to the throne, yet, Ewald's evil intentions become quite clear as he begins to assert control of what is not rightfully his. As it turns out, Ewald had been in contact with a powerful entity who considered himself a celestial force beyond good and evil, with the purpose to \"act when judgment has been passed\" (later revealed to be the villainous Overmaster, an alien being who destroys worlds he does not find worthy). The JLA set out to rescue Ice and when they reach her kingdom they discover that Ewald's power has increased due to an ancient staff he carries, and he is controlling the people of the kingdom. As they come near to Ewald, they find themselves under attack from ancient Norwegian giants summoned by Ewald to do his bidding. In the midst of battle Booster Gold's new armour shorts out, leaving both him and Blue Beetle running for cover. Guy and Fire lead the mission to rescue Ice from her brother while the rest of the Leaguers battle the mythic giants summoned by Ewald. One by one, the weapons that the giants hold are destroyed, and this removes the creatures' power as well. A similar tactic is tried on Ewald, causing his staff to overload and explode, killing him. Ice is free to take the throne of her kingdom, but believes the people should choose a leader for themselves – she leaves to rejoin her friends in the Justice League.\n\nParagraph 4: CNET's Jeff Bakalar felt that the game encouraged players to engage with all three characters. Edge found that switching players helped avoid long travel times to mission start points. Because of the switching mechanic, Game Informer Matt Bertz noted that players are kept \"in the thick of the action\" during shootouts. Eurogamer Tom Bramwell wrote that switching added a tactical element to shootouts as characters set up in strategic outposts would cause fewer \"shooting gallery\" situations than previous instalments. IGN MacDonald felt the switching feature gave players more choice in their approach and made missions less predictable.Giant Bomb Jeff Gerstmann considered the heist missions a welcome deviation from series typical mission structure. Eurogamer Bramwell likened them to \"blockbuster set-pieces\", and GameSpot Carolyn Petit cited the 1995 film Heat as a stylistic influence on their design. Joystiq Xav de Matos felt creativity and methodical approaches were encouraged. Polygon Chris Plante likened rapid character switching during heist missions to \"film editing, with the player serving as editor, switching rapidly to the most interesting perspective for any moment\". Computer and Video Games Andy Kelly felt that overall mission design was more diverse than and lacked the escort errands of its predecessors.Edge praised the game's graphical fidelity and absence of load screens. Play complimented the draw distances and weather and lighting systems. Eurogamer Bramwell considered the lighting system to be the game's most significant advancement. Official Xbox Magazine (OXM's Mikel Reparaz thought that the game was \"probably the Xbox 360's greatest technical achievement\", and was surprised that the open world could render on the console. Reviewers lauded the open-world design, some further complimenting the game for streamlining Los Angeles' geography into a well-designed city space. GameTrailers Brandon Jones considered the Los Angeles emulation authentic and the open world \"full of voice and personality\". IGN and PlayStation Official Magazine (OPM made favourable comparisons between Los Santos and Grand Theft Auto IV Liberty City. OXM Reparez felt Los Santos surpassed the \"grey and gritty\" Liberty City. Reviewers praised the world's satire of contemporary American culture—OPM Joel Gregory opined that \"the scathing social commentary is, of course, present and correct\".Destructoid Jim Sterling called the sound design \"impeccable\" and praised the actors' performances, original soundtrack and licensed music use. IGN and Giant Bomb commended the music selection and felt that the original score enhanced dramatic tension during missions. GameSpot Petit wrote that the score \"lends missions more cinematic flavour\". Edge said that the licensed music enhanced the city's \"already remarkable sense of space\" and that the original score improved the atmosphere of the gameplay. They summarised the game as \"a compendium of everything Rockstar has learnt about the power of game music in the past decade\".\n\nParagraph 5: In the 5th century, a dispute arose between Cyril of Alexandria and Nestorius in which Nestorius claimed that the term theotokos could not be used to describe Mary, the mother of Christ. Nestorius argued for two distinct substances or hypostases, of divinity and humanity, in Christ. He maintained that divinity could not be born from a human because the divine nature is unoriginate. The Council of Ephesus in 431, under the leadership of Cyril himself as well as the Ephesian bishop Memnon, labeled Nestorius a neo-adoptionist, implying that the man Jesus is divine and the Son of God only by grace and not by nature, and deposed him as a heretic. In his letter to Nestorius, Cyril used the term \"hypostatic\" (Greek, καθ᾽ ὑπόστασιν kath' hypóstasin) to refer to Christ's divine and human natures being one, saying, “We must follow these words and teachings, keeping in mind what ‘having been made flesh’ means .... We say ... that the Word, by having united to himself hypostatically flesh animated by a rational soul, inexplicably and incomprehensibly became man.” Cyril also stressed on “μία φύσις τοῦ θεοῦ λόγου σεσαρκωμένη, meaning \"one physis of the Word of God made flesh\" (or \"... of God the Word made flesh\")”\n\nParagraph 6: Following Hezbollah and FPM's boycott of the four previous sessions to choose a president, the FPM said that it would not attend the fifth session at the end of May unless an agreement over a consensus candidate is made. The round was then aborted. The sixth attempt, on 9 June, also failed for a lack of a quorum after FPM and Hezbollah maintained their boycott. The session was attended by a new low of 64 MPs, notably PSP leader Walid Jumblatt missed this session, which was his first during the process. The Daily Star suggested that, instead, the main interest on the day was a salary increase for MPs. The eighth round similarly failed to achieve a quorum, and a ninth round was scheduled for 23 July. Similarly, the ninth round failed to attain a quorum while Lebanese Forces MP Strida Geagea said she held rival Christian MPs responsible for the failure to elect a president Berri's spokesman, Mohammad Ballout, read out a statement saying that the election was canceled \"over lack of quorum.\" Berri set 2 September as the date for the next vote. Thirty minutes after the session began there were only 57 MPs present while Berri and Salaam were absent. Hezbollah MP Ali Fayyad reiterated that \"the political stance on the presidential election has not changed. What is required is an agreement among the political parties on a conciliatory candidate for the presidency.\" Once again, the 11th round failed or a lack of quorum with only 50 of 86 necessary MPs present. Berri postponed the election to 9 October over a lack of quorum. The 13th round failed as well for lack of quorum, after only about 58 of the minimum 86 MPs were present. Berri set the 14th round for 29 October. The 15th round also failed for lack of quorum with Berri setting 10 December for the next round. The 27th round failed on 12 August 2015, with the next round set for 2 September. The 34th round failed on 16 December 2015, with the next round set for 7 January. The 35th round failed on 7 January 2016, with the next round set for 8 February. The 36th round failed on 8 February 2016, with the next round set for 2 March. The 37th round failed on 2 March 2016, with the next round set for 23 March. The 38th round failed on 23 March 2016, with the next round set for 18 April. The 39th round failed on 18 April 2016, with the next round set for 10 May. The 44th round failed on 7 September 2016, with the next round set for 28 September.\n\nParagraph 7: In 2010, Florida's Anberlin played there, Ohio's Hawthorne Heights, Ohio's Black Veil Brides, Charleston's hard rock Deepfield, Ice Nine Kills, and In This Moment (with a female lead singer). In 2011, they had Frank Turner and The Joy Formidable (both from the UK), MUTEMATH, mewithoutYou, and Columbia's chillwave musician Toro y Moi. In 2012, they had Hartsville's Sent by Ravens, Florida's New Found Glory, early 00s band Smile Empty Soul, and mid-90s band Sponge. From 2013 to 2016 they had bands like Emery with Jacksonville's The Red Jumpsuit Apparatus in '15, L.A.'s Capital Cities, Atlanta's Cartel, Chapel Hill's Southern Culture on the Skids, Jimmy Eat World's Jim Adkins, Sleeper Agent, Ohio's Foxy Shazam in '14, We Came as Romans in '14, I Am Dynamite, Family of the Year, Middle Class Rut in '13, Nico Vega, Crash Kings, Knuckle Puck in '14, and NC's Rainbow Kitten Surprise in '16. In 2017, it hosted Chicago 90s band Local H (who also played there in '04), Atlanta's '68 (band), and Ocala's Wage War. In 2019, it hosted 90s horror punk band The Independents from Florence, electronic rock band eleventyseven from Laurens, death metal band Through the Eyes of the Dead also from Florence, and Adelitas Way. In 2020, the White Reaper concert on St. Patrick's Day was cancelled due to COVID-19. New Brookland Tavern had no concerts from late March until September 23, 2020, due to COVID-19 (concert venues were closed in all of SC). They did have 2 online live stream concerts in April and June, and actor Drake Bell's concert became livestreamed to New Brookland. On August 31, 2021, Hawthorne Heights returned to New Brookland with the female The Bombpops. In October they had a circus tent side show. In December 2021, Charleston's Susto played there. In late February 2022, New Brookland had The Red Jumpsuit Apparatus again, and had Greenville's nu metal band Islander in March. 00s band Saliva played there in June. Aaron Gillespie and Spencer Chamberlain of Underoath played there for 2 different concerts, and country singer Tenille Townes performed in August. September 3, 2022 saw 90s NYC street punks The Casualties headlining with new lead singer David Tejas. H.R. of 80s hardcore punk legends Bad Brains performed there in 2022. Actor Corey Feldman performed music there in 2022. Cove Reber (formerly of Saosin) played there in '22 with his new band Dead American.\n\nParagraph 8: Sahibzada Ajit Singh Nagar is a Municipal Corporation, with Kulwant Singh as the first mayor, with the current being Amarjoit Singh since April 2021. The district administration is under the supervision of Current Administrator Gurpreet Kaur Sapra, Deputy Commissioner (IAS). Sahibzada Ajit Singh Nagar is part of Anandpur Sahib Parliamentary Constituency, represented by Manish Tewari since 2019, while in Punjab Legislative Assembly, Sahibzada Ajit Singh Nagar is represented since 2012 by MLA Balbir Singh Sidhu from Congress. Before 2012, Sahibzada Ajit Singh Nagar was part of the Kharar Assembly Constituency. In the 2012 Punjab Legislative Assembly election, a new Assembly Constituency was carved out in the name of Mohali (as Sahibzada Ajit Singh Nagar was known during Assembly Elections 2012). Sahibzada Ajit Singh Nagar is also represented in Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) by Paramjit Kaur Landran and Hardeep Singh. The seat was reserved for women during the 2011 SGPC Elections.\n\nParagraph 9: In the 2000s, Jones began building a substantial body of photography work, concentrating primarily on landscapes. More recently, he traveled to southeast Asia, taking many portraits of villagers and religious Buddhist art.  In 2005, he recorded the EP, “BossAmerioca,” the first of its kind in which American and British popular songs that had been originally influenced by bossa nova in the 1960s, were redone by Jones with some top shelf Brazilian musicians such as Debora Watts, Dionisio Santos, Leco Reis and Helio Schiavo as well as the American jazz virtuosi Joel Frahm and Tim Collins. It was recorded in New York and he hopes to record many more songs that he has already arranged for these CD’s.  The authenticity of the EP was highly praised by many of the surviving original creators of bossa nova including Roberto Menescal, Carlos Lyra and Marcos Valle, and was played for audiences at both Toca do Vinicius, the bossa nova museum and store in Ipanema, and at the Vinicius Piano Bar in Ipanema, which is the most venerable existing standard bearer of bossa nova. The following year, he was asked to compose music for the off-Broadway play, \"The City That Cried Wolf,\" by the State of Play Theater Group at the New York Fringe Festival. He also was commissioned to compose music for several websites. In 2009, he assembled a third version of the group \"Sound Sculpture\" with Rob Thomas once again on violin, Ken Filiano on bass, Jay Rosen on drums and Joe Cruz on percussion, and performed at the world-famous Iridium Jazz Club in New York City. The concert received rave reviews and was recorded on both CD and DVD. The poet Jeff Schwartz documented the event in an original poem, which was eventually published in The Oakland Review.  Jones completed an important scholarly study on a work by Bob Dylan’s, entitled “Visions of Visions of Johanna,” which he is planning on publishing. In November and December 2011, one of his music compositions “Voyage Espagnole” was performed in Dallas by Bruce Patti of the Dallas Symphony Orchestra, and 2 different pianists.  It was also given to Chick Corea as a gift for his 70th birthday at the Blue Note Jazz Club.  And his collection of poetry, “The Cry of the Lonely, the Song of the Poet: Collected Poems 1971–2006” is due to be published in the spring of 2012.  Also being released in spring of 2012 is the CD, “Memories of the Future,” recently discovered virtuoso solo piano works originally recorded in 1981 and 1985 in Cleveland and New York.  Jones has been teaching the Chinese internal martial arts to private students and has given workshops throughout the world for many years. He intends to expand his involvement in teaching these arts in order to both keep the insights and achievements of past masters alive, and to help others attain good physical and mental health as well as quality, effective self-defense abilities.\n\nParagraph 10: In the 1950s, Thumboo wrote mostly lyrical poetry based on personal experiences. Displaying the influence of the English literary tradition on him, they dealt with aesthetic and metaphysical themes. By the mid-1970s, he had shifted his focus to the public sphere, believing that poets of post-independence Singapore should work towards creating a national literature. Singapore's national life was a key subject of his collection of poetry Gods Can Die (1977), and it has been said that the subsequent anthologies Ulysses by the Merlion (1979) and A Third Map (1993) \"established his reputation as a national poet committed to articulating a cultural vision for a multicultural Singapore\". Thumboo is often dubbed Singapore's unofficial poet laureate because of his poems with nationalistic themes, notably 9 August – II (1977), and Ulysses by the Merlion (1979) which was published in the anthology of the same name, as well as his role in promoting Singapore literature, for example, through his work as General Editor of the literary journal Singa. Ulysses, which references an iconic statue of a beast with the upper body of a lion and the tail of a fish called the Merlion that faces Marina Bay, was inspired by the use of Irish mythology and history by W. B. Yeats. The Irish poet has asserted a significant influence on Thumboo, as Thumboo recognizes parallels between Ireland's nationalistic struggle and Singapore's breakaway from colonialism. He describes himself as a myth-inspired poet, and sees myths as ancient narratives and structures which provide a stable point of reference for a multicultural society. Ulysses has prompted other Singaporean poets such as Alfian Sa'at, Vernon Chan, David Leo, Felix Cheong, Gwee Li Sui, Koh Buck Song, Lee Tzu Pheng, Alvin Pang and Daren Shiau to write their own Merlion-themed verses; it is often joked that one cannot be regarded as a true Singapore poet until one has written a \"Merlion poem\". A copy of Ulysses is installed on a plaque near the statue.\n\nParagraph 11: After long training and practice, Zinga becomes an international opera star and succeeds in all kind of concerts and dramas. This brings him wealth and fame that he has never dreamt of. Yet he feels alienated from his African past, always being sarcastic towards his slave-born identity as his being referred as the Negro King. One day after a great performance, Zinga is instructed to give a speech about what he feels about his success. Not good at public speaking, he sings an old song derived from his long lost childhood memory that he barely remembers and into which has to put some words. In the song, he himself is regarded as a ‘wanderer’ and ‘hears the cold felt by his people’. John has a feeling that by singing the song he may find out some information about his origins, which means much to him. The result does not fail him. The song is moving and invokes one of the audience's memories about the song. He comes to the dressing room at the back of the stage and talk to John about what he knows. John then finds out that his ancestor belongs to the island of Casanga, located on the west coast of Africa. The man from the audience, Pele, was the only white man to escape from the island since it was dominated by a brutal queen, and it is now ruled by a wicked witch doctor. And the song John sang was the secret song passed on by every king, regarded as the \"Song of Freedom\" of the Casanga people. Pele also tells Zinga the medallion hanging on his neck, which he got from his father and his father had from his great-grandfather, is the symbol of the kingship-----he, John Zinga, is the king of his people. Hearing that his people are still uncivilized on the island, Zinga's idea of going back to his homeland to help his people became even more fixed. At this time Donizetti happens to come in and tells John some good news - a new contract to work in the great New York City. Zinga refuses to go to New York to carry on his singing career, since he considers his people bigger than his success. Donizetti is mad about Zinga leaving his career, but cannot stop him from crossing the ocean to come to the little island in Africa.\n\nParagraph 12: In the offseason preceding the 2022 season, the team made several roster changes. They elected not to exercise their option to retain support player Lee \"Jecse\" Seung-soo and hitscan specialist Kim \"Pine\" Do-hyeon, and support player Kim \"Rapel\" Jun-keun retired from professional Overwatch. They signed three free agents: support player Han \"ChiYo\" Hyeon-seok, damage player Kang \"guriyo\" Min-seo, and hitscan specialist Kim \"Edison\" Tae-hoon. The Fuel's first match of the 2022 season resulted in a loss to the Houston Outlaws in the Kickoff Clash qualifiers. Throughout the Kickoff Class qualifiers, the Fuel found success running a team composition around Hanbin on Zarya and Edison on Reaper, allowing them to win their next five matches and claim the second seed in the Western Kickoff Clash tournament. The Fuel dropped to the lower bracket of the double-elimination tournament but ran through the lower bracket and reached the finals, where they ultimately lost to the Los Angeles Gladiators. In the second tournament cycle of the season, the Midseason Madness, the Fuel were swept in their first two qualifying matches, as their Zarya-Reaper composition from the Kickoff Clash was no longer viable due to a balance patch that shifted the meta. However, the team went on to win their next four matches and claimed the third seed, and a first-round bye, in the Midseason Madness tournament. However, Dallas made an early exit from the tournament after losing to the Shanghai Dragons and Philadelphia Fusion in their first two matches. In the Summer Showdown, the third tournament cycle of the season, the league saw another meta shift with the release of Overwatch 2 newest hero, Junker Queen. With Hanbin playing as one of the league's best Junker Queens, the Fuel finished the Summer Showdown qualifiers snapping the San Francisco Shock's 20-game regular season winning streak and claiming the top seed in the Western Summer Showdown tournament with a perfect 6–0 record in the qualifiers. The Fuel went undefeated in the tournament, finishing it with a 4–0 win over the Shock in the finals, and claimed their first tournament title of the season. The team finished the regular season as the top seed in the Western region with 26 league points, 20 wins, and 4 losses. Additionally, Kwon \"Fielder\" Joon, ChiYo and Hanbin were awarded Role Star commendations at the end of the regular season for the support, support, and tank roles, respectively. In the playoffs, the league saw another meta shift, with the release of the hero Kiriko, and Dallas elected to bring back Lee \"Fearless\" Eui-seok into the starting roster over Hanbin, with Fearless playing Winston. With a bye to the second round of the upper bracket, the Fuel selected the twelfth-seeded Hangzhou Spark as their first opponent; Dallas defeated them by a score of 3–1. Next, they swept the fourth-seeded Seoul Dynasty, 3–0, in the upper bracket semifinals. In the upper bracket finals, the Fuel faced their in-state rivals, the Outlaws. Dallas lost the first map of the match but went on to win the following three, defeating the Outlaws, 3–1, and advanced to the Grand Finals. The Fuel faced the Shock in the Grand Finals match. The match went to seven maps; Dallas defeated San Francisco by a score of 4–3 to claim their first OWL championship title. Fearless was named the OWL Grand Finals MVP.\n\nParagraph 13: Both the UK and the U.S. claimed sovereignty over the islands since the mid–19th century. The official British claim was formally reasserted on 6 August 1936, and in March 1937 the islands were attached to its Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony; establishing a radio station on Canton on 31 August 1937. In June 1937 a spat occurred at Canton between USS Avocet and HMS Wellington and their crews. In response, on 26 July President Roosevelt approved a U.S. Navy plan to occupy Canton, and on 3 March 1938 formally reasserted the United States claim, placing Canton and Enderbury under the control of the Department of the Interior. Seven U.S. citizens from the American Equatorial Islands Colonization Project landed on Canton on 7 March. To resolve these conflicting claims, the two governments signed an agreement on 6 April 1939 providing for joint administration over the islands without prejudice to the claims of either side.\n\nParagraph 14: Meanwhile, the construction work continued on the planned route. To the east of the tunnel, the Hunters Point Avenue subway station went up to the level of the Hunterspoint Avenue LIRR station. Immediately east of it was a ramp up to the elevated subway towards Queensboro Plaza. Hunters Point Avenue opened on February 15, 1916, and on November 5 of the same year, it was extended to Queensboro Plaza. Because the line did not have track connections to the rest of the IRT network, a provisional maintenance workshop was operated at the tunnel ramp until 1928. To the west, construction began in 1922. The tunnel was extended to Fifth Avenue on March 23, 1926, and Times Square on March 14, 1927. When Belmont modified the IRT Flushing Line to extend to Times Square and to Flushing, it was found that the loops could not be used for the extensions. The loops on the Queens side of the tunnel were obliterated in the wake of new construction. The loop on the Manhattan side, however, is intact and occupied by maintenance rooms, although the ceiling third rail still exists in the loop. The line from Times Square to Flushing was completed in 1928, when the station at Flushing opened.\n\nParagraph 15: In 1988, the band was signed to EMI Manhattan, and they began recording their self-titled debut album Vixen, which was released on August 31. Singer-songwriter Richard Marx co-wrote with Fee Waybill and arranged their signature hit, \"Edge of a Broken Heart\" and produced the song. Marx had nothing to do with their follow-up CD, since he was becoming more of a mainline singer than songwriter. Vixen spent the next year touring the world, supporting acts such as Ozzy Osbourne, Scorpions, and Bon Jovi, as well as headlining their own shows. The band returned to the studio in late 1989/early 1990 to record their follow-up album, Rev It Up, which was released in July 1990. A year of touring followed, including headlining their own shows and supporting acts such as KISS and Deep Purple. After the tour concluded in mid-1991, the group disbanded in 1992 due to musical differences.\n\nParagraph 16: Phylidor was dressed in black and led the visitors into a small darkened room with dazzling white walls, in which a rectangular area was fenced off with a construction of slats with a metal hand on each end. In the center of a chalk circle on the floor were a wand and a small lantern on a folded long black cloth. A container with almost burned out coals stood next to it. Phylidor asked the spectators not to speak, move or touch anything since they were surrounded by terrible dangers. He advised them to hold each other's hands and the ones on the end to hold the metal hands in order not to fall over and as a protection against the dangers. Von der Reck asked the man next to him to let go of his hand, because he suspected the metal hands could be used to give them an electric shock. Phylidor then extinguished the lantern, leaving only the very weak light of the coals. Soon thick white odorous smoke started to spread across the room and Phylidor started the ritual. It included some incantations in a dull but commanding voice with the words \"Helion, Melion, Tetragrammaton\" (as reportedly used by Cagliostro), some French sentences like \"Parois. Esprit terrible! Esprit terrible, épargne moi!\" and the name of Jehovah mixed in repeatedly. A terrible thunder-like noise filled the room and as Phylidor called out: \"Esprit, parois!\" (Ghost, appear!), a streak of light appeared on the wall that gradually transformed into the (almost) life-size figure of Voltaire, dressed in white and hovering a foot above the floor. Some spectators complained that this was a very poor apparition and clearly a projection of some transparent picture. Phylidor commanded the spirit to disappear and soon an apparition of Frederick the Great followed. When some visitors complained that the facial features weren't very clear, Phylidor replied that he was surprised that they expected to see more details in a ghost. Then Von der Eck confronted Phylidor with the question if it wasn't all just optical illusions. Phylidor threatened with terrible dangers that would be caused by this behavior. Von der Eck and other audience members then demanded to see Phylidor raise the devil, if he would still insist that he really had supernatural powers. He pleaded not to have to do this, but instead to raise the spirit of the deceased father of an Englishman in the audience as agreed upon a few days earlier. He conjured up this apparition, but the image showed a figure in too fashionable an outfit for someone who had died a few years before. In the meantime the smoke had become too irritating and some men called for light and wanted the door to be opened. Phylidor proposed to make King Heinrich IV appear, but couldn't calm his audience and accepted his defeat. Some of the men warned him that it would not end well if he was to perform his deceitful tricks again.\n\nParagraph 17: In 2000 he was the co-star of the comedy Buenos vecinos, where he acted alongside Hugo Arana, Moria Casán and Malena Solda. In 2001 he made his film debut starring alongside Romina Yan, Chiquititas: Rincón de luz, a film of the successful children's saga that had them as protagonists. He also participates in the film La fuga. His next protagonist was in the soap opera Yago, pasión morena with Gianella Neyra in the afternoon of Telefe, for which he obtained his first Martín Fierro Award for Best Leading Telenovela Actor. Under the production of Pol-ka, he stars in 2002 soap opera 099 Central, next to Nancy Dupláa on the screen of Canal 13. He was awarded a second time with the Martín Fierro Award for Best Telenovela Actor. In 2004 he starred again with Nancy Dupláa, marking the return of one of the most successful television duo.  The soap opera Padre Coraje, with production of Pol-ka, on the screen of  Canal 13. He receives his third Martín Fierro Award for Best Actor. He also received the award for Best Actor in the Festival y Mercado de la Telenovela Iberoamericana. In 2005 he starred in theater, along with Pepe Soriano, the play Visitando al Sr. Green. For his work, he obtained the ACE Award and Florencio Sánchez Award as Theater Revelation. In 2006 he starred a new soap opera by Pol-Ka, Sos mi vidaThe fiction became the most-watched of the year 2006 in Argentina and was transmitted internationally by different chains, having great success in Eastern Europe and the Middle East. Together with Betiana Blum and China Zorrilla, he stars in the film Tocar el cielo. Between 2007 and 2008 he starred in the play Codicia. In 2008 he signed a contract with Telefe to star in the soap opera Vidas robadas. Fiction was highly praised for dealing with topics such as the white.\n\nParagraph 18: Michael Moschello Anderson (born September 21, 1973) is a former American football running back who played seven seasons in the National Football League (NFL). He played college football at Utah and was drafted by the Denver Broncos in the sixth round of the 2000 NFL Draft. He played five seasons with the Broncos, being named the AP NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year in 2000. After being waived by the Broncos in 2006, Anderson signed a four-year contract with the Baltimore Ravens; however, he played just two seasons with the Ravens before his contract was terminated in 2008, effectively ending his NFL career.\n\nParagraph 19: Landon was private secretary to the Governor of New South Wales William Lygon, 7th Earl Beauchamp, 1900. In 1898 he and Beauchamp had holidayed in Paris. In 1903 he was special correspondent of the Daily Mail at the Delhi Durbar, in China, in Japan and in Siberia; in 1903–1904 he was special correspondent of The Times on the British military expedition to Lhasa, Tibet; in 1905–1906 he was special correspondent of The Times for the Prince of Wales' visit to India; and after that he was in Persia, India, and Nepal, 1908; Russian Turkestan 1909; Egypt and Sudan 1910; on the North Eastern Frontier of India and at the Delhi Durbar, 1911; in Mesopotamia and Syria, 1912; in Scandinavia and behind the British and French lines in 1914–1915; behind the Italian lines and to the Vatican in 1917 (the war and Vatican visits with Kipling); at the Paris Peace Conference, 1919; in Constantinople, 1920; in India, Mesopotamia, Syria, and Palestine 1921; on the Prince of Wales' tour of India and Japan, 1921–1922; in China and North America 1922; at the Peace Conference in Lausanne, 1923; in China, Nepal and Egypt 1924; and in China in 1925 (source except where noted: Who Was Who).", "answers": ["Paragraph 7"], "length": 6262, "dataset": "passage_retrieval_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "c0fe2309ca55ac01442fa28387a766461a40e92ccba36c1f"}
{"input": "The text highlights the unique drumming style of Charles \"Hungry\" Williams, a musician who played at Club Tijuana in New Orleans. Williams was known for his ability to play thirty-second notes with his left hand and incorporate a mixture of calypso, rock, and blues into his drumming. He introduced a double beat on the bass drum that added a funky element to his music. Williams also combined Latin percussion patterns with his various stylistic influences. His innovative playing style made him stand out in drumming contests and caught the attention of other renowned musicians like Earl King and Earl Palmer. Williams' contributions to rock and his ability to create funky rhythms were highly praised by those who witnessed his performances. Despite his lack of musical reading skills, Williams possessed natural talent and a unique ability to create drum patterns that often surprised and impressed other drummers.", "context": "Paragraph 1: Non-price competition is a marketing strategy \"in which one firm tries to distinguish its product or service from competing products on the basis of attributes like design and workmanship\". It often occurs in imperfectly competitive markets because it exists between two or more producers that sell goods and services at the same prices but compete to increase their respective market shares through non-price measures such as marketing schemes and greater quality. It is a form of competition that requires firms to focus on product differentiation instead of pricing strategies among competitors. Such differentiation measures allowing for firms to distinguish themselves, and their products from competitors, may include, offering superb quality of service, extensive distribution, customer focus, or any sustainable competitive advantage other than price. When price controls are not present, the set of competitive equilibria naturally correspond to the state of natural outcomes in Hatfield and Milgrom's two-sided matching with contracts model.\n\nParagraph 2: The music video, directed by Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris, starred Tom Kenny and Jill Talley, a married couple who were, at the time, cast members on the sketch comedy program Mr. Show with Bob and David and would later gain international fame for their voicework on SpongeBob SquarePants. The original idea for the music video was for a Busby Berkeley-style video, complete with \"people diving into champagne glasses\". The band was set to begin production on the video when they discovered that the Red Hot Chili Peppers had done a similarly styled video for their song \"Aeroplane\", which was almost identical to what they had wanted to do. The second idea for the video was that as the band played on a surreal stage, the camera would go into audience members' eyes and the viewer would see that person's vision of the song. The third and final concept, inspired by Georges Méliès's silent film A Trip to the Moon, came from directors Dayton and Faris, whose inspiration for the video came from the album cover for Mellon Collie, which reminded them of early silent films. Hence, the video was filmed much like a turn-of-the-century silent film using theater-style backdrops and primitive special effects, with most of the backdrops and puppetwork created by artist Wayne White.\n\nParagraph 3: Today's shape and form of venue in Kranjčevićeva Street is due to another unfortunate event in its history. On 29 November 1977 a fire destroyed large sections of old wooden western stand of the stadium in Kranjčevićeva. Since that time, the stadium in Kranjčevićeva experienced several modifications and reconstructions in the following years. Most of infrastructure was built in the preparation of the Universiade in Zagreb, the world's Student Games held in 1987 such as extensive overhaul and the construction of the adjoining facilities. Later that same year a lightning strike wreck the floodlights and the stadium was without any floodlight capabilities for 20 years, when new ones were installed by the City of Zagreb. The stadium consists of two stands. The west stand is fully seated and can hold 3,850 spectators. It houses the press box and the VIP area. The east stand has 5,000 standing places and is mainly used for travelling fans. The stadium also has a cycling track around the pitch which is used for track cycling events. Furthermore, the stadium has a wheelchair area. In June 2008 UEFA inspection in charge of licensing have visited the stadium and gave minor praise for the stadium in the city center. Among the major cons pointed out by the UEFA inspection were lack of floodlights and poor working conditions for journalists. Even though Kranjčevićeva failed to impress the UEFA delegation due to lack of floodlights (which were installed two months later) and press box provisions it managed to receive a 3-star rating out of five, which ranks it among the better stadiums in Croatia. After infrastructure renovations which were held by the City of Zagreb through June, July and August 2008 floodlights were finally reinstalled and fully prepared three days before the 5th round and match NK Zagreb - NK Osijek played on 24 August 2008. Zagreb eventually won its first match under the floodlights at Kranjčevićeva since 1987 when they were struck by lightning during a match between NK Zagreb and the same opponent NK Osijek 2-1 thanks to goals from Mario Čutura and Davor Vugrinec in the last minute in front of 2,500 supporters. Since then, thanks to newly placed floodlights at venue in Kranjčevićeva Street, stadium is capable of playing a daylight and night matches. In 2018 the stadium was refurbished with chairs installed in the eastern grandstand and a new hybrid lawn installed. The stadium now has a seating capacity of 5,350 seats.\n\nParagraph 4: Hognose snakes have mildly toxic venomous saliva and are frequently mistaken for the slightly more dangerous rear fanged snakes which possess grooved teeth and saliva intended for dispatching prey.  Hognose saliva fails to meet the definition of a venom because they have no injection system and do not have behaviours typically seen in venomous animals.  Indeed, the teeth of the hognose are smooth and strong without grooves and the mildly toxic duvernoy's secretions are produced by the Duvernoy's gland, well away from the unique evisceration fangs for which the genus is named. Hognose have never been formally documented using their saliva to kill prey, rather they kill by sawing and impaling prey, biting prey from the side rather than at the head to facilitate this process.  Although it is possible that some day one or more species may provide data that alter the current classification of mildly toxic saliva to actual venom, the absence of any injection mechanism and indeed adaptations counter to venom injection will most likely always leave them difficult to classify.  Hognose are perhaps best described as a transitional species with toxic saliva that is only produced during feeding, failing to fall into either of the classic recognisable categories of venomous or non venomous. Although their saliva is not likely to cause serious injury to humans in small amounts, should the toxic feeding saliva make its way into a cut in large enough amounts over an extended period of time the resulting swelling and localized tissue damage can be problematic in at least one species, H. Nasicus.  Such occurrences are rare however as they are uninclined to bite, instead striking with mouth closed or playing dead.  For these reasons they have been popular pets for more than 100 years despite the irritation experienced should they mistake their keeper's hand for food.\n\nParagraph 5: Air France, West Berlin's third scheduled carrier, had withdrawn entirely from the internal German market as long ago as 1969, reducing its presence at the city's Tegel Airport to providing a single daily non-stop scheduled service from/to Paris Orly only. (This move was designed to staunch the growing losses Air France's internal German routes from/to Tegel had incurred ever since Pan Am had introduced jet equipment on its own internal German services from/to Tempelhof in 1966. Over the following two years, the airline's share of the total West Berlin — West Germany air travel market collapsed from 9% to less than 5%. Following the beginning of BEA's jet operations from Tempelhof in late 1968, Air France's share dropped even further. Other factors that contributed to the company's progressive decline in traffic on its internal German services included Tegel's greater distance from West Berlin's city centre compared with Tempelhof, the lack of a motorway connecting the airport to the city centre and poor public transport links. Compared with its two bigger rivals in the Berlin market, it served fewer German domestic routes at lower frequencies and did not promote these as effectively. To keep a presence in the internal German air transport market from/to West Berlin, Air France had entered into a collaborative agreement with BEA. This agreement covered the Berlin–Frankfurt and Berlin–Munich routes. The agreement's intention was to enable both BEA and Air France to compete better with Pan Am's more frequent services on these routes by pooling their resources. It entailed the joint operation of these routes from Tempelhof with BEA BAC One-Eleven 500 aircraft, BEA flightdeck crews and mixed BEA/Air France cabin crews. However, BEA's claim that it returned to profitability on both its Frankfurt and Munich routes from Berlin as a result of the collaborative agreement with Air France was contradicted by the latter's counter claim that it was still losing money on these routes, in spite of that agreement. This in turn led to the agreement's termination as of November 1, 1972. The same day, Air France introduced a second daily return flight between Orly and Tegel, which routed via Cologne in both directions to maintain the airline's internal German traffic rights from/to Berlin. From April 1, 1974, Air France routed both of its daily Orly–Tegel services via Cologne, and from November 1, 1974, it switched them to the French capital's then new Charles de Gaulle Airport. At the start of the 1976 summer timetable, Air France introduced a third daily CDG–Tegel frequency, which routed via Düsseldorf and utilised the Boeing 727-200, a bigger aircraft than the Caravelles used on the company's other services from/to Berlin. Air France subsequently routed all of its CDG–Tegel flights via Düsseldorf and standardised the aircraft equipment on the 727-200/200 Advanced.)\n\nParagraph 6: Amateur boxing to this day have several scoring systems, depending on the tournament regulations and sanctioning authority. Several archaic score systems, that survived to the 1980s (and in some places to this day,) the first of which is a 3-point system, which gave one point for each of three rounds (therefore 3–0 stands for a clean victory by points, 2–1 means that defeated opponent dominated one round, 1–1–1 stands for a draw or ex aequo, which was a very rare occurrence.) It coexisted for a long time with 3-vote decision system, and 5-vote decision system, which resembled professional boxing decision-making system, it took five judges voting either for victory or a draw (in the 5-vote system, 5–0 stands for unanimous decision, 4–1 for majority decision, 3–2 for split decision, 3–1–1 for split decision and one judge ruled a draw. In the 3-vote system, 3–0 stands for unanimous decision, 2–1 for split decision, 0–0–3 for a  draw, with no majority decision option.) Depending on the tournament regulations an extra round or rounds could be appointed on the sudden death principle if there was no clear winner. All mentioned systems were practised in combination with each other (i.e. judges were supposed not only to pick up a winner, but also to fill-in scorecards,) creating complexity with points, scorecards, etc. Tournaments and championships usually employed the 5-vote system. International duals usually employed the 3-vote system, with two judges represented the guest nation, and one judge represented the host nation. Both systems lead to a number of controversial and officially contested results, as punch statistics (thrown-to-landed) mostly wasn't accounted for by either one. At the 1960 Rome Olympics preliminaries, after Soviet Oleg Grigoryev was controversially ruled a winner over Great Britain's Francis Taylor, the IOC decided to relieve some 15 of the referees and judges of their duties before the quarterfinals. After the 1988 Seoul Olympics controversy, when the clearly dominant finalist Roy Jones Jr. of the U.S. (whom even the Soviet judges ruled to be a winner, let alone the commentators and his beaten opponent, who himself apologized for the injustice) was virtually robbed of the gold medal, a new system was created and implemented, where only clean punches score, though a controversy still exist as to what is a clean punch in one's personal opinion, leading to another dubious results. The semifinals of the 1996 Atlanta Olympics proved the new points system susceptible to controversy as well, when Kazakhstani Vassiliy Jirov was pronounced a 15–9 score winner over U.S. Antonio Tarver, with many observers were left confused, believing Tarver was dominant through the entire bout.\n\nParagraph 7: Ser Jorah Mormont is the only child of the Night's Watch's Lord Commander Jeor Mormont, who abdicated shortly before Robert's Rebellion to join the Night's Watch and let Jorah assume the lordship of Bear Island. At some point Jorah married a lady of House Glover, who died from miscarriage after ten years of marriage. Jorah fought in Greyjoy's Rebellion, distinguishing himself by being one of the first to enter the fray during the siege of Pyke and was knighted by King Robert Baratheon. At a tourney at Lannisport celebrating the Baratheon victory, Jorah fell in love with the beautiful Lynesse Hightower (aunt of Margaery Tyrell). He named her Queen of Love and Beauty after winning the tourney and asked her father for her hand in marriage, which he accepted. However, Lynesse found herself ill-suited to the rough life on Bear Island, having grown up as a member of the wealthy House Hightower. Jorah bankrupted himself trying to provide her with luxuries and eventually sold poachers found on his lands to a Tyroshi slaver to fund her lifestyle. His liege lord, Eddard Stark, condemned Jorah to death, but he and Lynesse fled to Lys. Jorah then made his living as a sellsword, but was still unable to provide enough to satisfy Lynesse, and eventually returned from a campaign to find that Lynesse had become a concubine of a wealthy Lysene merchant. The merchant warned Jorah that he would be enslaved to settle his debts if he remained in Lys and Jorah was forced to flee again. Afterwards he drifted among the Free Cities and the Dothraki, before becoming a spy for Varys.\n\nParagraph 8: Mayor Joseph Watson of Philadelphia and Governor John Andrew Shulze of Pennsylvania worked to recover young free Black people kidnapped by the gang in the summer of 1825 and to prosecute the gang members. They did not succeed in trying any of the white members. The only time any real efforts to arrest and convict the gang is when authorities found the bodies of several white slave traders, a child and a baby. After being acquitted in Mayor's Court, biracial gang member John Purnell (aliases include \"John Smith\") was convicted on two counts of kidnapping in Philadelphia County Court in Pennsylvania in 1827. He was sentenced to a fine and 42 years in jail. He died in jail five years later.\n\nParagraph 9: The Food and Nutrition Service is funded under the umbrella of United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) through the annual Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies appropriations bill. In 2019, $27 billion was allocated for discretionary funding for USDA, which is spread out over many services including WIC, food safety, and other services. Of the expected people to be served in 2019, the estimate for SNAP recipients is 40.8 million, 30 million to have received school lunches, 15 million to have received school breakfast, 6.6 million participating in WIC, and 690,000 elderly people receiving Commodity Supplemental Food Program.\n\nParagraph 10: Fund-raising for the two Air Force windows began in September 1957.  Designed by the English artist Edward Liddall Armitage, these were installed in April 1962. They are dedicated to the members of the Air Force and New Zealanders who died in the service of the air forces of the Commonwealth during the Second World War. The four remaining windows were designed by New Zealand artist Howard Malitte and adapted for stained-glass by Brian Thomas. Governor-General Brigadier Sir Bernard Fergusson unveiled the Army memorial windows on 9 August 1966. They stand on either side of the organ loft, with the memorial tablet placed on the wall to the left of the Bishop's cathedra (\"The two windows above this tablet were installed by serving and former members of the New Zealand Army to commemorate those who have served in the New Zealand Army at home and abroad since the foundation of our country…\"). The naval and merchant service windows were unveiled on 22 October 1967. They were dedicated in memory of the men and women who lost their lives in the navies and merchant services of the Commonwealth during the two world wars. All six military windows incorporate a rich visual symbolism. A range of memorial flags is also housed in the bell tower.\n\nParagraph 11: Some forms of anarcho-communism such as insurrectionary anarchism are strongly influenced by egoism and radical individualism, believing anarcho-communism is the best social system for the realisation of individual freedom. Hence, most anarcho-communists view anarcho-communism itself as a way of reconciling the opposition between the individual and society. Furthermore, post-left anarchists like Bob Black went as far as to argue that \"communism is the final fulfillment of individualism. [...] The apparent contradiction between individualism and communism rests on a misunderstanding of both. [...] Subjectivity is also objective: the individual really is subjective. It is nonsense to speak of \"emphatically prioritizing the social over the individual,\" [...]. You may as well speak of prioritizing the chicken over the egg. Anarchy is a \"method of individualization.\" It aims to combine the greatest individual development with the greatest communal unity\". Max Baginski has argued that property and the free market are just other \"spooks\", what Stirner called to refer mere illusions, or ghosts in the mind, writing: \"Modern Communists are more individualistic than Stirner. To them, not merely religion, morality, family and State are spooks, but property also is no more than a spook, in whose name the individual is enslaved — and how enslaved! [...] Communism thus creates a basis for the liberty and Eigenheit of the individual. I am a Communist because I am an Individualist. Fully as heartily the Communists concur with Stirner when he puts the word take in place of demand — that leads to the dissolution of property, to expropriation. Individualism and Communism go hand in hand\". Peter Kropotkin argued that \"Communism is the one which guarantees the greatest amount of individual liberty — provided that the idea that begets the community be Liberty, Anarchy [...]. Communism guarantees economic freedom better than any other form of association, because it can guarantee wellbeing, even luxury, in return for a few hours of work instead of a day's work\". Dielo Truda similarly argued that \"[t]his other society will be libertarian communism, in which social solidarity and free individuality find their full expression, and in which these two ideas develop in perfect harmony\". In \"My Perspectives\" of Willful Disobedience (2: 12), it was argued as such: \"I see the dichotomies made between individualism and communism, individual revolt and class struggle, the struggle against human exploitation and the exploitation of nature as false dichotomies and feel that those who accept them are impoverishing their own critique and struggle\".\n\nParagraph 12: The triple received its first major update in 1997 with a ground up redesign to produce the fuel injected  T595 Daytona engine, and the  T509 Speed Triple engine, the latter using the original bore and stroke of the first generation engine. The claimed power outputs for these engines were  respectively. Over the next few years the 885 engine grew to 955 cc and was used in the newly launched Sprint ST and the later Sprint RS. In this updated form it was still claimed to produce , the more powerful  being kept for the Daytona. The injected 885 cc triple lived on for another couple of years in an updated Tiger. Triumph made minor updates until 2001, when it performed a major update, first appearing in the Tiger 955i and soon spreading across the rest of the range. Power and torque was increased across the range and this updated model was meant to remedy the faults apparent with the earlier 955 engine. The most lively performer to use this updated triple was the Daytona 955i, in this form claiming , the most powerful triple to emerge from Triumph. The 900 triple in its original form lingered on until 2002 in the form of the Trophy 900, being outlived by its four cylinder relative, the Trophy 1200.\n\nParagraph 13: The force accelerating a pinewood derby car is gravity; the opposing forces are friction and air drag. Therefore, car modifications are aimed at maximizing the potential energy in the car design and minimizing the air drag and the friction that occurs when the wheel spins on the axle, contacts the axle head or car body, or contacts the track guide rail. Friction due to air drag is a minor, although not insignificant, factor. The wheel tread can be sanded or turned on a lathe and the inner surface of the hub can be tapered to minimize the contact area between the hub and body. Polishing the wheel, especially the inner hub, with a plastic polish can also reduce friction. Often one front wheel is raised slightly so that it does not contact the track and add to the rolling resistance. Axles are filed or turned on a lathe to remove the burr and crimp marks and polished smooth. More extensive modifications involve tapering the axle head and cutting a notch to minimize the wheel-to-axle contact area. Packs can establish additional rules for what, if any, modifications are allowed. In some areas, no changes can be made to the axles or wheels.\n\nParagraph 14: OCA theory has been most frequently applied to discussions of the euro and the European Union. Many have argued that the EU did not actually meet the criteria for an OCA at the time the euro was adopted, and attribute the Eurozone's economic difficulties in part to continued failure to do so.  Europe does indeed score well on some of the measures characterising an OCA (such as symmetry of shocks).  Poloz (1990) concluded that a European Monetary Union should be viable since the variability of real exchange rates in Europe was similar to that between Canadian regions.This work was cited by the European Commission itself in the 1990 report One Market, One Money. By looking at the correlation of a region's GDP growth rate with that of the entire zone, the Eurozone countries show slightly greater correlations compared to the U.S. states. However, it has lower labour mobility than the United States, possibly due to language and cultural differences. In O'Rourke's paper, more than 40% of U.S. residents were born outside the state in which they live. In the Eurozone, only 14% people were born in a different country than the one in which they live. In fact, the U.S. economy was approaching a single labor market in the nineteenth century. However, for most parts of the Eurozone, such levels of labour mobility and labor market integration remain a distant prospect. Furthermore, the U.S. economy, with a central federal fiscal authority, has stabilization transfers. When a state in the U.S. is in recession, every $1 drop in that state’s GDP would have an offsetting transfer of 28 cents. Such stabilizing transfers are not present in both the Eurozone and EU; thus, they cannot rely on fiscal federalism to smooth out regional economic disturbances. The European crisis, however, may be pushing the EU towards more federal powers in fiscal policy.\n\nParagraph 15: In the early 1920s, Lowenthal seems to have had a law office in New York City.  While Ann Fagan Ginger does not mention him as a mentor of Carol Weiss King in her biography of King, Ginger does say that King formed a \"loose partnership\" with radical attorneys, who included Joseph Brodsky, Swinburne Hale, Walter Nelles, and Isaac Shorr as well as a long-term association with Walter Pollak (once partner of Benjamin Cardozo), whom she met through her brother-in-law Carl Stern.  Nevertheless, newspaper accounts of King (in the 1950s) mention Lowenthal as not only an associate but her employer.  The Saturday Evening Post went even further in 1951 in a long article on Carol Weiss King:  Lowenthal is of special interest. A product of Harvard Law, he has been described by a New Deal associate as \"self-effacing and ubiquitous.\" Shuttling between New York and Washington, he has maintained a New York office while holding a variety of Government posts dating back to World War I. On one hand, he has been an assiduous cultivator of high-level friendships, including Presidents Roosevelt and Truman and Supreme Court Justices Felix Frankfurter and Louis Brandeis. On the other, he has been an equally assiduous collector of proteges for whom he has found many Government jobs. Alger Hiss and Lee Pressman benefited by his friendship, and, for a time, did one George Shaw Wheeler, a young lawyer who became so carried away by communism that he denounced his United States citizenship to make a new career bebind the Iron Curtain. Back in 1920, at the time of her admission to the New York bar, Carol also was a Lowenthal protégée, and it was in his office that she served her first and only legal clerkship.  Another important protege of Lowenthal's (and his partner Robert Szold) was Benjamin V. Cohen, later known as one of Felix Frankfurter's Hotdogs in the New Deal. Lowenthal and Cohen both knew Judge Julian W. Mack, who was one of Cohen's professor at Harvard (and was uncle of Lowenthal's wife). In October 1920, Cohen first worked for Lowenthal on a bankruptcy case involving E.F. Drew & Company.\n\nParagraph 16: Cape Cod Airfield is located on the former site of Camp Perkins, a Massachusetts National Guard camp which was active on the site in 1921 and 1922. The airport was founded by Zenas Crocker, a World War I biplane pilot. It opened with a flying circus on July 4, 1929. During Prohibition, the biggest attraction at the airport was the nearby Aviation Country Club, which ran an open bar and night club. The club was closed down by Zenas Crocker's brother - Laughlin Crocker who was the Sheriff of Barnstable County. From 1929 to 1934, the Massachusetts National Guard's aviation group held its summer encampment at the airport. In 1930, the Skyways Flying School, run by Crocker's friend Crocker Snow, opened at the airport. In 1935, the property was acquired by Hilma and William H. Danforth, summer residents of Oyster Harbors. The Danforths used the property as a riding stable, polo field, and automobile race track as well as for their private aircraft and added a windmill to serve as an office building. The airport was opened for commercial service on May 8, 1946, when Mrs. Danforth leased the property to John C. Van Arsdale. Van Arsdale opened a flying school to take advantage of the G.I. Bill's flight training for World War II veterans. During this time, the stables were torn down and the Aviation Country Club moved to Hyannis, Massachusetts where it became an Elks Club. In 1949, Van Arsdale opened the Provincetown-Boston Airlines and eventually turned over control of the Cape Cod Airport to the Danforth's personal pilot Harry Kornhiser. Kornhiser expanded the operation to include airplane maintenance and reconditioning used aircraft for resale in addition to flight instruction. Kornhiser died in 1991 and his son Rick took over as airport manager. Under the younger Kornhiser, the airport saw gliders, blimps, and an occasional hot air balloon added to its flight operations. Kornhiser also towed advertising banners over nearby beaches. On April 17, 2000, Kornhiser died in an banner-towing accident near the Norfolk Airport. Laurel Kornhiser took over operations following her husband's death. In March 2003, a representative of the Danforth family informed Kornhiser that her lease would not be renewed and the airport would close. In 2003, the Town of Barnstable purchased the 217-acre Danforth Property, which included the airport, for $11.2 million. The airport reopened in July 2004.\n\nParagraph 17: Various areas of the brain work together in a multitude of ways in order to produce the images that we see with our eyes and that are encoded by our brains. The basis of this work takes place in the visual cortex of the brain. The visual cortex is located in the occipital lobe of the brain and harbors many other structures that aid in visual recognition, categorization, and learning. One of the first things the brain must do when acquiring new visual information is recognize the incoming material. Brain areas involved in recognition are the inferior temporal cortex, the superior parietal cortex, and the cerebellum.  During tasks of recognition, there is increased activation in the left inferior temporal cortex and decreased activation in the right superior parietal cortex. Recognition is aided by neural plasticity, or the brain's ability to reshape itself based on new information. Next the brain must categorize the material. The three main areas that are used when categorizing new visual information are the orbitofrontal cortex and two dorsolateral prefrontal regions which begin the process of sorting new information into groups and further assimilating that information into things that you might already know. After recognizing and categorizing new material entered into the visual field, the brain is ready to begin the encoding process – the process which leads to learning. Multiple brain areas are involved in this process such as the frontal lobe, the right extrastriate cortex, the neocortex, and again, the neostriatum. One area in particular, the limbic-diencephalic region, is essential for transforming perceptions into memories. With the coming together of tasks of recognition, categorization and learning; schemas help make the process of encoding new information and relating it to things you already know much easier. One can remember visual images much better when they can apply it to an already known schema. Schemas actually provide enhancement of visual memory and learning.\n\nParagraph 18: Williams told Tad Jones, \"Paul Gayten and Earl Palmer and all of 'em used to come up there (to Club Tijuana) just to listen to me play, because they couldn't understand what I was doing. I used to, I still do it, I played thirty-second notes with my left hand, and no drummers could do that. Plus I had a mixture. My music, my drumming, is between calypso and rock, you know, blues. I had something different going. Like a double beat on the bass drum that makes it funky. I had calypso going and funk at the same time. I started the 'double clutching' with my bass drum, with my foot. Wasn't no other drummer doing that.\" Singer, guitarist, and songwriter Earl King agreed, \"I've seen him do things with his left hand: I'm still waiting for another drummer to do it. Charles' playing emanated  out of the calypso-type stuff.\" During his time at Club Tijuana Williams often took part in drumming contests with Ricardo Lopez, a Cuban percussionist who played bongos and congas. Williams added Latin effects to his stylistic influences that included marches, country and western, and the music of the Spiritual church of his youth. He said \"I'd take all this and hook it up and make a jambalaya out of it, and it'd come out like this funky thing.\" Williams was known for his experiments with adapting Latin percussion patterns to the drum set. In his playing on Tommy Ridgely's \"The Girl Across The Street\", the shrill, metal sound he plays on the bell of his cymbal is described by writer Antoon Aukes as an Afro-Cuban cáscara that Latin percussionists would play on a cowbell or on the sides of timbales. In Ridgely's \"When I Meet My Girl\", Williams came upon the well-known drum set figure of performing the high-low conga accents with rimshot-on-snare and open snare or tom-tom, as he did in Huey Smith's \"Free, Single and Disengaged\". Ridgely remembered the sessions, \"Hungry (Williams) was on drums; this particular beat was his style- nobody could duplicate what he was doing.\" Record label owner and producer Al Reed acknowledged, \"The change came when Funky Charles started playing drums... and a whole lot of people right now aren't hip to his contribution to rock. He was the funkiest thing out. A funky beat was characterized by drummers who improvised to make people dance harder. Funky rhythms went as far back as Congo Square and Second Line, particularly in the distinctive styles of drummers like \"Tenoo\" Coleman, his pupil Williams, Smokey Johnson, and Joseph \"Zigaboo\" Modeliste of The Meters. New Orleans saxophonist Alvin \"Red\" Tyler said of Williams, \"This guy had more natural ability than all of them put together. He was another musician that couldn't read a note, but as far as feeling, he would do things on the drums most drummers would say, 'How does he do that?' And it was only because he didn't know he wasn't supposed to do it. In fact Earl Palmer and I used to get off our job and go to the place Hungry was working at.\" Palmer agreed, \"Well, if you listen to the New Orleans drummers you find that they all played more bass drum than the average guy. Listen to “Hungry” play. He played a lot. You know, he sure could play.\" Palmer wrote in his autobiography, “A guy we called Hungry, Charlie Williams, was a mother on drums, a guy who never knew how good he was.”\n\nParagraph 19: In 1980, Bolton co-founded the New Zealand branch of the Church of Odin, a pro-Nazi organisation for \"whites of non-Jewish descent\". He has published and edited newsletters such as The Watcher, The Flaming Sword, The Heretic, The Nexus, Ab Aeterno (assistant editor) and Western Destiny. He founded the national-socialist Order of the Left Hand Path (OLHP) in 1992, following a quarrel with other members of the Temple of Set. Two years later it was renamed the Ordo Sinistra Vivendi (\"Order of the Left Way\"), and in the same year created the fascist Black Order. It claimed to have a network of national lodges in six European countries plus Australia and the U.S. It was intended to be an activist front promoting an \"occult-fascist axis\" by mobilising political groups and youth culture elements such as industrial music. Bolton created and edited the Black Order newsletter, The Flaming Sword, and its successor, The Nexus, a satanic-Nazi journal with special attention given to figures such as Savitri Devi, Julius Evola, and Ezra Pound, and which especially catered to the black metal movement. It later changed its name to Western Destiny. In 1996, Bolton formed The Thelemic Society which blended rightist politics with the teachings of the English occultist Aleister Crowley and the philosophy of the German thinker Friedrich Nietzsche.\n\nParagraph 20: Guo began to construct astronomical observation devices.  He has been credited with inventing the gnomon, the square table, the abridged or simplified armilla, and a water powered armillary sphere called the Ling Long Yi.  The gnomon is used to measure the angle of the sun, determine the seasons, and is the basis of the sundial, but Guo Shoujing revised this device to become much more accurate and improved the ability to tell time more precisely. The square table was used to measure the azimuth of celestial bodies by the equal altitude method and could also be used as protractor.  The abridged or simplified armilla was used to measure the angle of the sun, as well as the position of any celestial body.  The Ling Long Yi is similar to an abridged armilla except larger, more complex, and more accurate.   Kublai Khan, after observing Guo's mastery of astronomy, ordered that he, Zhang, and Wang Xun make a more accurate calendar. They built 27 observatories throughout China in order to gain thorough observations for their calculations.  In 1280, Guo completed the calendar, calculating a year to be 365.2425 days, just 26 seconds off the year's current measurement.  In 1283, Guo was promoted to director of the Observatory in Beijing and, in 1292, he became the head of the Water Works Bureau.  Throughout his life he also did extensive work with spherical trigonometry.  After Kublai Khan's death, Guo continued to be an advisor to Kublai's successors, working on hydraulics and astronomy.", "answers": ["Paragraph 18"], "length": 6111, "dataset": "passage_retrieval_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "f1799ce8d663da589aab85598cf2c296b7c64b17a992bda8"}
{"input": "This text discusses the French empire's presence in Indochina and the challenges they faced in maintaining control. It begins by mentioning Japan's exploitation of Vietnamese resentment towards French colonialism after World War II. Vietnamese insurgents attacked and killed French residents in Saigon, prompting the French to send in troops to restore order. The Armée de l'Air, the French Air Force, provided support with U.S.-built aircraft and later, British Supermarine Spitfires. Due to a lack of French-built aircraft, seized Japanese aircraft were also used for various purposes, including bombing missions. By March 1946, the Armée de l'Air consisted of fighter and transport/bombing units. In March 1947, additional fighter groups were deployed, including one equipped with de Havilland Mosquito aircraft. However, the climate in Indochina began to deteriorate the aircraft. The insurgents, fighting as guerrilla army, gradually perfected guerrilla warfare tactics.", "context": "Paragraph 1: Marquardt was born in Lander, Wyoming to a father of German origin, and a mother of Welsh origin. He was raised along with his four other siblings in Denver, Colorado. Marquardt's late father was a Lutheran pastor, worked in construction, and was also a Marine veteran who fought in the Vietnam War. Marquardt's mother was a nurse and a manager at an attorney's office. Because of his father's work he and his family moved around frequently to places including Chicago, Illinois, and Indiana. Marquardt's parents divorced when he was eight years old, and the young Marquardt moved to Colorado. When he was 15 years old, he began studying the disciplines of Wing Chun Kung Fu, Japanese Jujutsu, Freestyle Wrestling, and Kenpo Karate. Present Marquardt's fighting style derived from his fights in Pancrase under the leadership of Sheldon Marr from Colorado. Sheldon Marr is the co-founder of the World Combat JuJitsu Association and he was a Junior National Judo Champion, and a California State Wrestling Champion and has been recognized as the \"Instructor of the Year\" by Jujitsu America, the U.S. Martial Arts Hall of Famer, the World Martial Arts Hall of Famer, and the International Black Belt Hall of Fame; and was a Coach for the 2000 U.S. World Pankration Team, and the 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012 & 2013 U.S. World Grappling Teams. Marquardt also trained with Shane Pitts in Colorado before he went to Jackson's MMA. Shane Pitts trained Marquardt in Japanese jujutsu for three years and gave him a black belt. Pitts is the founder of Law Enforcement Ground Tactics System, holder of five black belts in martial arts, a former World Masters Judo Champion, World Combat Jujitsu Association National Champion and Brazilian Jiu Jitsu Pan American Masters Division Champion. Marquardt also trained with Mike Van Arsdale and also trained Pancrase with Sanae Kikuta in the GRABAKA Dojo in Tokyo, Japan. Marquardt was active in other sports as well, including basketball and soccer, at Wheat Ridge High School and also began taking Kickboxing and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu lessons when he was 18 years old under the instruction of Ricardo Murgel.\n\nParagraph 2: There have been 28 head coaches for the Canadiens franchise in the NHL. The team's first head coach in the NHL was Newsy Lalonde, who coached the Canadiens for eight NHL seasons in two stints. Although Dick Irvin coached the team for 15 seasons, Toe Blake, who coached two fewer seasons, is the franchise's all-time leader for the most regular-season games coached (914), the most regular-season games won (500), the most regular-season points (1159), the most playoff games coached (119), and the most playoff games won (82). Blake has also won the most Stanley Cup championships with eight; Scotty Bowman has won five, Irvin has won three, Cecil Hart has won two, and Leo Dandurand, Claude Ruel, Al MacNeil, Jean Perron, and Jacques Demers have won one each. Lalonde won a Stanley Cup championship in 1915–16 while in the NHA. Bowman and Pat Burns have each been awarded the Jack Adams Award, in 1976–77 and 1988–89 respectively. Nine head coaches have spent their entire NHL head coaching careers with the Canadiens. Bowman and Dandurand have been elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame as builders. Dandurand is the only coach to have spent his entire NHL head coaching career with the Canadiens and to have been elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame as a builder.\n\nParagraph 3: The Dutch language Wikipedia has the largest ratio of Wikipedia pages per native speaker of all of the top 10 largest Wikipedia editions. Its rate of daily article creations spiked in March 2006, rapidly growing to an average of 1,000 a day in early May 2006. After this number was reached, growth dropped to an average of only about 250 a day, comparable to the averages around December 2005. Since then, there have been more article-creation surges, one of the largest peaking at 2,000 new articles per day in September 2007, but the growth rate has always returned to the lowest average of around 250.\n\nParagraph 4: \"And Cabades replied as follows: \"O son of Silvanus, by no means try to reverse the causes, understanding as you do best of all men that you Romans have been the chief cause of the whole confusion. For we have taken the Caspian Gates to the advantage of both Persians and Romans, after forcing out the barbarians there, since Anastasius, the Emperor of the Romans, as you yourself doubtless know, when the opportunity was offered him to buy them with money, was not willing to do so, in order that he might not be compelled to squander great sums of money in behalf of both nations by keeping an army there perpetually. And since that time we have stationed that great army there, and have supported it up to the present time, thereby giving you the privilege of inhabiting the land unplundered as far as concerns the barbarians on that side, and of holding your own possessions with complete freedom from trouble. But as if this were not sufficient for you, you have also made a great city, Daras, as a stronghold against the Persians, although this was explicitly forbidden in the treaty which Anatolius arranged with the Persians; and as a result of this it is necessary for the Persian state to be afflicted with the difficulties and the expense of two armies, the one in order that the Massagetae (Huns) may not be able fearlessly to plunder the land of both of us, and the other in order that we may check your inroads. When lately we made a protest regarding these matters and demanded that one of two things should be done by you, either that the army sent to the Caspian Gates should be sent by both of us, or that the city of Daras should be dismantled, you refused to understand what was said, but saw fit to strengthen your plot against the Persians by a greater injury, if we remember correctly the building of the fort in Mindouos. And even now the Romans may choose peace, or they may elect war, by either doing justice to us or going against our rights. For never will the Persians lay down their arms, until the Romans either help them in guarding the gates, as is just and right, or dismantle the city of Daras.\" With these words Cabades dismissed the ambassador, dropping the hint that he was willing to take money from the Romans and have done with the causes of the war.\"\n\nParagraph 5: Given the task of forming the personalities of the Crash Nitro Kart cast through the full-motion videos, the Red Eye Studio artists set certain rules for how each character would carry itself by default. As animator Thomas Happ noted, \"N. Gin, for example, would always default to twitchy, side-to-side glances, while Tiny would often scratch his head in confusion. There were a lot of scenes where the characters are just standing around listening to Emperor Velo talk, and we had to invent ways to personalize their mannerisms and create a uniquely 'thinking character'.\" To achieve the bold and deeply saturated colors and textures for the characters and environments, the artists used Maya as well as Adobe Photoshop and Corel Painter. While the artists adapted many of the sets and props in the cinematics from in-game counterparts, they recreated the majority of these objects from scratch in order to add surrealism to the scenery. The cinematics were completed well in advance of the four-month deadline. The console version of Crash Nitro Kart was announced by Vivendi Universal prior to the Electronic Entertainment Expo of 2003, while the N-Gage version was announced on February 16, 2004. Crash Nitro Kart is among the first titles to be developed using the Intrinsic Alchemy middleware technology following Vicarious Visions' purchase of its rights from the defunct Intrinsic Graphics.Crash Nitro Kart was released for the PlayStation 2, Xbox, GameCube and Game Boy Advance in North America on November 11, 2003, and in Europe on November 28, 2003; The N-Gage version of the game was released in Europe on June 30, 2004, and in North America on July 28, 2004. The mobile version was released on September 20, 2004. The PlayStation 2 version was re-released in the three-disc \"Crash Bandicoot Action Pack\" compilation (alongside Crash Twinsanity and Crash Tag Team Racing) in the United States on June 12, 2007, and in Europe on July 20, 2007.\n\nParagraph 6: Japan, even though a defeated power by the summer of 1945, exploited long-standing Vietnamese resentment of French colonialism. The first signs of the beginning of the end of the French empire in Indochina came when Vietnamese insurgents attacked and killed French residents in Saigon, prompting the French to send in a combat command (light brigade) of Leclerc's old 2nd Armored Division, among other troops, to help restore order. The Armée de l'Air reinforced the army units in the guise of the so-called Groupe marchant de l'extrême-orient (the Far East Forward Group), which included U.S.-built aircraft such as the ubiquitous Douglas C-47 Skytrain, totaling eighteen in number after reinforcements had been brought in. In November 1945, the personnel of the 1st Fighter Wing (consisting of GC I/7 and II/7) arrived in Saigon, but without airplanes. Later on, those units received the F.VIII and F.IX variants of the British Supermarine Spitfire. However, the complement was completed with seized Japanese aircraft, mostly ones dedicated to liaison duties. Although the C-47s were not bombers, a lot of them were jury-rigged in order to fulfill bombing missions over the nine years which remained to the French empire in Indochina. By March 1946, the Armée de l'Air consisted of four units, two of which were fighter units equipped with the Spitfire F.IX, a transport/bombing unit equipped with the C-47 and a further one consisting of examples of the Junkers Ju 52/3m. Indeed, the only French-built aircraft available were Morane-Saulnier MS.500 and Nord NC.702 liaison aircraft, which would be used for observation and evacuation duties as well. (The MS.500 was actually a copy of the German Fieseler Fi 156 \"Storch\" (Stork) aircraft.). By March 1947, the \"Cigognes\" and \"Alsace\" fighter groups had come to Indochina, and they had been joined by the \"Corse\" group, equipped with the de Havilland Mosquito. However, just as their RAF counterparts had experienced when stationed in Burma during World War II, the aircraft, dubbed the \"Wooden Wonder\" by the British, began to deteriorate as a result of their exposure to a climate that they were not designed to operate in at all. That same month, the Nam-Dinh garrison was encircled, so the transport groups were called upon to drop over 350 airborne troops in order to relieve the besieged troops and thus break the enemy's encirclement. Little by little, the insurgents, fighting the French as a guerrilla army, began to perfect the art and science of guerrilla warfare.\n\nParagraph 7: The second book in the series starts with Allie looking for her creator, Kanin, who is being tortured by the psychotic vampire Sarren. Following the blood tie, Allie encounters her brother Jackal who wishes to join her in helping to save their creator in Washington D.C. The pull of blood leads Allie and her new found brother to New Covington, where they discover a new outbreak threatening humanity. Allie knowing that the outbreak was started by Sarren, her determination to save her master and find the cure increases. Allie and Jackal not only discover the new Red lung outbreak but also the finding of Zeke who is helping a group of uninfected humans stay alive. Zeke and Jackal, before they can act their revenge upon each other, Allie shows them the bigger mission. Allie, Jackal and Zeke soon make their way into the palace of Prince Salazar where they not only find Sarren as a trusted man to the king but an old friend of Allie, Stick, who has much hate towards her. When Sarren is revealed as the true cause of the sudden outbreak, he tries to kill the prince and the group unsuccessfully. With new found trust in the group, prince Salazar makes a deal with Allie, that if she finds the cure within 72 hours (Three Days), he shall give her Kanin. Allie first however, wishes to see Kanin, though what she finds is instead an uncontrollable beast that bites her when she offers him food. Prince Salazar offers Allie, Jackal and Zeke a place to stay over night whilst awaiting to see if Kanin has improved. During that time, Allie first encounters music being played by a piano, Zeke surprised, dances with Allie. The next day, Kanin has improvement and is sent by the Prince to accompany the group in finding the cure, the group curious as to why the Prince would allow this, discover that Kanin is infected. This discovery immediately makes them quicken their search for the cure. Prince Salazar's men, including Stick, escort the group into the fringe in search of Sarren and the cure. Yet their journey is interrupted when Stick decides to enact his hate upon Allie by nearly killing her using the Prince's soldiers. Allie crushes the soldiers whilst nearly killing Stick before Zeke calms her down and reminds Allie of who she truly is. The slight interruption dissipates when the group continues their search, yet makes an unplanned stop when Allie discovers that Zeke is also infected and that the infection is spreading quickly. Zeke immediately requests that when the infection envelops him, that they kill him. Fearing his death, Allie makes a deal with Zeke, that they will lock him up in an abandoned car and bring back the cure in hopes of reviving him. Leaving Zeke in a crashed van, Allie, Jackal and a weak Kanin carry on their search for Sarren and the cure. Throughout the journey, the team walk through the tunnels with a withering Kanin behind them before Jackal decides to leave the search. When Allie and Kanin finally discover Sarren in one of the old labs from the experiments. A fight begins between an ailing Kanin and Sarren where Jackal is presented as a traitor by helping Sarren capture Allie. Right before Sarren can kill Kanin, Jackal betrays Sarren and tries to kill him, failing to do so nearly results in Jackal's death, but a cured Zeke rescues Jackal. Sarren escapes quickly leaving Allie, Jackal and Kanin to uncover the cure in Zeke's blood. After taking samples of his blood into their own, Allie, Jackal and Kanin give the cure to the Prince as the set off to fully exterminate Sarren once and for all. The group stays another night at Prince Salazar's kingdom, with Zeke and Allie sharing an intimate conversation. The next day, Allie wakes up to find Zeke gone and a dying traitor, Stick, who confesses in betraying the Prince to reenact his revenge upon Allie. Zeke has been taken by Sarren and before Allie can save him, they discover a video recording of Zeke being tortured by none other than Sarren, who still does not know of the cure in Zeke's blood. Sarren tortures Zeke into telling him where Eden is which Zeke inevitably gives into. In his last moments, Zeke professes his love for Allie and his hopes of forgiveness from God when Sarren tells them camera of his true intentions, to release the outbreak in Eden. The book ends with Allie swearing to protect Eden and avenge Zeke.\n\nParagraph 8: About the village's beginnings, there can only be speculation. It could be that there was already a small church in what is now today's Kappeln in the Early Middle Ages that stood as a parish seat, and Kappeln may have arisen within this parish. This chapel, which was once the village's namesake (“chapel” in German is Kapelle), has not been preserved. The churchtower's pedestal is supposedly all that is left of it. Probes of two of the pedestal's wooden beams have yielded the building dates 1143 and 1145 (or shortly thereafter). According to a legend, about AD 800, a monk named Udo, who founded Metten Abbey (although history says that while he was the first abbot, his godfather Gamelbert of Michaelsbuch was the actual founder), also built this church. Originally, the village belonged to the Nahegau, and after this was partitioned about 1130, it then passed into the ownership of the Waldgraves of Kyrburg (near Kirn). Later ownership arrangements are not always easy to discern. Kappeln's first documentary mention in 1319 (in which it is called Cappellen) dealt with a dispute between two Waldgravial houses over a claim to a series of villages from the court (judicial district) of Grumbach. According to the document, the magistrates denied Waldgrave Friedrich of Kyrburg any rights to the villages of Schweinschied, Kappeln, Löllbach, Langweiler, Käsweiler (vanished before 1500), Sulzbach, Homberg, Kirrweiler, Oberjeckenbach (cleared out in 1933 by the Nazis to make way for the Baumholder troop drilling ground) and Unterjeckenbach. He could only keep his share of the high jurisdiction and thus the right to carry out executions, because these villages belonged to the Hochgericht auf der Heide (“High Court on the Heath”), at which the Kyrburgs exercised these rights anyway. The limitation of the Waldgrave's claim owed itself to reasons that varied from one village to the next. In Kappeln's case, it had to do with the village's having ended up in several lordships’ hands. Half the village then belonged to the Lords of Löwenstein, while one fourth belonged to the Lords of Greifenclau. The remaining fourth was held by the Counts of Veldenz. The holders of the greatest share, namely the Lords of Löwenstein, also held great might as a result of having been enfeoffed with great parts of the former Nahegau. Castle Löwenstein stands near Niedermoschel. The Veldenzes transferred their share of Kappeln to the Lords Boos von Waldeck, whose seat was at Castle Montfort in a side dale of the lower Nahe. The Rügegerichtsbarkeit (“reprimand jurisdiction”) that the Lords of Löwenstein held, however, they gave to the Waldgraves of Grumbach. This was exercised on a day between 1 October (Saint Remigius’s Day) and 11 November (Saint Martin’s Day). The Waldgraves of Grumbach had to give out the court’s set times by messenger to each house. To pay the judge, they got from each house a Fastnachtshuhn – a Shrovetide chicken. This Rügegericht, as the court itself was called, mainly dealt with simple disputes and property crimes.\n\nParagraph 9: Zenarchus views Tymethes' butchered limbs and mourns bitterly. The Tyrant enters and asks Zenarchus if he is pleased that his villainous friend has been discovered and killed. Zenarchus coyly replies that he would be happier if Tymethes had been exposed sooner. He blames Mazeres for keeping Tymethes' crimes a secret rather than reporting them right away. Persuaded by his son's accusations, the Tyrant summons Mazeres and orders him executed. Mazeres is dragged off stage in astonishment. The Tyrant exits. Zenarchus expresses satisfaction that his friend's death has been avenged.  Amphridote enters, shocked by the news of Mazeres' imminent execution (she pledged her love to Mazeres in 4.2). She vows to kill the person responsible for arranging Mazeres' death. Assuming that Amphridote will be pleased to hear that Tymethes' death has been avenged, Zenarchus tells her how he facilitated Mazeres' execution. He orders some wine for a toast. Amphridote secretly poisons the wine before it is poured. They both drink the poisoned wine. Amphridote tells her brother that she hates him for killing Mazeres and dies. Zenarchus says that women who fall in love to easily can never be virtuous. He dies as well. Thunder rumbles and lightning strikes. The Tyrant enters and says that the bad weather is not a good sign. He finds the bodies of his dead daughter and son, shrieks in horror, and orders his servants to take the corpses away. The Old King, Lapyrus, Sertorio and Lodovico enter, all disguised as pilgrims seeking refuge from the storm. They observe Tymethes' butchered limbs with horror and note that the castle is not well-guarded. The Tyrant greets the \"pilgrims\" warmly and orders his servants to bring dinner. A banquet is brought in, and a separate table is set aside for the Young Queen. The Tyrant encourages the \"pilgrims\" to ignore the butchered limbs strung up around them. The Young Queen enters and sits at her table. A plate of human flesh and a bloody skull are set in front of her. She eats the flesh and drinks blood out of the skull. The \"pilgrims\" are astounded. The Tyrant explains that the Young Queen is being forced to eat her former lover as punishment for her betrayal. Fidelo slips out of the room unnoticed. The Old King asks the name of the man being eaten. The Tyrant tells him that it is Tymethes, son of the Old King of Lydia. Fidelo re-enters and tells the Old King that the castle guards have been seized. The Old King begs the Tyrant to have mercy on the Young Queen. The Tyrant refuses: \"Never, our vow's irrevocable, never. The lecher must be swallowed rib by rib. His flesh is sweet; it melts, and goes down merrily.\" At that moment, the pilgrims cast off their disguises and raise their swords. The Tyrant is shocked to see that Lapyrus has double-crossed him. Before he can be seized, the Tyrant kills the Young Queen and mocks his attackers. The Old King and company rush at the Tyrant with their swords. The Tyrant dies. The Old King is restored to his throne. The Old Queen enters, disguised as a humble nursemaid. The Old King asks her name, and she removes her disguise. The Old King rejoices and orders the burial of Tymethes' remains.\n\nParagraph 10: Reiko Chiba was born on January 8, 1975 in Fukushima Prefecture, and raised in Osaka Prefecture. She started her career as a model in 1991 before making her acting debut in the 1992 Super Sentai series Kyōryū Sentai Zyuranger as Mei/Ptera Ranger. When the series was adapted into the US version Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, it aired in Japan where Chiba, herself, re-dubbed both Ptera Ranger and the US footage of actress Amy Jo Johnson who played her character, now known as Kimberly Hart/Pink Ranger.  After the end of the series, Chiba made her J-Pop debut on April 7, 1993 as a member of Aurora Gonin Musume. She provided the vocals for the main theme song of Fatal Fury Special titled \"Non Stop! One Way Love\" and participated in the game's first image album, released April 1994. She also did a cameo voice appearance as herself in the anime movie Fatal Fury: The Motion Picture, performed the voice of Cham Cham in the Samurai Shodown video game series, and had a spot in the nightly radio show Akihabara Young Denkikan. Chiba retired from the entertainment industry in 1995. However, she has made several public appearances in recent years at comic and anime conventions in the United States to help promote the official US release of Zyuranger on DVD.\n\nParagraph 11: Arthur Llewellyn Basham was born on 24 May 1914, in Loughton, Essex, the son of Abraham Arthur Edward Basham and Maria Jane Basham née Thompson. Although an only child, he grew up in Essex with his adopted sister, who was in fact his cousin on his father's side. His father had been a journalist who served in the Indian Army at Kasauli, near Simla during World War I, and it was the stories that his father told him about India that first introduced him to the culture of the country to which he would devote his professional career. His mother was also a journalist and short story writer further instilling a love of language and literature. As a child, he was also introduced to music and learnt to play the piano to a high standard, writing a number of his own compositions by the age of sixteen.", "answers": ["Paragraph 6"], "length": 4149, "dataset": "passage_retrieval_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "125f26720fb54335c6e5c1aae7bc1020eeea28c46dd4ed55"}

He formed a troupe with two other singers, one of whom was also a tailor. It is believed that many of his songs were improvised. Only thirty of his songs have been written down. In 1857, he created the Broder-singer troupe and went to Russia due to an economic crisis in Brody. He published his first book of poetry in 1860 and went on to publish two more books. He composed numerous songs and couplets, although many were never published. He would often engage in rhyming competitions, usually winning against his opponents.", "context": "Paragraph 1: According to Metacritic, Fahrenheit received generally favourable reviews by critics. Executive producer Guillaume de Fondaumière claimed it was the highest-rated in its genre since Grim Fandango (1998) and considered the release a commercial success, with over one million copies sold. It was named the best adventure game of 2005 by Computer Games Magazine, GameSpy, PC Gamer, and IGN; Adventure Gamers ranked it fifty-seventh of all time. Game Informer listed Fahrenheit last among ten video game openings. Garnett Lee of 1Up.com praised the \"disturbing\" and graceful nature of the story as well as its combination with the gameplay, saying Fahrenheit had set a new standard for future aims of doing so. GameSpots Alex Navarro highlighted the layers of context and \"heartfelt meaning\" to its use of cinematic gameplay. He enjoyed the narrative, dubbing it \"deep, captivating\", and, echoing Lee, \"disturbing\". The character development, art style, voice acting, and music also saw approval from Navarro. Raymond M. Padilla at GameSpy declared that \"it's so good that it just might save a dying genre\", regarding the plot and main characters to be well-written and the voice cast as one of the best of the year. The controls were admired for their accessibility, while the score was complimented for its \"moody and captivating\" qualities. Writing for GameZone, Ronnie Hobbs liked that the controls helped with narrative immersion, and that this created an emotional connection to the characters. Hobbs' verdict read: \"Despite its flaws, Indigo Prophecy is the definitive interactive story, and not only does it perfect the genre, it redefines it\". Charles Onyett, reviewing the game for IGN, thought it succeeded in its effort to provide a movie-like experience. The feature of multiple playable characters was believed to have worked well, the action choreography and voice acting impressed him, and the soundtrack was described as gripping.\n\nParagraph 2: With the help of a Malabar Mappilas, Vakkom Moulavi was introduced to the popular Pan-Islamic journal Al-Manar, published by the influential Salafi scholar Mùhāmmád Ráshīd Rîdâ (1865 - 1935 C.E) from Cairo. Vakkom Moulavi would be its ardent reader, and through Al-Manar, Moulavi became familiar with a wide range of contemporary Islamic reform movements and would be influenced by the doctrines of the 14th century Sunni theologian Taqi al-Din Ibn Taymiyya (d. 1328 C.E / 728 A.H). Impressed by these reformers' staunch commitment to Tawhid, Moulavi began vigorously campaigning against shirk and bid'ah (innovations); and proclaimed the centrality of upholding Tawhid. Advocating the teachings of Rashid Rida and Ibn Taymiyya, Vakkom Moulavi attacked Madhab partisanship, condemned Taqlid, calling upon Muslims to shun un-Islamic customs by directly returning to Qur'an and Hadith; and establish Islamic Unity. Modelled after Al-Manar, Moulavi would publish numerous journals and magazines with the purpose of spreading Islamic message, in a way that would directly reach the common masses, through three languages Malayalam, Arabic and Arabi-Malayalam. Proclaiming the reformers' gratitude to Rashid Rida, Vakkom Moulavi wrote:\"It is through Rashid Rida's Al-Manar that Kerala Muslims were awakened\"Vakkom Moulavi's teachings would be popularised across Malabar by his disciples like Khatib Muhammad Moulavi (1886 - 1964 C.E). Like his teacher, K.M Moulavi was a regular reader of Al-Manar journal and a well-read expert of Fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence) and Islamic theology. K.M Moulavi was a fierce opponent of the British administration and played a major role in the Mappila rebellion of 1921, which sought to topple British colonial rule in Malabar. After the uprising was put down, K.M Moulavi fled to Kodungalur, a Muslim region free from British influences. From Kondungalur, Moulavi became known as a reputed scholar and advocated reformist campaigns calling for the eradication of shirk and bid'ah. He was also a founding leader of Kerala Muslim Aikya Sangham in 1921. K.M Moulavi played an important role in the proliferation of various Islamic publications like Al-Irshad, Al-Islah, Al-Murshid, etc and was a regular contributor in Rashid Rida's Al-Manar. At popular request, the British authorities would withdraw all Mappila Rebellion charges in 1932 and the Moulavi would return home. In 1932, K.M Moulavi held a meeting of major Moulavis from all parts of Kerala and announced the establishment of \"Kerala Jam'iyyat al-Ulema\". Thereafter, Moulavi would become the most influential Islamic scholar of the Mappila Muslims of Malabar. His fatwas were widely requested all across Kerala due to his immense knowledge of Qur'an and Hadith; as well as his juristic mastery of Shafi'i and Hanafi madh'habs (legal schools). By force of his charismatic personality and widely accepted scholarly credentials, Moulavi was able to overcome newly developed opposition to the Islahi movement.\n\nParagraph 3: In , Gil started for the O's on Opening Day. He was the first Orioles rookie to start at catcher on Opening Day since Andy Etchebarren, in . He caught 33 out of 91 baserunners stealing, second in the American League to Bengie Molina. He hit his first big league homer on April 11, off Tampa Bay Devil Rays pitcher Travis Phelps. His first multi-homer game was on April 23, both off the Boston Red Sox pitcher Frank Castillo. He also hit another home run off Castillo on April 29. Gil hit 12 home runs that year, the most ever by a Mexican-born rookie. The previous record was held by Vinny Castilla, who hit 9 for the Colorado Rockies in . An interesting fact about Gil's 2002 season is that of his 12 home runs, 4 were against the Red Sox, the most he hit against any team that year. 3 of those 4 homers he hit against Boston were off Frank Castillo. He was selected as the catcher on the Topps' All-Rookie team after the season was over. Gil played for the Obregón Yaquis in the Mexican Pacific League during the 2002 off season, batting .266 with 6 home runs and 20 runs batted in. He played mostly first base, outfield and designated hitter. He also played 6 games as a catcher and a game at third.\n\nParagraph 4: As 1994 progressed Dusty became involved in another angle with his son and The Stud Stable, offering commentary on the May 21, 1994 edition of WCW Saturday Night on Col. Robert Parker's efforts against Dustin. At a television taping on July 25, 1994 in Macon, GA he came to ringside and attacked Parker, before being overwhelmed by the manager and Bunkhouse Buck. After being rescued by Ricky Steamboat and Dustin, he made an appearance in Dustin's corner on the August 6th edition of WCW Saturday Night when his son faced Bunkhouse Buck. After delivering a bionic elbow to Buck when the referee was distracted, Dustin was able to gain the pinfall. This ultimately led to Dusty's second match since departing the WWF, where he would team with Dustin to defeated Terry Funk and Buckhouse Buck at Clash of the Champions XXVIII. After a vignette that saw Dusty travel to \"The Scrap Bar\" to recruit The Nasty Boys, he teamed with them and Dustin to defeat Buck, Arn Anderson, Terry Funk, and Rob Parker in a War Games match at Fall Brawl 94. He returned to the ring for three more house show matches that fall, teaming with Dustin  to defeat the Stud Stable. His last in-ring match for World Championship Wrestling in this run came on November 24, 1994 in Albany, GA, where Dusty and Dustin Rhodes defeated Arn Anderson and Bunkhouse Buck in a steel cage.\n\nParagraph 5: Bravo made his One Day International debut against England in their 2003/04 tour of the Caribbean, in a match in which he failed to bat but took 2–31 with the ball. In the West Indies tour of England in 2004 Bravo made his Test debut when he was selected for the First Test at Lord's in which he scored 44 and 10 and took three wickets. He finished the Test series with 16 wickets and a total of 220 runs with his most impressive performance at Old Trafford in a match in which he was the top scorer in the first innings with 77 followed by an 6 for 55  performance with the ball. The latter remains his best bowling figures in Test cricket.\n\nParagraph 6: In Charlotte, Smith founded in 1957 the first commercial recording studio in the Southeast. In addition to recording the Crackerjacks and its various members, he recorded such musicians as vocalist/guitarist/songwriter Tommy Faile, Lester Flatt, Earl Scruggs, Pat Boone, Ronnie Milsap, George Beverly Shea and the Statler Brothers. He also produced sides from many other acts, including rhythm and blues star James Brown, whose \"Papa's Got a Brand New Bag\" (1965) was cut in Smith's studio. It was later ranked as \"No. 72 in Rolling Stone's list of the 500 greatest songs of all time.\"  In this facility, Smith also created and produced nationally syndicated radio programs hosted by Johnny Cash, Chet Atkins, Richard Petty, James Brown, and George Beverly Shea. Billy Graham's Hour of Decision radio program was first produced in Smith's studio. Smith also produced and hosted his own radio program, Top of the Morning, which was syndicated for an unbroken span of 29 years.  In the 1970s, Smith produced a weekly, 30-minute videotaped program syndicated in more than 90 TV markets at its peak. He produced radio and television shows for a number of other artists, including Johnny Cash, who had become a friend, and gospel singer George Beverly Shea.\n\nParagraph 7: According to some scholars, collectivization in the Soviet Union and a lack of favored industries were the primary contributors to famine mortality (52% of excess deaths), and some evidence shows that ethnic Ukrainians and Germans were discriminated against.  Lewis H. Siegelbaum, Professor of History at Michigan State University, states that Ukraine was hit particularly hard by grain quotas which were set at levels which  most farms could not produce. The 1933 harvest was poor, coupled with the extremely high quota level, which led to starvation conditions.  The shortages were blamed on kulak sabotage, and authorities distributed what supplies were available only in the urban areas. According to a Centre for Economic Policy Research paper published in 2021 by Andrei Markevich, Natalya Naumenko, and Nancy Qian, regions with higher Ukrainian population shares were struck harder with centrally planned policies corresponding to famine, and Ukrainian populated areas were given lower amounts of tractors  which the paper argues demonstrates that ethnic discrimination across the board was centrally planned, ultimately concluding that 92% of famine deaths in Ukraine alone along with 77% of famine deaths in Ukraine, Russia, and Belarus combined can be explained by systematic bias against Ukrainians. The collectivization and high procurement quota explanation for the famine is somewhat called into question by the fact that the oblasts of Ukraine with the highest losses being Kyiv and Kharkiv, which produced far lower amounts of grain than other sections of the country. A potential explanation for this was that Kharkiv and Kyiv fulfilled and overfulfilled their grain procurements in 1930, which led to rations in these Oblasts having their procurement quotas doubled in 1931, compared to the national average increase in procurement rate of 9%, while Kharkiv and Kyiv had their quotas increased the Odesa oblast and some raions of Dnipropetrovsk oblast had their procurement quotas decreased. According to Nataliia Levchuk of the Ptoukha Institute of Demography and Social Studies, \"the distribution of the largely increased 1931 grain quotas in Kharkiv and Kyiv oblasts by raion was very uneven and unjustified because it was done disproportionally to the percentage of wheat sown area and their potential grain capacity.\" Oleh Wolowyna comments that peasant resistance and the ensuing repression of said resistance was a critical factor for the famine in Ukraine and parts of Russia populated by national minorities like Germans and Ukrainians allegedly tainted by \"fascism and bourgeois nationalism\" according to Soviet authorities.\n\nParagraph 8: Rejected by Hammond, Blanche becomes a slovenly alcoholic who does nothing all day long.  While Hammond is on a business trip alone, Blanche discovers Ellen is pregnant. Correctly assuming the baby is Hammond's, Blanche beats Ellen. Ellen flees, but falls down some stairs, and miscarries. Hammond (who had promised Ellen that her baby would be freed), returns to Falconhurst and discovers Ellen lost the baby. Threatened with bodily harm by Warren, Ellen does not tell him how she miscarried.  Hammond gives Ellen a pair of ruby earrings, which she wears while serving an evening meal. Hammond gave the matching necklace to Blanche, who becomes enraged to find Ellen being publicly favored by Hammond.\n\nParagraph 9: The impressive station was obviously intended to serve the Marrickville township proper but it was distant, surrounded by industrial and rural estates and only grew as a station by reason of the need to cope with the branch line junction. In 1907 the line from Edgeware Road to Sydenham was quadruplicated to serve the Belmore to Bankstown extension when it opened in 1909. This resulted in confining both buildings on island platforms so that passengers had to reach the platforms by an extended footbridge, whereas the substantial platform building on the current platform 2/3 island previously faced the street. A new timber overhead booking office on a steel support frame was built between Platforms 3 and 4 and steel footbridges were eventually extended to all platforms  1914.\n\nParagraph 10: In 2000, they released the self-titled demo, Transistor Revolt. Tintari left the band in the fall of that year before the recording of their full-length album. He was later replaced by Brandon Barnes of \"Pinhead Circus\". The band then signed with independent record label Fat Wreck Chords in 2001. They then released their debut album The Unraveling and spent the rest of the year touring. In 2002, Mr. Precision left and was replaced by Todd Mohney. The band returned to the studio in December 2002 to work on their second full-length album, Revolutions per Minute in 2003 and toured for the 2003 Warped Tour, which gained the band some success. Rise Against then signed to Dreamworks Records in late 2003 to begin the recording of their third record, but Dreamworks was shortly absorbed by the Universal Music Group, and Rise Against found itself with Major label Geffen Records. Todd Mohney, the band's guitarist at the time, left and was replaced by Chris Chasse and began the recording of their new album Siren Song of the Counter Culture. Siren Song of the Counter Culture was released on August 10, 2004, peaking at number 136 on the Billboard 200 album charts, gaining the band major critical and commercial success with the singles \"Give It All, \"Swing Life Away\", and \"Life Less Frightening\".\n\nParagraph 11: \"Stranger in Moscow\" received praise from music critics and producers. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic noted of HIStory, \"Jackson produces some well-crafted pop that ranks with his best material... 'Stranger in Moscow' is one of his most haunting ballads\". Tom Molley of the Associated Press described it as an \"ethereal and stirring description of a man wounded by a 'swift and sudden fall from grace' walking in the shadow of the Kremlin\". Longtime collaborator  Bruce Swedien, has described \"Stranger in Moscow\" as one of the best songs Jackson had ever done. Fred Shuster of the Daily News of Los Angeles described it as, \"a lush, pretty minor-key ballad with one of the album's catchiest choruses\". Chris Willman of Los Angeles Times stated:  A reviewer from Music Week rated it five out of five, picking it as Single of the Week. The reviewer added, \"More melodic than most of HIStorys new, uptempo tracks, this has a somewhat old-fashioned feel, being closer in spirit to Rock With You than Scream. It isn't quite vintage Jacko, but the song is irresistible.\" The magazine's Alan Jones stated that the Todd Terry remix \"works like a dream, and guarantees Jackson another substantial hit.\" Jon Pareles of The New York Times stated, \"The ballads are lavishly melodic. 'Stranger In Moscow', with odd lyrics like 'Stalin's tomb won't let me be,' has a beautiful chorus for the repeated question 'How does it feel?' \". Further praise came in 2005 when it was felt that the song had successfully portrayed \"eerie loneliness\" and was characterized as beautiful by Josephine Zohny of PopMatters. Rod Temperton, one of Jackson's songwriters from earlier in his career, believes that \"Stranger in Moscow\" is Jackson's best song. James Hunter of Rolling Stone commented: Patrick Macdonald of The Seattle Times described \"Stranger in Moscow\" as \"a pretty ballad interspersed with sounds of rain.\" David Sinclair from The Times viewed it as \"a dolorous ballad\".\n\nParagraph 12: Following Attilan's destruction during the Infinity storyline, Karnak goes on a rampage in New York at the start of the Inhumanity storyline. He is stopped and imprisoned by the Avengers. After warning Medusa to forget what she knows in order to prepare for a coming cataclysm, Karnak commits suicide by leaping out of one of the windows in Avengers Tower. Months pass by and the Terrigen Mists that spread throughout the world during Inhumanity have revealed Inhuman hybrids living among humans, dubbed the NuHumans. Medusa reveals their existence to the general public, and NuHumans become integrated into New Attilan society. One NuHuman named Lineage joins Medusa's council, taking Karnak's place. Lineage's power is having the knowledge of all his ancestors. Lineage plans to use the Inhuman genome to destroy humanity and rule the Inhumans. Meanwhile, Karnak has wound up in a strange afterlife that he believes to be hell. He and an ally he meets here plans to escape this place, and they successfully find a door out while holding off strange creatures. Karnak uses his ability to see the weakness in things to open the door, and finds himself bursting out of Lineage's chest in the real world, killing Lineage in the process. He realizes that what he thought was Hell was inside Lineage, as Karnak is one of his ancestors. Karnak tells Medusa he knows that she has been an outstanding queen in his absence and rejoins her council.\n\nParagraph 13: Ekidens are usually road races, and as such require intensive route management and police traffic control. Cross country races can include grass, mud, sand, and steep slopes. Each ekiden competitor runs a different distance, whereas all cross country runners run the same course and start at the same time . Some Japanese high school ekiden stages are longer and some stages are shorter than the \"standard\" 5000 meters for USA high school cross country (see below). Ekiden competition does not highlight the single individual winner of the race as in cross country, but ekiden analysis does highlight individual fastest runners in each stage; these runners may be in the middle of the field. Each ekiden runner has to run without reference to his or her own teammates for help in judging pace, whereas cross country team races can include strategies like \"pack\" running. This same contrast can be made between track and ekiden; only the runners in the first ekiden stage run as a group; later stage runners must judge for themselves the appropriate pace and the decisions to challenge and pass other runners, whose abilities might be significantly different and whose position was determined by the efforts of preceding teammates.\n\nParagraph 14: From some time in his late teens or early twenties, he headed on the road as an itinerant performer, along with two other singers, one of whom was also a tailor who made costumes for the troupe. It is believed that many of his songs were improvised on the spot; only thirty survive in written form. In 1857, when economic crisis hit Brody, he created the Broder-singer troupe and left for Russia. His first book of poetry was published in 1860 in Pressburg, the second in Lemberg, and the third (1882) in Warsaw. He composed a tremendous number of songs and couplets which were never published, and would challenge his partners and competitors to rhyming duels, himself generally emerging the victor.\n\nParagraph 15: In 1996, Shadows Fall recorded a demo called Mourning a Dead World, printing 200 copies. Guitarist Matt Bachand said the demo \"was really intended just for us to work on things\". People bought the demo and Shadows Fall began to have concerts. Bachand formed Lifeless Records to produce Somber Eyes to the Sky and both self-financed and self-promoted it. Genet Records of Belgium created a repress of the album, and Somber Eyes to the Sky sold 15,000 copies worldwide, including a few thousand in Europe. Somber Eyes to the Sky was recorded in Zing Recording Studios in Westfield, Massachusetts. Released on November 30, 1997, Somber Eyes to the Sky had success in late 1998 and early 1999 on CMJ New Music Report Loud Rock airplay chart, reaching the top ten and remaining on the chart for several weeks.\n\nParagraph 16: Only in the late afternoon on 1 January 1943 did Hitler learn that the Kriegsmarine had in fact been defeated in the Barents Sea, which put Hitler into a huge rage against the navy in general and Raeder in particular. As a result, Raeder was ordered to leave Berlin for the Wolf's Lair to explain to Hitler personally just why he reported the defeat in the Barents Sea as a victory – a trip that Raeder was not keen to make as he waited until 6 January 1943 before reporting at the Wolf's Lair. At a meeting on 6 January 1943 Hitler for over 2 hours savaged Raeder, complaining that he had spent millions of Reichsmarks in the 1930s building a fleet that proved useless when war came, instead of spending the money on building U-boats, which had proven far more useful in the war. Hitler went on to castigate the navy, saying that navy had done nothing in the wars of unification, that the High Seas Fleet \"played no important role in the World War\" and lacked \"... men of action who were determined to fight with or without the Kaiser\", that the navy were a nest of traitors whose only contribution to World War I was the High Seas Fleet mutiny of 1918, and that given this history, it was no surprise that the navy's record in World War II with the notable exception of the U-boats was one of failure after failure. Raeder, who had always taken great pride in the history of the navy, was very hurt by Hitler's account of German naval history, which was almost certainly Hitler's intention. Hitler offered up the recent Battle of the Barents Sea as just one more example of how the navy except for the U-boats failed him time after time. Hitler went on to accuse naval officers of being cowards not fully committed to victory, and offered a contrast with the Army, which Hitler claimed was run by brave men unafraid of death in their quest for total victory. Finally, Hitler announced that since Germany's capital ships had proven so useless, he was planning to scrap all of the capital ships and use their guns for coastal defence. The gun crews would be assigned to coastal defence, while the rest of their crews would be redeployed to the U-boats and the E-boats or re-trained and sent to the Eastern Front as infantry. Raeder left the meeting of 6 January very depressed, especially over the prospect of seeing his beloved capital ships scrapped and of Hitler's criticism of his leadership. Raeder told Hitler on 14 January 1943 that he could not preside over the scrapping of the capital ships, and informed the Führer of his wish to resign as of 30 January 1943 rather than carry out a policy that he did not believe in.\n\nParagraph 17: The interior, by contrast, was destined to have been a riot of Burgesian excess but \"not one of the rooms was completed according to Burges's designs.\"   Of the few interior features that were fully executed, much was dismantled or covered over by Sir John and his successors, who followed the twentieth century distaste for Victorian architecture, and for the work of Burges in particular.  The attitude persisted on the National Trust's acquiring the house in 1973. Writing at the time of the acquisition, the then Secretary, Robin Fedden, wrote; \"the house was built by an architect called Burgess (sic). I expect it is coming back into fashion but the house could be regarded as irrelevant except as part of the setting in the garden.\"  The new approach since the rehabilitation of the reputation of Burges  has seen the Trust seeking to recover and restore as many of Burges's fittings as possible, including some \"sparkling\" ceilings, such as that in the Drawing Room, which was discovered in 1981, having been boarded over as early as 1889. In a number of instances, the Trust has brought in Burges-designed furniture from other locations, including a bookcase from The Tower House, now in the Great Hall, and a marble fireplace in the Drawing Room, from Burges's redecoration of Worcester College, Oxford. The presentation album which Burges prepared, and which can be seen at the house, shows what might have been. \"At Knightshayes Burges was on top form. But (his) magical interiors remained a half-formed dream.\" The Victorian commentator Charles Locke Eastlake described the house in his A History of the Gothic Revival: \"For this quality of design as well as for a certain vigour of treatment, Knightshayes may be considered a typical example of the Revival.\"\n\nParagraph 18: Israel (ranked 8th in the Davis Cup standings, with 5,394 points) hosted heavily favored Russia (which won in both 2002 and 2006, and was the top-ranked country in Davis Cup standings, with 27,897 points) in a Davis Cup quarterfinal tie in July 2009, on indoor hard courts at the Nokia Arena in Tel Aviv.  Israel was represented by Sela, Harel Levy, Jonathan Erlich, and Andy Ram. Russia's lineup consisted of Marat Safin (#60 in the world; former world #1), Igor Andreev (24), Igor Kunitsyn (35), and Mikhail Youzhny (69; former world #8).  Sela said before the tie:  \"We feel we can beat the Russians.\"  The stage was then set by Safin, who prior to the tie told the press:  \"With all due respect, Israel was lucky to get to the quarterfinals.\"  The Israeli team's response was to beat the Russian team in each of their first three matches, thereby winning the tie. Levy, world #210, beat Russia's top player, Andreev, world #24 in the opening match. Sela (#33) followed by beating Russian Youzhny. Israeli captain Eyal Ran likened his players to two fighter jets on court, saying:  \"I felt as if I had two F-16s out there today, they played amazingly well.\"  The 10,500 spectators were the largest crowd ever for a tennis match in Israel.  The next day Israelis Ram and Erlich beat Safin and Kunitsyn in front of a boisterous crowd of over 10,000.  Even the Saudi Gazette described the doubles match as a \"thrilling\" win.  Ran was carried shoulder-high around the Tel Aviv stadium, as the 10,000-strong crowd applauded.  With the tie clinched for Israel, the reverse singles rubbers were \"dead\", and instead of best-of-five matches, best-of-three sets were played, with the outcomes of little to no importance.  Israel wrapped up a 4–1 victory over Russia, as Levy defeated Kunitsyn, while Sela retired with a wrist injury while down 3–4 in the first set against Andreev. Israel, however, lost to Spain in the semi-finals, 4–1.\n\nParagraph 19: Dave later starts a relationship with Kathy. When she imposes a sex ban until they marry, Dave resumes an old affair with Kim Tate (Claire King). King told Inside Soap's Ross that Kim is \"totally in love with Dave\". Kim's initial reaction to Dave is \"phroar, I fancy a bit of that\". As Kim fills the role of the \"bitch\", she knows what she wants and exactly how to get it. King explained that the adventurous sex between Dave and Kim leaves her hooked on him. She opined that they \"have a pretty good sex life\" because they do it in stables and on office desks, rather than a bed. Kelsey said that Dave enjoys playing with Kim's \"fire\" and would not be interested in her if she were single. Ultimately \"it's the wanton streak in Kim that Dave finds so irresistible\". Dave becomes more involved with Kim over time. Eventually Kim decides that she wants a larger share in Frank's estate and plans to achieve this by having his baby. However, Frank has a low sperm count which improves the chances that the baby could be Dave's. King revealed that Kim would often try to give him special treatment at his work place. While Kelsey said that Dave always runs back to Kathy for \"a cup of tea and a bun\", but having a baby changes that dynamic. If he was the father, Dave would \"probably\" stand by Kim as he would be \"proud as punch to be a dad\". Off-screen King was married to fellow Emmerdale cast member Peter Amory (who plays Chris Tate), who would often tease her for Kim's romance with Dave. With the storyline came heightened publicity. Kelsey felt that this made his work load heavier and was required to attend various photo shoots to promote the affair.\n\nParagraph 20: The life cycle of Lassa mammarenavirus is similar to the Old World arenaviruses. Lassa mammarenavirus enters the cell by the receptor-mediated endocytosis. Which endocytotic pathway is used is not known yet, but at least the cellular entry is sensitive to cholesterol depletion. It was reported that virus internalization is limited upon cholesterol depletion. The receptor used for cell entry is alpha-dystroglycan, a highly conserved and ubiquitously expressed cell surface receptor for extracellular matrix proteins. Dystroglycan, which is later cleaved into alpha-dystroglycan and beta-dystroglycan is originally expressed in most cells to mature tissues, and it provides molecular link between the ECM and the actin-based cytoskeleton. After the virus enters the cell by alpha-dystroglycan mediated endocytosis, the low-pH environment triggers pH-dependent membrane fusion and releases RNP (viral ribonucleoprotein) complex into the cytoplasm. Viral RNA is unpacked, and replication and transcription initiate in the cytoplasm. As replication starts, both S and L RNA genomes synthesize the antigenomic S and L RNAs, and from the antigenomic RNAs, genomic S and L RNA are synthesized. Both genomic and antigenomic RNAs are needed for transcription and translation. The S RNA encodes GP and NP (viral nucleocapsid protein) proteins, while L RNA encodes Z and L proteins. The L protein most likely represents the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. When the cell is infected by the virus, L polymerase is associated with the viral RNP and initiates the transcription of the genomic RNA. The 5’ and 3’ terminal 19 nt viral promoter regions of both RNA segments are necessary for recognition and binding of the viral polymerase. The primary transcription first transcribes mRNAs from the genomic S and L RNAs, which code NP and L proteins, respectively. Transcription terminates at the stem-loop (SL) structure within the intergenomic region. Arenaviruses use a cap snatching strategy to gain the cap structures from the cellular mRNAs, and it is mediated by the endonuclease activity of the L polymerase and the cap binding activity of NP. Antigenomic RNA transcribes viral genes GPC and Z, encoded in genomic orientation, from S and L segments respectively. The antigenomic RNA also serves as the template for the replication. After translation of GPC, it is posttranslationally modified in the endoplasmic reticulum. GPC is cleaved into GP1 and GP2 at the later stage of the secretory pathway. It has been reported that the cellular protease SKI-1/S1P is responsible for this cleavage. The cleaved glycoproteins are incorporated into the virion envelope when the virus buds and release from the cell membrane.\n\nParagraph 21: Rabanus Maurus: \"Or; The ruler of the synagogue signifies Moses; he is named Jairus, ‘illuminating,’ or, ‘that shall illuminate,’ because he received the words of life to give to us, and by them enlightens all, being himself enlightened by the Holy Spirit. The daughter of the ruler, that is, the synagogue itself, being as it were in the twelfth year of its age, that is, in the season of puberty, when it should have borne spiritual progeny to God, fell into the sickness of error. While then the Word of God is hastening to this ruler's daughter to make whole the sons of Israel, a holy Church is gathered from among the Gentiles, which while it was perishing by inward corruption, received by faith that healing that was prepared for others. It should be noted, that the ruler's daughter was twelve years old, and this woman had been twelve years afflicted; thus she had begun to be diseased at the very time the other was born; so in one and the same age the synagogue had its birth among the Patriarchs, and the nations without began to be polluted with the pest of idolatry. For the issue of blood may be taken in two ways, either for the pollution of idolatry, or for obedience to the pleasures of flesh and blood. Thus as long as the synagogue flourished, the Church languished; the falling away of the first was made the salvation of the Gentiles. Also the Church draws nigh and touches the Lord, when it approaches Him in faith. She believed, spake her belief, and touched, for by these three things, faith, word, and deed, all salvation is gained. She came behind Him, as He spake, If any one serve me, let him follow me; (John 12:26.) or because, not having seen the Lord present in the flesh, when the sacraments of His incarnation were fulfilled, she came at length to the grace of the knowledge of Him. Thus also she touched the hem of His garment, because the Gentiles, though they had not seen Christ in the flesh, received the tidings of His incarnation. The garment of Christ is put for the mystery of His incarnation, wherewith His Deity is clothed; the hem of His garment are the words that hang upon His incarnation. She touches not the garment, but the hem thereof; because she saw not the Lord in the flesh, but received the word of the incarnation through the Apostles. Blessed is he that touches but the uttermost part of the word by faith. She is healed while the Lord is not in the city, but while He is yet on the way; as the Apostles cried, Because ye judge yourselves unworthy of eternal life, lo, we turn to the Gentiles. (Acts 13:46.) And from the time of the Lord's coming the Gentiles began to be healed.\"\n\nParagraph 22: Chinese economic dominance of Laos dates back to the medieval Southeast Asian caravan trade that involved the integration of the medieval Lao Kingdom of Lan Xang into medieval Southeast Asia's regional trade network stemming from its establishment in 1354. By the end of the fifteenth century, the Kingdom of Lan Xang gained its economic efflorescence as a result of the prosperity engendered by the Southeast Asian caravan trade. Expatriate Hui caravan merchants and traders acted as intermediaries between the Laotian highland and lowland as their commercial activities of supplying and collecting from the Laotian highland energized the Kingdom's economy alongside the various Southeast Asian trade routes in addition to reaping the economic prosperity presided by the Chinese which acted as a major tax revenue stream for the Lan Xang monarchy. Numerous goods were traded on the Lanxang and international market ranging from medicinal plants, resins, benzoin, timber, and ivory. In the 19th century precipated by Qing rebellions, political upheavals, and dynastic conflicts sent waves of Han Chinese into Central and Southern Laos. Many of the Han immigrants whom eventually settled down in Vietiane, Pakse, Savannakhet, and Thakhek traced their ancestry to the Southern Chinese provinces of Fujian, Guangdong, and Hainan. Starting off their humble migrant beginnings as coolies for the French Colonial Empire in Laos, the Chinese soon began to flourish and eventually dominated the Laotian economy based on the Confucian paradigm of networking. In order to secure and protect their economic interests, the Chinese banded together to what the French colonialists denoted as congrégations (huiguan 会馆 or bang 帮). The French colonial economic structure utilized as an instrument to extract agricultural produce and the distribution of rudimentary consumer goods was nonetheless heavily dependent on the massive web of business networks controlled by the Chinese middlemen. Laotian entrepreneurs of Chinese ancestry purchased, wholesaled, traded, imported, and exported everything of economic value across the French Indo-Chinese colonies. Dominating the Indo-Chinese trade, the Chinese began to act as compradors for French colonial trading cooperatives as economic preponderance prompted Laotian businessmen of Chinese ancestry to act as financial intermediaries and operating as agents for the French as well as their own. Even more indicative of Chinese economic prowess was their control of the massive system of financial services networks across French Indo-China. One of the earliest modern forms of Laotian Chinese commodities trading was the purchase of indigenous Lao products from the Laotian countryside, which were then in turn, wholesaled to Laotian Chinese merchants and exporters in the urban areas of Laos. In the constituent domain of international finance and trade within Laos, the Chinese occupy a significant position, with much of the Laotian Chinese commercial activities having been extensively pervasive, as they control 75 percent of Lao's foreign trade in addition to presiding much of the Overseas Chinese investment capital, largely concentrated in 3 of the 4 major Laotian banks. In heavy industry, the Chinese dominate the Laotian industrial manufacturing sector, with dozens of Chinese-owned Laotian industrial manufacturing establishments involved in the production of plastics, monosodium glutamate, textiles, laundry detergent powder, nails, sheet metal, matches, ice, and beverages in addition to the Chinese possessing 70 percent of Laos's aggregate sawmill production capabilities.   \n\nParagraph 23: As top-40 radio became dominant on AM in the late 1950s, the Yankee Network continued to program for an audience that was now aging. In fact, at many stations, the programming content was undergoing a number of changes: for one thing, few stations had live orchestras any more. With television becoming popular, many programs previously heard only on radio moved over to TV. Even soap operas, long a staple of network programming on radio, ceased in 1960. Also during this time period, many stations stopped relying on syndicated programs from NBC, CBS, ABC, or Mutual and began to do their own programming:  in Boston, for example, WBZ ended its long affiliation with NBC to program its own music, using live and local announcers. Just like with WBZ, the emphasis at many radio stations had shifted to playing records.  As the top-40 hit format proliferated, in an effort to attract the growing youth audience, WNAC and the Yankee Network stayed with the older music; this earned them praise from a number of newspaper columnists, many of whom were also getting older and found top-40 unpleasant.  For them, WNAC's and the Yankee Network's emphasis on \"great standards\" and songs with \"beautiful melodies\" was very comforting.  The Yankee stations, especially flagship WNAC, played the music that the older audience enjoyed, avoiding songs that were popular with young people and focusing on \"easy listening\" music.  One popular announcer during this time was Gus Saunders, who was also well known as the host of another of the Yankee Network's cooking programs; in addition, Saunders announced some of the network's sports events, such as Boston's BAA Marathon. Another popular announcer was Vin Maloney, who like Saunders, fulfilled a wide range of functions for WNAC and the Yankee Network, including announcing, news-reading, and covering sports.  The Yankee News Service remained popular throughout the 1950s, and listeners relied on it for local news and sports; this was especially true in the summer of 1957, when Boston's newspapers went on strike.  WNAC, WNAC-TV, and the entire Yankee Network increased the amount of hourly newscasts, added more news bulletins, and sent out members of its Boston staff to post news headlines on billboards around the city.\n\nParagraph 24: Scaddan's government was returned in the election of 1914, but with a majority of only two.  This small majority, along with the outbreak of war in 1914 and the onset of one of the worst droughts ever to hit Western Australia, severely restricted Scaddan's policy in his second term.  The government's position was made even more unstable when, in January 1915, the Labor MLA for Roebourne, Joseph Gardiner, walked out of Parliament House, and did not return.  He subsequently left the state altogether, and in September 1915 his seat was declared vacant for non-attendance.  Labor lost the resulting by-election in November, leaving it with exactly half of the seats in parliament.  Meanwhile, Bertie Johnston, Labor's only member for a farming seat, had voted with the opposition several times in reaction to Scaddan's failure to fulfill a promise to reduce the price of crown land.  Eventually, Johnston resigned from the party and from parliament over the Nevanas affair, and was subsequently re-elected as an independent in January 1916.   This left the Labor government with a minority of seats, and in July 1916 the Liberal and Country parties cooperated to defeat the government.  Scaddan then asked the Governor Sir Harry Barron for a dissolution of parliament, but was refused.  Scaddan resigned as premier on 27 July 1916, and Liberal leader Frank Wilson took office.\n\nParagraph 25: In 1130 the diocese of Genoa faced a series of crises. In Rome, Pope Honorius II died on 13 February 1130. Two separate conclaves were held, and each elected a pope, Anacletus II (Petrus Pierleoni) and Innocent II (Gregorius Papareschi). Both sides immediately appealed for recognition and support from the King of the Romans, Lothair of Supplinburg. At the time, Lothair was in a fierce struggle for the imperial crown against Conrad III (Hohenstaufen) who had been crowned King of Italy with the Iron Crown of Lombardy by Archbishop Anselm of Milan in 1128. For this act he and the city of Milan were placed under papal interdict. Innocent was not able to maintain himself in Rome against the opposition of the majority of the Cardinals, of the clergy, of the nobility, and of the people of Rome, though for a time he held the Trastevere; in May or June he fled the City, and arrived in Pisa c. 20 June, and on 2 August he was in Genoa.  Meanwhile, in Milan, Archbishop Anselm had announced his support for Pope Anacletus, though a substantial number of Milanese objected to his choice and campaigned for Innocent. The opposition was led by the Archpriest, Stephanus Guandeca, who brought the people around to repudiating Anacletus, recognizing Innocent, and deposing Anselm.", "answers": ["Paragraph 14"], "length": 7218, "dataset": "passage_retrieval_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "63f51ad777ae342acc9df26f0224daf5b469ddb0087c2692"}
{"input": "In this text, the author argues that neoconservatism presents a contradiction in the areas of political and economic development. On one hand, neoconservatives prioritize democracy promotion and human rights in foreign policy, but on the other hand, they are wary of large-scale social engineering due to potential unintended consequences. The author suggests that the Bush Administration should have applied the principle of caution in foreign policy, similar to warnings by domestic neoconservatives like James Q. Wilson against extensive social programs. The author quotes Dick Cheney's belief that troops in Iraq would be greeted as liberators, contrasting it with President George W. Bush's assertion that democratic desires are universal. The author explains that while there is a broader trend towards the spread of liberal democracy, it is important to note that democracy and prosperity cannot be forced upon a society at a given time without considering the critical intervening variables known as institutions. The author concludes that neoconservatives paid too little attention to development and focused too heavily on defense.", "context": "Paragraph 1: \"This place has been to you the scene of many wayward frolic, of many a childish gam bob. You have here laughed and sported together year after year, caring only for the present, thoughtful of tomorrow and seemingly unconscious that you are never to be troubled with my cares beyond those of the present hour. I knew no other condition, I doubted not that the world was all friendly. But when I was torn from the companions of my childhood, and removed to a distance from kindred and home, and placed among strangers, I found, to my sad disappointment, that I was of little consequence to the world around me, and that none but myself cared for my comfort and welfare. Then it was that I learned to value the joys, and thousand social endearments of home. Then it was, that I learned duly to estimate the consolation which springs from the mature sympathy of school-fellows. Then, and not till then, did I know what it was to want a friend to smooth down the bed of sickness…  For it is a law of nature, that we know not the worth of our enjoyments, until the time arrives when they are to be interrupted. Then, and not till then, do we feel the wants of them…   I want you to reflect upon the many happy hours you have here enjoyed, that you may, in after years, when surrounded, perhaps with disease, and danger, and death, receive comfort and consolation by the retrospection.  It will be so delightful, yet so deeply affecting, when old age is upon you, to tell over the scenes and the frolics of your school-boy days! I have been acquainted with many village schools, but none did I ever witness so much mutual good will, so great manifestations of true and sincere friendship, as I have witnessed in this. You have always seemed to me, to constitute one great Family; and I have often thought you are indeed a band of Brothers and Sisters! For my own part, having spent two winters with you, I am, and shall always be ready to bear testimony to your depth of sympathy and kindly feeling as friends, and your faithfulness and diligence as scholars. During the last winter, my attention was so strongly attracted by these qualities, and by the kindness with which I was uniformly treated, that I formed an attachment to you, which not ever time, but death alone can sever… And am I no more to have my ears greeted with the endearing title of Master? - a title which has always suggested to my mind, so many pleasing emotions!  … Be assured, I shall not forget you.\"\n\nParagraph 2: In the 18th century, Vietnam was officially ruled by the Lê dynasty, but real power lay in the hands of two warring families, the Trịnh lords of the north who ruled from the imperial court in Thăng Long and the Nguyễn lords in the south, who ruled from their capital Huế. Both sides warred extensively for control of the country while simultaneously claiming to be loyal to the Lê emperor. Life for the peasants during these times were difficult- ownership of land became concentrated in the hands of a handful of landlords as time passed. The imperial bureaucracy became corrupt and oppressive; at one point the imperial examination-degrees were sold to whoever was wealthy enough to purchase them. As the people grew poorer, the ruling lords lived lavish lifestyles in opulent palaces. While the Trịnh lords had enjoyed peace since the end of the war between the Trịnh and the Nguyễn in 1672, the Nguyễn lords regularly campaigned against Cambodia and later the Kingdom of Siam. While the Nguyễn lords usually won these wars and opened up new fertile lands for the landless poor to settle, the frequent warring took a toll on their popularity.\n\nParagraph 3: In January 2011, Máximo took part in the Fantastica Mania 2011 weekend, co-produced by CMLL and New Japan Pro-Wrestling in Tokyo. On January 22, Máximo was defeated by old rival Taichi in a singles match. The following day, he teamed with Danshoku Dino in a tag team match, where they were defeated by Gedo and Jado. In December 2011, Máximo formed the trio El Bufete del Amor with Marco Corleone and Rush. On January 21, 2012, Máximo returned to Japan to take part in Fantastica Mania 2012, teaming with Danshoku Dino on night one in a tag team match, where they were defeated by Suzuki-gun (Taichi and Taka Michinoku). The following day, Máximo picked up his first win in Japan, when he and Jushin Thunder Liger defeated Taichi and Misterioso Jr. in a tag team match. Back in Mexico, El Bufete del Amor defeated Los Hijos del Averno (Averno, Ephesto and Mephisto) on February 19 to win the CMLL World Trios Championship. Máximo returned to Japan on July 7 for a two-week-long tour with New Japan Pro-Wrestling. In January 2013, Máximo returned to Japan to take part in the three-day Fantastica Mania 2013 event. During the first night on January 18, he teamed with La Máscara and Mascara Dorada in a six-man tag team match, where they were defeated by Taichi, Taka Michinoku and Volador Jr. The following night, Máximo and Tama Tonga defeated Taichi and Michinoku in a tag team match. During the third and final night, Máximo was defeated by Taichi in a singles match. In the fall of 2012 El Bufete began a feud against the Mexican National Trios Champions Los Invasores (Volador Jr., Mr. Águila and Kraneo). The two teams fought several occasions with El  Bufete's CMLL World Trios Chamipnship on the line, while Los Invasores Mexican National Trios Championship being passed over compared to the more prestigious CMLL title. Máximo was forced to team up with Mr. Águila for the 2013 Torneo Nacional de Parejas Increibles (\"National Incredible Pairs Tournament\"), a tag team tournament teaming up wrestlers who would never team up otherwise, often because they are rivals, would be forced to work together. Máximo and Mr. Águila lost to the team of Máscara Dorada and Mephisto even though they were able to put their differences aside for one night. On April 19, Máximo started another tour with New Japan Pro-Wrestling. In May, Máximo, Marco Corleone and Rush were stripped of the CMLL World Trios Championship, when Corleone was sidelined with a knee injury. In January 2014, Máximo returned to Japan to take part in the five-day Fantastica Mania 2014 tour. During the third event of the tour, on January 17, Máximo unsuccessfully challenged Rey Escorpión for the CMLL World Light Heavyweight Championship. On October 3, 2014 Máximo participated in the 2014 La Copa Junior VIP tournament, qualifying for the finals by defeating Puma, Stuka Jr. and then finally La Sombra (by disqualification) to qualify for the finals. On October 10, Maximo defeated Mephisto to win his first ever La Copa Junior.\n\nParagraph 4: In baseball, the dead-ball era was the period from around 1900 to the emergence of Babe Ruth as a power hitter in 1919, when he hit a then–major league record 29 home runs; only three players since 1890 had even hit 20. This era was characterized by low-scoring games and a lack of home runs; league batting averages dropped as low as .239 in 1908, producing the lowest league run average in history, with teams averaging only 3.4 runs per game. Teams played in spacious ballparks that limited hitting for power; as a further hindrance to scoring, the ball used then, compared to modern baseballs, was \"dead\" both by design and from overuse. In addition, ball scuffing and adulteration by pitchers, notably the spitball, was not against the rules during this period.\n\nParagraph 5: The Kuomintang (KMT; Chinese Nationalist Party) has frequently been criticized in Taiwan for its connections to gangsters and black gold. The party has had a long association with underground societies, and its founder Sun Yat-sen had joined the Triads to gain support for the Republican Revolution. In its early years, the KMT relied on support from organized crime, gangs, and unions and clan organizations with criminal ties in its efforts to consolidate power in war-torn post-imperial China.  As a result, the party made concessions to local \"crime bosses\", such as the notorious Du Yuesheng in Shanghai, who were well-connected with its longtime leader, Chiang Kai-shek. During the Shanghai massacre of 1927, the KMT employed the Green Gang to exterminate suspected communists; the Green Gang also happened to be a major financial supporter of Chiang Kai-shek. The KMT's relationships with such organizations are believed to persist. KMT fled to Taiwan following the Chinese Civil War. As Minister of Justice from 1993 to 1996, former Taipei mayor and KMT Party Chairman Ma Ying-jeou is credited with attempts to fight black gold corruption and bring KMT out of corruption, and his removal from office by the KMT was widely attributed to him being too effective at fighting black gold.\n\nParagraph 6: During the early Cold War, Speidel emerged as one of the major military leaders of West Germany, and played a key role in German rearmament, Western international negotiations on defence cooperation and West German integration into NATO. He is thus regarded as one of the founders of the Bundeswehr. He was appointed as the military advisor of Chancellor Konrad Adenauer in 1950 and joined the predecessor of the Federal Ministry of Defence in 1951, was the West German chief delegate to the conference on the Treaty establishing the European Defence Community from 1951 to 1954 and was a lead negotiator when West Germany joined NATO. In 1955 he became a director-general in the Federal Ministry of Defence with the military rank of lieutenant-general in the Bundeswehr, and in 1957 he became the first officer to be promoted to full General in West Germany. He served as COMLANDCENT from 1957 to 1963, with headquarters at the Palace of Fontainebleau in Paris. Speidel was also a historian by training, taught at the University of Tübingen and wrote several books. He received the Grand Cross with Star and Sash of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany in 1963. In 1964 he became President of the German Institute for International and Security Affairs, the German government's main think tank in international relations.\n\nParagraph 7: The story details a world where a heavy meteor shower, known as \"the Fall\", impacted with catastrophic force across much of the Northern Hemisphere in 1878, creating a massive dust cloud that blots out the sun. This in turn causes the collapse of Industrialized civilization, which was unable to survive without the ability to raise crops in winter-like conditions that lasted for three years. In order to survive, the British Government, under the leadership of Queen Victoria and Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli, employed the Royal Navy and all merchant shipping to evacuate the population of the British Isles to its colonies in India, Australasia, and South Africa over the next several years. After martial law breaks down in 1881, the rioting British lower classes storm the remaining military outposts in London; unable to escape, Disraeli is killed by rioters and becomes a martyr. The British Isles are abandoned, initially becoming the home of groups of degenerate cannibalistic savages, most of which quickly consume each other to extinction, and are only cautiously recolonized in the 20th century. By the time relatively normal weather returns, nine-tenths of the former population in the UK, as well as millions of other people around the world, have died as a result of the disaster.\n\nParagraph 8: Rochsire then released Live Sentence (1984), a concert recording with songs from both concerts of the recent tour of Japan at the Nakano Sun Plaza in Tokyo on January 28, 1984.  Being discontent with the sonic qualities of the recording, Malmsteen tried to prevent the release of the album but failed. Some Rainbow covers were included, including \"Since You Been Gone\". The album peaked at No. 133 in the US. A live video concert was also produced. During this period, internal turmoil began surfacing within the band, between Malmsteen and Bonnet. According to Malmsteen, Bonnet had become fed up with the attention drawn to his guitar playing from fans over Bonnet's vocals. According to Malmsteen, their professional relationship ended with the two having an altercation on stage after Bonnet allegedly tampered with Malmsteen's amplifiers during a guitar solo and \"Since You've Been Gone\" at a show in Oklahoma. This resulted in Malmsteen yelling at and arguing with Bonnet, Bonnet poking Malmsteen in the stomach with his microphone stand, and finally with Malmsteen punching Bonnet, all taking place on stage. Following this, Malmsteen left Alcatrazz and created his own band called Rising Force, who signed with Polydor Records and released a successful self-titled debut album.\n\nParagraph 9: Bayer Greater China is Bayer's second largest single market in Asia, accounting for approximately one quarter of regional sales. Its interests in this region have grown steadily over the years, from step-by-step investment in the early 1990s to large-scale, world-class facilities today. Bayer's investment in our integrated production site in the Shanghai Chemical Industry Park makes it evident that Bayer regards Greater China as one of its most important markets worldwide. Bayer's Greater China Group operates in the market encompassing Hong Kong, Taiwan, and China. The Bayer Group in Greater China is led by management holding companies, with the subgroups and production joint ventures operating independently under their strategic direction. The Country Group Speaker, Dr. Elmar Stachels, leads the Group in Greater China. The Greater China Group employs ca. 2,800 people across a wide range of functions. Companies and Locations: Bayer currently operates 18 companies in Greater China. Eight of them now have production facilities on stream in all business segments in which the company is active. Local production accounts for an increasing proportion of sales. Bayer China is engaged in a number of cooperation projects with some of the foremost research institutes and universities in China, to conduct research in the field of innovative materials, health care and crop science. It strongly cooperates with the Chinese Academy of Science and affiliated institutes such as the Institute of Materia Medica and the Kunming Institute of Botany in Yunnan with the aim to identify new compounds in the healthcare and crop science field. There are also a number of projects currently being started in polymers research. In addition, Bayer also supports a number of chairs and programmes for research and teaching at Chinese universities. These include the Tsinghua-Bayer Public Health and HIV/AIDS Media Studies Program, a national platform designed to play a key role in China's public health system. Furthermore, Bayer HealthCare supports a chair for Healthcare Management at the China European International Business School (CEIBS) in Shanghai.\n\nParagraph 10: Of the story chapters, this is one of the shortest. Tank commander Danny Pritchard is introduced. He is presented as being apathetic towards war. On the planet Dunstan Hammer's Slammers are fighting for the government and Danny Pritchard is becoming romantically involved with one of their representatives, a young woman named Sonna. After a short skirmish, Pritchard's section makes camp in a rural area of Dunstan. Sonna invites Pritchard out for a ride to show him something. They take an aircar to a nearby structure made of an opaque, glass-like material. Pritchard is urged to enter the building by Sonna. He is presented with various images of strange and alien creatures, bird-like in appearance; Sonna explains they are an alien race named the Gedel. Shaken, he leaves the ruin and Sonna explains that the Gedel were a race capable of creating many wonders. This ruin is just one of many scattered over Dunstan. Pritchard seems uncaring and uninterested in the nature of the race, especially if the presence of their creations does not directly help his regiment. After decamping, his tank section becomes engaged in a fight on the edge of a city made of irreplaceable Gedel structures. The enemy mercenaries have dug in there intentionally, knowing the Slammers' employers won't allow the Regiment to attack the site. If the Slammers don't attack and defeat their opponents, they will be labeled as quitters. This in turn will adversely impact their ability to land contracts. Despite Sonna's protestations, Colonel Hammer allows the use of the tanks' heavy 20 cm powerguns to flush out and kill the enemy. This has the foreseeable effect of destroying many of the Gedel buildings, but insures the Slammers' reputation as a unit that will do whatever it takes to win.\n\nParagraph 11: The Bobath concept is an approach to neurological rehabilitation that is applied in patient assessment and treatment (such as with adults after stroke or children with cerebral palsy).  The goal of applying the Bobath concept is to promote motor learning for efficient motor control in various environments, thereby improving participation and function.  This is done through specific patient handling skills to guide patients through the initiation and completing of intended tasks. This approach to neurological rehabilitation is multidisciplinary, primarily involving physiotherapists, occupational therapists, and speech and language therapists. In the United States, the Bobath concept is also known as 'neuro-developmental treatment' (NDT).\n\nParagraph 12: Williams accompanied an actor-friend from Los Angeles City College who needed a scene partner for the audition and was also accepted at The Actors Studio West, but rarely attended due to acting commitments. Williams picked up important film roles early in her career: George Cukor's Travels with My Aunt (1972); as Laurie Henderson, Ron Howard's character's high school sweetheart in George Lucas's American Graffiti (1973) for which she earned a BAFTA nomination as Best Supporting Actress; and Francis Ford Coppola's The Conversation (1974). She auditioned along with thousands of others, for Lucas's Star Wars for the role of Princess Leia, but Leia was ultimately played by Carrie Fisher because Lucas wished to cast unknowns, as in American Graffiti.\n\nParagraph 13: Morris stood about 5'8\" with a sturdy, wiry build, and had very strong wrists. He gripped the club with an interlocking grip as clearly seen on his famous photo with his father, in Gallery below. He had a lengthy backswing, and generally swung quite hard on most of his longer shots, but kept some power in reserve. His long shots were usually low to medium in trajectory, and ran out to very good distances, comparable with most of his main rivals; this technique kept the ball in play, minimized trouble, and fought the wind very well. He was among the first players to intentionally shape shots to curve in flight for shot-making strategy. He invented a new use for the rut iron, a club designed to escape ruts from cart tracks on the course, not an unusual situation in the days before courses were extensively groomed. Morris used the rut iron (a lofted club similar to the modern sand wedge) as a pitching club for short approaches, hitting high shots over hazards, which sometimes landed with backspin, another innovation. This was a very difficult shot requiring great skill. Prior to this, the pure running approach, together with the chip-and-run, were the usual methods. He used the niblick (like a modern 9-iron) for similar purposes from farther away; iron play was developed significantly by his examples, which were taken up by rivals. \n\nParagraph 14: Behavioral therapy is beneficial when simpler measures are not effective. Habit Reversal Training (HRT), which seeks to unlearn the habit of nail biting and possibly replace it with a more constructive habit, has shown its effectiveness versus placebo in children and adults. A study in children showed that results with HRT were superior to either no treatment at all or the manipulation of objects as an alternative behavior, which is another possible approach to treatment. In addition to HRT, stimulus control therapy is used to both identify and then eliminate the stimulus that frequently triggers biting urges. Other behavioral techniques that have been investigated with preliminary positive results are self-help techniques, such as decoupling and the use of wristbands as non-removable reminders. More recently, technology companies have begun producing wearable devices and smart watch applications that track the position of users' hands but no research has been published so far.\n\nParagraph 15: Campeggio found himself in a difficult position, since Emperor Charles V, Catherine of Aragon's nephew, was determined to prevent the divorce, and was putting pressure on Clement. The deciding point in law for Campeggio was Julius's dispensation for Henry and Catherine's marriage. In Catherine's possession from early in 1528, she showed it to Campeggio in October, and he took it to invalidate his commission, since the latter failed to cover the document. He tried to make the case disappear on 23 July 1529 by proroguing it until October, but this was forestalled by the Pope sending the matter to Rome a week earlier. On his way back to Rome, Campeggio met Charles and Clement in Bologna, where the pope gave Campeggio the castle of Dozza and the Emperor took Campeggio's family under his patronage. Charles later (2 September 1530) gave Campeggio the Spanish bishopric of Huesca and Jaca, which he held until 17 June 1534 when he became bishop of Candia (Crete) (until 1536); in 1532, moreover, when making Campeggio's son Gianbattista bishop of Majorca, the emperor reserved the administration of the see to the young man's father. Campeggio was legate to the Diet of Augsburg in 1530, where he pursued negotiations with Philip Melanchthon.\n\nParagraph 16: Structurally, carboxysomes are icosahedral, or quasi-icosahedral. Electron cryo-tomography studies have confirmed the approximately icosahedral geometry of the carboxysome, and have imaged protein molecules inside (presumed to be RuBisCO), arranged in a few concentric layers. The non-icosahedral faceted shapes of some carboxysomes can naturally be explained within the elastic theory of heterogeneous thin shells. The carboxysome has an outer shell composed of a few thousand protein subunits, which encapsulates a CO2-producing enzyme (carbonic anhydrase) and a carbon-fixing enzyme (RuBisCO). Proteins known to form the shell have been structurally characterized by X-ray crystallography. The proteins that constitute the majority of the shell form cyclical hexamers or pseudo-hexamers and belong to the BMC protein family. Small pores perforate many different types of BMC-H hexamers, and may serve as the route for diffusion of small substrates (e.g. bicarbonate) and products (3-phosphoglycerate) into and out of the carboxysome. Positively charged amino acids in the pores presumably help promote the diffusion of the negatively charged substrates and products. Other minor structural components of the shell that have been characterized include pentameric proteins (BMC-P proteins) which occupy the vertices of the icosahedral shell. A third building block of the carboxysome shell is a protein composed of two BMC domains in tandem (BMC-T proteins). Structurally, these are known to form trimers which are pseudohexameric. Some members of the BMC-T protein family stack in a face-to-face fashion and form tiny cages, notably both types of carboxysomes (alpha and beta, see below) contain these stacking trimers. Based on crystal structures, these protein cages have relatively large gated pores on both sides, and it has been proposed that the opening and closing of the pore could be controlled in a manner similar to an air-lock. Such an air-lock, in contrast to BMC-H proteins with constitutively open pores, has been suggested to serve as a route for larger substrates (ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate) and products (3-phosphoglycerate) that must cross the shell.\n\nParagraph 17: In the impartial version of Hackenbush (the one without player specified colors), it can be thought of using nim heaps by breaking the game up into several cases: vertical, convergent, and divergent. Played exclusively with vertical stacks of line segments, also referred to as bamboo stalks, the game directly becomes Nim and can be directly analyzed as such. Divergent segments, or trees, add an additional wrinkle to the game and require use of the colon principle stating that when branches come together at a vertex, one may replace the branches by a non-branching stalk of length equal to their nim sum. This principle changes the representation of the game to the more basic version of the bamboo stalks. The last possible set of graphs that can be made are convergent ones, also known as arbitrarily rooted graphs. By using the fusion principle, we can state that all vertices on any cycle may be fused together without changing the value of the graph. Therefore, any convergent graph can also be interpreted as a simple bamboo stalk graph. By combining all three types of graphs we can add complexity to the game, without ever changing the nim sum of the game, thereby allowing the game to take the strategies of Nim.\n\nParagraph 18: Ben Penderwick - He's an energetic and sarcastic red-haired boy, the only male kid in the family. Iantha's son and the Penderwicks step-brother. He is obsessed with making movies and forcing his younger sister Lydia to play in them. He was just one-year-old in The Penderwicks on Gardam  Street and The Penderwicks at Point Mouette, Seven in The Penderwicks in Spring, and 16 in The Penderwicks at Last. He has a best friend names Rafael that he loves playing action figures with and making alien movies. In his movies, he always makes Lydia die. Ben looks up to Nick Geiger, thinking he's the coolest for being in the military and learning the military alphabet and learning all about the military with his best friend Rafael. He's absolutely disgusted by the idea of ever having a girlfriend and refuses to listen to anyone who says he should date Remy, Tess, or Nora. He makes friends with people and becomes close with them easily, he's one of the most social Penderwicks. Though he hasn't known Jeffery as long as his older sisters, they're still pretty close. Ben jokes, saying, he'd marry Jeffery for his money. He wishes he had brothers instead of five sisters sometimes, saying he wished Tommy and Nick were his brothers. When Batty thinks she killed her mom and Hound and is experiencing serious problems, Ben's super worried and tells his best friend Rafael, who comes up with a ton of unlikely stories, like that she was bitten by a tsetse fly and has sleeping sickness or that she was abducted by aliens. Batty then tells Ben she tried to run away to Boston to see Jeffery and tells him to keep it a secret on the Penderwick family honor. Mr. Penderwick guesses after interviewing Ben, who was trying his hardest to not say anything. Once his dad found out, Ben started to sob, saying he hates secrets. In the fifth book, he helps Alice and Lydia make a movie to make Jack, Alice's brother, jealous. He chooses an alien movie and Alice gets really invested, thinking Ben's really cool. Ben's a complete child at heart, not taking anything except maybe movie making and keeping secrets too seriously. He loves making sarcastic comebacks and fun jokes. Him and his best friend Rafael plan on moving to Hollywood and becoming famous movie directors together, and they still have that dream to this day. Ben and Rafael are the only friendship still confirmed in the last book, not confirming Keiko and Batty, Rosalind and Anna, and Jane and Artie and Molly. \n\nParagraph 19: Fukuyama posits that two fundamental principles of neoconservatism may collide in the area of political and economic development: on the one hand, neoconservatives are concerned about the internal character of a regime, thus democracy-promotion and human rights are important considerations in foreign policy (unlike for political realists); on the other hand, there is a danger in large-scale social engineering which could have unintended consequences as a result. On the domestic front, neocons like James Q. Wilson had warned about extensive social programs and the Bush Administration should have put this principle into practice in foreign policy as well, Fukuyama asserts. Fukuyama cites an interview by Dick Cheney in which the Vice President said: \"to suggest we need several 100.000 troops there, after the conflict ends, I don't think it's accurate... I really do believe we will be greeted as liberators.\" President George W. Bush remarked at a speech that democratic desires are a human universal, but Fukuyama contrasts this to his own thesis of \"The End of History\" and caution: \"One can argue that there is a universal human desire to be free of tyranny and a universalism to the appeal of life in a prosperous liberal democracy. The problem is one of time frame involved. It is one thing to say that there is a broad, centuries-long trend towards the spread of liberal democracy - something that I myself have strongly argued in the past- and another to say that either democracy or prosperity can emerge in a given society at a given time. There are certain critical intervening variables known as institutions (...). And if there is one thing that the study of democratic transition and political development teaches, is that institutions are very difficult to establish.\" Neoconservatives ignored by and large development and put too much emphasis on defense.\n\nParagraph 20: During the Qing Dynasty (1644–1912), Hulunbuir was part of Heilongjiang province. The 1858 Treaty of Aigun established today's approximate Sino-Russian border, at a great loss to Heilongjiang's territory. In 1901, the Chinese Eastern Railway linked Hulunbuir to the rest of northeast China and to Russian Far East. From 1912 to 1949, during the Republic of China (ROC) period, Hulunbuir was part of Xing'an and Heilongjiang provinces. In winter 1912, the Barga Mongol people of Hulunbuir expelled the Chinese troops and administration and proclaimed the independence of Barga (Hulunbuir); afterwards they declared allegiance to the Bogdo Khan of Mongolia; an agreement between the Russian Empire and the ROC on November 6/October 24, 1915 designated Hulunbuir a \"special\" region under direct subordination to the Central Government of China, but in practice Russia had partial control over day-to-day administration and economy. In 1929, the Soviet Union broke this agreement and invaded Hulunbuir. After the Japanese invasion of China, Hulunbuir became part of the Japanese puppet state Manchukuo, which was not recognized by the Chinese. In the Chinese Civil War, the Communist Party of China gained the support of Inner Mongol leaders like Ulanhu by promising the irredentist expansion of Inner Mongolia into areas that had majorities of Han and Manchu peoples.\n\nParagraph 21: The list of targets included Major Ridge, John Ridge, Elias Boudinot, Stand Watie, John A. Bell, James Starr, George Adair, and others. (Notably absent from the list were Treaty Party leaders David Vann, Charles Vann, John Gunter, Charles Foreman, William Hicks, and Andrew Ross.  William Hicks died sometime before or in the year 1837.  His death was before removal took place.) On 22 June 1839, teams ranging up to twenty-five in number converged on the houses of John Ridge, Major Ridge, and Elias Boudinot, and murdered them; their attempt on Stand Watie was unsuccessful. They did not attack any others, but the assassinations marked the beginning of the Cherokee Civil War; it continued until after the American Civil War. James Starr was also killed during this period. The Ross partisans forced the Old Settlers to give up their established political system and accept the majority vote and John Ross's authority. Ridge Party families fled Oklahoma and found refuge in what was then Nacogdoches County, Texas (in the area that later became known as the Mount Tabor Indian Community), near present-day Kilgore. Many of their descendants still live in the area along with the Thompson-McCoy Choctaws. Rebecca Nagle, host of the award-winning This Land podcast, is a descendant of the Ridges and uses her ancestry to explore the ongoing toll their actions had.\n\nParagraph 22: The Soviet Union saw diaspora peoples as allegedly disloyal leading to numerous deportations, including the Soviet deportation of Koreans and Soviet deportations of Chinese. Nonetheless, Soviet secret police employed many diaspora peoples in espionage operations, with major examples including the German-Soviet spy Rudolf Abel (originally William Fisher) and the Ingrian Finnish-Soviet spy Reino Häyhänen. Moreover, this was not the first Maki Mirage-like operation (using Soviet natsmen) for William Fisher. Sometime shortly after Aug. 1939 Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, Fisher (a Baltic German) and Adamovich (a Soviet Pole) were sent to Ukraine to meet ethnic Germans, Poles and Ukrainians to stir up anti-Nazi sentiment in the nearby areas and countries. They proclaimed to be refugees from communism during the invasion of Poland, using a provision that Nazi Germany and the USSR had agreed upon for the migration of Soviet Germans. Jerzy Niezbrzycki (who worked in Polish intelligence as Niezbrzyski, while using the pseudonym Ryszard Wraga when working for U.S. academia) mentioned the capture of a Soviet Pole working under the administration of the INO, NKVD. This man was from Ukraine and spoke Polish with a slight accent (assumed Ukrainian or Russian). He was captured in Poland, agreed to work as a double agent, but then reneged and agreed to a jail term in Poland rather than a return to Russia. The Soviet Pole (Niezbrzski's) and Häyhänen went to great lengths to build their \"legends,\" that is, backstory as locals. The Pole spent lavishly on his girlfriend taking trips to Warsaw with fine dining, cabarets and other assorted nightlife that were part of courtship and \"good living.\" The intent was to marry a local in order to obtain citizenship, the right residency and work permits and have a layer of protection from suspicion. Häyhänen padded his \"legend\" by going to extreme lengths, even though he had one significant advantage over the Pole as Soviet agents. Reino spoke Finnish as a native speaker. First, Reino along with a Soviet agent (from Lapland) headed north to the Arctic Circle. There, they found Sámi who were willing to corroborate (for a fee) his residence and work in Lapland from 1943 to 1949. Heading south to Tampere, he then courted and married a local Finnish girl, Hanna Kurikka. Anna Chapman would utilize many of the same tactics while eclipsing all of her predecessors, the previous Russian Federation and Soviet illegals in regards to her ability to charm, deceive and induce credulity in her hosts. Her male friends in America stated that they believed that she was an American despite obvious telltale giveaways such as her foreign accent and Russian mannerisms.\n\nParagraph 23:  Toss-up: These are multiple choice questions that can be answered by any of the 4 active players on either team in play. Teams have 5 seconds to buzz in and answer the question. If the first team's answer is incorrect, the opposing team will get another 5 seconds to answer. The team that buzzes in first gets to answer the question. A correct answer wins the team 4 points and the right to attempt a bonus question. No conferring is allowed on toss-ups. If a player buzzes in before a moderator finishes reading the question, the buzz is called an interrupt. An incorrect answer will cause the team to lose 4 points and the question to be re-read to the opposing team. This is the only situation in which a team can lose points. However, no points are lost for incorrect answers that are not interrupts. If a player begins an answer before being verbally recognized by the moderator, this is called a blurt. The answer is ignored (not indicated correct or incorrect by the moderator) and the question is re-read to the opposing team. There is no point penalty for a blurt, but the team that blurted is disqualified from answering that question.", "answers": ["Paragraph 19"], "length": 6093, "dataset": "passage_retrieval_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "de23e2b1d2dd91ee82fbc68d8a5a15aca03f8c6afccc5c91"}
{"input": "The text discusses the diplomatic relations between Venice and the Safavid Empire during the 17th century. The Safavid court sent Ali Bali as the last Muslim ambassador to Venice in 1634. Venice, seeking allies against the Ottomans during the Cretan War, sent Giovanni Tiepolo to Poland with a Polish envoy in 1645. In 1646, Domenico de Santis was sent to the Safavid palace, followed by Ferdinando Gioverida going to Venice in 1647. The embassies from both sides resulted in declarations of friendship, but no specific alliance was made. Further negotiations were conducted by missionaries and Catholic clergy. In 1661, Venice appealed to the Safavid Empire to join the war against the Ottomans, and similar requests were made in subsequent years through different messengers. However, the Safavid emperor's efforts to attack the Ottomans were unsuccessful, and the last Safavid diplomatic mission to Venice was in 1673. In later years, additional letters were sent to the Safavids during the War of the Holy League, expressing Venice's favorable attitude towards the king.", "context": "Paragraph 1: Steward was born in Woodsfield, Ohio, and began attending Ohio State University in Columbus in 1927. He taught English at OSU from 1932 until 1934 as a university fellow. His first year-long post was as an instructor of English in 1934 at Carroll College in Helena, Montana. In 1936 he was summarily dismissed from his second teaching position, at the State College of Washington (now Washington State University) at Pullman, as the result of his sympathetic portrayal of a prostitute in his well-reviewed comic novel Angels on the Bough. He subsequently moved to Chicago, where he taught at Loyola University until 1946. After leaving Loyola to help re-write the World Book Encyclopedia, he subsequently taught at DePaul University.\n\nParagraph 2: In 1634, a messenger named Ali Bali was sent to Venice to inform Venice that Safi I ascended the Safavid throne. This envoy was the last Muslim ambassador of the Safavid court to Venice. With the outbreak of the Cretan War in 1645, which would last until 1669, Venice started “diplomatic offensive” to find allies against the Ottomans. Giovanni Tiepolo was sent to the King of Poland on a mission from the republic. On his return the following year, Giovanni arrived in Venice with a Polish envoy who had been commissioned to deliver a letter from his king to the Safavid king. The Polish envoy Jerzy Ilicz was sent to the Safavid palace together with the Dominican priest Antonio da Fiandra. In 1646, the Venetian government sent another emissary named Domenico de Santis to the king. This messenger reached the Safavid palace by crossing the road to Aleppo. In response, Ferdinando Gioverida (a Catholic priest and relative of Petra della Valle's first wife) left for Venice in 1647. Father Antonio was able to convey himself to the Collegium in the Palazzo Ducale on March 28, 1650. De Santis probably reached Venice in 1651. During the return trip, de Santis, who was going from Isfahan to Tarku, was not given permission to enter the territory of the Russian Empire, so his return took longer. Gioverida reached the Collegium exactly one year before Antonio – on March 28, 1650. The 3 embassies had brought nothing but sincere declarations of friendship from the Shah. The Safavid side did not make any clear statement about the specific alliance. As a result, further negotiations between Venice and the Safavid Empire were carried out by missionaries and Catholic clergy. In 1661, a letter addressed to the king was sent by an anonymous person, in 1662, Arakel was used, and in 1663, the Dominican priest Antonio Tani was used. In the letter of 1661, Venice's appeal to the Safavid Empire to join the war against the Ottoman Empire was repeated. In 1663, the senators did not find it appropriate to make such a request in writing and asked Arakel to convey it to the shah orally. In 1669, Archbishop Mateos Avanik was sent to the Safavid Empire, and in 1673, one of the Armenian Dominican priests arrived in Venice with a letter from the king and Mateos. The latter stated that despite his pleas to the Safavid emperor Suleiman I to attack the Ottomans, he eventually received word that Crete had been captured by the Ottomans, and his efforts were not successful. Two Dominicans were given a reply letter to the king. According to Berchet, this was the last Safavid diplomatic mission to Venice. In later years, especially during the War of the Holy League, additional letters were sent to the Safavids, delivered by an unknown envoy in 1695 and two papal envoys, Pietro Paolo Pignatelli in 1697 and Felice Maria da Sellano in 1699. Only the first of these letters called the king to war, the other two simply confirmed Venice's favorable attitude towards him.\n\nParagraph 3: Hunter-Reay began to compete in the Toyota Atlantic Championship, at the time the main development series for the FedEx CART Championship Series, in 2002. Hunter-Reay would drive the #1 Medlock Ames Winery/U.S. Print Swift 014.a-Toyota 4A-GE for Hylton Motorsports. Hunter-Reay would make his debut at Fundidora Park. Hunter-Reay would start in 6th place and retire to finish in 23rd place. At the second race of the season, on the Streets of Long Beach Hunter-Reay started in 2nd place and finished in 18th place after having the fastest lap of the race. At the third race of the season, at the Milwaukee Mile, Hunter-Reay qualified on the pole position, had the fastest lap of the race and led the most laps of the race. Hunter-Reay would retire from the race to finish in 19th place. At the fourth race of the season, at Laguna Seca Raceway, Hunter-Reay qualified on the pole position, had the fastest lap of the race and led the most laps to get his first win in the series. Hunter-Reay would then finish in 4th place at the following race of the season, at Portland International Raceway. At the sixth race of the season, at Chicago Motor Speedway, Hunter-Reay started in 6th place and led the most laps and had the fastest lap of the race to win his second race of the season. At the seventh race of the season, at Exhibition Place, Hunter-Reay started in 7th place and finished in 4th place. Hunter-Reay would then get his third, and final, win of both the season and his Atlantics career at the eighth race of the season, at Burke Lakefront Airport, after leading the most laps. Hunter-Reay would then start 15th and finish 7th at the following race, at Circuit Trois-Rivières. At the tenth race of the season, at Road America, Hunter-Reay started 8th and retired from the race to finish in 24th place. Hunter-Reay then started 6th and finished 22nd at the following race, at Circuit Gilles Villeneuve. At the following race of the season, the season-ending race at the Pepsi Center, Hunter-Reay retired from the race and finished in an unknown position. Hunter-Reay finished out the season ranked in 6th place in the final point standings with 102 points.\n\nParagraph 4: Fasti Diurni, divided into  and , were a kind of official year-book, with dates and directions for religious ceremonies, court-days, market-days, divisions of the month, and the like. Until 304 BC the lore of the calendaria remained the exclusive and lucrative monopoly of the priesthood; but in that year Gnaeus Flavius, a pontifical secretary, introduced the custom of publishing in the forum tables containing the requisite information, besides brief references to victories, triumphs, prodigies, etc. This list was the origin of the public Roman calendar, in which the days were divided into weeks of eight days each, and indicated by the letters A–H. Each day was marked by a certain letter to show its nature; thus the letters F., N., N.P., F.P., Q. Rex C.F., C., EN., stood for , ,  in some unexplained sense, , ,  and . The  were partly fasti and partly nefasti. Ovid's Fasti is a poetical description of the Roman festivals of the first six months, written to illustrate the Fasti published by Julius Caesar after he remodelled the Roman year. Upon the cultivators fewer feasts, sacrifices, ceremonies and holidays were enjoined than on the inhabitants of cities; and the rustic fasti contained little more than the ceremonies of the calends,  and , the fairs, signs of zodiac, increase and decrease of the days, the tutelary gods of each month, and certain directions for rustic labours to be performed each month.\n\nParagraph 5: In October 1966, Gary Duncan, a 19-year-old African-American, was driving down a Louisiana highway when he noticed his nephew Bert Grant and cousin Bernard St. Ann with a group of four white teenagers, including Herman Landry, on the side of the road. He became concerned because his cousins had reported occurrences of \"racial incidents\" at the recently desegregated school. He pulled over the car, stepped out, and asked his cousins to get in the car. Landry insulted Duncan, calling him a racial slur. According to historian Matthew Van Meter, Duncan told Landry to go home, \"reaching out to the boy's arm in a gesture that was both conciliatory and final.\" The white youths testified that Duncan slapped Landry at this point, but Duncan and his relatives denied it. Duncan was arrested and ultimately charged with simple battery. As it was punishable by no more than two years, simple battery is a misdemeanor under Louisiana law and so he was not subject to trial by jury. Duncan was convicted and received a 60-day prison sentence and a fine of $150. He appealed on the grounds that the state had violated the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments guaranteeing his right to a jury trial. The Court accepted the case, under its appellate jurisdiction from the Louisiana State Supreme Court.\n\nParagraph 6: Over these decades from the 1940s to the 1990s, the town itself changed significantly as well: road travel had begun to replace railway travel as the Canadian Pacific Railway phased out passenger transportation, and the centre of activity in the community shifted south, with the original area of settlement suffering a long-term decline. From two stopping trains in each direction in 1943 (with one western route turning south at McKerrow to serve Espanola and Manitoulin and the other continuing further west to Sault Ste. Marie), passenger service was reduced to a single train per direction per day by 1970, and Greyhound bus service grew in popularity during the 1950s. Early town plans in 1897 had called for a Hammond Road to run along the path of the CPR tote road and cross the Spanish at a similar location to the CPR's rail bridge. This was finally realized with the construction of the new Ontario Highway 17 around 1947, the culmination of about a decade of road construction and public works projects in the area. The new highway was routed south of the town's main commercial area, and facilitated a slow drift of the centre of the town away from the original core formed around the CPR station and Hall's general store. Some businesses relocated to new highway-adjacent locations, while others closed one by one, and there was a gradual shift away from hotels, taverns, and small retail, toward garages and gas stations, as truck freight became more frequent along the new highway, and larger centres like Espanola and Sudbury became more accessible for residents. The possibilities of car commuting depressed demand for temporary accommodation and therefore decreased the customer base for the town's hotels and boarding houses, as workers could now commute from larger urban centres, and seasonal industries, which heavily utilized temporary accommodations, declined. However, a new residential subdivision was built south of the highway in the 1960s as the town experienced a population boom due to an increase in the workforce at the lumber mill. Passenger rail service ended altogether in 1976, and the Nairn railway station was demolished sometime after.\n\nParagraph 7: In 1918, Max Rothman (John Cusack), a Munich art dealer, is a World War I veteran who lost his right arm in the Third Battle of Ypres, effectively ending his career as a painter. He returns to Germany and opens a modern art gallery. He is married to Nina (Molly Parker), but also has a mistress, Liselore von Peltz (Leelee Sobieski). Through a chance encounter, Rothman is approached by a young Adolf Hitler (Noah Taylor), a war veteran as well, disgruntled over Germany's loss during the conflict and the country's humiliation by the signing of the Versailles Treaty. Hitler is also an aspiring painter, and wishes to have his artwork displayed.\n\nParagraph 8: Balagopal (Suresh Gopi) is an alumnus and professor in a college. He is engaged to Anjali (Samyuktha Varma). Anjali is an heir to one of the royal families who owns a huge estate and bungalow in Ooty. Her father's brother tries to extort her. To help Anjali, Balagopal goes to Ooty. On the way, he meets a girl Rosy (Rajashree), who asks for a lift. On the way they get to know each other and become good friends after dropping her, when Balagopal sees a sweater left by Rosy. He goes back to give it in the home where he left her. There he realises that she was long dead. On coming back to the bungalow, he meets Rosy's ghost who was waiting for him there, she tell him her past, Rosy is a student in the same college as Balagopal, she has a huge crush on him, but never expresses it openly to him or meets him in person. She decides to express her desire to him after getting permission from her parents, but on the way she has an accident and dies. Balagopal sympathises with Rosy and treats her as a friend, Rosy even helps Balagopal when goons sent by Anjali's uncle attack him. It all changes when she realises that Balagopal is in love with Anjali, she becomes possessive of him. When Anjali and her family come to Ooty to stay with Balagopal, Rosy attempts multiple times to threaten her and  kill her. To find a solution, she approaches a priest in the church, he guides them to Father Rosario, who hails from the family of fabled exorcists. Father Rosario arrives and prevents many attacks of Rosy. He tries to talk to rosy in a prayer session, in that he realises that Rosy has denounced God and her powers are becoming evil. When he discusses it with another priest, Fr. Rosario learns that Rosy has not been baptised due to her father who was an atheist, it  was reason for Rosy's spirit to denounce God. When Rosy's father learns of his daughter's fate he accepts to undergo baptism for her benefit. Fr. Rosario plans to agitate Rosy bring out the evil in her so that when her body is baptised it dies. Fr. Rosario plans to conduct the marriage of both Anjali and Balagopal, during which Rosy attacks in full fury becoming a total evil spirit, so when baptised she retains her original calm form.\n\nParagraph 9: The caustic observations in her books and public stances on issues caused a stir and earned her some powerful enemies. She was derided as an eccentric scold, a virago, and (in the words of one newspaper editor) \"a literary wild-cat from the backwoods\". In 1829, Anne Royall returned to Washington, D.C. and began living on Capitol Hill, near a fire house. The firehouse, which had been built with federal money, had been allowing a small Presbyterian congregation to use its facilities for their services. Royall, who had long made Presbyterians a particular object of scorn in her writing, objected to their using the building as a blurring of the lines between church and state. She also claimed that some of the congregation's children began throwing stones at her windows. One member of the congregation began praying silently beneath her window and others visited her in an attempt to convert her, she claimed. Royall responded to their taunts with cursing and was arrested. She was tried and convicted of being a \"public nuisance, a common brawler and a common scold\". Although a ducking stool had been constructed nearby, the court ruled that the traditional common law punishment of ducking for a scold was obsolete, and she was instead fined $10. Two reporters from Washington's newspaper, The National Intelligencer, paid the fine. Embarrassed by the incident, Royall left Washington to continue traveling.\n\nParagraph 10: Caan • Caan van Neck  • De la Bassecour Caan  • Caarten • Van Calcar • Van Calker • Sharpe van Calker • Van Kalker • Calkoen • van Beeck Calkoen • Callenbach • Callenfels • Van der Beke Callenfels • Van Stein Callenfels • Von Stein Callenfels • Carnbier • Camp (Geertruidenberg) • Camp ('s-Hertogenbosch) • Van Campen •  Del Campo genaamd Camp • Van Lookeren Campagne • Cankrien • Cannegieter • Hoornsma Cannegieter • Reen Cannegieter • Schrader Cannegieter • Canneman • Cantzlaar • Capadose • Van Capelle • Carbasius • Cardinaal • Carp • De Carpentier • Carsten • Star Nauta Carsten • Van Casteel • Castendijk • Ten Cate • Naudin ten Cate • Cats • Lichtenvoort Cats • Manger Cats • Van Cattenburch • Casteren van Cattenburch • Van Panhuys van Cattenburch  • Cau • Cazaux • Cazius • Certon • Rigail Certon • Chabot • Taudin Chabot • Van Charante • Boss van Charante • Mensing van Charante • Moll van Charante • Watson van Charante • Charbon • De Chaufepie • de Dompierre de Chaufepie • Clant • Clant van der Mijll • Clant Schatter • Van Rijneveld Clant • Clarion • Clavareau • Clement • Van der Poest Clement • De Clercq (N.-Brabant) • Van der Lek de Clercq • De Clercq (Vlaanderen) • Cleveringa • Cleyndert • Cleijndert • De Jong Cleijndert • Clifford • Oetgens van Waveren Pancras Clifford • Pancras Clifford • Du Cloux • Alting du Cloux • Lincklaan du Cloux • Cluysenaer • Cnopius • Coenen • Cohen • Cohen Stuart • Coldeweij • Colenbrander • Van Berck Colenbrander • Van Hecking Colenbrander • Collard • Colthoff • Rom Colthoff • De Coningh • Van Assendelft de Coningh • Van Vrijberghe de Coningh • Conrad • Cool (Appingedam) • Cool (Overschie) • Coops • Coops Busgers • Van de Coppello • Kappeyne van de Coppello • Cordelois • Cordes • Corstius • Brandt Corstius • Corten • Coster • Costerman • Costerus • Couperus • Del Court • Couvee • Sauerbier Couvee • Cox • Craandijk • Van der Crab • Cramer (Ootmarsum) • Cramer (Rijnland) • Cramer (Westfalen) • Putman Cramer • Cramer von Baumgarten • Cramerus • De Crane • Van Cranenburgh • Cremer • Cremers • Canter Cremers • Hooftman Canter Cremers • Pathuis Cremers • Creutzberg • Creyghton • Criellaert • Croiset • Crol • Crommelin • Van Wickevoort Crommelin • Croockewit • Crull • Hofstede Crull • Cruys • Cunaeus • Gael Cunaeus\n\nParagraph 11: The Nathaniel B. Palmer is an icebreaking research vessel (RVIB) owned by Offshore Service Vessels LLC, operated by Edison Chouest Offshore, Inc. and chartered by the United States National Science Foundation. The Nathaniel B. Palmer is tasked with extended scientific missions in the Antarctic. The Nathaniel B. Palmer was purpose-built for and delivered to the NSF by Edison Chouest Offshore's North American Shipbuilding facility in 1992. The Nathaniel B. Palmer is able to support up to two helicopters, accommodates up to 45 science and technical personnel, has a crew of 22 and is capable of missions lasting up to 65 days. The vessel is named after merchant mariner and ship builder Nathaniel Brown Palmer, credited by some historians as the first American to see Antarctica.\n\nParagraph 12: The fjord runs through many municipalities: Solund, Gulen, Hyllestad, Høyanger, Vik, Sogndal, Lærdal, Aurland, Årdal, and Luster. The fjord reaches a maximum depth of  below sea level, and the greatest depths are found in the central parts of the fjord near Høyanger. Sognefjord is more than  deep for about  of its length, from Rutledal to Hermansverk. Near its mouth, the bottom rises abruptly to a sill about  below sea level. The seabed in Sognefjord is covered by some  sediments such that the bedrock is some  below sea level. The fjord is up to  wide. The average width of the main branch of the Sognefjord is less than . The depth increases gradually from Årdal to a central basin reaching more than  in depth located between Leikanger and Brekke. From Brekke the floor rises rapidly to Losna island, then drops gradually with a threshold at about  in the Solund area. Thresholds occur in an area with sounds, valleys, and low land where the glacier was allowed spread out and lose its erosive effect.\n\nParagraph 13: The GAZ-M20 Pobeda was one of the first Soviet cars of original design and moreover at the front line of a new vogue in automobile design; only the front suspension and, partially, the unitized body were influenced by the 1938 Opel Kapitän (the choice of car may have been influenced by the acquisition of the tooling from Opel's Rüsselsheim factory as part of the war reparations package for the Soviet side, which also lead to the creation of the Moskvitch 400/420). It was one of the first cars to introduce ponton styling with slab sides, preceding many Western manufacturers. The M20 was the first Soviet car using entirely domestic body dies; it was designed against wooden bucks, which suffered warping, requiring last-minute tuning by GAZ factory employees. The first prototype was ready on November 6, 1944 (for an anniversary of the October Revolution). A number of parts such as the gearbox and the transmission for the Pobeda (especially the early models) were carried over from the Ford Model B-based GAZ-M1 and modernized GAZ 11-73. The first production model rolled off the assembly line on June 21, 1946. It was also the first Soviet automobile to have turn signals, two electric windshield wipers (rather than mechanical- or vacuum-operated ones), four-wheel hydraulic brakes, an electric heater, and a factory-installed AM radio. The car came to be a symbol of postwar Soviet life and is today a popular collector's item.\n\nParagraph 14: In winter, the location of the North Pacific Current bifurcation is approximately 45°N, which is 5° south of where it bifurcates in the summer at  approximately 50°N. This has implications as to what water is moved into the Alaskan subpolar gyre. In winter, when the splitting of the current is more south, fresh, warmer waters from river input from the Columbia (47°N) and Fraser (49°N) rivers are transported north. This shift in the North Pacific current location leads to winter currents transporting relatively warmer water poleward from a lower latitude than in the summer. Although the northern branch of the subtropical gyre shifts south in the winter, the subpolar gyre does not shift location, but intensifies in its circulation. This intensification brings a greater volume of water from the south into the subpolar gyre, which again is dependent on the magnitude of atmospheric circulation. For example: the Aleutian Low is a persistent low pressure system over the Gulf of Alaska that can fluctuate on decadal timescales, producing the PDO. If this system is relatively strong during winter, there will be an increase in northward transport of waters along the Alaskan current from southerly winds. Haida eddies have been documented to form predominantly in the winter when bifurcation is south, and favorable atmospheric conditions are met to intensify the subpolar gyre. With these conditions, Haida eddy formation has also been documented to occur from baroclinic instabilities from alongshore wind reversals, equatorial Kelvin waves, and bottom topography. Baroclinic instabilities form when tilting or sloping of isopycnals (horizontal lines of constant density) form. Baroclinic instabilities from alongshore wind reversals occur when a persistent wind along the coast changes direction. For example: in the Gulf of Alaska average winds travel from the south, poleward (termed southerly winds), but during a wind reversal the winds will abruptly shift to a northwesterly wind (coming from the northwest), and the coastal current that was being pushed north will now be pushed south. This change in direction causes rotation in an originally northward flowing current, which results in tilting isopyncals. Kelvin waves that form along the equator are able to travel along the west coast of North America to the Gulf of Alaska, where their presence can cause disruptions in the poleward current and form baroclinic instabilities. Bottom topography, the third formation process of Haida eddies, can occur because the Alaska current will interact with hills or rock formations below the surface, and this can cause baroclinic instabilities.\n\nParagraph 15: The Fox Broadcasting Company's foundations were laid in March 1985 through News Corporation's $255 million purchase of a 50% interest in TCF Holdings, the parent company of the 20th Century Fox film studio. In May 1985, News Corporation, a media company owned by Australian publishing magnate Rupert Murdoch that had mainly served as a newspaper publisher at the time of the TCF Holdings deal, agreed to pay $2.55 billion to acquire independent television stations in six major U.S. cities from the John Kluge-run broadcasting company Metromedia: WNEW (now WNYW) in New York City, WTTG in Washington, D.C., KTTV in Los Angeles, KRIV in Houston, WFLD in Chicago, and KRLD-TV (now KDAF) in Dallas. A seventh station, ABC affiliate WCVB-TV in Boston, was part of the original transaction but was spun off to the Hearst Broadcasting subsidiary of the Hearst Corporation in a separate, concurrent deal as part of a right of first refusal related to that station's 1982 sale to Metromedia.\n\nParagraph 16: In 2003 Willard became an official member of The Offspring, replacing long-time drummer Ron Welty who had left the group earlier that year. During Willard's tenure with the group he performed on numerous tours but did not perform on any officially released studio recordings. Professional drummer Josh Freese had recorded the drum tracks for the band's 2003 album Splinter after Welty left the group. Willard joined shortly before the album's release and appeared with them in the music video for the single \"(Can't Get My) Head Around You\". However, in 2005 he became a founding member of Angels & Airwaves (see below), and his commitments to the new group began to draw him away from The Offspring. The Offspring released a Greatest Hits compilation in 2005 including two new songs, \"Can't Repeat\" and a cover of The Police's \"Next to You\"., though Willard appeared with the band in the \"Can't Repeat\" music video. In July 2007 he officially left The Offspring to focus on Angels & Airwaves. Freese again recorded drum tracks for The Offspring for Rise and Fall, Rage and Grace (2008) before he was permanently replaced by former Face to Face drummer Pete Parada. Offspring singer Dexter Holland later commented:", "answers": ["Paragraph 2"], "length": 4486, "dataset": "passage_retrieval_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "d932037fab091439091ecc68806cef10ee85edb5caf384ee"}
{"input": "The College of Europe is a prestigious post-graduate institute that offers European studies. It has campuses in Bruges, Belgium and Warsaw, Poland. Founded in 1949 by influential European figures such as Salvador de Madariaga and Winston Churchill, the college aims to foster solidarity and understanding among Western European nations. It provides specialized training to individuals who will uphold these values and contribute to Europe's development. The college is closely connected to the establishment of the European Union and is a member of the European Movement International. Notably, Federica Mogherini and Herman, Count Van Rompuy have held leadership positions at the college.", "context": "Paragraph 1: In June 1904, four years after Tuck had begun learning Japanese on his own initiative and two years after the Anglo-Japanese Alliance had come into force, the Admiralty made special arrangements for the study of Japanese by naval officers, allowing up to a year's residence in Japan. In August Vice-Admiral Sir Gerard Noel, Commander-in-Chief of the China Station, wrote to Sir Claude Maxwell MacDonald, the first British ambassador to Japan, seeking the services of a ‘suitable and reliable Instructor in the Japanese language for service with the British China Squadron’, possibly a ‘suitable retired Japanese Naval Officer, who has perhaps been wounded in the war and would be glad of a little financial assistance’. In February 1905, Macdonald replied to Noel to say that Baron Komura Jutarō, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, had been unable to find a suitable person. By this time Tuck was living in Japan and studying the language full-time, although he was finding the expenses involved much greater than he had expected. Later in 1905 Sir Claude  MacDonald instructed John Harington Gubbins, who had been Japanese Secretary in the British Legation for many years and had a good command of Japanese, to examine Tuck on his knowledge of Japanese. Gubbins reported in September that Tuck had gained full marks in colloquial and more than 75% for each of the two written papers, and that he had a good knowledge of Chinese characters. ‘A little further study of newspapers, and a course of instruction in what is known as official dispatch style, would, I think, enable Mr. Tuck to attain the standard required for interpreters in the Japan Consular Service', he concluded. In December Tuck received a certificate stating that he had passed the examination for Interpreter in Japanese and a few days later received appointment as Interpreter in Japanese on HMS King Alfred. In February 1906 Vice-Admiral Noel wrote to Tuck and forwarded to him extracts from an Admiralty letter dated 25 October 1905, which stated that ‘it would be a convenience if the services of Mr. Oswald Tuck could be utilized in connection with the instruction in the Japanese language of Naval Officers on the China Station, having regard to his special qualifications for such work’. And in 1907 the Admiralty wrote to express their appreciation for Tuck's translation of a diary by a Russian officer serving  on the Russian battleship Oryol. It was clear that Tuck's command of Japanese was now appreciated by the Admiralty.\n\nParagraph 2: Lesbian Connection (LC) is an American grassroots network forum publication \"for, by and about lesbians\". Founded in 1974 by the lesbian-feminist collective Ambitious Amazons, the magazine is run by the Elsie Publishing Institute, a Michigan-based 501(c)(3) nonprofit corporation. In 2016, its total revenue was $520,406. Lesbian Connection is published bimonthly and although it has a suggested yearly subscription, it is notable for offering it on a sliding scale basis (asking for flexible donations based on each subscriber's ability to pay). LC is made available to incarcerated women, and mailed free of charge upon request to those unable to make a financial contribution.\n\nParagraph 3: Executive producer Kelly Souders explained that the loss of show creators Alfred Gough and Miles Millar, as well as series regulars Michael Rosenbaum and Kristin Kreuk at the end of the seventh season, forced the creative team to look at the show from a new angle. As Souders explained, it allowed the writers to work with \"blank slates\", and come up with ways to \"reinvigorate and reinvent the show\". Executive producer Darren Swimmer explained that this season would feature Chloe's powers manifesting in a way that they have not previously been seen. He went on to express that the theme of season eight would be \"double identity\"; specifically, Swimmer explained that Clark would begin to understand that he is going to have to live a double life, or he will never be able to continue forward with his destiny. Season eight would be about Clark moving forward to his destiny in a way that the show has never attempted before. Swimmer further explained that Clark will be acting more with his superpowers, whereas previously he would \"react\" to the situation; \"he's going to seek out trouble.\" Clark joined the Daily Planet to help his cause, using the Planet as a means to get information about where there is trouble. Clark's heroic actions put him in Jimmy's sights, who starts connecting things to Clark; this helped fuel Clark's decision to develop a \"secret identity\". Another reason for Clark's decision to develop a secret identity will be the stark contrast between saving people in the secluded streets of Smallville, and saving people in the crowded streets of Metropolis. While working at the Daily Planet, Clark was paired up with Lois on various assignments. Lois Lane actress Erica Durance, explained the episodes would be more focused on her character than they have been in the past, and that Lois and Clark would be both rivals and supportive partners to each other. Durance also revealed that Lois would begin to realize her true romantic feelings for Clark, but that she does not want him to know the truth because she does not know what she wants to do with those feelings. Season eight explored these romantic notions between the two characters. Jeph Loeb added that season eight would explore more of the DC Comics mythology, and would introduce new characters, as well as expand on already existing ones in Smallville continuity. Peterson also revealed that there would be a chance that the show would break the \"No flights, no tights\" rule, at least in regard to the flying part of the rule.\n\nParagraph 4: In the early 1950s, Vélez's parents moved from Puerto Rico to Brooklyn, New York, where she and her identical twin sister, Lorraine Vélez, were born. The twins have five other sisters and one brother. Vélez's father, a New York City Police Department officer, eventually bought a house in Far Rockaway, Queens, and moved the family there. The twins staged improvised plays and acting for the family and participated in nearly all their high school drama productions, such as Fiddler on the Roof. After graduating from Beach Channel High School in 1982, they received scholarships to attend the Alvin Ailey Dance School. They went on to study acting at The Acting Studio - New York with its founding artistic director James Price, protégé and personal friend of Sanford Meisner. Lauren also studied Shakespeare with Michael Howard.\n\nParagraph 5: Hoskins was born in Wells England. His finest miniatures Royal & Noble painting are at Ham House, Montagu House, Windsor Castle, Amsterdam and in the Pierpont Morgan collection and collection of the Victoria and Albert Museum. Vertue stated that Hoskins had a son, and Redgrave added that the son painted a portrait of James II in 1686 and was paid £10, 5s. for it, a statement for which there must have been some evidence, although it is not supported by any reference in the State Papers.  there was a portrait painted of an unknown woman that was known to be the work of Sir John Hoskins ,  work As an important early miniature portrait by John who originally trained as an oil painter. His work is datable to about 1615 and shows the still dominant influence of Nicholas Hilliard (1547-1619). The red curtain background is typical for this time, a development of the flat blue background of Elizabethan (later 16th-century) miniatures. Red paint is laid in flat, but the artist then used a wet brush to lift the red paint in strokes, giving the effect of folds in a curtain. Hoskins has also painted the woman's pearl earring using Hilliard's jewelling technique. This involved laying on a raised blob of white lead paint with some shadowing to one side. This was then crowned with a rounded touch of real silver that was burnished with, to quote Hilliard, ‘a pretty little tooth of some ferret or stoat or other wild little beast’. This brought the silver to a sparkling highlight, while actual gold is used to paint the pearl’s gold setting. Silver tarnishes with age, and so this pearl now appears black. Twenty years later Hoskins was painting pearls and gold in a more painterly fashion, using white and yellow paint rather than actual gold or silver. This change was influenced by Charles I's court painter, Anthony van Dyck, who arrived in London from Antwerp in 1632\n\nParagraph 6: In 1998, an extension of the BMT Astoria Line to LaGuardia Airport was planned as part of a $1.2 billion package to provide access to the New York City airports with funding from the MTA, the Port Authority and the city. The preferred route would have extended the Astoria Line along 31st Street north onto Con Edison’s property at the edge of Astoria and then east along 19th Avenue to the Marine Air Terminal. The MTA also considered an eastward extension along Ditmars Boulevard, and a plan to reroute LaGuardia-bound trains from Queensboro Plaza through the Sunnyside rail yard and along the eastern edge of St. Michael’s Cemetery to elevated tracks parallel to the Grand Central Parkway. A fourth route was to have trains turn east via Astoria Boulevard. All of the options would have new elevated sections built. $645 million for the LaGuardia extension was included in the MTA’s 2000-2004 Five-Year Capital Plan, and in late 2002, Mayor Bloomberg supported the extension. These options were studied in the LaGuardia Airport Subway Access Study. Community opposition was strong and therefore the plan was canceled in July 2003; however, , it is being reconsidered after New York governor Kathy Hochul requested the Port Authority find alternatives to the AirTrain LaGuardia project.\n\nParagraph 7: Wii Sports received \"generally favorable\" reviews from critics, according to review aggregator Metacritic. GameTrailers called it a good complement to the Wii console and referred to all five games as a \"nice total package\". They commented that the games provided enough gameplay for long time gamers without making it inaccessible to novices. GameTrailers stated, however, that the lack of a tournament mode was a detractor, and did not recommend paying for the game if it did not come bundled with the system. GamePro also commented that the free addition of the game with the Wii was a positive. Matt Casamassina of IGN called it a \"successful showpiece for Nintendo's new hardware\" and enjoyed the ability to import Miis. GameSpot editor Ryan Davis complimented the multiplayer aspect and the fitness test. Reviewers praised the game's controls and ease of use. Casamassina referred to the controls as \"revolutionary\" and described them as intuitive. GamePro echoed similar comments, praising the ease of play and realistic motion controls, while Davis commented that the motion controls were sometimes erratic. Common criticism focused on the graphics and lack of depth in the separate games. Casamassina stated that the game \"comes up short in depth and visuals\", and called the graphics \"generic\" and \"archaic\". Other reviewers said the graphics were on par with Nintendo's older gaming systems, the GameCube and Nintendo 64. Davis criticized the oversimplified nature of the games, and GamePro stated that the separate games offered less depth than regular console sports games. Nintendo Power listed Wii Sports along with its sequel, Wii Sports Resort, as two of the greatest multiplayer experiences in Nintendo's history, stating that everyone from young children to grandparents can enjoy the games. The magazine praised the grouping of sports and the game's longevity. In 2009, Official Nintendo Magazine said the game was \"Responsible for the biggest turn-around the console wars has ever seen\", placing it 21st on a list of the greatest Nintendo games. In 2019, the game was ranked 28th on The Guardian newspaper's The 50 Best Video Games of the 21st Century list.\n\nParagraph 8: Again, fire destroys The Queen Vic and Peggy transfers ownership to Phil before she leaves Walford. Phil renovates the pub and rents it to Alfie Moon and his wife Kat (Jessie Wallace). Kat is away temporarily in 2012 when Roxy again is landlady but upon Kat's return, The Queen Vic is forced to close down due to an outbreak of bed bugs, the source of which was thought to be Shirley Carter (Linda Henry), who has been staying. Instead, it was found that the source was the flat where Kat was meeting her lover Derek Branning (Jamie Foreman). The Queen Vic returns to Phil when Kat and Alfie fail to pay rent and Roxy is again made manager. However, Phil has a change of mind about Kat and Alfie when he finds out from Kat about her affair and subsequent attempt to save her marriage, all the while leaving Roxy as manager. During Christmas 2012, Alfie finds out about the affair, they separate and Roxy and Amy move back to The Queen Vic. Roxy replaces Kat as the joint licensee of the pub with Alfie, but leaves after Alfie reunites with Kat on the day of his and Roxy's wedding. As an act of revenge against the Moons, Phil decides to sell the pub and Alfie and Kat are forced to move out. Janine initially tries to buy the pub, but is arrested for murder before paying Phil. Mick Carter (Danny Dyer) buys The Queen Victoria on Christmas Day, 2013, and the following day moves into the pub with his wife Linda Carter (Kellie Bright) and son Johnny Carter (Sam Strike). Phil is surprised to discover that Mick is Shirley's brother. When Shirley persuades their estranged father into giving them £10,000 to repair the rising damp in the cellar, Mick and Linda give Shirley a 10% stake in the pub.\n\nParagraph 9: In the early 1930s a few American artists began experimenting with silk screen printing, a process then mostly used for posters, advertising, and similar applications. In 1938 one of these artists, Anthony Velonis, convinced the Graphics Section of the WPA Art Project in New York City to set up a Silk Screen Unit. With Velonis at its head, the artists in the unit were able for the first time to focus their energies on advancing silk screening as an artistic medium. Called serigraphy or screen printing, the process quickly took hold in the New York art community. In 1940 Edward Alden Jewell gave a concise description of the method. \"A stopping out varnish is painted freely over a silk screen mesh,\" he wrote, \"so that only the areas intended to receive color remain exposed. From three to thirty stencils may be prepared and properly registered with the total effect of an interesting gouache painting.\" Harry Sternberg, one of the artists in the WPA group, later told an interviewer, \"Posters and displays for store windows were screenprinted. It was a logical thing to do, to try to make [art] prints that way. We were all looking for a way to make inexpensive color prints. Prints were selling for $5 or $10 and we needed a cheap way to make them.\" In an article published in 1964 Edward Landon, another member of the group, said the materials and equipment needed for serigraphy were affordable by virtually any artist. The method, he wrote, was easy to learn and any artist should be able to use it to create an edition of fine prints. At the same time it was so flexible that experienced serigraphers could make complex works of art. Shokler was a member of the Silk Screen Unit. He later told an interviewer that in 1940, when the WPA project came to an end, he and about a dozen others rented a loft in a low-rent area of Manhattan's Lower East Side, where they perfected the technique and taught it to others. The same year he also joined with former members of the unit to form an organization called the Silk Screen Group to promote and exhibit screen print works of art. In 1944 the Silk Screen Group renamed itself the National Serigraph Society. Shokler served as the society's president twice during its early years. The group ceased to exist in 1962.\n\nParagraph 10: Clay was a contender for the role of Wilma Deering in Buck Rogers in the 25th Century, but lost the role when Erin Gray returned to reprise her role from the theatrical release. Clay later guest-starred in the Buck Rogers episode \"Vegas in Space\", playing Marla Landers, who briefly partnered with Rogers. Clay appeared as a guest star on a number of TV series, including Father Murphy, L.A. Law, and The Edge of Night (she originated the role of Raven Alexander in 1976, before Sharon Gabet took over the role). Clay was also married to actor Joe Lambie, who played Logan Swift, one of the husbands of her character on The Edge of Night. In 1981, she appeared in The Legend of the Lone Ranger, and in 1983, she had a small role in WarGames. In 1985, she played Jacqueline Kennedy in the miniseries Robert Kennedy and His Times. She was a founding member of the New York Acting Unit, a Shakespearean repertory group, and the co-author, producer, and director of King of the City, a drama about Al Capone.\n\nParagraph 11: American architects first started seriously studying phenomenology at Princeton University in the 1950s under Prof. Jean Labatut, whose student Charles W. Moore was the first to write a PhD dissertation, titled Water and Architecture (1958), that drew heavily on the philosophy of Gaston Bachelard. In Europe, Milanese architect Ernesto Nathan Rogers, through his influential editorship of the journal Casabella Continuità helped to advance architectural phenomenology in Europe. He collaborated with philosopher Enzo Paci, and influenced a generation of young architects including Vittorio Gregotti and Aldo Rossi. By the 1970s, the Norwegian architect, theorist and historian Christian Norberg-Schulz achieved international acclaim with his book \"Genius Loci: Towards a Phenomenology of Architecture\" (1979), which was markedly influenced by Martin Heidegger's hermeneutic ontology.  Christian Norberg-Schulz was, for many architecture students of the 1980s, an important reference in architectural phenomenology, especially because the combination of texts and images in his books provided readily accessible explanations for how a phenomenological approach to architecture could be translated into designs. Norberg-Schulz spawned a wide following, including his successor at the Oslo School of Architecture, Thomas Thiis-Evensen. In the 1970s, the School of Comparative Studies at the University of Essex, under the direction of Dalibor Vesely and Joseph Rykwert, was the breeding ground for a generation of architectural phenomenologists, which included David Leatherbarrow, professor of architecture at the University of Pennsylvania, Alberto Pérez-Gómez, professor of architectural history and theory at McGill University, the architect Daniel Libeskind. In the 1980s, the phenomenological approach to architecture was continued and further developed by Vesely and his colleague Peter Carl in their research and teaching at the Department of Architecture at the University of Cambridge. As architectural phenomenology became established in academia, professors developed theory seminars that tried to expand the movement's range of ideas beyond Gaston Bachelard, and Martin Heidegger, to include Edmund Husserl, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Hans-Georg Gadamer Hannah Arendt and an ever wider group of theorists whose modes of thinking bordered on phenomenology, such as Gilles Deleuze, Henri Bergson, Paul Virilio, Charles Taylor, Hubert Dreyfus and Edward S. Casey.\n\nParagraph 12: On November 20, 1984, Zorko ran his first ever race, which he won on a cross country course at the age of 17. Less than a year into training, he posted a time of 8:30 for 3000 meters and won a competitive high school race called Kros Sportskih Novosti. He declined offers to train with AK Crvena Zvezda and instead remained in Križevci, where he did intervals on a track only once a week. The rest of his training took place on forest trails, where Zorko alleged that bystanders would ask him why he was running and tell him to \"take a hoe and dig out some corn\".\n\nParagraph 13: Sarah appeared in #20 (\"Secret Moves\") where her date with Cyborg was cut short once again. In #27 (\"Love is A Battlefield\") she and Jinx fight over Cyborg, but the comic ends with both leaving him due to a confusion when he is possessed by Overload. Sarah returned to Cyborg in #39 (\"Stupid Cupid\"), where she and Cyborg went on a double date with Starfire and Robin. In #45 she, Beast Boy, and Cyborg supervise the handicapped children on a camping trip that Cyborg agreed to do prior to their break up. In the first part of the story, Beast Boy tells his origin to Sarah and the kids by the campfire. The second part has Cyborg talking to Sarah and tells her about his life before to joining the Titans. Sarah explained that she left him because she thought that he didn't care, due to Cyborg never telling her when he would be out on missions for weeks. Cy says he should have been more considerate and open with her and then tells her his origin. After, he tells her that she saw past his cybernetic parts and understood him and he could relate with her. He also says that they met in another life (a reference to Sarasim in the episode \"Cyborg the Barbarian\"). He asks her if she'd give him a second chance and she tells him that she'll be attending college soon, and Cyborg promises her he'll keep in touch through cellphone, e-mail, text, or even smoke signals (he calls himself as a walking communication center). Sarah happily agrees to make up, and the two hug. Cy happily tells Sarah that he thinks Robin can get a T-communicator for her. The story ends with them embracing, and Beast Boy teasing them like he did in the issue they met.\n\nParagraph 14: He was more distinguished as a man of science than as a politician or administrator. His classical work, La Pression barometrique (1878), embodies researches that gained him the biennial prize of 20,000 francs from the Academy of Sciences in 1875, and is a comprehensive investigation on the physiological effects of air-pressure, both above and below the normal. Central nervous system oxygen toxicity was first described in this publication and is sometimes referred to as the \"Paul Bert effect\". He showed that oxygen was toxic to insects, arachnids, myriapods, molluscs, earthworms, fungi, germinating seeds, birds, and other animals. He also received the Cameron Prize for Therapeutics of the University of Edinburgh for this work.\n\nParagraph 15: Luke Spencer (Anthony Geary) tracks down art dealer Ava Jerome at her home in New York City. Luke gets Ava to confess that she was once involved with the crazed artist Robert \"Franco\" Frank (Roger Howarth) and that he fathered her daughter, Lauren Katherine \"Kiki\" Jerome (Kristen Alderson). Ava is shocked to learn from Luke that Franco is an heir to the wealthy and powerful Quartermaine family and that Lauren is entitled to a share of the family fortune. After Luke's visit, it is revealed that Morgan Corinthos (Bryan Craig), the missing son of mob boss, Sonny Corinthos (Maurice Benard) is hiding out in Ava's apartment. Before leaving for work, Ava convinces Morgan to call home. Ava follows her daughter to Port Charles and has an impromptu meeting with Tracy Quartermaine (Jane Elliot) over Kiki's shares, and manages to work out a deal that would endow her with a large money sum. Ava then confronts her daughter about the latest revelations and confesses that her father is in fact alive, leaving Kiki in a state of anger against her mother. Whilst in town, Ava runs Dr. Silas Clay (Michael Easton), with whom she previously had a fling. When Silas begins to question whether or not Kiki is his, Morgan confronts Ava about the truth to which she reveals that Kiki is not Franco's, but in fact is Silas' daughter. When Ava's older brother, the presumed dead Julian Jerome (William deVry) arrives in town under the alias \"Derek Wells\", the two reveal how their gambling ring involvement with Morgan was all in a hoax to work their way into the Corinthos family crime organization. Ava also confesses to Julian her involvement in the shooting of Olivia Falconeri (Lisa LoCicero). While on a discovery to find out about her birth father, Sam Morgan (Kelly Monaco) and Silas travel to New York and discover that Delia Ryan (Ilene Kristen), who had an affair with Victor, was Ava's birth mother. During a heated confrontation, A. J. Quartermaine (Sean Kanan) confronts Ava about the night that Connie Falconeri (Kelly Sullivan) was murdered; Ava then confesses it was she who murdered Connie, not A. J., due to Connie discovering the truth about \"Derek\" and Ava's connection. Sonny interrupts and shoots A. J., killing him as a result. During A. J.'s funeral, Ava sleeps with Sonny in the Quartermaine family crypt, and is discovered by Morgan, who breaks their relationship off. To escape town, Sonny sends Ava to his private island to hide out, after Carly finds out the truth about A. J.'s death.\n\nParagraph 16: His family hailed from Isell, Cumberland, and he was educated at Cambridge. After being ordained as a priest Leigh obtained several livings under the patronage of Cardinal Wolsey; despite Wolsey's fall he rose high in the esteem of Henry VIII and of Thomas Cromwell by pursuing the policy of suppressing the monasteries, and is believed to have been rewarded by officiating at Henry's secret marriage to Anne Boleyn in January 1533. Whether so or not, Bishop Leigh took a lead part in preparing for the divorce proceedings against Catherine of Aragon, before in January 1534 being elected as Bishop of Coventry and Lichfield (the last to hold that title), or Chester, as the see was otherwise known, pledging at his consecration the new oath to the King as sovereign head of the Church of England rather than to the Pope; he was consecrated a bishop on 19 April 1534, by Thomas Cranmer, Archbishop of Canterbury, assisted by John Longland, Bishop of Lincoln; and Christopher Lord, suffragan bishop of Canterbury and Bishop of Sidon. He served as a prelate to the royal household advocating the legality of Henry's marriage with Queen Anne until May 1534 when he was appointed Lord President of the Council of Wales and the Marches.\n\nParagraph 17: Baron Walter Louis Davis (born April 13, 1979) is an American former professional basketball player who is a studio analyst for the NBA on TNT. He was a two-time NBA All-Star, made the All-NBA Third Team in 2004, and twice led the NBA in steals. He was drafted with the third overall pick in the 1999 NBA draft by the Charlotte Hornets. He also played in the NBA for the New Orleans Hornets, Golden State Warriors, Los Angeles Clippers, Cleveland Cavaliers and New York Knicks. Davis played college basketball for the UCLA Bruins, earning All-American honors before turning professional after his sophomore year. He was a star high school player while at Crossroads School. Davis holds the NBA's career playoff record for steals per game with an average of 2.28 over 50 games.\n\nParagraph 18: Through his ownership of the ground lease, Cuthbert Burbage was drawn further into the ongoing battles between his father and the widow Brayne. On 4 November 1590 she obtained a court order sequestering the Theatre property until the hearing of the case; however on 13 November Cuthbert succeeded in having that order stayed, and obtained an order for performance of the 1578 arbitration. On 16 November Margaret Brayne, Robert Miles and his son Ralph, and a friend, Nicholas Bishop, took a copy of the order to the Theatre to enforce its terms by taking half the profits from the gallery that day. They arrived just as playgoers were flocking in for a performance. James Burbage, after initial argument through a window of the Theatre, came down into the yard and called Robert Miles a knave and a rascal, and the widow Brayne a 'murdering whore'. James Burbage's wife and her son Richard Burbage, then only about nineteen, came into the yard and beat Robert Miles with a broomstaff. Richard Burbage, after 'scornfully and disdainfully playing with Nicholas Bishop's nose', threatened to beat him also. At that point Cuthbert Burbage arrived, and threatened the intruders with 'great and horrible oaths'. They were then violently thrust out of the yard. Some of the actors were attracted by the tumult, among them John Alleyn, brother of Edward Alleyn, who also put in a word for the widow Brayne, to no avail. The Admiral's Men, of which the Alleyn brothers were members, subsequently withdrew from the Theatre and went across the river to play at Henslowe's theatre. On 28 November Margaret Brayne had James Burbage arrested for being in contempt of the court order, and for the next two or three years there was a lengthy investigation into the contempt issue which was still ongoing when Margaret Brayne died in late April 1593. In her will dated 8 April she made Robert Miles her sole executor and left him all her property, including her half interest in the Theatre, and he thereby inherited the litigation in which he had already been active as her financial backer. Miles filed a bill of reviver near the end of the year and continued the suit in Chancery until 28 May 1595, when the court finally adjudged that he should attempt to collect on the bonds in the common law courts, which he appears not to have attempted.\n\nParagraph 19: Preuss gained renown in the summer of 1911, with his second ascent of the West Face of the Totenkirchl. This climb at that time was reputed to be one of the hardest in the Alps. The first ascent took seven hours. He climbed it solo in two and a half, including a new variation. This was rapidly followed by a solo first ascent of the East Face of the Guglia di Brenta. In the next few months he made the second ascents of Angelo Dibona's routes on the Croz dell'Altissimo and the Northwest Ridge of the Grossen Ödstein, making a point of not using any of the pitons left by the first ascensionists, thereby putting into practice his desire to climb as his predecessors Georg Winkler and Emil Zsigmondy had: in a pure style, meaning without any artificial aids (without guides in Zsigmondy's case and solo, in Winkler's). Pitons and carabiners were just starting to be effectively adapted for use in the mountains. At first, they were just used for protection or securing a rappel line, but then increasingly became used for upward progress, for instance as hand or footholds, or to secure the rope for a pendulum or tension traverse. To Preuss, this was nothing less than cheating. You should have to bring yourself up to the level of a difficult new route by improving your abilities; you shouldn't have to bring the mountain down to your level by improving your technological gadgetry. Preuss prized human achievement, measuring ourselves against the mountains, not technological achievement, reducing the mountain to the measure of our tools: With artificial climbing aids, you have transformed the mountains into a mechanical plaything. Eventually, they will break or wear out, and then nothing else will be left for you to do than to throw them away.\n\nParagraph 20: After fighting crime alongside his siblings for less than a year, Spencer, in losing consciousness after swimming from the team's flooded underwater headquarters to the surface, is rendered unconscious, and is revealed to have a bizarre, alien-like appearance. Confronted by his siblings, he reveals that one of the women with whom Captain Dynamo had an affair was an alien whom Dynamo met in deep space when he came to the aid of her crippled starship. After aiding in its repairs, he journeyed with her crew to her home planet, where he and the woman had an affair that resulted in her pregnancy. Because of the cultural taboo of raising a \"half-breed\" on her world, she journeyed to Earth after Spencer was born to leave him in Dynamo's custody. Dynamo, however, had no interest in raising Spencer or threatening his marriage, so he left Spencer in the custody of a F.L.A.G. (Foundation for Law and Government) research facility, telling them not that Spencer was his son, but that he found the infant at an alien crash site. Spencer's home for the next few years was the research compound, where scientists subjected him to extensive study and experimentation, including exposing him to the same radiation that gave Captain Dynamo his superhuman abilities, not knowing what effect it would have on the child. This exposure activated Spencer's shapeshifting ability, long before he met Maddie Warner. He learned how to use this power to disguise his alien appearance, and to mimic the appearance of people around him, but one of the scientists in particular, an African-American woman named Dr. Bridges, took a liking to Spencer, and the two formed a rapport. The other scientists were not amenable to their bond, and separated the two. Unable to convince Captain Dynamo to remove Spencer from the facility, Bridges had Spencer use his shapeshifting ability to smuggle him out of the compound. Knowing that she would be discovered by F.L.A.G. if she attempted to raise Spencer on her own, she placed Spencer, who maintained the appearance of a full human, in the care of child services, and never saw him again. Spencer spent his childhood in an orphanage, and was placed in a succession of less-than-ideal foster homes, and struck out on his own at the age of thirteen. Spencer speculated that Warner found him through a notation in Dynamo's black books about Dr. Bridges. At some point Spencer took on Dr. Bridges' last name, though when he did so is unknown. The origin of his first name, and the point in his life at which he adopted it has also not been specified.\n\nParagraph 21: The College of Europe () is a post-graduate institute of European studies with its main campus in Bruges, Belgium and a second campus in Warsaw, Poland. The College of Europe in Bruges was founded in 1949 by leading historical European figures and founding fathers of the European Union, including Salvador de Madariaga, Winston Churchill, Paul-Henri Spaak and Alcide De Gasperi as one of the results of the 1948 Congress of Europe in The Hague to promote \"a spirit of solidarity and mutual understanding between all the nations of Western Europe and to provide elite training to individuals who will uphold these values\" and \"to train an elite of young executives for Europe\". It has the status of Institution of Public Interest, operating according to Belgian law. The second campus in Natolin (Warsaw), Poland opened in 1992. The College of Europe is historically linked to the establishment of the European Union and its predecessors, and to the creation of the European Movement International, of which the college is a supporting member. Federica Mogherini, former High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, was appointed as the Rector to start in September 2020; former President of the European Council Herman, Count Van Rompuy is chairman of the board.\n\nParagraph 22: The late 1980s and early 1990s found Farul in the Divizia A, but with results which did not impress too much: 1988–89 – 9th, 1989–90 – 10th, 1990–91 – 10th, 1991–92 – 13th, 1992–93 – 9th and 1993–94 – 6th. Things started to change during the 1994–95 season, which was an important one for the team from the shore of the Black Sea. Even if the ranking was lower than in the previous season, 11th, Farul was enrolled in the 1995 UEFA Intertoto Cup, making its debut in the competition. The five teams group in which the team from Constanța was assigned was formed of: Cannes (9th place in the Ligue 1), Dnepr Mogilev (5th place in the Belarusian Premier League), Bečej (4th place in the First League of Serbia and Montenegro) and Pogoń Szczecin (8th place in the Ekstraklasa). Farul won surprisingly the group, after 3 victories, 1 draw and no defeat. The draw brought in front of Farul an important club, Heerenveen, 9th place in the Eredivisie in the previous season. The match was played in the Netherlands on 29 July 1995 at the Abe Lenstra Stadion. The stadium was not full, with only 5,000 spectators present, out of a total capacity of 20,000 seats. The match was clearly dominated by the Dutch side, for which played also a young man named Jon Dahl Tomasson, who would become a well-known player over a few years. Florin Marin, the coach of Farul, sent on the field the following 11: Cristian Munteanu – Stelian Carabaș, Daniel Ghișan, Marian Dinu (C), Mihai Matei, Ștefan Nanu – Gheorghe Barbu, Dănuţ Moisescu, Gheorghe Ciurea – Mugurel Cornățeanu, Laurențiu Zadea. The course of the game was in a single direction, to the Farul's goal. In the 19-minute Erik Regtop opened the score and 16 minutes later same Regtop increased it. After the break, Jon Dahl Tomasson (48') and Romeo Wounden (71') set the final score, 4–0. \"The Sailors\" continued their good form also next season, especially in the Romanian Cup, where were eliminated in the quarter-finals.\n\nParagraph 23: A thangka, variously spelled as thangka, tangka, thanka, or tanka (; Tibetan: ཐང་ཀ་; Nepal Bhasa: पौभा), is a Tibetan Buddhist painting on cotton, silk appliqué, usually depicting a Buddhist deity, scene, or mandala. Thangkas are traditionally kept unframed and rolled up when not on display, mounted on a textile backing somewhat in the style of Chinese scroll paintings, with a further silk cover on the front. So treated, thangkas can last a long time, but because of their delicate nature, they have to be kept in dry places where moisture will not affect the quality of the silk. Most thangkas are relatively small, comparable in size to a Western half-length portrait, but some are extremely large, several metres in each dimension; these were designed to be displayed, typically for very brief periods on a monastery wall, as part of religious festivals. Most thangkas were intended for personal meditation or instruction of monastic students. They often have elaborate compositions including many very small figures.  A central deity is often surrounded by other identified figures in a symmetrical composition.  Narrative scenes are less common, but do appear.\n\nParagraph 24: The events were developing around Dobor fortress which presage the end of the Bosnian national independence. Those were conflicts with Hungarians in 1393/94 and 1408th, and the cut of 170 Bosnian boyars on the ramparts of the fort. These areas then became cruel war frontier in a fit of the Turks, and they won Dobor and Modrica in the 1536th. After the defeat of the Turks at Vienna 1683rd, in the next two centuries this was the border area, and that means - the zone of conflicts, rebellions, devastation and economic stagnation. During Austrian-Hungarian rule, in 1897 Modrica has been included in list of such towns that Bosnia and Herzegovina had only 66.", "answers": ["Paragraph 21"], "length": 6616, "dataset": "passage_retrieval_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "dad39ff56af22fac2c8f08b17739a3b8efc42eae70184022"}
{"input": "Between the years 1142 and 1149, Rognvald, the Earl of Orkney, visited Katanes and stayed at Vik, where he was entertained by a brave man named Sveinn. During this time, Sveinn entrusted the keeping of Dungulsbae to Margad, who caused trouble and forced many people to seek refuge with Hroald in Wik. This led to a dispute between Hroald and Margad, which ended with Margad killing Hroald. Later, between the years 1153 and 1156, Harald Maddadson, who was the joint Earl of Katanes and Orkney with Rognvald, spent a winter in Katanes at Wik.", "context": "Paragraph 1: In 1890 she was arrested again. After an attempt to commit her to a mental asylum she moved to London. Michel lived in London for five years. She opened a school and moved among the European anarchist exile circles. Her International Anarchist School for the children of political refugees opened in 1890 on Fitzroy Square. The teachings were influenced by the libertarian educationist Paul Robin and put into practice Mikhail Bakunin's educational principles, emphasising scientific and rational methods. Michel's aim was to develop among the children the principles of humanity and justice. Among the teachers were exiled anarchists, such as Victorine Rouchy-Brocher, but also pioneering educationalists such as Rachel McMillan and Agnes Henry. In 1892 the school was closed, when explosives were found in the basement. (See Walsall Anarchists.) It was later revealed that the explosives had been put there by Auguste Coulon, a Special Branch agent provocateur, who worked at the school as an assistant. Michel contributed to many English-speaking publications. Some of Michel's writings were translated into English by the poet Louisa Sarah Bevington. Michel's published works were also translated into Spanish by the anarchist Soledad Gustavo. The Spanish anarchist and workers rights activist Teresa Claramunt became known as the \"Spanish Louise Michel\".\n\nParagraph 2: The game is a science fantasy comedy set in the fictional country of Aquitania, which bears a strong resemblance to early-to-middle 20th century Britain. The central characters in the story are the Guardians, immortal guardian angel-like beings who look after and help people. The Guardians - members of ARSE, the Association of Registered Stochastic Executives - are described as liking to wear herringbone overcoats and eat cheese sandwiches. Centuries ago the country was threatened by the rising dark power of the wicked Green Witches until the good magician Turani created a magical object, called the Bracelet, which holds luck and distributes it throughout Aquitania to limit and keep in check the witches' magic, banning the dangerous parts of the witchcraft and rendering them relatively harmless. However, the new high witch Jannedor has enough of the restraints. She has obtained and disassembled the Bracelet, stripped it of its five magical charms and hid them in various places (the bracelet itself is worn by Jannedor), waiting for its powers to be weakened enough it could be destroyed so she would fulfill her schemes of jinx and conquest. If the charms of Turani are not reunited soon with the legendary Bracelet of Turani then luck could completely run out and the witches will regain all of their old magic and the country will again fall under their influence.\n\nParagraph 3: The Captain N comic book was published by Valiant Comics as part of the Nintendo Comics System in 1990. Despite being based on the television cartoon of the same name, it had a more serious tone, delving into the wider effects of the N-Team's conflict with Mother Brain against the galaxy at large, and including serial storytelling. Following an older Kevin, leading the N-Team following the departure of Simon Belmont and Mega Man, the groups meet famed bounty hunter and hero Samus Aran, who falls in love with Kevin, and becomes Lana's rival for his affections. When asked by a fan why Samus did not appear in the television series, Jeffrey Scott said that he never heard about her. An article at 1UP.COM describes Samus as \"rambunctious, reckless, and gets into @#!*% contests with Lana over Kevin's affections, which makes for some of the most entertaining situations in the series\". The reviewer added: \"Not to say that the deadly quiet, contemplative Samus who fights for truth and justice in the more recent Metroid games isn't awesome, but there's something compelling about a Samus who's greedy and conniving – and is proud to admit it.\"<ref>\"Funny Pages. 1UP.COM. 1.

He purportedly possessed supernatural powers through Taoist practices, which he used to help the poor and stand up to injustice. However, he was also known for his wild and eccentric behavior, who didn't follow Buddhist monastic rules by consuming alcohol and meat. By the time of his death, Ji Gong had become a legend in Chinese culture and a deity in Chinese folk religion. He is mentioned by Buddhists in folktales and kōans, and sometimes invoked by oracles to assist in worldly affairs.\n\nParagraph 5: NH 9 begins in the west where VT 9 crosses the Connecticut River from Brattleboro, Vermont, into Chesterfield, New Hampshire on the United States Navy Seabees Bridge. The highway meanders its way through the large town (by area) en route to Keene, home of Keene State College. NH 9 enters the southern part of the city and intersects with the triplex of NH 10, NH 12, and NH 101, the latter of which has its western terminus here. NH 9 joins NH 10 and NH 12, bypassing downtown Keene to the west. After about a mile, NH 12 splits off to the northwest. Two miles later, NH 10 follows suit and NH 9 continues northeast, crossing through parts of Roxbury, Sullivan, and Nelson en route to Stoddard, where NH 9 intersects with NH 123. The two routes overlap for about a mile before NH 123 splits northwest, while NH 9 continues east. The highway passes along the northern edge of Antrim, intersecting and overlapping with NH 31. The two routes cross into the town of Hillsborough, where NH 31 splits off to the northwest and NH 9 becomes a semi-limited access highway (not quite up to super-two standards due to a number of at-grade intersections).  One mile (1.6 km) to the east, NH 9 interchanges with US 202 and the two routes form the first of two lengthy concurrencies. US 202 and NH 9 bypass downtown Hillsborough to the north, as well as the neighboring town of Henniker, before entering Hopkinton. US 202 and NH 9 intersect NH 127 near the town line and continue east to one of two partial interchanges with I-89. The first interchange allows the following movements: US 202/NH 9 east to I-89 south, US 202/NH 9 west to I-89 north, I-89 north to US 202/NH 9 west, and I-89 south to both directions of US 202/NH 9. The highway continues into town, intersecting the southern terminus of NH 103 (a secondary highway paralleling I-89 north) before intersecting I-89 again, with southbound-only access to the Interstate highway. US 202 and NH 9 enter the city of Concord from the west and roughly parallel I-89 until reaching downtown. The two highways intersect the northern terminus of NH 13 before meeting US 3 downtown. US 202 and NH 9 turn north onto US 3 for about six blocks before NH 9 turns east onto Loudon Road, intersecting with I-93 (US 202 continues along US 3 to meet I-393 just to the north). NH 9 runs as Loudon Road parallel to I-393 (which also carries US 4 and US 202), with access possible via NH 132 (East Side Drive) and NH 106 (Sheep Davis Road - NH 106 is also the route to New Hampshire Motor Speedway, which lies  to the north). NH 9 crosses underneath I-393 and enters the extreme northern tip of Pembroke.\n\nParagraph 6: The best-known study demonstrating inattentional blindness is the Invisible Gorilla Test, conducted by Daniel Simons of the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign and Christopher Chabris of Harvard University. This study, a revised version of earlier studies conducted by Ulric Neisser, Neisser and Becklen in 1975, asked subjects to watch a short video of two groups of people (wearing black and white T-shirts) passing a basketball around. The subjects are told either to count the passes made by one of the teams or to keep count of bounce passes vs. aerial passes. In different versions of the video a person walks through the scene carrying an umbrella (as discussed above) or wearing a full gorilla suit. After watching the video, the subjects are asked whether they noticed anything out of the ordinary taking place. In most groups, 50% of the subjects did not report seeing the gorilla (or the person with the umbrella). Failure to perceive the anomalies is attributed to failure to attend to it while engaged in the difficult task of counting passes of the ball. These results indicate that the relationship between what is in one's visual field and perception is based much more on attention than was previously thought.\n\nParagraph 7:  Between the years 1142 and 1149 Rognvald Earl of Orkney went into Katanes and was there entertained at Vik by a husbandman named Sveinn the son of Hroald, a very brave man. When Sveinn Asleifson was in the Hebrides, he committed the keeping of Dungulsbae, which he had received from Earl Rognvald, to Margad Grimson, whose oppressions caused many to take refuge with Hroald in Wik. This occasioned a dispute between Hroald and Margad, and the latter soon afterwards went to Wik with nineteen men and slew Hroald. Between the years 1153 and 1156, Harald Maddadson, then joint Earl Katanes and Orkney with Earl Rognvald, passed into Katanes and wintered at Wik.\n\nParagraph 8: But this marriage is not to be. Max and Skye, bent on revenge, set them up, making it appear as though Blair has slept with Max the night before her wedding to Todd. They drug Blair, making sure that Todd sees them together. Todd does not let on to Blair what he thinks he saw until the wedding itself. His voiced laced with hostility, he announces to everyone that he cannot marry Blair because she is the one who shot Max in the back. Blair is stunned at Todd's betrayal and cannot understand why he is doing this. She later forces Max, at gunpoint to tell her what he has done. Blair goes to Todd to tell him the truth, but it is too late. Todd has already made a deal with the DA and has turned in the clothes Blair wore the night of the shooting, in return for a deal where he is spared jail time. Blair is arrested for shooting Max and is put in jail. In the hope that he will testify on her behalf to keep her and her baby out of jail, she lies when she tells Max that she is pregnant with his child. Blair is unaware, however, that she really is pregnant. She later discovers this when Max drags her to the hospital for a pregnancy test — except, she privately discovers that she is pregnant with Todd's child. Max agrees to testify on her behalf, but Starr locks him in Asa's wine cellar on the day of the hearing so that he never makes it there. Instead, Todd testifies that Blair was totally out of her mind the day that she shot Max. The judge sends Blair to St. Ann's instead of to jail and she sees her mother there. After talking with Addie, Blair realizes that Todd had actually been trying to help her by keeping her out of jail. Blair wonders if she should try again to tell Todd the truth.\n\nParagraph 9: Hsieh attended Badminton Proton Malaysia Open which is held in the capital of Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur, in January. He played both events in the tournament, men's singles and mixed doubles. He knocked out in the first round in the mixed doubles while in the men's singles, he had clashed into men's singles semifinals successfully. But he was knocked out 13–21 14–21 by South Korean Park Sung-hwan. In March, Hsieh attended Badminton All England Open. In this tournament, Hsieh lost to Indonesia's strongest players in the first round in both events he took. Later, he continued his competition in Wilson Swiss Open. He took both events also, he played until second round in mixed doubles and in the men's singles he was successfully played until the quarters final match. He beat India's Chetan Anand in the second round by winning rubber games 9-21 22-20 21-17. He was then stopped by China's Lin Dan 16-21 14-21 in the quarters final and ended his tournament. In early April, he went to Osaka and took part in both events to get some points to improve his world ranking. In June, Hsieh took part men's singles match only in the Singapore Open. He lost to Indonesia's Sony Dwi Kuncoro 15-21 15-21 in the second round. Then, he attended Indonesian Open also in men's singles only. Later, he was blew away again in the second round by China's Lin Dan with 12-21 12-21. In August, Hsieh grabbed his golden opportunity to take part in the Macau Open Grand Prix Gold competition. Hsieh clashed into the last eight in Macau. But unfornately again, he was stopped by Indonesian Taufik Hidayat 16-21 14-21 in the last eight. Later in the Chinese Taipei Open and Li Ning China Open, Hsieh again lost 17-21 21-17 20-22 to Thailand's Tanongsak Saensomboonsuk and lost 15-21 19-21 to China's Lin Dan in the second round. Then in Japan Open, he lost to Indonesian Simon Santoso 18-21 6-21 in the first round. In November, Hsieh again took both events in the Hong Kong Open Super Series. He lost to Malaysian mixed doubles pairs in the qualification match and later he lost 13-21 9-21 to Indonesian Dionysius Hayom Rumbaka in the second round. Hsieh maybe made many mistakes again the Indonesian. After that, Hsieh went for the second time of China Open to play in only men's singles. He was beaten by Chen Jin of China in the second round by 14-21 5-21. In December, he attended BWF World Super Series Masters Competition in Johor Bahru, Malaysia. All of the players who come to this Masters Competition should win at least 2 points in the opening three rounds before clashing into the semi-finals. Hsieh had won 1 point only in his match so that he was again have nobond to play in the last four. He was only beaten by former Olympic Champion Taufik Hidayat of Indonesia with a 21-17 21-15 win in the last round. The first round he lost 11-21 12-21 to the world number one Lee Chong Wei and in the second round he lost to Chinese ace Bao Chunlai 21-17 8-21 16-21.\n\nParagraph 10: (L. 5.)— [His son] . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . magnanimous; equal to Brihaspati in intellect; possessed of a countenance like the full-moon; the standard of comparison, as it were, for (even) Râma and Bhagîratha; . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . on the earth, (was) Visvavarman;— who surpassed (the mountain) Mêru in firmness, Vainya in hereditary virtue, the moon in development of lustre, (the god) Vishnu in strength, and the most unendurable fire of universal destruction in brilliance, and (Indra) the lord of the gods in prowess;—who, when he grasps (his) weapon, cannot be gazed upon even for a moment by (his) enemies, whose eyes are blinded by fear, just like a sun, which, turning back upon (its) course, has an unendurable form and a brilliant and terrible lustre that is heightened by rising in a cloudless sky;— to whom obeisance is performed by the waterlilies which are the faces of the lovely women of (his) enemies, frightened beforehand by (hearing of) the prowess of (his) strength, (and now) destitute of ornaments, moist on the cheeks with the water of the tears that cling there, (and) deprived of beauty by having their wearing of adornments stopped;— whose forces, moreover, have reverence done to them by [the oceans], the palmyra-trees on the shores of which are beautified by the lustre of the production of jewels (from the waters); the rows of the foam on which are broken through by the terrified sharks and marine monsters; (and) all of whose hands, which are their waves, are shaken about by a fierce wind;—at the time of the journeying forth of whose army, the earth has (its) thickets emptied of the beasts and birds which flee away from fear of the lances that uproot the trees and make the mountains tremble, and, having (its) highways made uneven by protuberances, sinks down as it were (under the tread of his troops);— whose reputation has respect paid to it in a reverential manner in the sky by the Vidyâdharas, bound in the fetters of the arms of (their) mistresses, who are blinded by the radiance, directed towards (them), of the rays of the jewels in (his) diadem, (and) the upper parts of whose cheeks are shaded by the lifting up of (their) joined hands in the act of respectful salutation;— and who, even when\n\nParagraph 11: In the opening game of the season, he made his debut in a 3–2 win over Wimbledon. On 24 September 2011, he scored his first goal for Bristol Rovers away at Morecambe, which won the match for Rovers 3–2. After the match, manager Buckle was pleased to see him back on track from his injury and said: \"We haven't seen too much of him because of injury and, as we build, get strong and get to know each other and add to the squad we will be fine. It's still all brand new and we have to keep working hard and hopefully there will be a lot more performances like (Saturday's).\" 20 days later on 14 October 2011, he scored his second goal of the season in a 5–2 rout against Rotherham United at the Memorial Stadium. On 29 October he added his to his tally with a goal in the 2–0 home win over Dagenham and Redbridge. 7 days later, he scored again in the 2–1 loss away at Accrington Stanley. On 4 December 2011, he scored his last goal of the season and set up a goal in 6–1 FA Cup rout against Totton. During his first season, the club would suffer losing form, leading to Buckle's sacking but under new manager Mark McGhee, the club would eventually survive relegation. For Anyinsah in the second half of the season, he was substituted very early in the first half in a 2–1 win over Morecambe and McGhee's action was explained when he changed formation from 4–4–2 to 4–3–3. Despite this, Anyinsah praised McGhee's impact, saying, \"It's been good. He's come in and he's just shaken up the place with the way he works. He's very thorough in his methods and he's got the players playing as he wants us to.\"''\n\nParagraph 12: Meng's overtures to Dong were unable to persuade Dong, and Dong, indeed, launched an attack on Xichuan in summer 932.  Zhao pointed out that while Dong was known to be a ferocious fighter, he lacked the grace to have his soldiers to be truly committed to his cause.  Zhao predicted that while Dongchuan forces will be initially successful, as long as Xichuan persevered, the situation would eventually be reversed, and advocated that Meng should prepare for this and encourage his troops by personally appearing to them — an assessment shared by the general Zhao Tingyin.  Once Dong launched the attack, he tried to, in addition to issuing a declaration, foster suspicion in Meng's mind against Zhao Jiliang, Zhao Tingyin, and another general, Li Zhao () by writing letters addressed to the three of them, but Meng disregarded that.  He followed Zhao Jiliang's recommendations and went to the front lines himself, leading Zhao Jiliang and Gao Jingrou () in charge of Chengdu.  After a few Dongchuan victories that allowed Dong to penetrate all the way to Mimou Base (彌牟, in modern Chengdu), near Chengdu itself.  When the Dongchuan forces then engaged the main Xichuan forces under Meng, they were initially successful, but a counterattack by Meng's general Zhang Gongduo crushed Dong's own personal guard corps, causing a general collapse of the Dongchuan troops.  Dong fled back to Zi Prefecture, where he was killed by his own subordinates, who surrendered to Meng and allowed Meng to take over Dongchuan.  In the aftermaths of the victory over Dongchuan, Zhao Tingyin and Li Renhan both wanted to be the military governor of Dongchuan; under the advice from Li Hao and Zhao Jiliang, Meng decided to assume the military governor of Dongchuan himself (in addition to Xichuan), while giving both Li Renhan and Zhao Tingyin both smaller circuits.  Zhao subsequently suggested that Meng assume the title of prince and exercise imperial powers, but Meng refused at that point.  In late 932, in a further show of authority over the region, at Li Hao's suggestion, Meng requested commissions for five of his subordinates as full military governors, including commissioning Zhao Jiliang as the military governor of Wutai Circuit (武泰, headquartered in modern Chongqing).  In spring 933, without having further received Emperor Mingzong's orders, Meng went ahead and issued the five military governor commissions on edicts written in black (i.e., still issuing edicts under Emperor Mingzong's purported authorities, but without prior imperial authorization).  Shortly after, Emperor Mingzong issued an edict creating Meng as the Prince of Shu and confirming the five military governor commissions.  (However, given the subsequent events, it was not clear whether Zhao actually reported to Wutai or remained at Chengdu.)\n\nParagraph 13: On Dasami day Lord is made to ride on the Hamsa vahanam with beautiful flower decoration. On Ekadasi day the lord is atop Vyali vahanam in his majestic best. On the Dwadasi day, Lord is carried on his shoulders by his most ardent devotee Hanuman and is a very popular vahanam among certain communities of the town. On the Triyodasi day in the morning, Lord goes around the town in his famous Mohini avatar and in the night Lord is atop Golden Garuda with huge following of the public is taken out of the temple in a takeoff mode. This vahanam is made to go around the entire town and returns to the temple almost at the day break. Seetharamula Kalyanam is celebrated with the full religious fervour with huge attendance from people from all over on the Chaturdasi day and this event is generally more popular among the women folk who throng to get the ‘Talambralu’ (Rice mixed in turmeric and used during the celestial wedding). Seetha Lakshmana sametha Rama is taken to the southern end of the city to shower their blessings on the town folks. Once they return Lord Rama goes on the Gaja vahanam On the pournami day the three deities are put on the elaborately decorated ‘Ratham’ (Temple car) and this ratham is pulled by the thousands of devotees who visit the town from far and near for this event. Normally it takes about 45 minutes for the Ratham to complete its journey and reaches the resting place. During the evening hours, the Lord is taken for a boat ride on a specially built float ‘Theppa’ which is well decorated with lights in the temple tank for three rounds. On completion of the Theppotsavam, Lord goes around the town in Krishna avatar on ‘Ponnamanu seva’. On the Padyami day, Lord goes on his Ashwa vahanam and there is a story of ‘Paruveta’ on triyodasi day chakrasnanam is performed and Dwaja avarohanam is conducted.\n\nParagraph 14: The Citizen Corps is an organization of volunteer service programs, administered locally and coordinated nationally by DHS, which seek to mitigate disasters and prepare the population for emergency response through public education, training, and outreach. Most disaster response is carried out by volunteer organizations. In the US, the Red Cross is chartered by Congress to coordinate disaster response services. It is typically the lead agency handling shelter and feeding of evacuees. Religious organizations, with their ability to provide volunteers quickly, are usually integral during the response process. The largest being the Salvation Army, with a primary focus on chaplaincy and rebuilding, and Southern Baptists who focus on food preparation and distribution, as well as cleaning up after floods and fires, chaplaincy, mobile shower units, chainsaw crews and more. With over 65,000 trained volunteers, Southern Baptist Disaster Relief is one of the largest disaster relief organizations in the US. Similar services are also provided by Methodist Relief Services, the Lutherans, and Samaritan's Purse. Unaffiliated volunteers show up at most large disasters. To prevent abuse by criminals, and for the safety of the volunteers, procedures have been implemented within most response agencies to manage and effectively use these 'SUVs' (Spontaneous Unaffiliated Volunteers).\n\nParagraph 15: Roxxon is revealed to be orchestrating the young superheroes being falsely outlawed by the public. Having acquired the dragons from War of the Realms event, their first step was to get rid of the high schooler Aliana Kabua. Although Kamala Khan got injured from saving Aliana, Roxxon begin to shift the blame to the Champions for the damage they never started. While forming a partnership with Senator Geoffrey Patrick and C.R.A.D.L.E., Roxxon manipulates them into unknowingly furthering their shady businesses, such as permanent imprisonment, brainwashing and unethical experimentation, as well as possibly kidnapping of the kids who oppose the unjust law. Viv Vision, who survived Roxxon's assault on Aliana, had been monitoring her fellow younger superheroes, but discovers that she is unintentionally selling her friends to C.R.A.D.L.E. and Roxxon. Once the Champions reveals Roxxon's conspiracy to Senator Patrick and the public, the senator finally begins to repeal the unjust law, ending the partnership with Roxxon, and clearing Kamala's name while re-evaluating his business dealings. Later, Miles Morales and Sam Alexander go undercover as interns, prior to being suggested to hire Kamala Kahn. While Roxxon attempts to cover up their illegal activity by releasing a social app called \"Roxx-On\", a Champion and a former prisoner of C.R.A.D.L.E.'s harassment, Snowguard rallies a group of mobs because they still openly do not trust Roxxon for their previous activities. Much worst, Roxxon already hired Ironheart's nemesis from Stark Unlimited, Andre Sims, in an attempt to collect data to dispose of those who are deemed threats to its business. He replaced young superheroes with his Chaperon robots to ensure the unjust Kamala's Law remains active. During Roxx-On concert, Roxxon lost its public trust thanks to Kamala's public speech about the company's ongoing shady business, thus repealing Kamala's Law and disbanding C.R.A.D.L.E.. However, Roxxon's reputation becomes worst when Andre attempts to dispose of young people like the Champions because of his personal issues, but is immediately stopped by Roxxon's higher-up Miriam Blakemoore. After that, Roxxon finally makes a public speech to apologize for their actions and takes responsibility for Andre's crime.\n\nParagraph 16: As the once great Indian Ocean maritime power of the Chola dynasty in medieval India had waned and declined, Chinese sailors and seafarers began to increase their own maritime activity in South East Asia and into the Indian Ocean. Even during the earlier Northern Song period, when it was written in Tamil inscriptions under the reign of Rajendra Chola I that Srivijaya had been completely taken in 1025 by Chola's naval strength, the succeeding king of Srivijaya managed to send tribute to the Chinese Northern Song court in 1028. Much later, in 1077, the Indian Chola ruler Kulothunga Chola I (who the Chinese called Ti-hua-kia-lo) sent a trade embassy to the court of Emperor Shenzong of Song, and made lucrative profits in selling goods to China. There were other tributary payers from other regions of the world as well. The Fatimid-era Egyptian sea captain Domiyat traveled to a Buddhist site of pilgrimage in Shandong in 1008, where he presented the Chinese Emperor Zhenzong of Song with gifts from his ruling Imam Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah, establishing diplomatic relations between Egypt and China that had been lost during the collapse of the Tang dynasty in 907 (while the Fatimid state was established three years later in 910). During the Northern Song, Quanzhou was already a bustling port of call visited by a plethora of different foreigners, from Muslim Arabs, Persians, Egyptians, Hindu Indians, Middle-Eastern Jews, Nestorian Christians from the Near East, etc. Muslims from foreign nations dominated the import and export industry (see Islam during the Song dynasty). To regulate this enormous commercial center, in 1087 the Northern Song government established an office in Quanzhou for the sole purpose of handling maritime affairs and commercial transactions. In this multicultural environment there were many opportunities for subjects in the empire of foreign descent, such as the (Arab or Persian) Muslim Pu Shougeng, the Commissioner of Merchant Shipping for Quanzhou between 1250 and 1275. Pu Shougeng had gained his reputable position by helping the Chinese destroy pirate forces that plagued the area, and so was lavished with gifts and appraisal from Chinese merchants and officials. Quanzhou soon rivaled Guangzhou (the greatest maritime port of the earlier Tang dynasty) as a major trading center during the late Northern Song. However, Guangzhou had not fully lost its importance. The medieval Arab maritime captain Abu Himyarite from Yemen toured Guangzhou in 993, and was an avid visitor to China. There were other notable international seaports in China during the Song period as well, including Xiamen (or Amoy).\n\nParagraph 17: In 1891, the Swedish-Norwegian Rifle Commission started its work. After extensive ballistic tests where different calibers were tested (8 mm, 7.5 mm, 7 mm, 6.5 mm etc.), the optimal caliber was determined to be 6.5 mm (0.256 in). Following this decision, a joint Norwegian-Swedish commission was established in December 1893. This commission worked through a series of meetings to decide on the different measurements for the cartridge case. The Norwegians early presented a 6.5 mm rimless cartridge design, but the Swedes wanted a rimmed cartridge. As a compromise, the Norwegians produced an experimental semi-rimmed cartridge which was very similar to what would become the final version. The book Cartridge Cases refers to this cartridge as 6,5mm Norwegian Experimantal. This cartridge had a 6.7 mm bullet, a 55 mm long case, but differed from what became the final version by having a slightly less tapered shoulder, a slightly smaller diameter base (11.75 mm) as well as being semi-rimmed (12.6 mm). However, after a firearm demonstration by Mauser, the Swedes changed their mind and wanted a rimless design. After further discussions, a rimless cartridge case of 55 mm length was approved, and each possible measurement (diameter at base, diameter at neck, angle of case, angle of shoulder etc.) was decided upon. The corresponding dimensions of the cartridge chamber to be used in a future service rifle was also determined. At the time of its development the 6.5×55mm was a high-performance smokeless-powder cartridge. The design of the joint Norwegian-Swedish commission was subsequently adopted by the Norwegian and Swedish governments, and entered service in the Norwegian and Swedish militaries. The cartridge was also adopted by the Danish, Norwegian and Swedish civilian shooting associations DDS, DFS and FSR.\n\nParagraph 18: Agori Barhar an impartible estate, it originally comprised the present districts of Sonbhadra and part of Mirzapur district. It was divided into two parganas of Agori, which was  and Barhar, which was  in area, thus making it the largest estate in area in the United Provinces of Agra and Oudh. Chandel Rajput Raja Paramardideva of Mahoba, ancestor of the family and contemporary of Raja Prithviraj III of Delhi, who attacked Mahoba as the Raja was the ally of Raja Jaichand of Kannauj, and occupied it for a time. Raja Paramardi Deva fled for his life with his friends and family, and though Mahoba was re-occupied by the Raja with the help of Jaichand of Kannauj, the glory of the capital never returned. During this time one of the sons of Raja Paramardi Deva, called Ashajit, fled eastwards in the turmoil that followed. His sons or grand sons called Barimal and Bharimal, captured Agori from the Kaharwar Raja and made themselves the independent rulers of Agori and Barhar. The elder brother Barimal took the kingdom of Agori and Barhar, and the younger brother Bharimal became the independent ruler of Bardi (Princely state ruled by Chandel -Rajput ruler). Within this zamindari, sixteen talukas have been assigned for the maintenance of the Babus (collateral agnates).\n\nParagraph 19: In addition to a material being certified as biocompatible, biomaterials must be engineered specifically to their target application within a medical device. This is especially important in terms of mechanical properties which govern the way that a given biomaterial behaves. One of the most relevant material parameters is the Young's Modulus, E, which describes a material's elastic response to stresses. The Young's Moduli of the tissue and the device that is being coupled to it must closely match for optimal compatibility between device and body, whether the device is implanted or mounted externally. Matching the elastic modulus makes it possible to limit movement and delamination at the biointerface between implant and tissue as well as avoiding stress concentration that can lead to mechanical failure. Other important properties are the tensile and compressive strengths which quantify the maximum stresses a material can withstand before breaking and may be used to set stress limits that a device may be subject to within or external to the body. Depending on the application, it may be desirable for a biomaterial to have high strength so that it is resistant to failure when subjected to a load, however in other applications it may be beneficial for the material to be low strength. There is a careful balance between strength and stiffness that determines how robust to failure the biomaterial device is. Typically, as the elasticity of the biomaterial increases, the ultimate tensile strength will decrease and vice versa. One application where a high-strength material is undesired is in neural probes; if a high-strength material is used in these applications the tissue will always fail before the device does (under applied load) because the Young's Modulus of the dura mater and cerebral tissue is on the order of 500 Pa. When this happens, irreversible damage to the brain can occur, thus the biomaterial must have an elastic modulus less than or equal to brain tissue and a low tensile strength if an applied load is expected.\n\nParagraph 20: Since the 1970s, South Asian performers and writers have achieved significant mainstream cultural success. The first South Asian musician to gain wide popularity in the UK and worldwide fame was Queen lead singer Freddie Mercury, born Farrokh Bulsara in Zanzibar, East Africa, to parents of Parsi descent from Bombay (now Mumbai). In 2006, Time Asia magazine voted him as one of the most influential South Asians in the past 60 years. At around the same time, music producer, composer and songwriter Biddu gained worldwide fame for a number of hit songs, including \"Kung Fu Fighting\" by Carl Douglas and \"I Love to Love (But My Baby Loves to Dance)\" for Tina Charles. In the 1990s the South Asian artists who gained mainstream success included Apache Indian, whose 1993 single \"Boom Shack-A-Lak\" was used in many Hollywood movies, and Jas Mann, who headed Babylon Zoo and whose 1996 single \"Spaceman\" set a UK chart record when it sold 418,000 copies in its first week of release. The most successful South Asian musician in 2008 was the British Tamil artist M.I.A., who was nominated for two Grammy Awards for her single \"Paper Planes\", and has been nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Score for \"O... Saya\", from the Slumdog Millionaire soundtrack.\n\nParagraph 21: A 1999 study found for people in the F2, F3 and F4 classes in the discus, elbow flexion and shoulder horizontal abduction are equally important variables in the speed at which they release the discus. For F2, F3 and F4 discus throwers, the discus tends to be below shoulder height and the forearm level is generally above elbow height  at the moment of release of the discus. F2 and F4 discus throwers have limited shoulder girdle range of motion.  F2, F3 and F4 discus throwers have good sitting balance while throwing. F5, F6 and F7 discus throwers have greater angular speed of the shoulder girdle during release of the discus than the lower number classes of F2, F3 and F4. F2 and F4 discus throwers have greater average angular forearm speed than F5, F6, F7 and F8 throwers.  F2 and F4 speed is caused by use of the elbow flexion to compensate for the shoulder flexion advantage of F5, F6, F7 and F8 throwers. A study of javelin throwers in 2003 found that F2 throwers have angular speeds of the shoulder girdle less than that of other classes. A study of was done comparing the performance of athletics competitors at the 1984 Summer Paralympics. It found there was little significant difference in performance in distance between women in 1A (SP1, SP2) and 1B (SP3) in the club throw. It found there was little significant difference in performance in distance between men in 1A and 1B in the club throw. It found there was little significant difference in performance in distance between men in 1A and 1B in the discus. It found there was little significant difference in performance in distance between men in 1A and 1B in the javelin. It found there was little significant difference in performance in distance between men in 1A and 1B in the shot put. It found there was little significant difference in performance in times between women in 1A and 1B in the 60 meters. It found there was little significant difference in performance in times between men in 1A and 1B in the 60 meters. It found there was little significant difference in performance in times between women in 1A and 1B in the slalom. It found there was little significant difference in performance in distance between women in  1A, 1B and 1C  in the discus. It found there was little significant difference in performance in distance between women in 1A, 1B and 1C  in the club throw.", "answers": ["Paragraph 7"], "length": 6436, "dataset": "passage_retrieval_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "647ab0f2c3a376dff61e86bd0414403a4efefa8e921ce2a3"}

Heavy with physics theory, the story describes the relationship between the creator of the device, the billionaire inventor Edward Bloom, and his former classmate James Priss, a Nobel Prize-winning theoretical physicist who had developed most of the theory that made the device possible. The men are expert billiards players and bitter rivals. Challenged to execute a shot on a table which is equipped with the device, Priss sends a ball on a complicated trajectory, which finishes when it enters the device's field. At that point the ball vanishes and Bloom collapses, dead. There is a mysterious hole drilled completely through his chest.\n\nParagraph 2: It is the parish where the miracle of fresh flowers and the first of the apparitions of Santa María de Guadalupe are remembered. A first chapel was built on the Tepeyac hill in 1666 by the will of Cristóbal de Aguirre and Teresa Pelegina. Around 1740, Father J. de Montufar ordered the construction of the current temple, next to which the chaplain's house was built. which, when enlarged, was used for exercises. Inside you can see frescoes by the muralist painter Fernando Leal, who was entrusted with narrating the history of the apparitions, and who captures the meeting of cultures and the roots of faith. In times of New Spain, this chapel was consecrated to Saint Michael the Archangel, who is always represented protecting the Virgin (Apocalypse 12, 7). According to New Spain tradition, it was Saint Michael who brought down from heaven to earth the portrait of the Virgin, painted in the heavenly workshop. At the time he was the patron saint of Mexico City. In this chapel is currently the convent of the Carmelites, a cloistered community that carries out activities related to the care of the chapel and prayer for the world. The last of its chaplains was the archpriest priest, Carlos Vargos, who served as such along with his sacristan, Mr. Diego Velázquez.\n\nParagraph 3: Anniemal received acclaim from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 81, based on 23 reviews, which indicates \"universal acclaim\". Scott Plagenhoef of Pitchfork referred to the songs as a \"dozen slices of stylish, sophisticated electro-pop, crisp tracks that move between the fizzy and the woozy, all anchored by Annie's breathy (sometimes almost muted) vocals.\" The site's endorsement was uncommon during a period when sites covering independent music were often dismissive of pop acts. In his review for AllMusic, Andy Kellman described Anniemal as \"cunning\" but also \"deeply affecting\". Dylan Hicks' review for The Village Voice stated that the blogosphere and British music press overrated Anniemal but that \"an overrated good record is still a good record\". Jody Rosen wrote for The New York Times that the album \"is a true album, strong from top to bottom\" and that \"there is charm in [Annie's] deadpan delivery, and her songwriting is full of the flair for melody for which Scandinavian pop is famous.\" Rosen also contributed a review to Slate, where she noted that \"other singers have made whole careers out of singles less winning than 'Chewing Gum,' but [Anniemal] includes several other superb songs\". Kitty Empire's review in The Observer stated that the album's songs \"boast a winning combination of innocence and experience, breezy blonde melodies and just-so productions\". PopMatters Pierre Hamilton called Anniemal \"riveting\" for how \"it lacks the waxy sheen\" that listeners were used to hearing in manufactured pop music. However, a second PopMatters review, written by Rob Horning, criticised the album for using a similar formula to previous generations of electropop, adding that the result was \"exquisitely empty…enough to suck the feelings out of its listeners and leave them happily vacant, blank and unburdened.\" In his review for Billboard magazine, Michael Paoletta described the album as \"slinky and sensual, cool and classy, fun and fiery\" and labeled it \"one of the best debut albums of 2005.\"\n\nParagraph 4: Asian Latin Americans served various roles during their time as low wage workers in Latin America. In the second half of the nineteenth century, nearly a quarter of a million Chinese migrants in Cuba worked primarily on sugar plantations. The Chinese \"coolies\" who migrated to Peru took up work on the Andean Railroad or the Guano Fields. Over time the Chinese progressed to acquiring work in urban centers as tradesmen, restaurateurs and in the service industry. By the second decade of the nineteenth century, approximately 25,000 Chinese migrants in Mexico found relative success with small businesses, government bureaucracy, and intellectual circles. In the 1830s, the British and Dutch colonial governments also imported South Asians to work as indentured servants to places such as Trinidad and Tobago, Suriname, Curaçao and British Guiana (later renamed Guayana). At the turn of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, Japanese immigrants reached Brazil and Peru. Much like the Chinese, the Japanese often worked as indentured servants and low wage workers for planters. Japanese work contracts were notably more short term than those of the Chinese and the process was closely monitored by the Japanese government to dissuade abuse and foul play. In both cases, the influx of Asian migrant workers was to fill the void left in the Latin American work forces after the abolition of slavery. Employers of all kinds were desperate for a low cost replacement for their slaves so those who did not participate in any illegal slave operations turned to the Asian migrants.\n\nParagraph 5: Roy was born in Quebec City as one of three children. His father was a judge, the dean of the faculty of law at the University of Laval, and a friend of Maurice Duplessis. His mother was a descendant of the poet Napoléon Legendre. Initially homeschooled, he was ordained to the priesthood by Bishop Joseph Brunault on June 12, 1927 after attending the Seminary of Quebec from 1915 to 1923. He obtained his licentiate in theology from the Université Laval in 1927, and then studied at the Angelicum in Rome, receiving a doctorate in philosophy in 1929. From 1929 to 1930, he attended the Sorbonne and the Catholic Institute in Paris. Roy then taught dogmatic and sacramental theology and apologetics at Quebec's Grand Seminary until 1939. He worked as a chaplain to the University of Laval (1935–1937) and to the Canadian Army during World War II. He served in the United Kingdom, Italy, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Germany from 1939 to 1943 and attained the rank of colonel. He was awarded the Order of the British Empire for his \"extremely courageous conduct\" as a chaplain in the war. Resuming his teaching posts upon his return to Canada in 1945, Roy was named superior of the seminary in December of that same year.\n\nParagraph 6: Balou (severe; the name of a Portuguese settler Barros very severe) – Bambi/Mbambi (Iguana) – Batchi/Mbatchi (possess me, caught up with me, what belongs to you; of the verb mbak meaning to possess, to catch) – Bilindji – Bouiti (Master) – Boutali – Djembo (struggle with, provoking quarrels) – Djimbi – Gnali – Goma/Ngoma (drum, percussion musical instrument) – Guimbi – Katane (leaves) – Kutana (competing, compete) – Lassy – Lende – Lianzi (name of sea fish, fisherman) – Likounzi/Tchikounzi (Pillar) – Limeka-Linka (the other problem) – Loemba/Loembe (landlord) – Loendo – Louang ' (the little herb that cures) – Loubendou – Louviloukou – Loussiemo (Lightning) – Louzimbou (ingratitude) – Louzingou (Life) – Louzol ' (Love) – Mabiala (Madness, elected, selected) – Makala (Coal/energy) – Makani – Makaya (leaves) – Makosso (plural of likosso; comments, eye drops, solution obtained by mashing by hand unidentified leaves and administered in the nostrils with a funnel made from leaves, arguments) – Malalou – Malassy – Mambou/Liambou/Tchimambou (case (s), amazement, admiration, many) – Mangafou/Mangofo (Minister of Health of the Government of the Kingdom of Loango/Minister of Foreign Affairs and Introducer of Foreigners at the court of the Kingdom of Kakongo-1776) - Manka (other situations) - Mapakou - Matakou (buttock) - Matchiela – Matouti – Mavoungou (plural Muvungu, bedding covers) – Mbouakissi – Mbouyou/Bouyou – Mfoumou/Foumou (chief, leader) – Moutou/Bantou/Tchimoutou (person (s)) – Mpaka/Paka (fence, doubt, uncertainty) – Mpili (Viper) – Munuel (informant) – Ngang Lyel (educated, erudite) – Ngang' Vumba (the one who broods) – Ngô (leopard) – Ngulungu (Pain) – Ngulubu (wild boar) – Nguli Mbwiti (Grand Master, great fetishist) – Niambi (complaint) – Nkali – Nkouanga – Nkoussou (Parrot) – Nkunta/Ntetchi (Basket) – Nombo – Ntenda (sound of rifle shot translated in Tendart) – Nzaou (Elephant) – Nzassi (Lightning) – Nzenze (cricket) – Nziami – Pango/Pangou – Pambou (ability, bell) – Panzou – Pakassa (Buffalo) – Pembello (clean air) – Poati (hold me, live all my being) – Poba – Sakala – Sitou – Souami – Souchlaty (hold me, inhabit my whole being) – Soumbou – Ta Lounga (we were right) – Tam ' Si (deals with the affairs of the country) – Ta Tounga (we have built) – Tati – Tchiama/Untchiama (Rainbow) – Tchibota -Tchicaya (diminutive of Tchikakati; thing from the inside, placenta) – Tchinianga -Tchilala – Tchilimbou (flag, victory, indelible europeanised mark in Sinald) – Tchimbakala (young man) – Tchiloumbou (the day) – Tchingoundou – Tchissafou (safou) – Tchissambou – Tchissina (wealthy) – Tchitembo – Tchivanga – Tchivéla (thunder) – Tchiyembi (poverty) – Téléman (hope, arise) – Viodu/Li Viodu/Viaudo (Sparrow, Unlucky, bad eye).\n\nParagraph 7: The architecture of Hindu temples is also symbolic. The whole structure fuses the daily life and its surroundings with the divine concepts, through a structure that is open yet raised on a terrace, transitioning from the secular towards the sacred, inviting the visitor inwards and upwards towards the Brahma pada, the temple's central core, a symbolic space marked by its spire (shikhara, vimana). The ancient temples had grand, intricately carved entrances but no doors, and they lacked a boundary wall. In most cultures, suggests Edmund Leach, a boundary and gateway separates the secular and the sacred, and this gateway door is grand. In Hindu tradition, this is discarded in favor of an open and diffusive architecture, where the secular world was not separated from the sacred, but transitioned and flowed into the sacred. The Hindu temple has structural walls, which were patterned usually within the 64-grid, or other geometric layouts. Yet the layout was open on all sides, except for the core space with a single opening for darsana.  The temple space is laid out in a series of courts (mandapas). The outermost regions may incorporate the negative and suffering side of life with the symbolism of evil, asuras and rakshashas; but in small temples this layer is dispensed with. When present, this outer region diffuse into the next inner layer that bridges as human space, followed by another inner Devika padas space and symbolic arts incorporating the positive and joyful side of life about the good and the gods. This divine space then concentrically diffuses inwards and lifts the guest to the core of the temple, where resides the main murti,  as well as the space for the Purusa, and ideas held to be most sacred principles in Hindu tradition. The symbolism in the arts and temples of Hinduism, suggests Edmund Leach, is similar to those in Christianity and other major religions of the world.\n\nParagraph 8: Cross-country skiing: In a simple ceremony during the Norwegian national cross-country skiing championships at Lillehammer, skiers Thomas Alsgaard and Frode Estil finally get their Olympic gold medals won in the Pursuit race of the Salt Lake City 2002 Winter Olympics; the medals were awarded the two Norwegian skiers after Johann Mühlegg of Spain was found guilty of having used doping to win the race (see Cross-country skiing at the 2002 Winter Olympics). For the same reason, teammate Kristen Skjeldal gets his long-delayed bronze medal from the 30 km race (finishing fourth at race day, but ascending to third place after Mühlegg was disqualified). (NRK.no Sport|Ski) (in Norwegian)\n\nParagraph 9: As Miller's court-martial commenced on November 8, 1993, his defense attorney, Lieutenant Commander Wiliam C. Little, asked Vest to dismiss the charges because of unlawful command influence. As Little explained, by referring the charges against Miller, Kelso was acting as a command \"accuser.\" If Kelso, however, himself was present in the vicinity of the alleged sexual assaults and other lewd behavior, he would have had the same duty as the other defendants to intervene to stop the behavior in question. By appointing Reason, junior to him, to oversee the judicial process, he was shielding himself from prosecution. Therefore, the circumstances indicated that Kelso could not lawfully act as an accuser commander, since he himself might be involved in the same, or related, crimes. Vest replied that, if true, the defense had a legitimate concern and requested witnesses to give evidence on whether Kelso had been present on the night in question. A week later, Tritt's attorneys made the same motion on behalf of their client and asked Vest to join their case with Miller's, to which Vest agreed. On January 11, 1994, Samples' appeal for dismissal on the basis of immunity was denied and, on January 28, Vest granted Samples' defense attorneys' motion to join his case with those of Miller and Tritt on the Kelso question.\n\nParagraph 10: Raghava Rao, a noble school teacher, leads a happy family life with his ideal wife Janaki, two sons, and a daughter. Raghava Rao is transferred to his native village as a headmaster where he notices the children are completely undisciplined. He struggles hard and makes them straight including an impish boy Ramu who becomes his admirer and designates their school as ideal. Eventually, Raghava Rao's presence becomes a hurdle to the trespasses of school committee president Papa Rao, a fraudulent person. So, he sets fire to Raghava Rao's house when the school children unite together and built a house showing their adoration towards him. Years roll by, and Raghava Rao's children Satyam, Venu, and Lakshmi grew up, for their education, Raghava Rao forcibly takes a loan from Papa Rao. But they are not fair, Satyam marries Papa Rao's daughter Shanthi and Venu marries a rich girl Jaya without their parents' knowledge. After that, Raghava Rao strives hard, makes the marriage arrangements with a guy Pichaiah (Raja Babu), son of a miser Panakalu and for the expenses, hostages his house. During the time of marriage, Papa Rao lands and demands his debt, to keep up his honor Raghava Rao gives away the dowry amount. Learning it, Panakalu tries to stop the marriage, heretofore, it is completed. So, he takes a promissory note instead of a dowry and does not allow the couple to live together. Now the Raghava Rao couple is left alone, moreover, he retires when they have no other alternative except to live with their children. But their ungrateful children split the couple and leave the house for debts. Papa Rao brings it to auction when Ramu the old student of Raghava Rao purchases it. Meanwhile, the couple endures the separation, as well as horrible treatment from their children. Above Papa Rao reaches his daughter's house, attributes theft to Raghava Rao which he could not tolerate, and leaves the place. On the other side, Janakamma also abuses her daughter-in-law & her mother, so, she too proceeds. Both of them meet at the railway station, by that time, Papa Rao gives a police complaint, and Raghava Rao been arrested. Fortunately, there, Ramu appears as Police Officer who orders his men to take them to their village. Parallelly, Venu & Satyam realize their mistake, even Pichaiah teaches a lesson to his father, accompanies Lakshmi and all of them travel toward their parents. Therein, the Raghava Rao couple is surprised to see themselves in their house where Ramu gifts it to his beloved teacher. At last, Raghava Rao's children also arrive and seek their pardon. Finally, the movie ends on a happy note with the reunion of the entire family.\n\nParagraph 11: The story picks up where the previous fable left off, as the Cock returns safe and happy to his family (it's still unknown what his wives think about it, though it's hinted that they are relieved he survived at all), but the fox, Lawrence, was starving as he waits until nightfall before his next hunt. When it gets dark, Lawrence, though he never been to college, had been gifted with knowledge enough to foresee his own future and that of his descendants by astrology, and after seeing the bad omens that align the planets with unfitting constellations, Lawrence comes to realize that unless he or one of his descendants could repent and amend himself or wrongdoings, he and his family (as the fate of all foxes, but worse to compare) will be shamed forever with the \"cursed life of a thief\", which is said to be so horrible that it orphans each new generation as the last one is sentenced to death for a crime he didn't commit. Thinking himself a lost cause, Lawrence the fox, in the light of dawn, sees Friar Wolf Waitskaith and assumes that admitting sin in the presence of this assumingly holy man would help free himself. The friar Wolf is pleased as the fox admits to lying, stealing, adultery, and even exaggerates by mentioning murder (few as his successful hunting-and-killings may be). After that, Lawrence the fox, believing himself cleansed of his wrongs, fears doing so again, as he is from a povertous family, and is too proud to work or beg for his meals, but upon Friar Wolf suggesting he fast and eat nothing with flesh until Easter, Lawrence resorts to begging to be an exception to the custom. The friar granted it, but suggested that it would be only fish from the stream at least once or twice a week. Lawrence takes the advice gracefully, but then finds the new practice difficult as he has no net, pole, or boat to fish with properly, and so has to keep swiping at the water and missing his catch. Upon one of these unsuccessful fishing trips, the fox sees a fat lamb had strayed from the flock, and driven by hunger, he cannot resist pouncing on it. While the lamb survived the incident, the shepherd caught Lawrence the fox in the act of attempting to kill it, and although he said that he was \"only kidding\" and pleads he'd never do it again, the fox meets his end by a single, unmerciful blow from the shepherd. (the next story is the official beginning of Reynard's tale, as he faces trial for his father's sins.)\n\nParagraph 12: A Midrash interpreted the Israelites' encounter with Sihon in  and . Noting the report of  that \"Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, saying: ‘Let me pass through your land,'\" the Midrash taught that the Israelites sent messengers to Sihon just as they had to Edom to inform the Edomites that the Israelites would not cause Edom any damage. Noting the report of  that the Israelites offered Sihon, \"You shall sell me food for money . . . and give me water for money,\" the Midrash noted that water is generally given away for free, but the Israelites offered to pay for it. The Midrash noted that in , the Israelites offered, \"We will go by the king's highway,\" but in , the Israelites admitted that they would go \"until [they] shall pass over the Jordan,\" thus admitting that they were going to conquer Canaan. The Midrash compared the matter to a watchman who received wages to watch a vineyard, and to whom a visitor came and asked the watchman to go away so that the visitor could cut off the grapes from the vineyard. The watchman replied that the sole reason that the watchman stood guard was because of the visitor. The Midrash explained that the same was true of Sihon, as all the kings of Canaan paid Sihon money from their taxes, since Sihon appointed them as kings. The Midrash interpreted , which says, \"Sihon king of the Amorites, and Og king of Bashan, and all the kingdoms of Canaan,\" to teach that Sihon and Og were the equal of all the other kings of Canaan. So the Israelites asked Sihon to let them pass through Sihon's land to conquer the kings of Canaan, and Sihon replied that the sole reason that he was there was to protect the kings of Canaan from the Israelites. Interpreting the words of , \"and Sihon would not suffer Israel to pass through his border; but Sihon gathered all his people together,\" the Midrash taught that God brought this about designedly so as to deliver Sihon into the Israelites' hands without trouble. The Midrash interpreted the words of , \"Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon,\" to say that if Heshbon had been full of mosquitoes, no person could have conquered it, and if Sihon had been living in a plain, no person could have prevailed over him. The Midrash taught that Sihon thus would have been invincible, as he was powerful and dwelt in a fortified city. Interpreting the words, \"Who dwelt at Heshbon,\" the Midrash taught that had Sihon and his armies remained in different towns, the Israelites would have worn themselves out conquering them all. But God assembled them in one place to deliver them into the Israelites' hands without trouble. In the same vein, in  God said, \"Behold, I have begun to deliver up Sihon . . . before you,\" and  says, \"Sihon gathered all his people together,\" and  reports, \"And Israel took all these cities.\"\n\nParagraph 13: The badly damaged Guillaume Tell was taken in tow by Penelope, the only ship in any condition to remain at sea and arrived at Syracuse on 3 April. After being patched up she was sailed to Britain, arriving at Portsmouth on 23 November 1800. She was surveyed and fitted out there, a process completed by July 1801, during which time she was commissioned as HMS Malta in May under Captain Albemarle Bertie. She initially based in the roadstead off St Helens, but was damaged in a serious fire in April 1802 and was paid off for repairs.  After these were completed she recommissioned in March 1803,on the outbreak of war, under the command of Captain Edward Buller. Buller was temporarily replaced in January 1805 by Captain William Granger for service off Cadiz, but Buller was back in command in time to take part in Calder's Action off Cape Finisterre on 22 July 1805. Malta formed the rear-most ship in the British line in the approach to the battle, but as the fleets became confused in the failing light and thick patchy fog, Buller found that he was surrounded by five enemy ships. After a fierce engagement in which Malta suffered five killed and forty wounded, Buller forced the Spanish 84-gun San Rafael to strike, and afterwards sent the Maltas boats to take possession of the Spanish 74-gun Firme.Malta became the flagship of Rear-Admiral Sir Thomas Louis in August 1806, and was still serving with Louis' squadron when they were ordered to intercept a French force under Jean-Baptiste Philibert Willaumez that was expected to arrive in European waters from the Caribbean. On 27 September they came across the 44-gun French frigate Président, and after a pursuit, forced her to surrender. Malta departed for the Mediterranean on 5 January 1807 and spent the year participating in the blockade of Cadiz, with Buller being succeeded in command by Captain William Shield during the year. She blockaded Toulon in 1808, at first under Shield, and later under Captain Robert Otway. Returning home to Britain in December that year, she was paid off. Work began on a large repair at Plymouth in July 1809, after which she was fitted out for foreign service, a process completed by December 1811. She had recommissioned in September 1811 under the command of Captain Charles Paget to serve as the flagship of Rear-Admiral Sir Benjamin Hallowell in the Mediterranean. Malta sailed from Britain on 8 January 1812, and spent the next few years in the Mediterranean, passing under the command of Captain William Charles Fahie in January 1815. Fahie was in command of Malta when she took part in the successful attack on the Fortress of Gaeta during the July and August 1815.\n\nParagraph 14: McCarthy completed a move to West Ham United for an undisclosed fee on transfer deadline day, 1 February 2010. He signed a two and a half-year contract that was due to run until the summer of 2012. He made his Premier League debut for West Ham against Burnley at Turf Moor in a 2–1 defeat on 6 February 2010, where he sustained an injury which would keep him out for six weeks. In February 2011, having played just 326 minutes of football, making only three starts and failing to score any goals for West Ham, McCarthy was omitted from West Ham's 25-man squad for the remainder of the 2010–11 season. He was also offered a £1 million pay-off in exchange for terminating his contract prematurely. In April 2011, McCarthy left West Ham by mutual agreement after the parties agreed to terminate his contract.\n\nParagraph 15: In 2007, Cole published her first book, The cult of true victimhood: from the war on welfare to the war on terror. The book builds on the study of the rhetoric of victimization in American politics, in which the notion of victim is viewed as a useful device for the political establishment to translate failures of the system into individual faults with some group of people. Early writers on this topic include the psychologist William Ryan. Cole studies competing claims to victimhood in contemporary American politics, particularly claims on either side of the culture wars that began in the 1980s and 1990s regarding welfare, feminism, racism, and eventually the War on Terror that followed the September 11 attacks. The notion of victimhood maps naturally onto social groups because a particular set of people is claimed to be disadvantaged by the system, and it is politically salient because claims of victimhood often seek state remedies. Disagreements about victimhood can therefore cause inter-group conflicts through processes like identity politics. Cole argues that part of the source of this tension in the United States is the conflict between the idea of victimhood and the dominant American political culture: because liberal individualism is a fundamental virtue in American political identity, the notion of claiming to be a victim can be cast as pathetic and undeserving. Cole focuses on how \"anti-victimist\" figures like Charles Sykes, Robert Hughes, Shelby Steele, Alan Dershowitz and Dinesh D'Souza have used anti-victimhood rhetoric to undermine the credibility of those claiming to be victims of an unjust political system, which in turn positions those figures as victims of other peoples' professed victimhood. Conversely, Cole also studies the rejection of victimhood by some second-wave feminists, studying how authors like Naomi Wolf and Camille Paglia rejected the political tactic of identifying with victimhood as a means to accrue power by appearing powerless. Cole's study of victimhood has implications for understanding the right and left in American politics from the 1960s onwards, but primarily focuses on political disputes regarding multiculturalism, identity politics, and feminism during the 1990s, as well as how America was rhetorically cast as a victim to justify the country's response to the September 11 attacks. She also studies the implications of these rhetorical tools to policies including civil and criminal justice reform and the extent of the welfare state. In addition to The cult of true victimhood, Cole has also written about the political use of victimhood and vulnerability in peer-reviewed journal articles.\n\nParagraph 16: The acquisition closed on October 19, 2012, at which point Score Media's digital assets (the website theScore.com and associated mobile apps) were spun off into another company primarily owned by Score Media's previous shareholders, theScore Inc., in which Rogers Media retained a 10% interest. Score Media's television properties were immediately placed into a blind trust, under trustee Peter Viner, pending final CRTC approval. The operations of the digital properties and the television channel were separated at this point, with the latter operating a separate website (theScoreTV.ca - archived) for the interim period until the Rogers deal was approved. As part of CRTC requirements to spend 10% of the value of an acquisition on initiatives to strengthen the broadcasting industry, Rogers planned to fund the production of the Sportsnet Winter Games (which would have been an annual winter sports competition) and provide funding for the production of amateur sports programming. While Rogers planned to continue running The Score as a sports news service, it also requested that the CRTC ease some of the restrictions that were placed on the network in order to allow it to be more competitive with other Canadian sports channels. Namely, Rogers requested that it only be required to air one sports news update per-hour during live programming.\n\nParagraph 17: Ultimate X-Men was the second comic to debut as part of the Ultimate Marvel line, predated a few months by Ultimate Spider-Man.  Mark Millar reinvented the X-Men with the first X-Men film (which debuted seven months before) as his only reference.  The plot of \"The Tomorrow People\" was what Millar had in mind for the first X-Men film, and \"Return to Weapon X\" would have been the plot to the sequel. As in the film, Millar's original X-Men consisted of telepath Professor X, Cyclops (whose eyes shoot concussive beams) telepath/telekinetic Jean Grey, weather-manipulating Storm, simian genius Beast, metal-skinned Colossus, and cryokinetic Iceman. In its first year, the series was the best-selling comic book of 2001.\n\nParagraph 18: It is here that Kubovy introduced the influential concept of “the robustness of perspective, later summarized by Yang & Kubovy (1999) as follows: Viewed from the center of projection, a perspective picture presents the pictorial depth information of a scene. Knowing the center of projection, one can reconstruct the depicted scene. Assuming another viewpoint is the center of projection will cause one to reconstruct a transformed scene. Despite these transformations, we appreciate pictures from other viewpoints. Kubovy also argued against the influential claim advanced by Nelson Goodman (in Languages of Art) that all visual experience (including perception of perspectival representations) was merely a convention. In his polemic against Goodman's notion that geometric rules of pictorial representation are established by consensus, Kubovy argued thatgeometry does not rule supreme in the Land of Perspective [...] In fact, if in the Land of Perspective geometry plays a role analogous to the role played by Congress in the United States, then perception has the function of the Constitution. Whatever is prescribed by the geometry of central projection is tested against its acceptability to perception. If a law is unconstitutional, it is rejected and must be rewritten to accord with perception. (p. 125)The book received multiple accolades, described by Ernst Gombrich as \"excellent,\" and by Samuel Egerton, Jr. as a volume \"full of tantalizing observations which students of word and image will find endlessly applicable.\" The American philosopher and cultural critic David Carrier of Carnegie Mellon University summarized Kubovy's work as follows:This clearly written, well illustrated book provides the best introduction I have read to the central problems [of perspective]. Starting with a highly original interpretation of Mantegna's Archers Shooting at Saint Christopher in which, Kubovy argues, the arrow entering the eye of the watching king is a metaphor for the art of perspective, he offers an account of Brunelleschi's pioneering experimentation with perspective, trompe l'oeil baroque ceilings, the effects of seeing perspectival pictures from 'off-center' positions, the highly complex perspective of Leonardo's Last Supper, and critique of Nelson Goodman's claim that perspective is merely a convention. This wide-ranging study combines art historical observations, appeal to experimental psychology and concern with the philosophical literature in a text which is at once erudite and not needlessly difficult to read.The book was translated into several languages, including Italian (as La freccia nell'occhio in 1992) and Spanish (as Psicología de la perspectiva y el arte del Renacimiento in 1996). The title of the Italian translation (which means \"The arrow in the eye\") reflects Kubovy's original choice of the book title, disfavored by the English publisher.\n\nParagraph 19: The Weinstein Company also heavily recast the film with bigger-name actors in the hopes of attracting a larger audience. Anne Hathaway replaced Tara Strong in the lead role of Red; Jim Belushi replaced David Ogden Stiers in the role of Kirk, the Woodsman; Anthony Anderson replaced Tony Leech in the role of Det. Bill Stork; Glenn Close replaced Sally Struthers in the role of Granny Puckett; Xzibit replaced Joel McCrary in the role of Chief Grizzly and Chazz Palminteri replaced Tom Kenny in the role of Woolworth the Sheep. Opining that the final steps in character design were really fleshed out when the actors were hired, Hooten felt that Hathaway put some edge that was missing on Red, making her more sarcastic, sassy and quick. Anderson accepted the role of Bill Stork given his past experience as voice actor and his previous collaborations with the Weinsteins in Scary Movie 3 and My Baby's Daddy, wanting to do something that his children and godchildren could watch and enjoy. Palminteri was called to be offered the part of Woolworth the Sheep, which he accepted as found the script hilarious. Despite these recastings, Tara Strong retained the much smaller role of Zorra, David Ogden Stiers retained the role of Nicky Flippers, Tom Kenny retained the role of Tommy and Tony Leech retained the role of Glen. Many high-profile country singers were considered to replace Benjy Gaither in the role of Japeth, but none of them were available and Gaither retained the role. The Weinsteins also wanted to replace Joshua J. Greene in the role of Jimmy Lizard with a more famous actor such as Albert Brooks, but the role was ultimately not recast. Edwards appreciated the reason for the recastings and attributed a large part of the film's financial success to them. He expressed disappointment about the amount of recasting, however, saying, \"At a certain point it became Recast-o-Rama, everybody got recast-happy. My feeling is, you get two or three names on that poster, you're fine. Our Hoodwinked poster has like a paragraph of names on it. After a certain point, I don't think you need more than two, three celebrities—give it to the voice actors. It sweetens the pot\". Since the film's animation had already been mostly completed by the time the recastings were made, the new actors had to deliver their lines exactly as the old actors had done, giving them no opportunity to improvise. Edwards expressed disappointment with the fact that the original actors would not get any credit for their improvisations in the film, which were copied by the replacement actors.\n\nParagraph 20: This chapter is composed entirely of letters from other people writing to Daisy. Barker Flett dies of a malignant brain tumor at the age of seventy two. Niece Beverley, a former WREN in World War II, comes to live in Ottawa after getting pregnant. Daisy takes over her late husband's gardening column in the local paper as \"Mrs. Green Thumb\" and her oldest daughter goes off to college. Cuyler Goodwill dies and his widow Maria disappears. Daisy visits her two childhood friends 'Fraidy' and 'Beans' and dates her editor Jay Dudley until he callously informs her that her gardening column has been taken over by a full-timer.\n\nParagraph 21: The Schweizer Aircraft Corporation was an American manufacturer of sailplanes, agricultural aircraft and helicopters located in Horseheads, New York. It was incorporated in 1939 by three Schweizer brothers (Paul, William, and Ernest), who built their first glider, the SGP 1-1, in 1930. Previously the oldest privately owned aircraft company in the United States, Schweizer was acquired by Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation of Stratford, Connecticut in 2004, and became a diversified aerospace company. Schweizer Aircraft ceased operations in 2012. It was sold to Schweizer R.S.G. in 2018 and production lines were opened again in Fort Worth, Texas. The company was producing three helicopter models in 2021.\n\nParagraph 22: Maila Nurmi was born to Onni Niemi (earlier Syrjäniemi), a Finnish immigrant, and Sophia Peterson, an American of Finnish descent. Her place of birth was at one time disputed: According to biographer W. Scott Poole in Vampira: Dark Goddess of Horror (2014), she was born in Gloucester, Massachusetts. During her career, she claimed to have been born in Petsamo, Finland, claiming she was the niece of Finnish athlete Paavo Nurmi, who began setting long-distance running world records in 1921, the year before her birth. Public U.S. immigration records show her father's immigration at Ellis Island in 1910. Additionally, Dana Gould claimed in a 2014 public interview that he had seen Nurmi's birth certificate, which listed her birthplace as Gloucester, Massachusetts. In her personal diary, Nurmi admitted the Petsamo story was fiction.\n\nParagraph 23:  In Smallville, Lieutenant General Sam Lane appeared in the second and third episodes of Season 4 portrayed by Michael Ironside. When Chloe Sullivan and her father were put in protective custody, Lex Luthor managed to get General Lane in to shield her from the blast when they got into the \"safe\" house. In the fourth season episode \"Lucy\", it is noted that \"the General\" (as both his daughters call him) was unable to cope with raising his daughters alone after the death of his wife. He modeled his parenting on that of his Army career where he implemented a chain of command. He was in charge of Lois and Lois was in charge of Lucy. Both his daughters resented their father for this. At the end of the episode, he sent Lois to Europe in order to locate his younger daughter Lucy, but it is unclear if the efforts were successful. In subsequent episodes, Lane has been casually referenced by other characters. Chloe states that General Lane provided her with covert surveillance equipment in \"Mortal\". With it, she helps Clark Kent infiltrate the LuthorCorp building and rescue his family. In the sixth-season episode \"Prototype\", Lois told Clark and Chloe that Wes Keenan was the only soldier that the General ever respected. Ironside reprised his role as the General (now a four-star General) in the Season 10 episode \"Ambush\", where Clark becomes the first person to pass the \"tests\" the General has arranged for Lois's previous boyfriends. General Lane reveals that he gave the list of chores to Lois' boyfriends to test her, not them, and Clark is the only one that Lois has ever stood up for, which proves she loves him. The two bond despite their initial disagreement over General Lane's role in the Vigilante Registration Act, which makes him a target of the Suicide Squad and Rick Flag, before dispatched. As seen on his uniform, General Lane is a recipient of the Silver Star.\n\nParagraph 24: Like his neighbor Archie Bunker, George Jefferson was frequently opinionated, rude, bigoted, prone to scheming and not particularly intelligent in a scholastic sense, but still a loving, hard-working father and husband. Unlike Archie, however, George was quicker thinking, and usually cleverer. Frequently, plots in The Jeffersons revolved around George's usually dishonest schemes, which always ended in comedic failure. In the Season 3 episode \"A Case of Black and White\", George schemes to obtain a new client (a mixed-race couple) by inviting them and the Willises (also a mixed-race couple) to dinner. When the Willises realize that George is using them, they leave before the new client shows up. This makes George bribe Florence the maid and Ralph the doorman into pretending to be the Willises. Eventually the Willises return, and by pretending to be Florence and Ralph, they help George land the client, while trapping George into throwing them an extravagant anniversary party. In the episode \"George and Jimmy\" George's big-mouthed attempts to invite US President Jimmy Carter to his home as a publicity stunt backfires with George almost being arrested by the US Secret Service. In another episode \"George and the Manager\" George's refusal to hire any woman to be the manager of his cleaning store results in 1] A qualified African American woman refusing to work for George under any circumstances 2] a qualified white woman employee quits so she can work at George's biggest competitor, Cunningham Cleaners 3] Louise and Mother Jefferson allied with one another against George's sexist attitude. In the last episode of the series \"Red Robins\", George's dishonest \"business advice\" to his granddaughter Jessica Jefferson and her \"Red Robins\" girl scout troop about selling their uneatable candy results in the girls losing a chance at a scout Jamboree and Louise Jefferson scolding George soundly.", "answers": ["Paragraph 24"], "length": 6938, "dataset": "passage_retrieval_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "923e80008e2cfe06d0f669a635a78abbc816e81c3b1bb4bf"}
{"input": "Dave Wilson Nursery is a family-owned and operated corporation that has been in existence since 1938. It is the largest wholesale grower of fruit trees for home gardens in the United States. The nursery specializes in growing deciduous fruit, nut, and shade trees, producing over two million trees annually. Its growing grounds are located near Hickman, California, while its regional office and variety test block are situated in Reedley, California. The nursery is recognized for being the primary licensee and propagator of new fruit varieties developed by Zaiger's Genetics, which includes popular fruits like the Pluot and the Aprium.", "context": "Paragraph 1: The hamlet of Port Republic, Virginia, lies on a neck of land between the North and South Rivers, which conjoin to form the South Fork Shenandoah River. On June 6–7, 1862, Jackson's army, numbering about 16,000, bivouacked north of Port Republic, Maj. Gen. Richard S. Ewell's division along the banks of Mill Creek near Goods Mill, and Brig. Gen. Charles S. Winder's division on the north bank of North River near the bridge. The 15th Alabama Infantry regiment was left to block the roads at Union Church. Jackson's headquarters were in Madison Hall at Port Republic. The army trains were parked nearby.\n\nParagraph 2: Narc (stylized as NARC) is a 1988 run and gun arcade game designed by Eugene Jarvis for Williams Electronics and programmed by George Petro, Todd Allen, and Eugene Jarvis, with art by Jack Haeger, John Newcomer, and Lin Young. It was one of the first ultra-violent video games and a frequent target of parental criticism of the video game industry. The object is to arrest and kill drug offenders, confiscate their money and drugs, and defeat \"Mr. Big\". It was the first game in the newly restarted Williams Electronics coin-op video game division.  Shortly before its release, Williams acquired the video and pinball divisions of Bally/Midway.\n\nParagraph 3: When Abdul Qadir was unsuccessful against India in 1987 and Iqbal Qasim rejoined the team, Tauseef ended up joining the latter at Bangalore. India's defensive approach was based on playing the waiting game on slow turners, expecting the inexperienced Pakistani batting line-up (with just Imran and Miandad having played more than 30 tests) to crumble at some point . For four tests, they waited until at Bangalore, Kapil Dev, having led India to two 2–0 wins (against England (away) and against Sri Lanka (at home), came under immense pressure to get a result. Both captains misread the wicket: Pakistanis played the left-arm fast-bowler Saleem Jaffer who would not bowl a ball in the match. Imran won the toss and batted and Tauseef's glorious run began; he scored a crucial unbeaten 15 in the first innings enabling Pakistanis to cross 100 and then sparked the fightback by bowling Krish Srikkanth and Sunil Gavaskar through the gate that very day. Pakistanis, after getting bowled out for just 116, in spun India out for just 145 with both Tauseef and Iqbal Qasim getting five wickets each. In the second innings, Tauseef's all-round skills reached a peak when he was part of the only 50-run partnership of the match, his own share being just 10, as Pakistanis set India a target of 221 to win. That day would end with Tauseef firing out Dilip Vengsarkar and Kiran More. The next day, Pakistanis, hunting for the remaining six wickets, got four through Iqbal Qasim, including that of the threatening Sunil Gavaskar, before Tauseef's sharp-spinning off break went through Shivlal Yadav's defences. Roger Binny hit back with a massive six of Tauseef who was surprised when Imran handed the ball to him to have another go. He did and so did Binny and could only manage an inside edge to Saleem Yousuf who gobbled it up to give Pakistanis their first-ever test series win in India. As in the first test, Tauseef had shared 18 wickets with Iqbal Qasim except that this time round, both had nine each with crucial runs to boot.\n\nParagraph 4: The Panthers came away with a 36–33, four-overtime victory after falling behind Notre Dame by two touchdowns, 17–3, at halftime. Conor Lee made the game-winning field goal, one of four overtime fields goals, during his perfect, 5-for-5 day to help lead the Panthers. His five field goals and 18 points are both Pitt records for a kicker; he also extended his school record of consecutive extra points without a miss to 100. LeSean McCoy lead the way on offense with 32 rushing attempts for 169 yards, his 5th straight 100-yard game, and one touchdown as he surpassed 1,000 yards rushing for the season; he also had two catches for 23 yards. The Panthers fell behind in the first half when Notre Dame controlled the clock and took advantage of poor play by Pitt on offense. Quarterbacks Kevan Smith and Pat Bostick, who were playing in place of the injured started Bill Stull, who suffered a concussion in the previous game, were ineffective in the first half, and the running game couldn't get going as McCoy had only 5 yards on 3 carries. In total, the offense only had 71 yards and five first downs in the entire first half. The offense got back on track in the 2nd half as the Panthers scored 10 straight points to tie the game at 17. The Panthers first possession of the 3rd quarter went eight plays and 71 yards, including a converted fourth-and-one pass that Oderick Turner turned into a 37-yard gain. The Panthers next touchdown came on a 15-play, 70-yard drive that used 8:28 of time during the end of the 3rd and beginning of the 4th quarters. Pat Bostick, although he was intercepted three times in the game, persevered and stepped up his play in the second half, leading the Panthers on three critical scoring drives. After the game Bostick, speaking of his own performance, said, \"\"I came out and made some mistakes out there, forced a couple of things, made a couple of plays. We made enough plays to win though and this was a total team win... But the bottom line is we are here to win a football game and when you throw picks, it is not about you, you can't say 'Woe is me.' It is all about, 'What do I have to do on the next drive to take this team down the field to win the game?'\" The Panthers defense, led again by linebacker Scott McKillop with 15 tackles, played significantly better than in the week before, allowing only one big play versus the Irish's offense, a 47-yard pass from Jimmy Clausen to Golden Tate. They also held Notre Dame to only 146 yards in the second half and all four overtimes, including just seven yards on three three-and-out possessions in the third quarter. (Game report)\n\nParagraph 5: After two shorts, Nasce un campione (1954) and I sette contadini (1959), Petri made his debut as a director with L'assassino The lady killer of Rome, 1961) based on a script co-authored with Tonino Guerra.His Days Are Numbered (I giorni contati, 1962), was his second film, again co-authored with Tonino Guerra. After two somewhat lesser films The Teacher from Vigevano (Il maestro di Vigevano, 1963) and the sketch Sin in the afternoon, included in High Infidelity (Alta infedeltà, 1964). Petri directed The 10th Victim (La decima vittima, 1965), a film with futuristic overtones also co-authored with Tonino Guerra. His film We Still Kill the Old Way (A ciascuno il suo, 1967) was adapted from the novel To Each His Own by Leonardo Sciascia), which deals with the individual's inability to cope with reality. The film was also the beginning of the collaboration with the script-writer Ugo Pirro which was to last until 1973.A Quiet Place in the Country (Un tranquillo posto di campagna, 1968), the last of his films co-authored with Guerra, focuses on solitude and the artist's romantic agony. The film won a Silver Bear award at the 19th Berlin International Film Festival. He then directed four films which earned him recognition for his analysis of schizophrenia. Investigation of a Citizen Above Suspicion (Indagine su un cittadino al di sopra di ogni sospetto, 1970) was about the police-force. The Working Class Goes to Heaven (La classe operaia va in paradiso, 1971) focused on the worker's condition. Property Is No Longer a Theft (La proprietà non è più un furto, 1973) emphasized the role of money in our society and how power destroys the individual. Todo modo (1976), which was adapted from the eponymous novel by Leonardo Sciascia, is about the warped psychic structure of the power moguls among the Christian Democrats. Investigation of a Citizen Above Suspicion won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film.\n\nParagraph 6: Luby, drawing on both archival and oral sources, presents the history of the local Anishinaabe population at the Dalles 38C from the second half of the twentieth century, when the Winnipeg River was first dammed at Kenora to power a paper and pulp mill, through to the 1960s, when the construction of the Whitedog Falls hydroelectric generating station further upstream was completed. Luby argues that even after settler-colonial encroachment the Anishinaabe were socially and economically sustainable at Dalles 38C; however, the damming of the Winnipeg River, seen as key to the modernization of Kenora and Ontario, degraded the local environment and undermined the local Anishinaabe society.\n\nParagraph 7: Like all cormorants, this bird has webbed feet and sturdy legs that propel it through the water as it seeks its prey of fish, small octopuses, and other little marine creatures. The species feeds near the sea floor and no more than 200 metres offshore. The flightless cormorants look slightly like a duck, except for their short, stubby wings. The upperparts are blackish, and the underparts are brown. The long beak is hooked at the tip and the eye is turquoise. Like all members of the cormorant family, all four toes are joined by webbed skin. Males and females are similar in appearance, although males are larger and ca. 35% heavier. Juveniles generally resemble adults but differ in that they are glossy black in colour with a dark eye.

The 2002 ceremony was held at Halifax's Pier 21 to mark the 50th anniversary of Canadian Governors General, but the most common reason for the insignia not being presented at Rideau Hall is the recipient's inability to travel to Ottawa. An early example of this occurred in 1980 when activist athlete Terry Fox was dying of terminal cancer. A more recent example occurred in 2003 with singer-songwriter Gordon Lightfoot: in 2002, shortly before a concert, Lightfoot suffered a serious abdominal hemorrhage that resulted in his being in a coma for a time and months in hospital recovering. On the news of his near-death condition, Lightfoot was promoted to the rank of Companion. Since his condition left him unable to travel, Adrienne Clarkson flew to Toronto and presented him with the insignia in a private ceremony performed in his hospital room. Similarly, in 2000 Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother, at the age of 100, was invested as an Honorary Companion at Clarence House in London. Rather than place the insignia on the Queen Mother, who was recovering from a hip replacement, Clarkson handed Her Majesty her badge. Her Majesty made a point of wearing it around her neck at a special lunch following the private ceremony. Inductions can also be delegated to another individual, such as a Lieutenant Governor, as was the case when Mervyn Wilkinson was inducted into the order by Iona Campagnolo, the then Lieutenant Governor of British Columbia, in 2002. Investitures can also be delayed, such as in the case of Wayne Gretzky, who was appointed to the grade of Officer in 1984 for his outstanding contributions to the game of ice hockey. However, as the ceremonies always conflicted with his hockey schedule, it was not until over 13 years, and two governors general, later that Gretzky could personally be invested into the order.  The longest delay between appointment and investiture was the 23-year delay of W. Bruce Hutchison. Hutchison was appointed in July 1967, but did not attend the investiture ceremony until April 1990 \n\nParagraph 9: AngelHeaded Hipster : The Songs of Marc Bolan & T. Rex (2020) is a compilation album that pays tribute to 2020 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductee Marc Bolan and his group T. Rex, although the songs included on the album cover both the T. Rex and the earlier Tyrannosaurus Rex eras.  Willner relates in the notes to the album that he was exposed to the Tyrannosaurus Rex albums A Beard Of Stars and Unicorn in the early 1970s while still in high school, and later to the seminal Glam Rock album Electric Warrior by the by-then T. Rex. Decades later, BMG approached Willner to produce a tribute album to Marc as a composer, and AngelHeaded Hipster is the result. The double CD and vinyl album includes performances by Kesha, Nick Cave, Joan Jett, Devendra Banhart, Lucinda Williams, Peaches, BORNS, Beth Orton, King Khan, Gaby Moreno, U2 and Elton John, John Cameron Mitchell, Emily Haines, Father John Misty, Perry Farrell, Elysian Fields, Gavin Friday, Nena, Marc Almond, Helga Davis, Todd Rundgren, Jesse Harris, Sean Lennon and Charlotte Kemp Muhl, Victoria Williams and Julian Lennon, David Johanson, and Maria McKee.  The album was released in September 2020, following Willner's death from COVID-19 related symptoms in April 2020.\n\nParagraph 10: Dave Wilson Nursery is the largest wholesale grower of fruit trees for the home garden in the United States. It’s afamily-owned and operated nursery established in 1938, and now a corporation. It is one of the largest growers of deciduous fruit, nut and shade trees in the USA, farming more than  on a four-year rotation, growing more than two million trees a year. Its growing grounds are east of Modesto, California, near Hickman, California; and its regional office and variety test block are situated east of Reedley, California. The nursery, says its website, is the primary licensee and propagator (in the United States) of new fruit varieties developed by Zaiger's Genetics, including the Pluot and the Aprium.\n\nParagraph 11:  The spokesperson for the , , charges that the PRO process was introduced by the executive board in a \"hush-hush operation\" () without a resolution from the General Assembly—and which just happened to benefit the members of the executive board, including its chairman at the time, Otto Krause. He accused him of exploitation and personal enrichment, because he sometimes collected sums that were 100 times the incoming licensing fees collected for his old Schlager songs, while rock musicians only earned 10% of the licensing fees their music earned. Furthermore, he claimed that a statistics professor that had been appointed to assess the rationale for the distribution process had had absolutely no expertise in the field of live music and was deliberately misinformed by the executive board. Furthermore, a 2005 verdict by the federal court demanded that the PRO process be subject to a vote by the membership, which has yet to occur. Seelenmeyer also sharply criticized the term \"solidarity principle\" (), arguing that it disguises and sugarcoats a planned- and intentionally-unfair distribution process. He cited the former chairman of the GEMA board of directors , who wrote regarding the introduction of the PRO process that, \"For an extrapolation process heavily impacting the income distribution of members to be introduced without a membership resolution is simply intolerable and furthermore against regulations, according to the opinion of many legal experts.\" Evers further charged: \"This paternalism would rob GEMA members of their voting rights regarding an essential domain of their assets. They are almost being deprived of their right of decision by their own trustees!\" Evers demanded that: \"The only way that the executive board and directorial board can get out of this crisis of confidence that has arisen through the patronization of members lies in the immediate dismissal of the PRO process and the development of a new process with the participation and approval of its members!\"\n\nParagraph 12: Chinese money trees (Traditional Chinese: 搖錢樹; Simplified Chinese: 摇钱树; Pinyin: yáo qián shù), or shengxianshu, (\"immortal ascension trees\"), are tree-like assemblies of charms, with the leaves made from numismatic charm replicas of cash coins. These money trees should not be with coin trees which are a by-product of the manufacture of cash coins, but due to their similarities it is thought by some experts that they may have been related. Various legends from China dating to the Three Kingdoms period mention a tree that if shaken would cause coins to fall from its branches. Money trees as a charm have been found in Southwest Chinese tombs from the Han dynasty, and are believed to have been placed there to help guide the dead to the afterlife and provide them with monetary support. According to one myth, a farmer watered the money tree seed with his sweat and watered its sapling with his blood, after which the mature tree provided eternal wealth; this implies a moral that one can only become wealthy through their own toil. Literary sources claim that the origin of the money tree lies with the Chinese word for \"copper\" (銅, tóng) which is pronounced similar to the word for \"the Paulownia tree\" (桐, tóng). The leaves of the Paulownia become yellow in autumn and take on the appearance of gold or bronze cash coins. Chen Shou (陳壽) mentions in the Records of the Three Kingdoms that a man named Bing Yuan (邴原) walked upon a string of cash coins while strolling and, unable to discover the owner, hung it in a nearby tree; other passersby noticed this string and began hanging coins in the tree with the assumption that it was a holy tree and made wishes for wealth and luck. The earliest money trees, however, date to the Han dynasty in present-day Sichuan and a Taoist religious order named the Way of the Five Pecks of Rice. Archeoloigsts uncovered money trees as tall as , decorated with many strings of cash coins, little bronze dogs, bats, Chinese deities, elephants, deer, phoenixes, and dragons, with a bronze frame and a base of pottery. Both the inscriptions and calligraphy found on Chinese money trees match those of contemporary Chinese cash coins, which typically featured replicas of Wu Zhu (五銖) coins during the Han dynasty while those from the Three Kingdoms period had inscriptions such as \"Liang Zhu\" (兩銖).\n\nParagraph 13: The main feature change was support for Microsoft's 64-bit operating system, however support for Banyan VINES was also dropped from this version of MDAC. There were several known issues: MDAC 2.7 continued causing connectivity problems on clustered servers running Microsoft SQL Server 6.5 or SQL Server 7.0, with no workaround provided by Microsoft. When creating or configuring ODBC data source names (DSNs) using the Microsoft SQL Server ODBC driver the network library protocol might unexpectedly switch to TCP/IP, even if the DSN was configured to use named pipes. This issue was found by InfoWorld reporter Randall C. Kennedy, who identified that the change was actually made in MDAC 2.6 but was never documented. It was discovered when testing client/server database workloads on a Windows XP computer; InfoWorld claims that although overall server CPU utilization rose by only 8 percent using TCP/IP, context switches per second dropped by more than 150 percent (which is of course impossible because you would then have a negative context switch rate - the drop is either 33% or 60% depending on which planet the author was on at the time of writing) for a 10-user workload. They were unimpressed that a fundamental functional change to the default behaviour of Net-Lib occurred without more than a passing mention in an unrelated document. Windows XP users also sometimes experienced problems connecting to SQL Server because SQL Server attempts to use certificates it finds on the local computer, however if there is more than one certificate available it did not know which one to use. When attempting to use Microsoft Analysis Services 2000 RTM, an error would sometimes appear when trying to browse cubes. Microsoft also discovered a problem in Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows Me's setup program which prevented the MDAC installation program from rolling back when it encountered an installation error.\n\nParagraph 14: Caan • Caan van Neck  • De la Bassecour Caan  • Caarten • Van Calcar • Van Calker • Sharpe van Calker • Van Kalker • Calkoen • van Beeck Calkoen • Callenbach • Callenfels • Van der Beke Callenfels • Van Stein Callenfels • Von Stein Callenfels • Carnbier • Camp (Geertruidenberg) • Camp ('s-Hertogenbosch) • Van Campen •  Del Campo genaamd Camp • Van Lookeren Campagne • Cankrien • Cannegieter • Hoornsma Cannegieter • Reen Cannegieter • Schrader Cannegieter • Canneman • Cantzlaar • Capadose • Van Capelle • Carbasius • Cardinaal • Carp • De Carpentier • Carsten • Star Nauta Carsten • Van Casteel • Castendijk • Ten Cate • Naudin ten Cate • Cats • Lichtenvoort Cats • Manger Cats • Van Cattenburch • Casteren van Cattenburch • Van Panhuys van Cattenburch  • Cau • Cazaux • Cazius • Certon • Rigail Certon • Chabot • Taudin Chabot • Van Charante • Boss van Charante • Mensing van Charante • Moll van Charante • Watson van Charante • Charbon • De Chaufepie • de Dompierre de Chaufepie • Clant • Clant van der Mijll • Clant Schatter • Van Rijneveld Clant • Clarion • Clavareau • Clement • Van der Poest Clement • De Clercq (N.-Brabant) • Van der Lek de Clercq • De Clercq (Vlaanderen) • Cleveringa • Cleyndert • Cleijndert • De Jong Cleijndert • Clifford • Oetgens van Waveren Pancras Clifford • Pancras Clifford • Du Cloux • Alting du Cloux • Lincklaan du Cloux • Cluysenaer • Cnopius • Coenen • Cohen • Cohen Stuart • Coldeweij • Colenbrander • Van Berck Colenbrander • Van Hecking Colenbrander • Collard • Colthoff • Rom Colthoff • De Coningh • Van Assendelft de Coningh • Van Vrijberghe de Coningh • Conrad • Cool (Appingedam) • Cool (Overschie) • Coops • Coops Busgers • Van de Coppello • Kappeyne van de Coppello • Cordelois • Cordes • Corstius • Brandt Corstius • Corten • Coster • Costerman • Costerus • Couperus • Del Court • Couvee • Sauerbier Couvee • Cox • Craandijk • Van der Crab • Cramer (Ootmarsum) • Cramer (Rijnland) • Cramer (Westfalen) • Putman Cramer • Cramer von Baumgarten • Cramerus • De Crane • Van Cranenburgh • Cremer • Cremers • Canter Cremers • Hooftman Canter Cremers • Pathuis Cremers • Creutzberg • Creyghton • Criellaert • Croiset • Crol • Crommelin • Van Wickevoort Crommelin • Croockewit • Crull • Hofstede Crull • Cruys • Cunaeus • Gael Cunaeus\n\nParagraph 15: Tom Buckley of The New York Times wrote, \"The complications begin amusingly enough, but tend to become tiresome and predictable well before the movie is over. Even so, 'The Cat From Outer Space' is likely to keep the under-14's amused, at least if supplemented by plenty of popcorn.\" Variety wrote, \"The fun, as usual with Disney pix, comes in the believable sight gags provided along the way. Also as usual, it's a good cast of veterans and nothing to tax them beyond their abilities, all ably kept in place by director Norman Tokar. The aerial climax is especially good.\" Linda Gross of the Los Angeles Times described the film as \"successful G-rated family fare\" but \"at one hour, 43 minutes is too long, particularly the jeopardy situation involving the midair transfer of Duncan and her cat from a pilotless helicopter to another plane.\" Judith Martin of The Washington Post wrote, \"This is not exactly inspiring material, but it is harmless enough — unless the child expects you to sit through it with him.\" Martyn Auty of The Monthly Film Bulletin stated, \"Putatively aimed at the junior end of the s-f market, this 'Close Encounter of the 'Furred' Kind' is a distinctly earthbound Disney adventure film, in which magical technology is harnessed to foiling villains and rescuing heroines, human and feline. For all that, The Cat from Outer Space displays its visual trickery ingeniously and more or less reverently within the caper-comedy narrative.\"\n\nParagraph 16:  Church of San Giovanni Battista, church of the parish of Caldogno. As evidenced by the discovery made in the early seventies during the arrangement of the heating system, the church has undergone several reconstructions throughout history. Dating is difficult since there are no graffiti or decorative elements and the bricks with which the walls are made are both well-shaped and squared (index of a florid period) and rough and mixed clay (typical instead of poorer periods), although it is certainly before the little church of San Michele, whose origin seems to date back to the second half of the seventh century. The lowest level, in fact, corresponds to the fifth century and had the apse to the east; the next level is from the sixth century and the upper one from the tenth century. During the XVI and XVII centuries it was modified several times until 1648, when it was totally rebuilt. The work led to the reconstruction of the high altar and the purchase of the tabernacle, still present today, with the two angels on the sides and two other smaller ones that have been lost. The facade was rebuilt buying the five statues still present today. The church was damaged during the Napoleonic raids, giving way to the church built in 1818. The present structure originates from the central nave, built in 1818, which was the church of that time and was enlarged in the first half of the 20th century by a design of Ferruccio Cattaneo.  The structure was often modified during the 20th century both to expand and restore it, especially after the Friuli earthquake in 1976. In 1990 a new pavement was laid, which brought to the same level the three naves designed by Cattaneo in the early twentieth century. Inside there is the tomb containing the bones of Felice Ponso, parish priest of Caldogno from 1901 to 1908. The entire ceiling of the nave is painted with a series of four frescoes representing four important stages in the life of the patron saint Saint John the Baptist. Near the entrance there is the annunciation to Zacharias of the birth of his son, in the centre of the nave is depicted the birth, in the third panel the figure of John the Baptist and above the presbytery the image of the banquet during which Salomè received on a silver tray the head of the one who blamed her and her mother for the sins committed: John the Baptist. The author of this work, in 1839, seems to be Giuseppe Poppini of Schio whose signature, however, is present only in the last box. In the baptistery there is a canvas depicting the Baptism of Christ by Giuseppe Poppini.\n\nParagraph 17: Florencia Fazzarino, an orphan girl who tries to live and works in a greengrocery store, dedicating her free time to her friends in the band. When the singer leaves, Florencia takes her place in the group and they get a presentation at the party organized by the brothers Nicolás Fritzenwalden and Maia Fritzenwalden in their mansion. There his destiny will be united forever to that of that family. On the other hand, Federico Fritzenwalden, the older brother of the family, has to return from Germany in order to take over the family business and his four brothers who have been orphaned by parents. His arrival coincides with the party that his brothers have organized without his consent and there he meets Florencia among the foam and unable to recognize it. Soon clashes between him, serious and responsible with his little brothers will begin. And after the escape of the minor named Tomás there will be numerous misunderstandings that will eventually lead Florencia to the mansion to work as a nanny. In the mansion Florencia will win everyone's love. When Malala and Delfina learn that Florencia is not the biological daughter of Eduardo Fazzarino but Alberto Santillán they do the impossible so that Florencia does not find out. They create multiple situations that will face Delfina and Florencia but leaving Federico in between. However, Federico will always prefer Florencia. Finally, Florencia finds out but Delfina seems to have never known and Malala makes several excuses to avoid Florencia claiming her inheritance and being ruined. Florencia falls madly in love with Federico. Being reciprocated by him, they begin a very beautiful and secret love, which becomes impossible when the evil stepsister Delfina makes Federico believe she is pregnant. Then this is the cause of a very serious illness the gynecologist Claudio Bonilla and the real husband of Delfina named Lorenzo who pretends to be a Chinese doctor so that everyone thinks she is sick. There Florencia convinces Federico to marry Delfina to give her happiness before her death. Already at the altar, Federico humiliates her before everyone by refusing to marry her and announcing that he loves Florencia. They rejoin but their love has a tragic turn after Federico's heroic death in a car accident since he interposed to save the life of Conde Máximo Augusto Calderón de la Hoya. Federico will have time to say goodbye to his great, unique and painful love and leave his brothers in charge of Conde Máximo Augusto Calderón de la Hoya. Thus ends the season with the meeting in the foam of Florencia and Conde Máximo Augusto Calderón de la Hoya as happened when she and Federico met. Finally, all this happens when Federico leaves the body of Conde Máximo Augusto Calderón de la Hoya to go definitively to heaven.\n\nParagraph 18: During the 1950s several politicians involved in the West Indies Federation again broached an idea of political association with Canada.  One proposal from the Caribbean heads was for the West Indies Federation to first become a fully functional unit and following five years time the bloc should look at obtaining dominion status with Britain and possibly move to seek political association with Canada at that time.  The Canadian government presented the new government of the West Indies Federation with two merchant ships. The twin ships named The Federal Palm and The Federal Maple sailed to all ports between Jamaica in the north and Trinidad and Tobago in the south and were a key aspect of building trade links between the islands.  Several meetings continued to take place in the Caribbean region and in Ottawa to formulate the structure and exact form of the future political association with Canada, but a constant occurrence in the Federation of haggling between the heads of governments stymied the movement.  After 4 years, the entire West Indies Federation unraveled when Jamaica left, with the head of Jamaica publicly claiming that \"one from ten leaves nought\", with Jamaica representing the number \"1\" in the number ten, thus leaving a zero (representing the remaining islands).  Trinidad and Tobago's leader quickly followed Jamaica's exit by saying if Jamaica represented the 1, then they were the 0 itself leaving \"none\", ending the Federation experiment. The remaining islands tried a group of the \"Little 8\" said it wanted to go its own direction and Barbados next withdrew from any idea of a smaller group.  The remaining islands came up with the West Indies Associated States, but ultimately, they too reverted to their sovereign paths. The 1960s overall marked a decade of political independence by a large number of Caribbean nations from Britain.\n\nParagraph 19: NASA astronauts Gus Grissom, Roger Chaffee, and Ed White perished in a flash fire which engulfed their command module on January 27, 1967, while training for the first of the crewed Apollo missions, initially designated as Apollo Saturn-204 (AS-204).  Their capsule stood atop the Saturn-1B rocket which was at the time docked to the launchpad gantry at Cape Canaveral's Launch Complex 34, while they performed an in-capsule training for what was to be a low Earth orbit shake-out mission for the United States' Apollo Space Program.  The craft was set to launch three weeks later, on February 21, 1967.  Following the fire, the mission was renamed Apollo 1 to honor the crew's work.\n\nParagraph 20: Of the views of Plato on the subject, it is hardly less difficult to gain a clear conception from the Dialogues, than it is in the case of ethical good.  In some of these, various definitions of the beautiful are rejected as inadequate by the Platonic Socrates.  At the same time we may conclude that Plato's mind leaned decidedly to the conception of an absolute beauty, which took its place in his scheme of ideas or self-existing forms.  This true beauty is nothing discoverable as an attribute in another thing, for these are only beautiful things, not the beautiful itself.  Love (Eros) produces aspiration towards this pure idea.  Elsewhere the soul's intuition of the self-beautiful is said to be a reminiscence of its prenatal existence.  As to the precise forms in which the idea of beauty reveals itself, Plato is not very decided.  His theory of an absolute beauty does not easily adjust itself to the notion of its contributing merely a variety of sensuous pleasure, to which he appears to lean in some dialogues.  He tends to identify the self-beautiful with the conceptions of the true and the good, and thus there arose the Platonic formula kalokagathia. So far as his writings embody the notion of any common element in beautiful objects, it is proportion, harmony or unity among their parts.  He emphasizes unity in its simplest aspect as seen in evenness of line and purity of color.  He recognizes in places the beauty of the mind, and seems to think that the highest beauty of proportion is to be found in the union of a beautiful mind with a beautiful body.  He had but a poor opinion of art, regarding it as a trick of imitation (mimesis) which takes us another step further from the luminous sphere of rational intuition into the shadowy region of the semblances of sense.  Accordingly, in his scheme for an ideal republic, he provided for the most inexorable censorship of poets, etc., so as to make art as far as possible an instrument of moral and political training.\n\nParagraph 21: He again came into the fore as a pre-favorite just when the Olympics was looming and was hyped as a firm contender for gold medal in triple jump at 1956 Summer Olympics. He also served as the flagbearer for Brazil at the 1956 Summer Olympics in the opening ceremony. However, it was not easy for Adhemar to claim the Olympic title and defend the Olympic gold medal during the 1956 Olympics as Icelandic triple jumper Vilhjálmur Einarsson gave a run for his money in the finals. Einarsson who was on his Olympic debut took limelight and recognition in the 1956 Olympics after clearing a whopping 16.26 meters (which many call his jump was aided by the wind) in his second jump in the triple jump final to create a new Olympic record. Interestingly and coincidentally the Olympic record in men's triple jump was previously held by Adhemar who had jumped 16.22 meters during the 1952 Olympics. Einarsson's record jump of 16.26 meters stunned the spectators, organisers and fellow competitors including Adhemar, which also raised the expectations among the sporting fraternity that Einarsson would win the gold medal in the competition. Einarsson came in as a surprising element who gave an unexpected challenge for Adhemar with the latter's bid to reclaim the Olympic title was almost quashed. The presence of Einarsson made it even special as he was just one of only two athletes who would represent Iceland during the 1956 Summer Olympics. However, Adhemar bounced back strongly by breaking the Olympic record set by Einarsson during the same competition by jumping 16.35 meters in his fourth jump and as a result he was once again in contention for gold medal. Adhemar backed up his jump by equalling Einarsson's best jump in the fifth round (16.26 meters) and adding a 16.21 meters in the final round. In the end, Adhemar da Silva successfully defended his Olympic title at the 1956 Olympics largely due to the Olympic record leaping 16.35 metres in fourth round and also for recording over 16 metres jumps on three occasions. On the other spectrum, his rival Einarsson had to settle for a silver medal which also ensured Iceland's first ever medal at an Olympic event. The gold medal achievement by Adhemar turned out to be the second Olympic gold medal of his career and thus went onto become the first Brazilian to secure gold medals in two successive Olympic appearances.", "answers": ["Paragraph 10"], "length": 6188, "dataset": "passage_retrieval_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "60d2c6e9463cd84ae115b1012d7d759d810a4686ef6ab22d"}
{"input": "The text is about Buddy Knox, a teenager from Happy, Texas, who wrote the original verses of a song called \"Party Doll\" in 1948. He and two college friends recorded the song at a studio in Clovis, New Mexico, with the help of Knox's sister, two friends, and a girl from the marching band. A DJ in Amarillo started playing the song in 1956, making it a regional hit. Roulette Records in New York City then distributed the song across the U.S., and it became a chart-topping hit in March 1957. Jerry Allison, drummer for The Crickets, stated that the drum sound on \"Party Doll\" inspired the drum sound he used for their song \"Not Fade Away\".", "context": "Paragraph 1: The vitamin folic acid is an oxidized precursor to reduced folates that is upstream of the blockade at dihydrofolate reductase, and compared to leucovorin is recognized as a very weak antidote to the toxic effects of antifolates that is inappropriate for use in cases of acute intoxication. Minnich et al. dosed mongrel dogs subcutaneously with aminopterin and folic acid simultaneously to test whether folic acid can rescue animals from the lethality and toxicity of aminopterin Dogs were given 0.020, 0.046, 0.044 escalated to 0.088, and 0.097 mg/kg aminopterin each day for 7 to 12 days. Folic acid was given in a weight ratio to aminopterin of 200:1 to 800:1. All animals survived. In contrast, animals given aminopterin in an amount of 0.041 mg/kg/day x 6 days without folic acid died. Thus, when the ratio of folic acid to aminopterin was 200:1 and greater, all of the subjects survived on regimens that would have otherwise been uniformly fatal to all subjects.\n\nParagraph 2: Outram's respect for Kaufmann is vividly expressed in his detailed account of climbing Mt. Bryce. On July 21, in preparation of their climb, the two mountaineers left camp, made their way through forests of fallen trees, chopped-down a big spruce to make \"a bridge across the swift torrent,\" climbed steep, rugged slopes to \"delightful\" lakes, and finally reached an altitude of 8,000 feet in order to \"survey Mt. Bryce and its approaches . . . with strong field glasses.\"  On August 21, they begin their climb at 4:40 in the morning, roped together before tackling the snow wall, and continued thus throughout the day.\" One 70 feet high cliff \"threatened defeat,\" but \"Christian immediately led the way: Hold after hold gave way as [Kaufmann] tried them one by one, and fragments rattled down the gully and leapt from rock to rock in ever growing bounds till, lost to sight and sound, they dashed to final rest upon the glacier 6,000 feet below . . . Fortunately Kaufmann is a magnificent rock-climber, and it was a treat to watch the skill and science he displayed in his advance slowly and cautiously towards his goal.\" Kaufmann, \"sometimes with arms and legs outstretched, like great starfish,\"  overcame one difficulty after another \"with cat-like tread, face inwards towards the slope.\" After reaching the 11,750-foot summit, eleven hours later, at 3:40 PM, they spent little time at the top. But they soon realize that the 70 feet of cliff encountered earlier could not be descended before dark. Rather than freezing without shelter in arctic winds during a night, Kaufmann decided to descend the mountain in darkness. Outram, still roped to his guide, went first, and Kaufmann, in the upper, less secure position, moved cautiously down the rocky cliff. \"Drawn out for one long hour of concentrated tension were the successive experiences of helpless groping in the dark depths for something to rest a foot upon, of blind search all over the chilled rocky surface for a knob or tiny crack where the numbed fingers might find another hold, of agonizing doubt as to their stability when found, of eerie thrill and sickening sensation when the long-sought support crumbled beneath the stress and hurtled downward into the blackness of space, whilst the hollow reverberations of its fall reechoed through the silence.\" As Outram observed, after \"nearly 17 hours of adventurous companionship,\" the mountaineers finally unloosened the rope that had bound them together.\n\nParagraph 3: The series begins at the middle of a game of hide and seek, as a young boy named Justin Casey (Gen Adachi) finishes counting and begins searching for his friends, Angela \"Angie\" Roberts and her little brother Corwyn \"Corky\" Roberts (Kanna and Tsukubo Natsuyama). As he searches for Angie and Corky in a wooded area, a thunderstorm occurs. Justin manages to sneak up on the two before the rain starts pouring, forcing them to run for cover. They eventually find a spacecraft type house in the wooded area, previously unseen according to Justin. At first glance it appears that nobody is home, until they discover a clown-battery type android named Solar Ion Robot (Kadenchin), or S.I.R. for short. They soon meet the owner of the house, Professor Humphrey Bumble (Dr. Tokio Taimu), who introduces the children to his greatest creation, a half rocket, half house one of a kind time machine named The Flying House. Professor Bumble's attempt at recreating Benjamin Franklin's famous lightning experiment with the use of a bat looking kite flying outside the house to get the machine working leads to a temporary change in S.I.R.'s personality from being nice to mean and he goes berserk, before sending The Flying House in course to the past. Justin, Angie, Corky, and S.I.R. realize how long the journey back home will take due to Professor Bumble's misguidance and errors in time travel, but in the meantime they witness and participate (with little or no consequences) in numerous events of the Bible's New Testament, from the birth of John the Baptist to the rise of the Paul the Apostle. Eventually, they make it home exactly the same way they traveled into the past in the first place. S.I.R. gets a knock in the head which, again, makes him go from being nice to mean and go berserk and he attacks The Flying House. Ironically, S.I.R.'s berserkiness fixes it in such a way that it finally sends the whole crew back to their own time period, and the show ends, with S.I.R. changed back from being mean to nice by the end of the trip.\n\nParagraph 4: As this \"new\" Steve Rogers escorts the woman he rescued through the forest, she reveals she's been poisoned during the resulting battle and is dying. Steve reveals that his only memories are of what is implied to be his basic training days. Meanwhile, outside the safety of Earth's force field, Star-Lord, Rocket Raccoon, and Groot try to enlist representatives of the Skrulls, Kree, Brood, Shi'ar and Spartax empires that are on the Galactic Council in helping against the Chitauri hordes and to break down the Planetary Defense Shield and get rid of Hydra. Realizing they are now facing a galaxy without human interference, the Galactic Council refuses aid and attempt to kill the three Guardians as they flee. As Star-Lord tells Captain Marvel what happened amongst the Chitauri attacks, Quasar is still comatose. Back on Earth, Black Widow makes her way to a safehouse owned by Boomerang who is now a crime boss in Newark, New Jersey. Boomerang is hiding Maria Hill who is working with the criminal underworld to hide from the regime. Hill and Widow begin training the Champions, pushing them to learn how to kill. While the resistance seeks a Cosmic Cube shard, Hydra Supreme is called away from attending a Hydra science fair alongside a reluctant Sharon Carter by news from Kraken that another shard has been located in Atlantis. As Hydra's Avengers invade and destroy the Atlantean temple, they discover that the shard they've tracked down is a fake planted by Namor to keep them from discovering the real one. This is the second failed attempt to recover a shard after an ill-fated mission into Wakanda to retrieve another. Before Steve can take the failure out on Hydra's Avengers, he receives word that another shard has been located. Mockingbird leads the task force to find Sam Wilson. They come across the base of the Ultron/Hank Pym hybrid who decides to give his \"family\" a warm welcome. As the new Steve Rogers and the woman travel through the forest, the woman succumbs to her injuries and dies. But before she passes, she promises Steve he'll find his way home if he \"stays true to himself.\" With a quick jump back to Newark, Boomerang awakens to discover a bomb in his safehouse. Though he survives the blast, a mysterious figure puts a gun in his face demanding knowledge of his criminal enterprises and of the resistance. Boomerang protests as it's revealed that the figure is the Punisher who is now apparently in the employ of Hydra.\n\nParagraph 5: The medical missionary work in this sensitive border town was started in the year 1894 by the Presbyterian Church of United States. Rev. Janvier Newton and his wife Mrs. Frances on whom the hospital is named arrived in Firozpur in the year 1877. The same year i.e. 1877 Rev. Janvier had to return to US for health reasons. He took a two years condensed medical course at the Jefferson Medical College, Philadelphia. Although this was not long enough time to get medical degree, it qualified him to do much for the benefit of the sick. In 1882 when he took charge of the Mission work in Firozpur, he opened a small dispensary in Firozpur City and daily treated a number of patients during summer, while in winter he connected medical work with his preaching. He traveled to the surrounding villages on a camel, back carrying his saddle bags of medicines and equipment. He worked mainly among men. Mrs. Frances, Dr. Newton's wife on whom the hospital is named, was much concerned about the women as there was no medical facility for them. She started running a dispensary for women and children from her residence. Later on, her daughter after taking a short medical course in America joined her. It was the mid 1880s that this dispensary from their home started functioning. When she had gone to US for leave and lying on sick bed in the Women's hospital, Philadelphia, Mrs. Frances Newton thought of building a hospital for the women and children of Firozpur area. She started talking about this and praying about it. The result was $2000/- collected to build the hospital for women and children. That was the beginning of Frances Newton Hospital and a 50-bed hospital was finally opened in 1894, and later on School of Nursing was opened in 1923. The first fully trained Missionary doctor that came out to the Frances Newton Hospital, Firozpur was Dr. Maud Allen from California. She was the Medical Superintendent of the hospital for 30 years. She owned a car which was very very rare thing ‘Model-T Ford’. She was an outstanding doctor and liked by all. Dr. Grace Edwards was the next missionary to be the Medical Superintendent for the next six years. She got married and Dr. Dorothy Ferris took charge of the hospital in 1936. Dr. Ferris, a graduate from the University of Cincinnati and a short course at the Columbus College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York, before coming to India. She spent a year in Language schools.\n\nParagraph 6: Buddy Knox was a teenager living near Happy, Texas, in 1948 when he wrote the original verses of \"Party Doll\" behind a haystack on his family farm. While attending college at West Texas State University, he and two college friends, Jimmy Bowen and Don Lanier, traveled to Clovis, New Mexico, to record the song at the studio of Norman Petty. Knox's sister and two of her friends, Iraene Potts of Amarillo and a neighbor, sang background vocals on the song and a girl from the marching band of Clovis High School was recruited to play cymbal. After pressing copies of the record, a DJ in Amarillo began playing \"Party Doll\" in 1956 and it soon became a regional hit. After being contacted by Roulette Records in New York City, the song was distributed around the U.S. and became a chart-topping hit, spending a week at No. 1 on the Top 100 chart, the precursor to the Billboard Hot 100, in March 1957. Jerry Allison, drummer for The Crickets (who also recorded for Petty at Clovis), stated in an interview that the drum on Party Doll (which he said was played on a cardboard box) was the inspiration for the drum sound he used for \"Not Fade Away\".\n\nParagraph 7: In 2013, 8 members of the parliament resigned from the National Unity Party (UBP) and joined the Democratic Party. The party subsequently renamed itself Democratic Party — National Forces. At the legislative elections in 2013, the DP greatly increased its share of the votes and won 12 out of 50 seats and 23.2% of the popular vote. The party then subsequently went on to become the junior partner of the coalition government under the Republican Turkish Party (CTP). However, in 2014, four members of the parliament resigned from the party and three of them joined the National Unity Party. In July 2015, the party became the main opposition party, against the CTP-UBP coalition. It joined the government as the junior partner once again, this time with the UBP, in April 2016.\n\nParagraph 8: However, a trap is waiting for them on Turtle Island. Hilary Simpkins has been in cahoots with the local priest, Baba Carey, to squeeze out the island's riches, which include sacred objects. Baba Carey is the only surviving priest and therefore the only person who knows the location of the Golden Turtle, which is a deity of the Caribbean and protector of Turtle Island. To prevent the other islanders from catching on to his scheme by talking to the protector, he claims to not know where the Golden Turtle is either. The crew of the Winsome Maid is taken captive by the islanders on orders of Baba Carey as instructed by Simpkins, but Morgane escapes. On the beach, she finds Bobby, an unfit member of Simpkins's crew, and tells him of Nell's feelings as well as gets him to aid her. She also meets a young native girl, Tanama, who becomes her companion on the search for the Golden Turtle. They succeed and are informed of everything that Turtle Island has suffered in the past years. The worst of it is that Baba Carey has stolen the sacred turtle egg and the Golden Turtle is close to dying. Without the egg, no new Golden Turtle will be born. Thus informed, Morgane retrieves it, but she is followed by Baba Carey who tries to kill her. Tanama takes the blow, gravely wounding her, and the Golden Turtle declares Baba Carey to be a priest no more. The guard that had come along promptly stops taking orders from the ex-priest, causing a stalemate. Morgane places the sacred egg back on its altar to bring about the new Golden Turtle, who cures Tanama and declares her the new priest, Bibi Carey. Baba Carey is taken away for trial and Morgane is joined by Briscoe and Alessandro. Now knowing the truth of the Golden Turtle, Briscoe is a satisfied customer. Alessandro expresses his pride in having Morgane as his daughter, more so when they are rewarded with a glimpse into the whole sacred network of the Caribbean and are allowed to pick one item from the temples treasures. They find and pick the White Gold Skull, a legendary talking skull said to be the lead to Ruby Heart's treasure. After expressing their thanks, they leave to deal with Simpkins. They take his ship and leave him and his crew (minus Bobby) stranded, making him their mortal enemy.\n\nParagraph 9: The proposed Convention on the Rights of Older Persons (UNCROP) is likely to be the next major human rights treaty adopted by the United Nations. The proposed treaty will seek to remedy the fragmented human rights structure for Older Persons, and will focus on reaffirming critical human rights which are of concern to older persons. The focus of the treaty will be persons over 60 years of age, which is a growing demographic worldwide due to increased population ageing. The treaty follows from the success of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child which has seen near universal acceptance since 1989. Where the UNCRC focuses on the rights of younger persons, the UNCROP will address those who form the older portion of society, who according to United Nations reports, are becoming increasingly vulnerable as a group without applicable normative standards of human rights law. Support for a Convention is becoming increasingly popular, as human rights groups including the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (CESCR), HelpAge International, the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, the International Labour Organization, and many other NGOs and states have expressed support for a universal instrument. A raising number of NGOs from across the world have joined forces in advocating for a Convention in the Global Alliance for the Rights of Older Persons (GAROP) which has been set up out of the need to strengthen the rights of older persons worldwide. With population ageing, the human rights of the growing number of older persons have become an increasingly important issue. Among the human rights issues faced by older persons are ageist attitudes leading to discrimination, exclusion and constraints on the legal capacity, autonomy and independent living of older people. Existing human rights violations have been further exacerbated and put on the spotlight by the COVID-19 pandemic. Older people have been denied access to health services and became prone to physical and social isolation. The stigmatisation of older people and ageist images of older persons have also become more evident. The debate surrounding the convention focuses on the implementation and safeguarding of older persons’ human rights aiming to set normative standards of human rights for older persons in an international legally binding instrument. An underlying common factor and root cause of many of human rights violations experienced by older persons, along with its ubiquitous, prevalent, and surreptitious nature, is ageism. Ageism, as defined by the World Health Organization, refers to the stereotypes, prejudice and discrimination towards others or oneself based on age. A UNCROP would go a long way to tackle ageism. Individual relationships generally fall outside of current human rights law, which seeks to present standards of relations between states and individuals. Therefore, it has been suggested that the proposed human rights convention for older persons ought to be drafted as an anti-discrimination convention. However, this would not be consistent with other multilateral human rights conventions such as the ICCPR and ICESCR which set normative standards.\n\nParagraph 10: The march towards League One continued unabated with the Gulls' Good Friday encounter with Accrington resulting in the side's tenth 1–0 win of the season.  However, despite an early Rene Howe goal in the Easter Monday fixture with Oxford United, Torquay were perhaps fortunate to leave the Kassam Stadium with a point after Ian Morris was sent off in the 79th minute.  Only a late Taiwo Atieno strike salvaged a 2–2 draw for the Gulls after Oxford had already fought back to a 2–1 lead before the sending off.  However, the point did at least secure Torquay a place in the play-offs, although their sights were now firmly set on a much bigger prize.  The month's next fixture saw the visit of promotion-chasing rivals Southend to Plainmoor.  The two sides cancelled each other out in a 0–0 draw which did at least establish a new club record of 20 clean sheets in one season. The draw just managed to keep the Gulls in the automatic promotion spots although with both Shrewsbury and Crawley both winning their games in hand shortly afterwards, Torquay had dropped down to fourth spot before their trip to AFC Wimbledon.  A disappointing 2–0 defeat at Kingsmeadow did nothing to help the team's promotion prospects and appeared to suggest that Torquay's small squad may finally be running out of steam at the crucial moment.  However, the following week the Gulls seemed to have all three points in the bag back at home when they were 1–0 up against play-off hopefuls Crewe Alexandra before a 94th equaliser from Nick Powell robbed Torquay of two vital points.  Other results on the penultimate day of the season ensured Swindon were crowned champions of League Two while Shrewsbury became the second team to win automatic promotion.  However, a shock home defeat for Crawley at the hands of relegation threatened Hereford meant that only goal difference separated Torquay and Crawley for the vital third automatic promotion spot.  Meanwhile, just a point behind them both were Southend who could grab the coveted third spot if they won and Torquay and Crawley both failed to do so.  What would make the final day even more intriguing was the fact that Torquay had to travel to Crawley's victors Hereford who themselves would have to win their final match of the season to guarantee their League Two survival.\n\nParagraph 11: The Lingen family had long been settled in that county and are recorded in early documents including Doomsday Book. The manor of Lingen was settled on Turstan de Lingen and his wife Agnes, heiress and daughter of Alfred of Marlborough, Baron of Ewyas with his extensive Doomsday landholding. Turstan's and Agnes's descendants included Isolde de Lingen who married Brian Harley, ancestor or the Harley Earls of Oxford and Dukes of Portland and Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother. Another descendant and sister of Isolde was Isabella de Lingen, Lady Pembruggue of Tong Castle, founderess of the Chantry Church and buried at Tong, ancestor of the Ludlows of Stokesay Castle, Vernons of Hadden Hall and the Manners, Dukes of Rutland. Another descendant was Sir John Lingen of Lingen d 1506, who fought at the Battle of Mortimer's Cross which elevated Edward IV as king and the family's arms were amended with the three white roses of York. Sir John married Elisabeth de Burgh (d. 1522) who was a co-heiress of Sir John de Burgh and thus descended from the native Welsh Princes of Powys and Llewellyn the Great, Prince of Wales. Elisabeth also shared common descent with the Royal House of Tudor with a grandmother being a sister of Margaret ferch Thomas who married Fychan Tudor and was grandmother of Henry VII, and another of these sisters Ellen ferch Thomas being the mother of Owain Glyndŵr \"Prince of Wales\". Both Elisabeth and Sir John are buried in Aymestrey church near Lingen with in the chancel. Their descendants included Sir Henry Lingen, Sir Ralph Robert Wheeler Lingen the 1st Baron Lingen of Lingen, the Lingen's of Stoke Edith, Andrew Lingen-Stallard Esq, a former Council member of Royal College of Midwives and the present senior line of the Burton-Lingen's of Longner Hall near Shrewsbury, in which any co rights of the former Principality of Powys now rest.\n\nParagraph 12: Transferrin, in addition to chromodulin has been identified as a major physiological chromium transport agent, although a recent study found that Cr3+ in fact disables transferrin from acting as a metal ion transport agent. While transferrin is highly specific for ferric ions, at normal conditions, only 30% of transferrin molecules are saturated with ferric ions, allowing for other metals, particularly those with a large charge to size ratio, to bind as well. The binding sites consist of a C-lobe and an N-lobe which are nearly identical in structure. Each lobe contains aspartic acid, histidine, 2 tyrosine residues and a bicarbonate ion that acts as a bidentate ligand to allow iron or other metals to bind to transferrin in a distorted octahedral geometry.  Evidence supporting the binding of Cr3+ to transferrin comes from extensive clinical studies that showed a positive correlation between levels of ferritin and of fasting glucose, insulin, and glycated hemoglobin (Hb1Ac) levels. Furthermore, an in vivo study in rats showed that 80% of isotopically labelled Cr3+ ended up on transferrin while the rest were bound to albumin. An in vitro study showed that when chromium(III) chloride was added to isolated transferrin, the Cr3+ readily bound transferrin, owing to changes in the UV-Vis spectrum. The formation constant for Cr3+ in the C-lobe is 1.41 x 1010 M−1 and 2.04 x 105 M−1 in the N-lobe, which indicates that Cr3+ preferentially binds the C-lobe. Overall, the formation constant for chromium(III) is lower than that of the ferric ion. The bicarbonate ligand is crucial in binding Cr3+ as when bicarbonate concentrations are very low, the binding affinity is also significantly lower. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) studies have shown that below pH 6, chromium(III) binds only to the N-lobe and that at near neutral pH, chromium(III) binds to the C-lobe as well. Chromium(III) can compete with the ferric ion for binding to the C-lobe when the saturation greatly exceeds 30%. As such, these effects are only seen in patients with hemochromatosis, an iron-storage disease characterized by excessive iron saturation in transferrin.\n\nParagraph 13: The highway was created in 1944 from existing roads in the Wheatbelt and a series of tracks through remote pastoral areas. However, it was a hazardous route that could be dusty in the dry season, and boggy or washed away in the wet season. Some sections were effectively impassable sand, while others contained limestone outcrops. Economic growth and development in northern Western Australia prompted initial improvement efforts, and the federal government's Beef Roads Scheme in the 1960s resulted in a noticeably higher-quality road in the Kimberley. Construction of a sealed road from Perth to Wyndham, including numerous bridges to reduce the impact of seasonal flooding, took many years to complete. The last section opened on 16 December 1989, and received national media coverage. However, by then many older sections were either worn out or not up to modern standards. Various upgrades have been carried out in small sections, across the length of the highway, with further works planned. The southernmost part of the highway, from Midland to Muchea, was bypassed in 2020 by the NorthLink WA project that upgraded and extended the Tonkin Highway to Muchea. This section remains in use for local traffic and tourism to the Swan Valley area.\n\nParagraph 14: In 1457, King Ladislas V the Posthumous issued a charter which set up the legal foundation for a universitas of the Wallachian communities in the highlands of the Banate of Severin. There, in eight districts, most of them part of the military border structure of the Banat, the Wallachians constituted the majority of the population, nobility included, and they had rendered important military services to the kingdom. The royal diploma reaffirmed and enhanced earlier privileges, which were explicitly referenced in the document. The charter established a set of exclusive legal rights over the united territory of the eight highland districts, thus creating an essential condition for an Universitas Valachorum in that region. The Wallachians, subjects to the ius valachicum, were to be judged only by their own lord. However, they had no such lord, and King Ladislas established their right to appeal directly to him if they were dissatisfied with local court rulings. In effect, this meant that the eight districts were to become legally subjected directly and exclusively to the king. The absence of a Wallachian lord distinguished them from the Saxons, who had their own comes. Lastly, the king set the  nobles and knezes in the Banat on an equal footing with the true nobility in the rest of the kingdom. For this, Ladislas removed the juridical and confessional restrictions which had massively limited their ascendance to the first Estate of the realm. The fact that until the Ottoman conquest of their districts in 1658, only a small number of local noble families had acceeded to higher political office shows that they rather stayed in their local, familiar places. Once the Ottoman advance led to the separation of a new Principality of Transylvania from the kingdom, in the Banat–never more than a marginal part of the new state–local nobles preferred regional positions. In exchange, the Wallachian privileges were not contested by the princes.", "answers": ["Paragraph 6"], "length": 4707, "dataset": "passage_retrieval_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "3a954452167cc7e8aaa9c563fc2f88628bd5397745218cea"}
{"input": "The Einleitung, written by Hermes, had a significant impact on Catholic theology in Germany. Hermes was influenced by Immanuel Kant and Johann Gottlieb Fichte, although he criticized their beliefs in his work. He rejected their idea that the moral law is the only proof for the existence of God and disagreed with their limited perspective on revelation. Despite this, there were still enough speculative elements in Hermes' system to provoke controversy. He studied Kant's philosophy closely and aimed to refute any doctrines that contradicted Roman Catholicism. Hermes believed that the truth of Christian revelation and the Catholic church should be tested by reason first before accepting them. He argued that faith is a response to overwhelming evidence and is therefore not freely chosen.", "context": "Paragraph 1: Nga Ying Chau, or Cap Island, was an island off the northeast shore of Tsing Yi Island of Hong Kong, separated by a small harbour, Mun Tsai Tong, with Tsuen Wan at its northeast, just across the Rambler Channel. When the small harbour was reclaimed for the development of a new town, the island became part of Tsing Yi Island. The island was once home to the CRC Oil Storage Depot, which later relocated to the other side of Tsing Yi Island owing to its proximity to the residential area. The former island is now a small hill on the northeast point of Tsing Yi Island, and Villa Esplanada, a private housing estate, stands on the hills.\n\nParagraph 2: The division of 1956 was much different from the wartime pattern. There were tight military budgets for conventional forces in the Nuclear Age since the predominant belief was that battlefield nuclear weapons would be used early and often. This in turn made riflemen obsolete. This, combined with the fact the new 101st would be built from scratch, made the division a test of what was called a Pentomic, for \"pentagonal atomic\" division. The division was made up of five \"battle groups\", each one consisting of five companies (1 headquarters company, four rifle companies) plus a heavy mortar section. There was even a nuclear-armed rocket battery in Division Artillery. But there was only room for one \"battle group\" of each of the 101st's old regiments (327th, 501st, 502nd, and 506th, with the 187th coming in from the 11th). The lineage of the 502d was revived with the activation on 25 April 1957 of HHC, 1st Airborne Battle Group, 502d Infantry (bearing a lineage going back to Company A of the original 502nd PIB) as a unit within the 101st. As the rest of the Army converted to the Pentomic structure, the 2d Airborne Battle Group, 502nd Infantry was activated on 1 March 1957 in West Germany by reflagging existing elements of the 11th Airborne Division. Perpetuating the lineage of Company B, 502d PIB and thus the World War II 2d Battalion, it was inactivated on 1 July 1958 when the 11th itself was inactivated. Its personnel and equipment were reflagged to other unit designations under the 24th Infantry Division, which retained a partial Airborne capability with two battle groups (1-187th and 1-503d) before they rotated back to the United States to become part of the 82d Airborne Division. Their departure from the 24th was concurrent with the arrival of two non-airborne battle groups arriving from the United States.\n\nParagraph 3: The BC Express Company, (which had been formerly known as Barnard's Express) had been freighting in the area since the 1860s during the Cariboo Gold Rush. They were also aware of the great changes that the railway would bring to this sparsely populated area. Thousands of construction workers would soon be working in-between Tête Jaune Cache and Fort George and millions of acres of land would be opened for settlement. The owner of the BC Express Company was now Charles Vance Millar who had purchased the company from Stephen Tingley in 1897. Millar decided to build two large and very luxurious steamers to accommodate the growing demand. Both were built at Soda Creek by Alexander Watson Junior, the son of the man who had built the Charlotte. The first company sternwheeler was launched in May 1910. It was named the BX and was piloted by Captain Owen Forrester Browne. She had stateroom accommodation for seventy and was also licensed to carry sixty deck passengers. Her paddlewheel was covered, so there was no backsplash, and a fine view could be enjoyed from the stern, which was where the ladies cabin was located. The BX boasted hot and cold running water and steam heat. She soon became the preferred steamer for passenger service and also won the government mail contract. Premier Richard McBride traveled on the BX in her sumptuous bridal suite, which featured, among other luxuries, a double brass bed with a silk eiderdown. She was the only steamer that could advertise a bi-weekly service from Soda Creek to Fort George. On Sunday and Wednesday mornings, she would leave Soda Creek at the break of dawn, usually 3am, and would reach Quesnel around noon. After unloading the mail and supplies for that town she would continue upriver until dark, tying up at a woodpile where her crew would have an opportunity to load more fuel aboard. This was called wooding up and it was a common activity. Most sternwheelers burnt upwards of four cords of wood an hour when they were travelling upstream and they could only carry three. She would arrive in Fort George the next day, usually around 11am. Her return trips downriver were far swifter, she would leave Fort George at 7am on Tuesdays and Saturdays, arriving in Soda Creek by 4;30pm of the same day.  For the 1911 season of navigation, the BC Express Company built a second sternwheeler, the BC Express which was nearly identical to the BX, only slightly smaller and lacking the covered paddlewheel. Her pilot was Captain Joseph P Bucey. The BC Express worked the route from Fort George to Tête Jaune Cache until 1913 and then joined her sister ship, the BX, on the Soda Creek to Fort George route, where they both worked on the construction of the Pacific Great Eastern Railway. In 1915, only the BX worked on the Fraser, and in '16 and '17 there were none at all. The BX returned to the river in 1918, still under Captain Browne, and was joined, when the need arose, by the BC Express.Then, in August 1919, the BX struck a reef named \"Woodpecker\" and sank in the Fort George Canyon while carrying 100 tons of concrete. Her sister ship towed her back to Quesnel for salvage but she never sailed again.\n\nParagraph 4: Bampton Fair only began to be well known for the sale of ponies when in 1856, Frederick Knight began selling his ponies at the fair. Exmoor Ponies used to be rounded up on the moors during the so-called Autumn Drift and driven by road to be sold at the fair. After being driven from the moors via Dulverton and Exebridge, the ponies were brought to an old  orchard behind the Tiverton Hotel (now called the Quarryman's Rest) where they were kept in wooden pens. The auction ring was a small round pen nearby. Large numbers of fair-goers would pay an entrance fee to see the pony pens. In 1979, the Dartmoor Preservation Society wrote to the RSPCA about suspected cruelty to the ponies at the fair. Then in 1984, a meeting was held between the RSPCA inspectors, vets and the council. A number of recommendations were made to improve the welfare of the ponies, although the meeting did reach a consensus that the fair was more trouble free than any other. At the end of the 1984 fair the RSPCA were satisfied with the way the fair was organised and in 1985 Bampton again received no official complaints about the pony fair.  However, the RSPCA and the auctioneers did request a number of improvements to the way ponies were loaded onto lorries and repairs to some of the pens. While alternative sites were offered to hold the sales, the council was unwilling to spend the money needed to fulfil the obligations for an event which was only held once a year. The Ministry of Agriculture and Devon County Council were asked for help but none was provided. From 2004 to 2013, farm-tackle, Exmoor ponies and other livestock were auctioned as part of the Fair again, a little way out of town, at Luttrell Quarry. However, due to a reduction in demand for pony sales and Luttrell Farm becoming unavailable for the auction this has ended.\n\nParagraph 5: The maximum overall length is dictated by the need to fit into a box magazine of standard manufacture.  For example, the .223 Remington cartridge, when loaded for use in the AR-15 rifle (or the military's M16 rifle), has to fit into the removable box magazine for that rifle.  This dictates that the cartridge's maximum overall length be no greater than 2.260\".  However, for competition purposes during off-hand and slow fire prone match stages, the .223 Remington is loaded one cartridge at a time into the rifle's receiver.  This allows for the cartridge to be longer than the standardized 2.260\" SAAMI maximum overall length.  These cartridges can be safely loaded to a length that has the ogive portion of the bullet just touching the rifle's lands.  Many competitive shooters will make these cartridges 0.005\" less than the truly maximum allowable overall length, for the sake of safety.\n\nParagraph 6: The Einleitung had a major and controversial effect upon Catholic theology in Germany. Hermes himself was very largely influenced by the Immanuel Kant and Johann Gottlieb Fichte, and although in the philosophical portion of his Einleitung he strongly criticizes both these thinkers, rejecting their doctrine of the moral law as the sole guarantee for the existence of God, and condemning their restricted view of the possibility and nature of revelation, enough remained of purely speculative material to render his system controversial. Having closely studied Kant's philosophy, he occupied himself in refuting the doctrines of that philosopher so far as they were inconsistent with the Roman Catholic faith, while insisting that the truth of Christian revelation and of the Catholic church should first be tested by reason, and that revelation should then be followed. He argued that faith is a response to irresistible evidence, and therefore, not free.\n\nParagraph 7: 1837, June: Fese's Ashitla-Tilitl campaign: Akhmet Khan of Mekhtuli (?modern Dzhengutai, 33 km E), the temporary ruler of the Avar Khanate, fearing Shamil, arranged for the Russians to occupy Khunzakh. On 29 May 5000 Russians reached Khunzakh from Temir-Khan-Shura, having taken 20 days and building a road as they went. On 5 June Fese left Khunzakh for Shamil's headquarters at Ashitla (9 km W on the Andi Koysu).  Untsukul submitted and on 8 June he was on the Betl plateau overlooking Ashitla.  Here he detached a battalion to deal with Tilitl (see below).   The next day they crossed the Betl River and came to Ashitla which was occupied by 2000 Murids. The village was taken by 2PM with a good deal of house-to-house fighting, but the Russian losses were only 28 killed and 156 wounded. They counted 87 enemy dead, but many were probably carried away. No prisoners were taken. Some Murids retreated north of the river and some east to Old Akhulgo where many were killed and 78 taken prisoner. The vineyards and orchards around Ashitla were devastated. A fresh horde of mountaineers, said to be 12,000, appeared near Igali and Fese, around the 15th, performed a \"strategic movement to the rear\", losing 7 officers and 160 men.   Meanwhile, Shamil was besieged in Tilitl (probably , 37 km S). On 7 June he had made a sortie, both sides losing about 300 men, which was a significant share of their forces.  Fese reached Tilitl on 26 June. Tilitl had 600 houses, nine towers, steep slopes on three sides and a cliff behind. The towers were soon blasted by artillery and a general assault was made on 5 July. Half the village was gained with much slaughter and Shamil sent envoys to treat for peace. An agreement was made that neither side would attack the other, which amounted to a Russian recognition of Shamil's sovereignty. Fese withdrew on the 7th and reached Khunzakh on the 10th. Fese's withdrawal at a point of near victory is explained by the condition of his army.  He had lost 1000 men, most of his horses and wagons, his soldiers needed boots and he was short of ammunition. Fese claimed he had won and Shamil presented his retreat as divine intervention.  Shamil went north, surveyed the ruins of Ashitla and set about building a stronger fort at Akhulgo (9 km NW on the Andi Koysu).\n\nParagraph 8: A December 1955 study of 101 patients at the Mississippi State Hospital in Whitfield, Rankin County, Mississippi, found meprobamate useful in the alleviation of \"mental symptoms\": 3% of patients made a complete recovery, 29% were greatly improved, 50% were somewhat better, while 18% realized little change. Self-destructive patients became cooperative and calmer, and experienced a resumption of logical thinking. In 50% of the cases, relaxation brought about more favorable sleep habits. Following the trial, hydrotherapy and all types of shock treatment were subsequently halted. Meprobamate was found to help in the treatment of alcoholics by 1956. By 1957, over 36 million prescriptions had been filled for meprobamate in the US alone, a billion pills had been manufactured, and it accounted for fully a third of all prescriptions written. Berger, clinical director of Wallace Laboratories, described it as a relaxant of the central nervous system, whereas other tranquilizers suppressed it. A University of Michigan study found that meprobamate affected driving skills. Though patients reported being able to relax more easily, meprobamate did not completely alleviate their tense feelings. The disclosures came at a special scientific meeting at the Barbizon Plaza Hotel in New York City, at which Aldous Huxley addressed an evening session. He predicted the development of many chemicals \"capable of changing the quality of human consciousness\", in the next few years.\n\nParagraph 9: Although the Co-operative Group incorporates the original Rochdale Society, the business's core for much of its history were its wholesale operations. This began in 1863 when the North of England Co-operative Wholesale Industrial and Provident Society Limited was launched in Manchester by 300 individual co-operatives in Yorkshire and Lancashire. By 1872, it was known as the 'Co-operative Wholesale Society' (CWS) and it was wholly owned by the co-operatives which traded with it. The CWS grew rapidly and supplied produce to co-operative stores across England, though many co-ops only sourced around a third of their produce through the CWS. It was this continued and fierce competition with other non-co-operative wholesalers which led to the CWS becoming highly innovative. By 1890 the CWS had established significant branches in Leeds, Blackburn, Bristol, Nottingham and Huddersfield alongside a number of factories which produced biscuits (Manchester), boots (Leicester), soap (Durham) and textiles (Batley). In an attempt to drive down the significant cost of transportation for produce the CWS even began its own shipping line which initially sailed from Goole docks to parts of continental Europe. One of the CWS' steamships, the Pioneer, was the first commercial vessel to use the Manchester Ship Canal. This rapid expansion continued so that by the outbreak of World War I the CWS had major offices in the United States, Denmark, Australia and a tea plantation in India.\n\nParagraph 10: This category was created to differentiate between British nationals with strong ties to the United Kingdom and those connected only with an overseas territory (other than Gibraltar or the Falkland Islands), both of which groups had shared Citizenship of the United Kingdom and Colonies (CUKC) before 1 January 1983. The primary right of citizenship, that of abode in the United Kingdom, had been involuntarily taken away from colonial CUKCs by 1968 and 1971 Acts of Parliament, unless they retained it through a qualifying connection with the United Kingdom. Under the British Nationality Act 1981, which went into effect on 1 January 1983, colonial CUKCs (other than Gibraltarians and Falkland Islanders) without a qualifying connection to the United Kingdom became British Dependent Territories citizens (renamed British Overseas Territories citizenship in 2002), a citizenship which did not include right of abode anywhere; not even in the territories in which they were born (CUKCs born in the United Kingdom, Gibraltar, the Falkland Islands, or the Crown Dependencies of the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man all became British Citizens, with right of abode in the United Kingdom). Those with British Overseas Territories citizenship remained British nationals (subject to British sovereignty), but not British citizens (although British Dependent Territories Citizenship or British Overseas Territories Citizenship is a class of British citizenship, stripped of the most basic citizenship rights, not a citizenship of a British Overseas Territory or of the British Overseas Territories collectively as the name was intended to imply). As the United Kingdom is a Commonwealth Realm, all British Nationals, including BDTCs, remained Commonwealth citizens, though free movement by citizens of other Commonwealth countries into the United Kingdom had ended with the Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1962 (the British Overseas Territories are not members of the Commonwealth in their own rights, as it is a community of independent nations, one of which is the United Kingdom).\n\nParagraph 11: The tornado continued at EF3 intensity as it crossed into northwestern Mississippi County, striking Leachville at 7:30 p.m. CST (01:30 UTC). There, it completely destroyed a local Dollar General store, killing the store's assistant manager. A few metal-framed warehouse buildings were badly damaged or destroyed nearby, cars and semi-trailers were tossed, and multiple homes and mobile homes were damaged or destroyed in town. Extensive tree damage also occurred, and businesses in downtown Leachville had roofing blown off. The tornado grew larger as it passed near the rural community of Buckeye, and very intense tree damage was noted along West County Road 38. An entire row of large trees were completely debarked and denuded at this location, and an EF3 rating was applied. Power poles were snapped and an outbuilding was also destroyed by the tornado in this area. As it crossed the state line into Dunklin County in the Missouri Bootheel at 7:40 p.m. CST (01:40 UTC), high-end EF2 damage occurred as multiple outbuildings, mobile homes, and houses were damaged or destroyed, and many power poles and trees were snapped, with some low-end debarking noted. It continued south of Hornersville and over the Hornersville Swamp Conservation Area, briefly weakening to EF1 intensity. Trees and power poles were damaged in this area, and a mobile home also sustained minor damage. Farther to the northeast, the damage became more severe again as multiple metal truss transmission towers were twisted or collapsed near County Road 722, and damage in this area was rated EF3. A house along the periphery of the circulation sustained minor damage, and some power poles were pushed over as well. High-end EF2 damage occurred as the tornado then crossed into Pemiscot County west of Steele. Trees were snapped and denuded, power poles were downed, a couple of homes were heavily damaged, and a pickup truck was tossed along this segment of the path. The tornado became weak again as it passed just south of Braggadocio at EF1 intensity, damaging or destroying some barns and outbuildings, and inflicting roof damage to homes. However, the tornado abruptly became violent as it moved through the intersection of State Highway J and County Highway 407 to the east of town, causing EF4 damage as two homes were swept from their foundations and scattered across fields. A nine-year-old girl was killed, and her parents and two younger sisters were injured in the destruction of one of the homes. As it crossed Interstate 55 just south of Hayti, the large wedge tornado weakened back to EF2 strength and blew multiple semi-trailer trucks off the highway into a field, injuring the drivers. A car was also thrown, fatally injuring the driver. In addition to the two fatalities, at least nine people overall were injured in the county.\n\nParagraph 12: On the October 27, 2020, episode of AEW Dark, Top Flight made their All Elite Wrestling (AEW) debut where they lost to Evil Uno and Stu Grayson of The Dark Order. On the November 18 episode of AEW Dynamite, Top Flight fought The Young Bucks in a losing effort. On November 23, it was announced that they had signed with the company. In February 2021, Darius was sidelined with a torn ACL thus taking him out of action and leaving Dante on his own as a singles competitor. Over the following months, Martin would receive a significant push wrestling against the likes of Kenny Omega, Malakai Black, Matt Sydal, and Powerhouse Hobbs. In October 2021, Martin formed an alliance with Lio Rush who was attempting to recruit him as his tag team partner. On the November 11, 2021, episode of AEW Dynamite, Martin teamed with Rush against Matt Sydal and Lee Moriarty where they were victorious. On the November 24 episode of AEW Dynamite, Martin accepted Taz's offer to join Team Taz much to Rush's dismay. However, on the December 8 episode of Dynamite, Martin would eliminate Team Taz member Ricky Starks from the Dynamite Diamond Dozen Battle Royal, thus winning the battle royal and removing him from the group. It was revealed that Dante joining Team Taz was a scheme created by Lio Rush and Dante Martin. The following week, Martin fought MJF for the Dynamite Diamond Ring where he lost after a distraction by Starks. The partnership between Rush and Martin would abruptly end after Rush departed AEW. On the January 12th episode of Dynamite, Dante Martin defeated Powerhouse Hobbs. On the February 18, 2022, episode of AEW Rampage, Martin fought Hobbs in a Face of the Revolution Qualifying match where he was defeated. Three weeks later on the March 2nd episode of Dynamite, Dante reunited with his brother Darius in the tag team Casino Battle Royal, where Darius would last until the end, with Darius being eliminated by Matt Jackson of The Young Bucks. On the March 9 episode of Dynamite, Martin challenged Hangman Page for the AEW World Championship in a losing effort. After the match, Martin was endorsed by Page as a future champion in AEW as both men embraced and shook hands. The return to action was short-lived as soon after it was revealed that Darius had gotten into a serious car accident, which was expected to leave him out injured for up to nine months, forcing Dante to return to singles competition. On May 4, Dante lost to Rey Fenix in an Owen Hart Cup tournament qualifying-round match. On June 3, Dante faced Scorpio Sky for the AEW TNT Championship, but was defeated.  On August 12 on AEW Rampage Quake by the Lake, Martin teamed up with Skye Blue to take on Sammy Guevara and Tay Melo for the AAA World Mixed Tag Team Championship which they lost. On September 4, at All Out (2022), Dante competed in the Casino Ladder match, but the match was won by Maxwell Jacob Friedman.\n\nParagraph 13: Benjamin Simonds’s military career began during the war called King George's War which started in 1744.  At the start of the war, Governor William Shirley of Massachusetts ordered that a line of forts be built from Colrain to the Dutch settlements,  the strongest and westernmost of which was called Fort Massachusetts. Begun in the summer of 1745 in East Hoosac or what is now Williamstown, Massachusetts, Fort Massachusetts was garrisoned by December of that year and Benjamin Simonds was at that time or the following year a part of that garrison.  On August 19, 1746, Fort Massachusetts was attacked by an army of French soldiers and their Indian allies and surrendered the following day because only eight of the garrison of twenty two men were in reasonable health, the remainder being sick. The French and Indians then took the members of the garrison captive to Fort Saint-Frédéric on Lake Champlain (modern day Crown Point, New York) then to Montreal on September 10 before reaching Quebec on September 15, 1746. On the first night after their capture, the party camped near the river at the spot where Simonds would eventually buy and build a house. The site is now known as the “River Bend Farm”. The journey to Quebec was later described by the fort’s chaplain, Rev. John Norris, and he mentions Benjamin Simonds, or “Brother Simon” as he called him, at several points in his narrative. Norton reported for August 22 that “the Indians also carry’d in their Canoes Br Simon & John Aldrich, and Perry’s Wife, down the River about ten Miles.” For August 23 he reported that “the French still carrying Smeed’s and Scot’s Wives and Children, the Indians finding Horses for Brothers Simon and John Aldrich.”   According to Nehemiah How who wrote another captivity narrative, Benjamin Simonds was one of the captives from Fort Massachusetts who arrived at the prison in Quebec on September 15, 1746.  Only nine of the soldiers captured at Fort Massachusetts returned home and Benjamin Simonds and John Aldrich, both sick in the hospital at Quebec, were the last to return in October 1747. According to his petition dated 12 December 1749, Benjamin Simonds, after his return from captivity, was “unable to Get Home till 14 days after, and was weak & low and unable for a whole month to provide for himself.” He was awarded £20, 9s. for his service. During the Seven Years' War, Benjamin Simonds was again stationed at Fort Massachusetts where he was listed serving as a private in a company commanded by Capt. Ephraim Williams from 14 October 1754 to 28 March 1755 and then again in a company commanded by Isaac Wyman from 29 March 1755 to 26 November 1755.\n\nParagraph 14: After Volition had started to develop Red Faction out of what had been Descent 4, many people on the team felt like the game was a \"ground-pounder\", a game they would work hard on just to get an unpleasant result. The game shifted from a space combat game to a first-person shooter with a heavy focus on environmental destruction. Much like Summoner, Red Faction was first developed for personal computers before moving to consoles. When Kulas attempted to write a part of the game's code, he found himself writing code for personal computers, having to rewrite everything should it work on consoles. The game was delayed for two months shortly before release to allow the team to polish the game before it shipped. The game went gold shortly thereafter, and received positive reviews, much to the surprise of the development team. Following Red Faction, Volition developed Summoner 2, aiming at fixing all flaws made in the first game. While it was received better than the first game, it also sold fewer copies. After that came Red Faction II, which was ultimately not reviewed as good as the first game, again to the team's surprise. Internally, Red Faction II was considered a failure, and the series was halted. Ports of the game, released in 2003, were developed by fellow THQ studios Outrage (for Windows and Xbox) and Cranky Pants Games (for GameCube). A third Red Faction game was already in development, but was consequently canceled. A third Summoner game was also canceled. Following these cancellations, their teams started development on a heist-style game called Underground. The team worked on the game for about twelve months, but when Grand Theft Auto III was released, the marketing department at THQ pushed the expectations for the game so high that they could not be met, wherefore Underground, too, was canceled.", "answers": ["Paragraph 6"], "length": 4637, "dataset": "passage_retrieval_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "ab5ca22dfbcc05424bd3332f2cd56343c8ef7c7487a99561"}
{"input": "In May 2013, the members of Bullet Club had their first match together and emerged victorious. Following this, Devitt entered the Best of the Super Juniors tournament and won his block, advancing to the knockout stage. He defeated Kenny Omega and Alex Shelley to win the tournament and challenged Hiroshi Tanahashi. Devitt expressed his intention to move to the heavyweight division and become the first wrestler to hold both the IWGP Junior Heavyweight and IWGP Heavyweight Championships simultaneously. At Dominion 6.22, Devitt defeated Tanahashi, earning a shot at the IWGP Heavyweight Championship. However, he was ultimately defeated by Kazuchika Okada in the title match. Both Devitt and Anderson participated in the 2013 G1 Climax, with Devitt securing notable victories but failing to advance. Rey Bucanero joined Bullet Club in September and, with the help of the group, won the CMLL World Tag Team Championship. The rivalry between Devitt and Tanahashi concluded with Tanahashi's victory in a Lumberjack Deathmatch at Destruction.", "context": "Paragraph 1: Acceleration 0- for the 4-cylinder models is improved (around the mid-9-second mark), with comparable fuel efficiency to its predecessor: /city and /hwy for LX and EX models with automatic transmissions. Emissions of Non-Methane Organic Gases (NMOG), also known as unburned hydrocarbons, produced during engine warm-up are considerably lower. The LX and EX engines produce less than 0.075 grams per mile, qualifying them for California LEV (Low-Emission Vehicle) status. In California, the Accord EX with the available automatic transmission will produce less than 0.03 grams per mile of NMOG, qualifying it as the first gasoline-powered vehicle to reach ULEV (Ultra-Low Emission Vehicle) status. The five-main bearing block is high-pressure die-cast from aluminum alloy. The walls of the block extend below the centerline of the crankshaft, which helps stiffen the bottom end. FEM (Finite Element Method) computer analysis was used to arrive at optimum thicknesses for the block ribs and walls in order to minimize engine vibration. Additional bottom-end rigidity comes from a larger, stronger bearing-cap beam that ties directly into the cylinder-block skirt. An aluminum-alloy stiffener has been added between the transmission case and the block, just behind the bearing carrier. The stiffener serves to tie the block and transmission together into a single, reinforced unit. FEM was also used to design this stiffener so that it would not only stiffen the area, but also help minimize high-frequency engine vibration. Finite-element analysis of the Accord's piston design by Honda engineers yielded a new ultra-short, lightweight skirt design, which is very rigid and resistant to vibration and piston slap. Like the V-6 engine the pistons are gravity-cast aluminum alloy and utilize full-floating wrist pins in order to minimize noise. The engine's drop-forged single-plane steel crankshaft and connecting rods have been designed to be stronger and operate with less friction, much like the V-6 components. The I-section, drop-forged steel connecting rods have a completely new design and are considerably lighter than their predecessors (475 g vs. 578 g), which helps to minimize vibration. Big end-bearing journal diameter has been reduced from . Rod thickness is down from  and the bolt size is smaller. Like the V-6 rod bolts, those of the 4-cylinder engine are torqued to the plastic region of the bolt material in order to ensure a solid union between the bearing cap and the connecting rod. The engine block incorporates the Honda-designed second-order balance system that cancels the inertial forces common to large-displacement 4-cylinder engines. The system consists of a balance shaft on either side of and parallel to the crank-shaft,  above its centerline. Driven by a toothed belt, these balance shafts rotate in same directions at twice engine speed. Eccentric weights built into the shafts generate inertial forces that counteract the second-order forces created by the motion of the pistons and connecting rods. This Honda system minimizes vibration in the entire rpm range.\n\nParagraph 2: In adapting the film, a few adjustments were made, such as changing the names of the protagonists to Owen and Abby, and moving the setting from the Stockholm suburb of Blackeberg to \"a small New Mexico town.\" Reeves was also asked to change the ages of the main characters, but he refused, saying that \"would ruin the essence of the story and change everything completely ... we need that childlike innocence.\" He also told his actors to not watch the original film beforehand so \"we could make our own version but stay very true to the essence of the story.\" The filmmakers have noted that \"they intend to forge a unique identity for Let Me In, placing it firmly in an American context\", while at the same time paying respect to the original. In comparing his adaptation to the Swedish one, Reeves admitted to not adding many different details from the book that weren't in the original film, stating that \"the story was so big that you couldn't really add a lot of stuff in without taking away the focus of the coming of age story so I tried to have allusions and references to stuff in the book.\" Reeves also admitted to borrowing elements from the Swedish film, stating \"There are things that [Lindqvist] adapted brilliantly in the movie and I borrowed from that because I thought he did a great adaptation. But there are some things that hopefully don't detract and fit into the context of the story. It's a mixture of details from the book, the original film and things that grew out of adapting it.\" In adapting the story for American audiences, Reeves stated that keeping the 1980s time period within the film was critical in exploring the theme of good and evil. He used Ronald Reagan's \"evil empire speech\" as an example of American thought during that period. Reeves stated, \"The idea of Reagan's 'evil empire' speech and that whole sort of school of thought was that evil was something that was outside of us. Evil was 'Other,' it was over there, it was the Soviets\". Reeves felt that this idea was central to the main character Owen, as he \"would be grappling with these very, very dark feelings but being in a kind of American town where there was that sort of [Reagan era] mindset and religiousness. How would you fit in? How would you feel about yourself being confused and being 12 or 13 years old and not knowing what it means that you wish you could kill those kids who were terrorizing you every day? The humanity of that.\"\n\nParagraph 3: The four members of Bullet Club wrestled their first match together on May 22, when they defeated Captain New Japan, Hiroshi Tanahashi, Manabu Nakanishi and Ryusuke Taguchi in an eight-man tag team match. Two days later, Devitt entered the 2013 Best of the Super Juniors tournament, where he won his block with a clean record of eight wins and zero losses, advancing to the knockout stage on June 9, where he first defeated Kenny Omega in the semifinals and then Alex Shelley in the finals to win the tournament, after which he proceeded to challenge Hiroshi Tanahashi. Devitt's old tag team partner Ryusuke Taguchi had originally earned a spot in the semifinals of the tournament, but a legitimate hip injury forced him to pull out. During the following day's press conference, Devitt also mentioned a move to the heavyweight division, aiming to become the first wrestler to hold the IWGP Junior Heavyweight and IWGP Heavyweight Championships simultaneously. On June 22 at Dominion 6.22, Devitt defeated Tanahashi, again following interference from the rest of the Bullet Club, to earn his first-ever shot at the IWGP Heavyweight Championship. The reigning champion, Kazuchika Okada, accepted Devitt's challenge for the title later in the event on the condition that he first defend the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship against his Chaos stablemate Gedo. Bullet Club's feud with Tanahashi continued at the July 5 Kizuna Road 2013 pay-per-view, where Tama Tonga and visiting Mexican wrestler Terrible lost the Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) World Tag Team Championship to Tanahashi and Jyushin Thunder Liger. Terrible worked also the rest of his two-week NJPW tour as a member of Bullet Club. After successfully defending his IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship against Gedo, Devitt received his match for the IWGP Heavyweight Championship on July 20, but was defeated by Okada, despite interference from the rest of Bullet Club. From August 1 to 11, both Devitt and Anderson took part in the 2013 G1 Climax, wrestling in separate round-robin blocks. During the tournament, Devitt picked up big wins, albeit through outside interference, over reigning IWGP Heavyweight Champion Kazuchika Okada and former champions Hiroshi Tanahashi, Satoshi Kojima and Togi Makabe, but failed to advance from his block. Meanwhile, Anderson entered the final day with a chance to reach the finals, but a loss against Tetsuya Naito eliminated him from the tournament. On September 5, Rey Bucanero, another CMLL wrestler, started a NJPW tour working as a member of Bullet Club. On September 14, the rest of Bullet Club helped Bucanero and Tama Tonga defeat Hiroshi Tanahashi and Jyushin Thunder Liger for the CMLL World Tag Team Championship. The rivalry between Devitt and Tanahashi culminated in a Lumberjack Deathmatch on September 29 at Destruction, where Tanahashi was victorious.\n\nParagraph 4: In an Irish tale from County Cork titled Tom Fisher and John Fisher, a fisherman's daughter catches a big fish into her boat. The fish becomes a man and marries her. They have twin boys, one named Tom Fisher and the other John Fisher. Years later, Tom Fisher declares he wants to look for his missing father. On the road, he gives food to three foxes (the Fox of the Long Gate, the Fox of the Red Gate, and the Fox of the Green Wood). Tom Fisher reaches a kingdom that is threatened by a serpent from the sea that demands one of the king's daughters as sacrifice every year. He rescues the princess and marries her. Later, he follows a mysterious hare with a golden chain around its neck to the woods and loses his way. He builds a hut and is visited by a witch (the true form of the hare), who turns him into a blue stone with a stick. Back to John Fisher, he notices that his brother is in danger (his token of life, a knife, has rusted), and goes to the princess's kingdom. John Fisher follows the same hare and meets the same witch. John Fisher threatens her, but the witch begs to be spared in exchange for providing the means to rescue the twins' father: the brothers are to find a bull in the king's stables, find a duck inside it, and an egg inside the duck (the egg holds the life of the mermaid that is holding their father hostage). The witch restores Tom Fisher to life and he kills her. Now back to the kingdom, the elder twin, Tom Fisher, summons his helpful foxes to kill the bull, so they can use the mermaid's egg as a bargaining chip. Tom goes to the sea shore and summons the mermaid, demanding his father's return, otherwise he will crush the egg. The mermaid releases the twins' father, and Tom throws the egg at the mermaid, vanquishing her once and for all. Tom sends for his mother and grandfather to live in his kingdom.\n\nParagraph 5: Following the departure of Jay Leno from The Tonight Show and the late night shake-up at NBC, both Late Show and The Late Late Show struggled in the ratings against Jimmy Fallon and his successor at 12:30 a.m. ET/PT, Late Night with Seth Meyers. In April 2014, Letterman announced his plans to retire. CBS passed over Ferguson to choose Stephen Colbert as the new host of Late Show beginning sometime in 2015, reportedly viewing Ferguson as too much of a niche performer to succeed Letterman. Ferguson's contract, which expired in June 2014, stipulated that he was Letterman's successor at 11:30 and that if he was not given the position, he would be paid compensation of as much as US$10,000,000. Letterman's contract included the right to control the time slot that follows his and produce the Late Late Show and it was his production company (Worldwide Pants) that selected Ferguson as host and with whom his contracts were negotiated. With Letterman's departure, CBS would become the sole producer of the show and it is the network that determines what is done with the time slot and with which any contract is negotiated. CBS had been ambiguous in regard to Ferguson's future as host of The Late Late Show. CBS chief executive Leslie Moonves said in an interview: \"12:30 is up in the air [...] Obviously, we’re considering all sorts of candidates and women are among them. A woman would be great in late night.\" However, CBS Entertainment chairman Nina Tassler said that the CBS management are \"big fans of Craig\" and that \"Craig is here and doing his show at 12.30am, and we love having him there\".\n\nParagraph 6: The compressor design point will be in an area of high efficiency whether the compressor is part of a gas turbine engine or whether it is used for pumping air into a blast furnace. However the compressor has to provide suitable performance at other operating conditions imposed on it which means a high efficiency is required over a wider range of operation. In the case of a gas turbine engine it must permit the engine to be started readily and accelerated rapidly to the design speed which means operating at lower speeds than the design speed. At speeds and flows away from the design point the compressor flow area reduction is not appropriate for the actual density rise. A NACA report illustrates pictorially the difference in contraction required at the design condition and at low speed. At lower speeds, for example, the gas hasn't been compressed enough to exit the compressor without adversely affecting the blade angles of attack through the compressor.  Away from the design point the middle stages of an axial compressor continue to operate at about the optimum angle of attack but the front stages deviate one way, towards stall, and the rear stages in the opposite direction towards choke. The deviation was acceptable up to a design pressure ratio of about 5:1, producing only a loss in efficiency. At higher design pressure ratios prevention of rotating stall, which occurs at low corrected speeds, and choking was required with the introduction of inlet guide vanes which partially closed at low speeds, or by removing air part-way along the compressor at low speeds. Rows of variable stators or split compressors, which allowed the front stages to speed up and the rear to slow down relative to each other, would also be introduced for the same reason. When pressure ratios reached about 12:1 compressors would incorporate more than one of these features together.\n\nParagraph 7: Bhadase Sagan Maraj was born on the 29th of February 1920 into a Brahmin Hindu Indo-Trinidadian family who lived on Sagan Street in Caroni Village in the county of Caroni in central Trinidad in the British colony of Trinidad and Tobago. His parents were Baboonie and Mathew Sagan Maraj. His mother Baboonie was the daughter of Parmesar Maharaj. His father, Mathew Sagan Maraj, was an immigrant from India who came as an indentured laborer to Trinidad and Tobago. The elder Maraj was a devout Hindu, a mukhiya (village head), and a leader in the Hindu and Indian community of central Trinidad. At the time there was much tension between Hindu and Muslim Indo-Trinidadians in Caroni, and when Maraj was thirteen years old his father had been shot and killed by a Muslim gang while he was on his hammock on the porch of his home reading the Bhagawad Gita. His uncle was also killed when a Muslim gang had tied him to a stone and threw him into the Caroni River. After his father's death, Maraj went to live with his aaji (paternal grandmother). Many attempts were made on Maraj's life, so he took up wrestling and by the age of twenty he became an accomplished wrestler. He had attended the Caroni Canadian Mission School and the Pamphylian High School in Tunapuna.\n\nParagraph 8: Later, Verdú said that her role in Lovers marked a turning point in her screen career and has brought about a maturity as a performer.  Thereafter, she worked with such directors as José Luis Garci in Cradle Song (Canción de cuna); Bigas Luna in Golden Balls (Huevos de Oro); again with Trueba in the Academy Award winner Belle Époque; Emilio Martínez-Lázaro in Carreteras Secundarias; Carlos Saura in Goya in Bordeaux (Goya en Burdeos); and Gonzalo Suárez in El Portero and Oviedo Express. On the international stage, her career hit a highpoint when she starred in Y tu mamá también by Alfonso Cuarón, followed by Pan's Labyrinth by Guillermo del Toro.  Verdú was subsequently invited to be a part of the academy in Hollywood.\n\nParagraph 9: Heavy rain in Jamaica caused a landslide that killed two people after demolishing a home in Saint Andrew Parish. Zeta left roughly $15 million in damage on the island. Strong winds and rain caused flooding and damaged infrastructure in Mexico's Yucatán Peninsula. Zeta knocked out power to more than 2.6 million homes and businesses across the Southeastern United States; it also disrupted 2020 election early voting in several states. In Louisiana, the cyclone produced hurricane-force winds, with the highest reported sustained wind speed being  at Golden Meadow, while the same location recorded gusts up to . Strong winds caused significant damage to hundreds of homes in Jefferson, Lafourche, Orleans, Plaquemines, St. Bernard, and Terrebonne parishes, while some 100 homes were destroyed. Storm surge resulted in coastal flooding, especially in Lafourche and Jefferson parishes, with water entering buildings in Golden Meadow and Leesville. Roughly 500,000 households in the state lost electricity. Areas of extreme southern Mississippi reported severe wind damage, as hurricane-force winds also impacted the state's coastal counties. Around 10,000 homes in Mississippi were damaged. Storm surge inundated hundreds of roads in the vicinity of Bay St. Louis, while Route 90 was submerged in Harrison County. Much of the rest of the state reported generally minor impact. Coastal Alabama suffered storm surge flooding, inundating roads and damaging some businesses and properties. Farther inland, winds damaged hundreds of homes, knocked down a number of power lines and uprooted trees. In Georgia, Zeta left extensive damage from the Atlanta metropolitan area northward due to tropical storm-force wind gusts. Within the Atlanta area, strong winds damaged many traffic signals and uprooted trees, blocking many roads and causing property damage. Heavy rains also produced flooding in Rabun and Union counties. Approximately 1 million people lost electricity. The storm uprooted hundreds of trees, damaged hundreds of homes, and caused flash flooding in parts of North Carolina. Similar but slightly lesser impacts occurred in South Carolina. Zeta also damaged hundreds of power lines and uprooted trees in Virginia, though structural damage was mostly minor. As the remnants of Zeta moved off shore from the continental U.S., it left behind accumulating snow across parts of New England. There were seven related deaths in the United States: three in Georgia; two in Mississippi; and one each in Louisiana and Mississippi. Damage within the United States totaled $4.4 billion, with at least $1.25 billion incurred in Louisiana, $1.1 billion in Georgia, $840 million in Alabama, $635 million in Mississippi, $550 million in the Carolinas, and $25 million in Virginia.\n\nParagraph 10: The clause stated: \"People of the Western Ocean, [Europeans or Portuguese,] should they propagate in the country the religion of heaven's Lord, [name given to Christianity by the Catholics,] or clandestinely print books, or collect congregations to be preached to, and thereby deceive many people, or should any Tartars [Manchus] or Chinese, in their turn, propagate the doctrines and clandestinely give names, (as in baptism,) inflaming and misleading many, if proved by authentic testimony, the head or leader shall be sentenced to immediate death by strangulations : he who propagates the religion, inflaming and deceiving the people, if the number be not large, and no names be given, shall be sentenced to strangulation after a period of imprisonment. Those who are merely hearers or followers of the doctrine, if they will not repent and recant, shall be transported to the Mohammedan cities (in Turkistan) and given to be slaves to the beys and other powerful Mohammedans who are able to coerce them. . . . All civil and military officers who may fail to detect Europeans clandestinely residing in the country within their jurisdiction, and propagating their religion, thereby deceiving the multitude, shall be delivered over to the Supreme Board and be subjected to a court of inquiry.\"\n\nParagraph 11: The Four Spirits sculpture was unveiled at Kelly Ingram Park on September, 2013 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing. Crafted in Berkeley, California by Birmingham-born sculptor Elizabeth MacQueen and designed as a memorial to the four girls killed in the bombing (which occurred on September 15, 1963), it depicts the four girls in preparation for the church sermon at the 16th Street Baptist Church in the moments immediately before the explosion. The youngest girl killed in the explosion (Carol Denise McNair) is depicted releasing six doves into the air as she stands tiptoed and barefooted upon a bench as another barefooted girl (Addie Mae Collins) is depicted kneeling upon the bench, affixing a dress sash to McNair; a third girl (Cynthia Wesley) is depicted sitting upon the bench alongside McNair and Collins with a book in her lap.  The book depicts the refrain of William Butler Yeats poem \"The Stolen Child\". The fourth girl (Carole Robertson) is depicted standing and smiling as she motions the other three girls to attend their church sermon. At the base of the sculpture is an inscription of the name of the sermon the four girls were to attend prior to the bombing—\"A Love that Forgives.\" Oval photographs and brief biographies of the four girls killed in the explosion, the most seriously injured survivor (Sarah Collins), and the two teenage boys shot to death later that day also adorn the base of the sculpture.\n\nParagraph 12: This section of I-290 varies in width from two lanes at the ramp east from the I-290/I-355 split to three lanes between I-355 and US 20, to three lanes plus two exit lanes at US 20/IL 64 (Lake Street/North Avenue; exit 13B). After exit 13B, the highway reverts to three through traffic lanes. Exit 15 to southbound I-294 is a frequent point of congestion due to ramp traffic backing up onto the mainline highway, often as long as . This is because the ramp is not isolated from the mainline, only one lane in width, is a low-speed ramp (marked as a  ramp), and is relatively short () while carrying a high volume of truck traffic south to Indiana from North Avenue. Additionally, the sudden appearance of the exit tends to cause accidents when cars in the center lane try to aggressively turn into the right lane, particularly at the mouth of the I-294 exit. Finally, there is a dangerous high-volume weaving situation at the end of the ramp to I-294 with southbound I-294 traffic exiting to westbound I-88. , there are no plans to overcome any of these problems with new construction.\n\nParagraph 13: Of the story chapters, this is one of the shortest. Tank commander Danny Pritchard is introduced. He is presented as being apathetic towards war. On the planet Dunstan Hammer's Slammers are fighting for the government and Danny Pritchard is becoming romantically involved with one of their representatives, a young woman named Sonna. After a short skirmish, Pritchard's section makes camp in a rural area of Dunstan. Sonna invites Pritchard out for a ride to show him something. They take an aircar to a nearby structure made of an opaque, glass-like material. Pritchard is urged to enter the building by Sonna. He is presented with various images of strange and alien creatures, bird-like in appearance; Sonna explains they are an alien race named the Gedel. Shaken, he leaves the ruin and Sonna explains that the Gedel were a race capable of creating many wonders. This ruin is just one of many scattered over Dunstan. Pritchard seems uncaring and uninterested in the nature of the race, especially if the presence of their creations does not directly help his regiment. After decamping, his tank section becomes engaged in a fight on the edge of a city made of irreplaceable Gedel structures. The enemy mercenaries have dug in there intentionally, knowing the Slammers' employers won't allow the Regiment to attack the site. If the Slammers don't attack and defeat their opponents, they will be labeled as quitters. This in turn will adversely impact their ability to land contracts. Despite Sonna's protestations, Colonel Hammer allows the use of the tanks' heavy 20 cm powerguns to flush out and kill the enemy. This has the foreseeable effect of destroying many of the Gedel buildings, but insures the Slammers' reputation as a unit that will do whatever it takes to win.\n\nParagraph 14: David Wright's introduction to An Anthology from X: \"X, a quarterly review of literature and the arts, flourished, or at any rate existed, between the years 1959 and 1962. It took its name from the algebraic symbol for the unknown quantity—‘incalculable or mysterious fact or influence’ as the Concise Oxford Dictionary defines it. Neither manifesto nor editorial introduced the first number: its contents were the manifesto...Through the poet David Gascoyne, Swift had become acquainted with an extraordinary old lady, one of the last survivors of Bloomsbury. This was Mary Hutchinson, a cousin of Lytton Strachey... It had long been her ambition to start a magazine devoted to literature and the arts, and as editors Swift and I seemed to her to be the answer. This was before the days when literary magazines could get financial backing from the Arts Council...However, Mrs Hutchinson and he were confident that she would be able to find a backer for the venture...Our benefactor was Michael Berry [1911-2001], now Lord Hartwell, the owner of the Daily Telegraph. He undertook to guarantee the first four volumes of X, and proved an ideal backer—he never interfered. Indeed, I never even met him...Apart from Swift and myself there was no other staff, for we had determined to cut out all unnecessary expenses...The first number of X was carefully planned, and well received. Philip Toynbee hailed it in the Observer as 'an event, if only because a literary magazine of this kind has not existed for a long time. The admirable impression of a review devoted to attacking both the corruptions of an established avant-garde and the dreary \"retrenchments\" of the age is reinforced by every article and poem which appear here.' In a leading article the Times Literary Supplement was also laudatory: 'A concern for \"rethinking\" about the nature of literary and artistic experience is apparent throughout the pages of X, and gives the whole of the first issue a unity uncommon among periodicals now'... About 3,000 of the first number were sold, and the circulation remained at this figure, more or less, until its demise. Much of its impact was due to the layout that Patrick Swift designed, and to its unusual format, which was in fact determined by the dimensions of a menu card in a caff off Victoria Station where we happened to be having a cup of coffee. To begin with we were resolved to avoid insularity. Poems, essays, and graphics by European writers and artists...appeared in our pages...", "answers": ["Paragraph 3"], "length": 4616, "dataset": "passage_retrieval_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "2eb19ed6e5997f36d76f5cbde0f21d8106162c8268550c0e"}
{"input": "The text describes Stella Adler's involvement in the Group Theatre, a theater collective in New York City formed in 1931. The group consisted of individuals with left-wing political views who aimed to produce plays that focused on important social issues. The collective operated for ten years, staging twenty productions, and influencing numerous actors, directors, and playwrights. Some notable members of the group included Luther and Jay Adler, Elia Kazan, John Garfield, Howard Da Silva, Franchot Tone, and Lee J. Cobb. Elia Kazan regarded Adler as the most talented actor in the company.", "context": "Paragraph 1: Olga was genuinely popular and was extensively involved in charity work. On arrival in Athens, her immediate patronages included the Amalieion orphanage founded by the previous queen consort Amalia of Oldenburg, and the Arsakeion school for girls located on University Boulevard. With her personal support and the support of wealthy donors, she built asylums for the terminally ill and for the elderly disabled, and a sanatorium for patients with consumption. She founded a society to help the poor, a kindergarten for the children of the poor, and a soup kitchen in Piraeus that doubled as a cooking school for poor girls that was later expanded into a weaving school for girls and elderly women in financial difficulty. She was patron of two military hospitals and endowed the Evangelismos (Annunciation) Hospital, Greece's largest, in downtown Athens. She built the Russian Hospital in Piraeus in memory of her daughter, Alexandra, who died in Moscow in 1891. Although aimed primarily at Russian sailors, the hospital was open to all seamen visiting Greece, with consultation fees set at the low rate of thirty lepta and medicines being free. Olga also supported the establishment and funding of hospitals during the conflicts between Greece and its neighbors, including the Greco-Turkish War of 1897 and the First Balkan War (1912–13). For their work for the wounded, Olga and her daughter-in-law Crown Princess Sophia were awarded the Royal Red Cross by Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom in December 1897.\n\nParagraph 2: \"Hateship, Friendship, Courtship, Loveship, Marriage\":  In southwestern Ontario, Canada, Johanna, a plain, poor, unmarried woman, works as a housekeeper for Mr. McCauley and his granddaughter Sabitha. Sabitha's mother is dead, and her father, Ken Boudreau, lives elsewhere in poverty, frequently pleading with his father-in-law for money. Sabitha is friends with Edith, a shoe repairman's daughter who feels bored with her constricting blue-collar lifestyle. Edith devises a hoax in which she and Sabitha forge love letters from Sabitha's father to Johanna. Johanna, convinced by the letters that Ken will marry her, uses her substantial savings to travel to his remote location in rural Canada. She discovers that Ken has fallen ill, and, lovingly, she nurses him back to health. Having realized that Ken cannot control his own life, Johanna takes charge and arranges for them to start a new life. Ken, impressed by Johanna's resolve and by her savings, does not question her decisions. Several years later, Edith learns that Ken and Johanna have married and had a child. She is confused by the consequences of her hoax, but soon focuses once more on her desire to escape her parents' lifestyle and show everyone who she really is.\n\nParagraph 3: The general layout or body plan of the pallium is already clearly defined in animals with relatively simple brains, including lampreys, sharks and amphibians. In teleost fish, reptiles, birds, and mammals, the pallial architecture is greatly modified (sharply diverging in fish), with differential growth and specialization of diverse sectors of the conserved pallial Bauplan. In all vertebrate brains, the telencephalic forebrain consists of two hemispheres, joined at the midline by a region called the septum. The septum is continuous with the preoptic area across the plane defined by the anterior commissure; it is largely subpallial, but also contains a small pallial portion, where the hippocampal commissure forms, which is contiguous to the medial pallium. The telencephalic part of the rostral choroidal tela (roof plate continuous caudally with a diencephalic part) is inserted at the back of this commissure at a locus where mammals show the subfornical circumventricular organ, and extends laterally over the interventricular foramen into a wing-shaped medial telencephalic territory, the so-called choroidal fissure. Here the choroidal tissue is attached to the fimbria of the hippocampus (also known as the cortical hem area), bordering lengthwise the medial pallium. At its rostral and caudal ends, the medial pallium contacts the ventral pallium, which builds the pallial portion that contacts the subpallium across the pallio subpallial boundary, observed at the lateral telencephalic wall. Inside the ring formed thus by the medial and ventral pallium there is a sort of island that contains the dorsal and lateral pallial portions. In older literature the pallium used to be subdivided only into three zones, called the medial pallium, dorsal (or dorsolateral) pallium, and lateral pallium. The old lateral pallium encompassed the modern lateral and ventral parts of the pallium. The medial pallium is the progenitor of the mammalian hippocampus, and is thought to be involved in spatial cognitive mapping and memory formation across a broad range of species. The lateral and ventral pallium is the progenitor of the mammalian piriform cortex, and has an olfactory function in every species in which it has been studied. The evolutionary diversifications and specialization in functions of the dorsal pallium have been more difficult to decipher. It is widely believed to be the progenitor of the bulk of the mammalian cerebral cortex, although the evidence for this is considered by some anatomists not yet to be conclusive. In mammals and birds, the dorsal pallium increased in size and became the predominant brain region for sensory processing and the end site of sensory consciousness, the hypothesized reason for which is because of the nocturnal and burrowing lifestyle of ancestral mammals and the arboreal and volant lifestyle of ancestral birds.\n\nParagraph 4: In 1870, following the Civil war and the abolishment of slavery, the 15th amendment was passed, giving all United States citizens the right to vote regardless of race, color, or previous conditions of servitude. This amendment ensured the voting rights of African Americans. However, after its enactment, many southern states began implementing new ways to bar African Americans from voting. Some of these methods included poll taxes, which many could not afford, literacy tests, that many could not pass, and grandfather clauses, which stated that one can only vote if their grandfather voted. This changed  with the passing of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which outlawed these racially discriminatory practices and required government supervision for states that had less than 50 percent of non-White citizens registered to vote. If any state wanted to change any voting rules, they had to receive pre-clearance to ensure no new rule was racist. The Voting Rights Act prohibited many of the tactics that hindered Black voters from getting their voices heard. This was due to the establishment of the Fourteenth Amendment, which granted citizenship and equal rights to all African-Americans. The law of redistricting had to comply with this act in order for the minority group to have impact in the U.S. government. In addition, any affected American citizen that felt that they are being affected by the Voting Rights Act can file a lawsuit stating that it violates Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act which led rise to the case. However, racial gerrymandering continued past 1965 because it is extremely difficult to prove if districts were drawn on the basis of racial discrimination. This was apparent in the Thornburgh V. Gingles case of 1986 in which Black citizens of North Carolina argued that all white-majority districts were drawn up so a Black representative wouldn't get elected. In this unanimous decision, it was decided that districts did indeed dilute Black votes and therefore did violate the Voting Rights Act.\n\nParagraph 5: Peter Petrelli escorts Nathan Petrelli, who is still confused over what had happened to him over the past week, to his first day back at work. The Haitian then arrives, informing Peter that Angela Petrelli had sent him to wipe their memories, but instead tells Peter he needs to know the truth and gives him the address of a storage facility. Although the Haitian had only intended Peter to find out, Peter brings Nathan along anyway, and discover a metal casket which contains the apparently embalmed corpse of Nathan. When Nathan touches what appears to be his dead self, bits and pieces of the events surrounding the death of Nathan (as shown in \"An Invisible Thread\") come into his mind, including Matt Parkman's attempt to push Sylar's thoughts out of his head and replace them with Nathan's and the real Nathan's death. The brothers decide to find Matt, who they discover is in critical condition and under guard in a Texas hospital. They sneak into Matt's room and Peter heals him, though Matt immediately warns them to leave. Matt tells the brothers the whole story: that the real Nathan is dead and lying in the storage unit as they saw for themselves. Peter seems unconvinced, but Nathan begins to believe him, pointing out that it's the only explanation to his newfound abilities. Sylar then takes control of Matt and attempts to convince Nathan that by touching him he can learn the whole truth; Sylar reveals to Matt that by touching him, he can transfer back to his original body. Peter attempts to keep Nathan away, only to have him flung away by telekinesis, as Nathan wishes to touch him. The guard learns of their presence and enters the room. He grabs Nathan, only to have him brush up against Matt's hand, allowing Sylar's mind to transfer back in, although Nathan remains in control. Nathan then flings the cop into a wall, grabs Peter, and flies them both away to the Grand Canyon. Although Matt is horrified that Sylar has returned to his original body, he is also relieved Sylar has left his, and using his telepathy, Matt sneaks out of the hospital. Nathan is devastated to think that he is really Sylar, while Peter grabs onto him, assuming his flight power, refusing to let Nathan go at it alone. Later, Nathan asks Peter how he can live knowing Nathan is really Sylar.\n\nParagraph 6: The 1943 Atlantic hurricane season marked the first deliberate reconnaissance aircraft flights into tropical cyclones. The season officially lasted from June 16 to October 31, which was, at the time, considered the most likely period for tropical cyclone formation in the Atlantic Ocean. A total of ten storms from 1943 are listed in the Atlantic hurricane database, and an eleventh system that affected Florida and Georgia has been identified as a probable tropical depression. The first system of the year, dubbed the \"Surprise hurricane\", caused severe damage throughout Texas and Louisiana in June, partially because information about its approach was censored in the fray of World War II; the storm caused 19 deaths and $17 million in damage. A major hurricane in mid-August produced hurricane-force winds in Bermuda, and several other tropical cyclones throughout the year resulted in strong winds there. In September, a hurricane impacted the western Gulf Coast of the United States, then a tropical storm struck the Mid-Atlantic. The two storms resulted in $419,000 and $20,000 in damage, respectively; one death was attributed to the latter system. In mid-October, a strong hurricane resulted in flooding and damage to crops throughout the Caribbean; after becoming post-tropical, it contributed to moderate impacts across Nova Scotia.\n\nParagraph 7: Though little is known about Staden outside of his written travel accounts, his writings proved that one way to find favor in a hostile setting was to establish oneself as a mediator between groups in a position known as a go-between. Go-betweens could mediate business or trade transactions between indigenous and European groups or translate language and culture. In captivity, Staden used his extensive knowledge of Tupinambá culture, religious veneration, and allegiance with the French to take on the role of a transactional go-between. As he had learned about South American indigenous culture and politics on a previous expedition, Staden first aimed to manipulate the Tupinambá into granting him his freedom. He first attempted to convince the Tupinambá that he was truly a Frenchman and an ally; when a French trader visited the group, however, and denied Staden's story, this method failed and Staden was forced to think of new ways to survive. He began to view himself in more nationalistic terms as a German, who could not rely on the Portuguese and French as Christian Europeans to save him. Staden quickly changed course and became an important transactional go-between who shared information of an anticipated attack by the Tupinambá's enemies, the Tupinikin. When the attack happened, the Tupinambá's trust in Staden grew. Staden also became a religious go-between. Staden attempted to deceive the Tupinambá tribe, convincing them that he had the ability to foresee future events and connect them with his Christian God's emotions. Staden repeatedly linked negative or dangerous circumstances, such as death and illness, with God's anger, telling the Tupinambá that God had been angered by their threats to kill and eat him. Furthermore, when another prisoner died,who had supported the idea of killing Staden, Staden used this as an example of God's anger towards those who lie about his nationality. Thus, once again, Staden falsely tried to claim he was a Frenchman in attempt to persuade the Tupinambá to free him. As the Tupinambá began to link their good fortunes with Staden's happiness, which apparently appeased God, and their misfortune with hostility to Staden, which apparently angered God, they began to trust his stories and value him within the tribe. As a captive of the Tupinambá, Staden relied heavily on his position as a go-between to gain favor and good will with them. Through excelling in this role he became an important asset to the group and despite constant threats of death, his life was spared. In 1555, Staden was finally able to make his escape and return to Europe.\n\nParagraph 8: As a part of an overall plan to circle and defeat Gungunhana, Couceiro marched 270 Europeans, 50 Angolans, five cannons, and three rapid-firing guns to the southern border of Vátua lands in late June. Near the former fort of Stokolo, about 12 kilometers from the main road, Paiva Couceiro and Freire de Andrade built an outpost (Ponto X) and bridges without any conflict from the Cossine or Vátua tribes. On July 17, he recaptured the Portuguese outpost in Magude, and completed another bridge on July 24. Meanwhile, Enes was not having too much success in trying to encircle the tribal-lands of Gungunhana. He protested to him, through his intermediaries José Joaquim de Almeida and Aires de Ornelas, and requested he surrender rebels Mahazulo and Matibejana, as well as insisting that the chief accept two or three posts on his lands, in exchange for the immediate removal of Portuguese troops along his frontiers.  Although Enes had been counseled against starting a war with Gungunhana, Couceiro and Freire de Andrade insisted, at the end of June, that they should advance towards Cossine (within the Vátua lands) and begin the war against the chief. This perturbed the chief; near Cossine were many Vátua tribesmen, and in Magul, the provisional base of Matibejana. On August 23, Paiva Couceiro received orders to attack and arrest the rebel Matibejana. He advanced with 1,000 men along the swampy river, while a contingent of auxiliaries pillaged the neighboring villages and massacred the inhabitants. What was later known as the Battle of Magul, demonstrated acts that were more cavalier than operationally strategic. Paiva Couceiro's contingent, once again, became separated from his colleague Freire de Andrade's column, and finding the tribes of Cossine exhorted an ultimatum to surrender the rebel Matibejana within three days. When this did not occur, and after several days of inactivity, the gathered tribesman attacked directly the Portuguese lines, which resisted with only 5 dead and 27 injured (the tribes lost 300–450 in total). Although not a strategic victory, it did establish Portuguese military supremacy and turned the tide of the Luso-African skirmishes For his actions, in August 1895, Paiva Couceiro was made Knight of the Order of São Bento de Avis, for his actions. Although he demonstrated extraordinary physical courage, he placed his forces in unnecessary harm, but was to become a celebrity and feted with local honors, particularly after the imprisonment of Gungunhana:\n\nParagraph 9:  In the Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes episode \"459\", this Captain Marvel has some aspects of the Ultimate version/Mahr-Vehl, like his full name and rank, powers, human alias, and even appearance. Here, he is portrayed as a blue-skinned Kree rather than his traditional appearance as a \"Pink Kree,\" and uses the human alias \"Philip Lawson.\" He does not have the Nega-Bands, but makes use of highly advanced shape-shifting Kree weaponry. He helps the Avengers save Earth from a Kree Sentry sent to purge it of human life so the Kree can use the planet in their war against the Skrulls. He is distrusted by the team, particularly the Wasp, due to him being a Kree, but nearly sacrifices himself to take the robot's bomb into space and save earth. Afterwards he leaves to plead with the Supreme Intelligence to spare Earth, though he warns that the Kree will try to take Earth again. As he returns in \"Welcome to the Kree Empire\", He is accommodated by superiors commander Yon-Rogg and the Kree Grand Accuser Ronan who had been tasked by the Supremor to judge whether Earth's citizens were fit to join the empire. They were soon met with resistance by S.W.O.R.D and its newest agent Ms. Marvel, an associate of Mar-Vell's from when he went by his Lawson identity; exposure from his Kree Navy battle gear had augmented her genetic structure giving Carol cosmic superpowers. Mar-Vell begged her and the rest of earths heroes as well as its people to surrender peacefully, only to be violently rebuked, this defiance sending Ronan and the rest of his soldiers on the warpath. In a desperate attempt to stop all hostilities at the U.N. site, Captain Marvel intercepts a blast exchange between Ms. Marvel and Ronan; begging one last time for Earth to surrender to the Kree in order to spare mankind the galactic emperium's wrath. After Ronan is defeated Marvel and the rest of the invading Kree forces are imprisoned within Prison 42, an extra-dimensional prison in the Negative Zone. He warns that the Kree Empire will now come in full force after having humiliated the planets would be conquerors, but Iron Man retorts that they'll be waiting. He is voiced by Roger Craig Smith.\n\nParagraph 10: In September 1881, Carter invited him to the Scarborough Festival where he made his first-class debut for Yorkshire against Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC). Hawke went to Cambridge a month later and played for the university team from May to July 1882 before returning to Yorkshire. At this time, Hawke was usually the only amateur in the Yorkshire team. He refused the captaincy at first, saying he wanted to learn the job by playing under the professional captain, Test bowler Tom Emmett. Hawke was formally appointed club captain for the 1883 season, though he was still at Cambridge, and held the post until 1910. He remains the most successful county captain ever, Yorkshire winning the County Championship a record eight times during his tenure.\n\nParagraph 11: Generally, the evidence indicates that worker cooperatives have higher productivity than conventional companies although this difference may be modest in size. Research indicates that employee ownership can improve company performance, increase firm stability, increase survival rates and reduce layoffs during a crisis, though the effect is small and only an average, meaning it is not necessarily guaranteed to bring benefits. A 2016 metanalysis concluded that employee ownership had a small positive effect on firm performance but no effects on efficiency or growth-related outcomes. However some researchers have argued that while cooperatives can have higher performance in some circumstances, there is generally little difference in performance between cooperatives and conventional firms and that ultimately they are, on average, just as productive as each other. Economists have explained the clustering of worker coops through leagues or \"supporting structures\" Regions where large clusters of worker cooperatives are found supported by leagues include Mondragón, in the Basque region of Spain, home of Mondragón Cooperative Corporation and in Italy, particularly Emilia-Romagna. Leagues provide various kinds of scale economies to make coops viable. But as leagues need coops to start them the result is a chicken or egg problem that helps explain why few coops get started. Research has suggested that the primary appeal of a cooperative for its members is in security of employment, as workers can actually become decoupled from a cooperative's ostensible worker ownership (due to a mixture of interests and the more individualistic values of more recent workers), making secure employment, particularly in economically precarious times, a major draw. While it has been suggested that cooperatives could be a solution to unemployment, research indicates that this is unlikely to be the case.\n\nParagraph 12: |UFC Fight Night: Joanna vs. Waterson                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n\nParagraph 13: \"Never Back Down is our first label debut album! We spent all of 2010 creating this record and getting everything in place to release it! I just wanted to take a moment to tell you a little about the process of making this record and what the concept for it was. When we were first told we would be doing a full-length we sat down and put a lot of thought in what direction we wanted to go with it, musically and lyrically. We have always tried our best to be real in everything we do and write what is real to us so the concept of the record formed there. We decided to make a record that would be an exact reflection of our lives, in a way that any one can appreciate. For those who have been supporting us for a long time you know about the struggles we have gone through personally and business wise in pursuit of what we love. It has never been an easy journey but we have always been relentless and 'DIY' in our efforts. The album title and artwork are fairly simple in what it portrays. Being the underdog and coming up against something massive in front of you. The content of the record itself is something we are all very proud of. Musically it is influenced by everything we have ever loved and we believe will take the listener on a journey. It shows the good and the bad of going after what you love and sacrificing everything. We tried to show that also musically as much as lyrically. Some songs are a lot more fun and tell the good side of our lives. The friendship, traveling, partying, creating memorable moments in life worth fighting for and just a love for the people and music itself. The other side to that is some of the heaviest music we have wrote yet and portrays the downsides and struggles. Always being gone and slipping away from understanding what it will ever be like to be 'normal' again. The strain it puts on friendships and all relationships in life. The people who want to pollute the music, talk shit, and infect it with impure intentions. We shot a music video to the song 'All We Know' which is a summary of what the record is about. The album name Never Back Down comes out of this song. We wanted the record to be something anyone who has ever pursued what they love in life, sacrificed or overcome great obstacles could appreciate. Can't wait for people to give it a listen from beginning to end! To hear it as one total work and give us feedback\". - Close to Home\n\nParagraph 14: In 1931 Adler became one of the original members of the Group Theatre (New York), a New York City theatre collective formed by Cheryl Crawford, Harold Clurman and Lee Strasberg. The founders, as well as the actors in the group, \"tended to hold left-wing political views and wanted to produce plays that dealt with important social issues.\" The collective lasted for ten years, had twenty productions, and served as an inspiration for many actors, directors and playwrights who came after it. During those years, the Group's members included Luther, Luther's sister and brother, Stella Adler and Jay Adler, Elia Kazan, John Garfield, Paul Green (playwright), Howard Da Silva, Harry Morgan (billed as Harry Bratsburg), Franchot Tone, John Randolph, Joseph Bromberg, Michael Gordon, Will Geer, Clifford Odets and Lee J. Cobb. Elia Kazan considered Adler to be the best actor working in the company.\n\nParagraph 15: In 1979 Andrew Morris became Director of Music at Bedford School where he remained for 32 years. During this time at Bedford, he developed the Music School into one of the largest school music departments in the UK and brought its music making to unprecedented heights. He also presided over the building of an award-winning new Music School, designed by Eric Parry RA and opened in March 2006 by Sir Peter Maxwell Davies, Master of The Queen's Music. Under Andrew Morris's direction the School's First Orchestra played most of the Classical and Romantic concerto and symphonic repertoire as well as symphonies by Sibelius and Nielsen and new works by British composers such as Paul Patterson and the recipients of the Composer-in-Residence Scheme which Morris set up at Bedford School (with funds from the Maingot Trust), Alan Charlton, Paul Whitmarsh, Tim Watts and James Lark. With the School Choral Society, Morris conducted many of the major choral works including Bach's B minor Mass, the St John Passion, the St Matthew Passion, Handel's Israel in Egypt and Samson, the Verdi Requiem and Elgar's The Dream of Gerontius to name but a few. Under Morris's direction, the First Orchestra and Choral Society were featured in the BBC 'Youth Orchestras of the World' series in a new work by John Tavener. Andrew Morris also took the Chapel Choir, with whom he established a strong cathedral repertoire in the weekly Chapel services, to sing in many English cathedrals and churches, including St Paul's Cathedral and Westminster Abbey, and on tours to Madrid (including Madrid Cathedral) Venice (which included a concert in the Basilica dei Frari and Mass on the Feast of the Assumption in the Basilica di San Marco) and Paris (which included the Sunday morning Mass in Notre Dame, a concert in La Madeleine and a concert in Chartres Cathedral as part of the Cathedral Festival). His notable pupils include the international conductor and violinist Andrew Manze, Royal Opera House timpanist and Professor of Timpani at the Royal College of Music Christopher Ridley, composer and choral director Philip Stopford, pianist and conductor William Vann, Paul and Barnaby Smith, CEO and music director respectively of the Voces8 Foundation, counter-tenor Matthew Venner, musicologist and Lecturer in the Faculty of Music of the University of Leeds, Dr Ross Cole and the former England cricket captain Sir Alastair Cook, CBE.  At Bedford School Morris established a Visiting Fellows scheme, made up of advisers to the Music Department and to the Bedford boys, who included Sir Stephen Cleobury, CBE (then Director of Music at King's College, Cambridge), Andrew Manze (then Chief Conductor of the Helsingborg Symphony Orchestra and Associate Guest Conductor of the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra), Richard Egarr (Director of the Academy of Ancient Music), Paul Patterson (then Manson Professor of Composition at the Royal Academy of Music) and Roger Wright, CBE (then Controller of BBC Radio 3 and Director of the BBC Proms). While at Bedford, Andrew Morris was a Trustee of the St Albans Cathedral Music Trust.\n\nParagraph 16: Yvonne Perry (born October 23, 1966, in Voorheesville, New York, U.S.) is an American actress. After years doing commercials, and nearly a year as part of the improv team tricking people for Candid Camera, her big break came in 1992 when she landed the role of Rosanna Cabot on the CBS soap opera As the World Turns. In 1993, she won the Soap Opera Digest award for Outstanding Female Newcomer which was the show's first win in that category. She and on-screen love interest Shawn Christian (ex-Mike) were voted Hottest Soap Opera Couple by People Magazine in 1995. In 1996, she left the program  but returned in 1998 and 1999.\n\nParagraph 17: The co-main event was for the NXT Women's Championship, contested between champion Sasha Banks and challenger Bayley. It was described as the \"arrogant and ultra-talented champ\" taking on the \"lovable ... ultimate underdog\" by The Baltimore Sun. This was the culmination of a rivalry between the duo and a long storyline for Bayley which began over two years prior. In June 2013, both Bayley (debuting an innocent character) and Banks participated in the tournament to crown the first NXT Women's Champion, but both were eliminated in the first round. Banks aligned herself with Summer Rae that September to form \"The BFFs.\" She then changed her gimmick to \"The Boss\", while Bayley aligned herself with Charlotte. Despite Rae and Banks attempting to persuade Bayley to join their alliance, it was Charlotte who turned on Bayley in November to join The BFFs. In early 2014, Bayley, now backed up by Natalya, scored multiple wins over Banks while feuding with The BFFs, but Banks defeated Bayley in May during the first round of a tournament for the vacant NXT Women's Championship. In July, The BFFs disbanded, and Bayley failed to defeat Rae for a title shot. Bayley finally became the number one contender for the title by beating Banks in August, only to lose to champion Charlotte at TakeOver: Fatal 4-Way in September, and again in a title rematch the next month. After the first match, Charlotte saved Bayley from an attack by Banks; after the second, the duo shook hands. In October 2014, Bayley's friend Becky Lynch turned on her to join Sasha Banks, so Bayley again allied with Charlotte to feud against Banks and Lynch. An attack by Banks and Lynch caused a storyline knee injury for Bayley in November, while Charlotte beat Banks at TakeOver: R Evolution to retain her title in December 2014. Bayley returned in January 2015, saving Charlotte from Banks and Lynch. Charlotte then snatched her title belt from Bayley, resulting in Bayley attacking her. This caused a fatal-four-way match to be set up between the four women at TakeOver: Rival. Banks won the match and the NXT Women's Championship. When Bayley refused to turn her back on her supporters despite her failings, Emma slapped her to start a feud in March 2015. In April, Becky Lynch beat Bayley and Charlotte in a triple threat match for a title shot. Bayley's woes continued when she lost to Emma in May, as well as being ruled out of action with a hand injury, for which she blamed Emma for. Meanwhile, Sasha Banks racked up successful title defenses in singles action with two against Charlotte, one against Alexa Bliss, and at TakeOver: Unstoppable, one against Becky Lynch. Bayley returned on the July 22 episode of NXT, where she defeated Emma and announced her championship aspirations, but first challenged Charlotte to prove her credentials. After Bayley defeated Charlotte on the August 5 episode of NXT, she earned a title shot by beating Becky Lynch the following week, earning a title match for Banks' NXT Women's Championship at TakeOver: Brooklyn.", "answers": ["Paragraph 14"], "length": 5264, "dataset": "passage_retrieval_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "e068d7d120cdbe14e54c8fe95823a94ca4388f5ac10874a9"}

They barely escape death, and Carlo decides to part ways with Roberta until the war is over.", "context": "Paragraph 1: After his graduation from the University of California Los Angeles in 1972, Kineman started his career at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), working as officer and scientist in various assignments in oceanographic research at sea collecting geophysical, oceanographic, and climate data, Solar Forecaster at the Space Environment Services Center in Boulder, CO, and member of the NOAA-Coast Guard Spilled Oil Research Team (SOR Team) a research unit of the Outer Continental Shelf Environmental Assessment Program (OCSEAP), publishing a one year study of the 'Tsesis' oil spill in the Baltic as his Masters Dissertation.  He joined the Kenya Wildlife Conservation and Management Department of the Ministry of Environment and Tourism (later reorganized under Richard Leakey as the Kenya Wildlife Service) in 1987 as a Senior Research Warden through the US Peace Corps, and later helped conduct the 1981 census of Mountain Gorillas in 1981 under the direction of Dr. Sandy Harcourt at Dian Fossey's Karisoke Research Center in Rwanda. He then began postgraduate research in ecology and returned to public service in NOAA at the National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC), developing distribution modeling techniques and ecological characterization datasets for emerging USA and International global change programs, and led development of the Data and Information Management component of a new NOAA \"Center for Ecosystems Health\" in Charleston, SC. In 1997 he joined CIRES at the University of Colorado, where he has continued as a Senior Research Scientist since retiring from government service in 2005. Extending the work of Dr. Robert Rosen (mathematical biologist), he completed his Ph.D. in the Department of Environmental Studies in 2007, focused on ecological informatics, niche modeling, and complex systems theory, which he continued in post-doc research through a Fulbright grant to India 2007-2008, working as Honorary Adjunct Fellow at the Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and Environment (ATREE). Continuing research in both India and the USA to develop a theory of natural system wholeness, he published his first synthesis of Rosen's relational theory in 2011, which he later called \"R-Theory\" or \"Relational Holon Theory\", finding surprisingly deep correlations with ancient Vedic concepts of whole nature. In 2020 he co-published an update of the general synthesis in two parts with his original PhD mentor Dr. Carol Wessman. He has been a visiting professor at the Indian Institute of Sciences in Bangalore (Karnataka), the Sri Sathya Sai Institute of Higher Learning in Puttaparthi (Andhra Pradesh), and Vignan's University in Vadlamudi (Andhra Pradesh). Kineman was  elected President of the International Society for the Systems Sciences in the year 2015-2016, producing the annual ISSS conference on the dual theme: Realizing Sustainable Futures in Socioecological Systems (USA) and Leadership for Sustainable Socioecological Systems (India).\n\nParagraph 2: The old Hirsauer Kirche was originally the spiritual hub for all villages in the Eßweiler Tal. When it was that a church was first built in Hirsau (not to be confused with Hirsau in Baden-Württemberg) cannot be determined today. It can be assumed nonetheless that there had been an earlier church standing at the same spot centuries before the one that still stands now was built (about 1100); it may have been wooden. Churchgoers came from throughout the dale to attend services, all weddings were held there, and so were all funerals and burials. It was also the thingstead, and on certain days, market was held there, too. Hirsau lost this central role when in 1451 the church in Hinzweiler was built, although originally this only functioned as a chapel of ease to Hirsau's parish church. This actually brought about competition between the two churches in the time that followed for the function of parish church. As early as 1526, the Duchy of Palatinate-Zweibrücken introduced the Reformation into the church of the Oberamt of Meisenheim, replacing Catholic belief with Martin Luther’s teachings so that bit by bit, church services in the Eßweiler Tal, too, began to be conducted in accordance with the Reformation. The Offenbach Monastery, to which the Hinzweiler church was subject, at first opposed Reformist efforts. In 1555, though, the Rhinegraves of Grumbach, too, introduced the Reformation, and in 1588, the Offenbach Monastery was dissolved. In 1562, Eßweiler got its own graveyard. After the Counts Palatine of Zweibrücken had become absolute fiefholders over the Eßweiler Tal in 1795, worshippers then had to convert to Calvinism in line with developments in the County Palatine. Beginning in 1601, Hinzweiler became the temporary parish seat, but already by 1610, it once again had to yield this function to Hirsau, only to get it back after the Thirty Years' War. This structure remains in place to this day. In earlier days, Nerzweiler's inhabitants were mainly Reformed, according to John Calvin’s teachings. As minorities, there were Lutherans, who in 1818 merged with the Calvinists. Catholic Christians were not found in Nerzweiler until the early 19th century, and even thereafter, only sporadically. In 1743, out of 14 households, only two belonged to the Lutheran faith, while none belonged to either the Catholic or the Jewish faith. In 1825, only Protestants lived in the village, that is, former Calvinists and Lutherans after the 1818 Protestant Union. In 1961, among the 180 inhabitants was one Catholic.\n\nParagraph 3: Creative Assembly was founded in 1987 by Tim Ansell. Ansell had begun professional computer programming in 1985, working on video games for the Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64, and Atari 8-bit family. Initially, Ansell kept the company small so he could personally work on computer programming. The company's early work, often produced personally by Ansell, involved porting games from the Amiga platform to DOS, such as the 1989 titles Geoff Crammond's Stunt Car Racer and Shadow of the Beast by Psygnosis. Creative Assembly began work with Electronic Arts in 1993, producing titles under the EA Sports label, starting with the DOS version of the early FIFA games. With EA Sports,  Creative Assembly was able to produce low development risk products bearing official league endorsements. The company's products included Rugby World Cup titles for 1995 and 2001, the game for the 1999 Cricket World Cup and the Australian Football League games for 1998 and 1999, of which the AFL 98 title was particularly successful in the Australian market. When it became clear that the company needed to expand further, Ansell employed Michael Simpson in 1996 as creative director. Simpson, a microchip designer turned video game designer, later became the driving force for the creative design of the Total War series. Ansell left Creative Assembly after Sega acquired the developer in 2005, later on, Tim Heaton took over as studio director.\n\nParagraph 4: The next clipper system was weaker than the previous one, alias only reaching a peak of  early on April 3, however, gained enough characteristics to become a full-fledged winter storm. Moving fairly quickly, this snowmaker began to drop snow near the Great Lakes at its peak intensity, and as it neared the Northeast, snow began to spread eastward. Early on April 4, light to moderate snow had reached Boston, with locally heavier snowfall rates at times, which made visibility low. By mid-day, rainfall began to fire up along the clipper's cold front, spreading into New York City and New Jersey. This forced the New York Yankees to postpone their home openers against the Houston Astros. It began to accelerate at the same time, moving off the coast late the same day. Total snowfall accumulations from this system ranged from , in a swath extending from the Great Lakes into southeastern New England. Providence, Rhode Island set a daily record for snow at , as well as a daily record for coldest high on the date at . After the storm, Ithaca, New York set a monthly record low of . Several cities in northern Maine also broke monthly record lows. A third system began plowing into the same areas on April 5–6, bringing more snow to the Great Lakes, and also the risk of wildfires in the Southwest. This clipper transitioned into a storm complex early on April 7, and brought heavy rain to parts of the New York metropolitan area. It lingered into early April 8 before finally retreating into Canada. A fourth clipper system reached the Mid-Atlantic states by the weekend of April 9–10, and brought both cold temperatures with it, and a swath of accumulating snow of  from the Ohio Valley into the southern parts of New Jersey. The fourth clipper postponed a Baltimore Orioles game. As it approached the coastline, it began to transition into a small nor'easter. Because of temperatures being at or just above freezing, pockets of wet snow broke out in central New Jersey, with only accumulations on grassy surfaces, but areas further to the south picked up to . The system moved offshore late by April 9, but brought some more cold temperatures behind it, setting more record lows. Due to the cold brought by the system, wind chills at Nationals Park hovered in the upper 20s and lower 30s. This forced a game between the Miami Marlins and Washington Nationals to postpone.\n\nParagraph 5: When new women was released in 1935, the film was interpreted by many as an example of the leftward development of Cai's politics on the traditional constraints on women in mass media and urban society. One newspaper reviewer praised \"the number of films with 'the woman question' as their subject over the past few years\" and declared that \"it is inevitable that this kind of film would go on to influence many aspects of the women's movement to come.\" 'The woman question' or funu wenti, was centred around the discussion of love, marriage, education and employment for women. The term \"new women\" also symbolized the start of modernist discourse in China. Post release of the film, critics were “quick to compare the three kinds of women and to try to identify who the new woman might be.\" Newspaper reviews were published to prototype these “new women” figures into their respective social strata. Zhang Xiuzhen is a college graduate (undoubtedly the daughter of a capitalist family), but she is willing to be a man's plaything all her life as Mrs. Wang of the comprador class. Li Aying has her roots in the working class, combating the hostile environment in her struggle. Wei Ming's background seems to be somewhere between the former two women and, because of that, she comes to be incapable of extricating herself from the sad fate of the wavering petit bourgeois.The release of New Women was marred by a backlash from the press who objected to their profession's unflattering portrayal in the film. When the film opened in Shanghai the commercial press took the film's narrative to task for depicting the news media as slanderous. The Journalists’ Union loudly protested the film's characterization of their trade and the spectre of negative publicity pressured Lianhua studio into making an open apology. The portrayal of the new woman by Ruan Linyu was also heavily criticized for her way of life and using “suicide as the ultimate way of protesting against discrimination and gossip.” In an attempt to clear away accusations that the movie was “condoning” the suicide of New Women, the producers made a public relations show of their virtue by agreeing to screen the film at a fundraiser for a women's educational centre on International Women's Day, March 8. The target of much of their ire became the suicide of the film's star, Ruan Lingyu exactly one month after the movie premiered. The reception and publicity the film received was directly tied to Ruan's suicide by overdosing on barbiturates. Her death was purportedly due to the gossip and exposure surrounding her personal life. In her final note, she stated, \"Gossip is a fearful thing\", attributing her suicide to the same kind of media harassment her character Wei Ming experienced. The idea of the protagonist's \"crisis in subjectivity\" was brought to life by Ruan's suicide. It provoked much debate in the Shanghai news media on the controversy over the representation and status of women in popular culture and shed a light on the increasing feminist problems of modernity. Much discussion surrounded the similarities between Ai Xia, Ruan, and her character Wei Ming, all sources of scrutiny in 'the woman question' of urban China in the 1930s. Some criticised the representation of new woman in the film as not focusing on family duties and pressured the idea of an independent new woman, conveying the traditional Chinese ideals which needed reformation.\n\nParagraph 6: In 1995, the precursor to the J. Craig Venter Institute, TIGR, determined the sequence of Haemophilus influenzae, Mycoplasma genitalium, and Methanococcus jannaschii. In 1997, TIGR determined the genome of Borrelia burgdorferi (which causes Lyme Disease) . In 1998, TIGR sequenced the genome of Treponema pallidum (which causes syphilis). In 1999 TIGR published the sequence of the radioresistant polyextremophile Deinococcus radiodurans. TIGR has sequenced and analyzed more than 50 microbial genomes. TIGR developed the gene finder GLIMMER and the sequence alignment program MUMmer. In 2001 anthrax attacks, TIGR worked with the National Science Foundation and the FBI to sequence the strain of Bacillus anthracis used in bioterrorism attacks.\n\nParagraph 7: He has been a member of the Southern Methodist University Board of Trustees since 1992. He is chair of the board's Finance Committee and a member of its Executive Committee, Trusteeship Committee, Committee on Athletics and Executive Committee of the Campaign for SMU. He also currently serves as co-chair of the Dedman College Campaign Committee and on the Executive Board of Dedman School of Law. He is a former member of the Executive Boards of Dedman College of Humanities and Sciences, Cox School of Business, John Goodwin Tower Center for Political Studies and Willis M. Tate Distinguished Lecture Series''. He has also served as a regent for the Texas A&M University System. He donated US$20 million to build the new football stadium at SMU, named the Gerald J. Ford Stadium. He also donated US$10 million to the Weill Cornell Medical College at Cornell University.\n\nParagraph 8: Throughout his career Hodson was dogged by accusations of financial impropriety. He was investigated on more than one occasion but nothing was ever proved. His detractors claim he was a looter; his supporters say that these accusations came from those who disliked his manner and his military success. William's brother, the Rev. G. Hodson, stated in his book that he obtained the inventory of William's possessions made by the Committee of Adjustment and it contained no articles of loot, and Sir Charles Gough, president of the committee, confirmed this evidence. This statement is incompatible with Sir Henry Daly's. Sir Henry Norman stated that to his personal knowledge Hodson remitted several thousand pounds to Calcutta which could only have been obtained by looting. On the other hand, again, Hodson died a poor man; his effects, which included a ring, watch, Bible and Prayer book, and a miniature, were sold for only £170. General remarked \"there was nothing in his boxes but what an officer might legitimately and honourably have in his possession.\" His widow did not have money enough to pay for her passage home and she had to apply to the Compassionate Fund for assistance, which was granted. She was offered the use of an apartment by Queen Victoria at Hampton Court Palace, and left only £442 at her death.\n\nParagraph 9: After his NFL career ended, Leaf completed his degree at Washington State. He had legal troubles involving drugs beginning in 2010 after a Texas judge sentenced him to 10 years probation. Two years later, Leaf pleaded guilty to felony burglary and drug possession in Montana. After a suspended sentence with a stint in drug rehabilitation, Leaf began serving a seven-year sentence in state prison in December 2012. On September 9, 2014, Leaf was sentenced to five years in prison for violating his Texas probation by breaking into a home in Montana to steal prescription drugs, but he was released from prison on December 3, 2014. In October 2020, he pled guilty to a misdemeanor domestic violence charge.\n\nParagraph 10: Bogut was born in Melbourne in 1984. His parents, Michael and Anne, immigrated to Australia from Croatia in the 1970s, with his father from Osijek and his mother from Karlovac. Bogut grew up playing Australian rules football and tennis in addition to basketball. As a child, he patterned his basketball game after Toni Kukoč, a Croatian NBA player who spent the majority of the 1990s playing for the Chicago Bulls. As a 15-year-old, he was cut from the Victoria junior state representative team. In response to this setback, Bogut began to improve his game with the help of Siniša Marković, a professional basketball player from Yugoslavia. Bogut's emergence began after he earned a roster spot with the Australian Institute of Sport (AIS) in 2002. He competed in the South East Australian Basketball League (SEABL) in 2002 and 2003, helping the AIS win the East Conference title in his first season. He later joined the U-19 Australian junior national team, and was named the most valuable player of the 2003 FIBA Under-19 World Cup, in Greece, after leading the Emus to the title. In eight games, he averaged 26.3 points, 17 rebounds, 2.5 assists and 1.5 blocks per game, and he shot 61 percent from the field and 74 percent from the free throw line. One of the highlights of his MVP conquest was a 22-point, 18-rebound performance, in a 106–85 win over the US, in the quarter-finals of the medal round.\n\nParagraph 11: Gotita de Plata he made his in-ring debut on November 5, 2009, against Rayito del Sol (Little Ray of Sunshine), making him only 11 years old at the time. To obscure the fact that he was only 11 when he began wrestling he was booked as a Mini-Estrella, working with other wrestlers who were not necessarily little people but generally short of stature. His early matches were closely monitored by his father and older brothers, only working the occasional match while still in school. Lucha Libre AAA Worldwide (AAA), one of Mexico's largest wrestling promotions, held the 2012 version of their Quien Pinta Para La Corona (\"Who Desires the Crown\") competition, a contest used to evaluate young wrestlers and invite the top prospects to work a match or two for AAA show before the judges chose the best male, female and Mini-Estrella to get an AAA contract. For the 2012 version AAA visited Monterrey, Campeche, Puebla and Guadalajara to evaluate wrestlers, it is not clear which location Gotita de Plata auditioned in or if he was invited to wrestle a tryout match in some other way. The actual try out matches took place on September 12, 2012, in Mexico City in front of a panel of AAA judges and officials. In the first match Gotita de Plata teamed up with fellow Mini-Estrellas Lucky Boy and Rey Celestial, losing to Heylex, Mini Excorcista and Los Gemelos Muertes (who did not compete in the Mini-Estrella division). Later in the night Gotita de Plata, Pequeño Bonsai and Rey Celestial defeated the team of Heylex, Mini Diamond and Mini Exorcista. In the end Rey Celestial won the Minis division contest, but Gotita de Plata impressed the AAA officials enough that they brought him back in May 2013 as part of the regular sized division, teaming with Flamita and Saturno to defeat the team of Carta Brava Jr., Danny Casas and Eterno in the opening match of the show. Following his experiences with AAA Gotita de Plata began working in the regular sized division full-time, working for the International Wrestling League (IWL) in 2013. On the IWL 3rd Anniversary Show he lost to Flyer in the third match of the night. In late 2014 he returned to AAA and began working opening show matches for AAA television tapings, often with opening match wrestlers such as Argenis, Ludxor, Venum and Niño Hamburguesa as he continues his in-ring training, supervised by AAA high flyer Aero Star.\n\nParagraph 12: Blackburn made the first change of the afternoon in the 67th minute when Gee came on to replace James.  Atkins became the second player to be booked a minute later when he pulled back Mills.  In the 71st minute, Blackburn cleared a long through but the ball fell to Thompson who passed the ball back to Grayson who struck wide of the left-hand post from around .  A minute later, Mills picked up a loose ball around the half-way line and ran into the Blackburn half unchallenged until Hendry brought him down outside the penalty area: the Blackburn defender was shown a yellow card for the foul.  The resulting free kick from Thompson was headed over the bar by Walsh.  Gee then headed the ball directly into the arms of Mimms from .  On 76 minutes, Atkins made a long pass which found Newell on the left flank in an advanced position: Newell ran on with the ball and his attempted chip was pushed away by Muggleton.  On 77 minutes, a cross-field pass from Speedie was collected by Price on the edge of the Leicester City penalty area, but Muggleton gathered his low cross.  Two minutes later May's long ball forward found Atkins in space but his diagonal shot was caught in the Leicester goal.  With eleven minutes to go, Speedie was brought down by Grayson after being sent free down the left wing by a pass from Sellars.  Speedie was then booked for pushing Grayson to the ground.  Leicester's Gee then crossed from the corner of the Blackburn penalty area and Ormondroyd's header back across the face of goal was cleared by Hendry just ahead of Russell.  With six minutes remaining, Newell passed to Atkins who ran into the area and was fouled by Muggleton who conceded the second penalty of the match.  Sellars was then replaced by Richardson. Newell's spot kick was straight at Muggleton who deflected it onto the post, to keep the score at 1–0.  Newell then received a goal kick from Mimms deep in Leicester territory, his cross was nudged on by Speedie to Atkins whose shot was tipped just past the post low to Muggleton's left.  In the 89th minute, Tommy Wright's shot from inside the box went just over the Blackburn crossbar.  Despite late pressure from Leicester City who were pushing for the equaliser, it was to no avail as the match ended 1–0 and Blackburn Rovers secured promotion.\n\nParagraph 13: The \"international version\" of the film debuted in the United Kingdom. In the prologue and epilogue, the Russian voice-over has been dubbed in English, but for the rest of the film features stylized subtitles appearing in odd places around the screen, often animated to emphasise or complement the action.  For example, in a scene in which Yegor is being called by a Dark vampire, he is in a pool and the camera is underwater.  The caption appears as blood red text that dissolves as blood would in water.  In another scene, as a character walks across the scene from left to right, the caption is revealed as his body crosses the screen. In addition, many of the scenes that were present in the Russian theatrical release were omitted, while, at the same time, some scenes were re-cut or added. The International version is shorter by 10 minutes. The DVD was released in the UK on 24 April 2006.  The zone 4 DVD had the option of either a Russian or an English audiotrack.  Subtitles were simply plain white text at the bottom of the screen. The International version of both Night Watch and its sequel, Day Watch, are now available in HD on Vudu. The HDX encodes are based on the International release and retain the original Russian dialog track with the stylized subtitles.\n\nParagraph 14: Carlo Caremoli (Trintignant) arrives in Riccione, and enjoys life together with his friends at his father's villa. Riccione is still peaceful, and only a few things remind about the war fought in the south. On seaside holiday, the youth witness a German fighter flying low over the beach and causing panic among the crowd. Carlo tries to protect a frightened little girl who runs toward him, and meets her mother, Roberta (Rossi Drago), a naval officer's widow. Carlo is attracted to Roberta, often meets her and even makes a trip with her to San Marino, although Roberta's mother (Lilla Brignone) disapproves of this new acquaintance, and urges her to stay away from Carlo, partly because of his father, Ettore Caremoli (Enrico Maria Salerno), a brutal Fascist. Meanwhile, Maddalena (Federica Ranchi), the young sister of Roberta's deceased husband, arrives from Catanzaro, fleeing the impending war. Maddalena spends time with Carlo's friends, and  together with Roberta, is invited to a circus. However, the show is interrupted by an air raid blackout, and the friends proceed to a nighttime party at Carlo's villa. After watching flares in the night sky, the men and women form couples and start dancing to a record of Temptation, Carlo with his girlfriend Rosanna (Jacqueline Sassard), and Roberta with a much younger boy. The camera cuts between Carlo and Roberta, staring at each other passionately. Carlo asks Roberta for the next dance, and the couple end up kissing in the garden, which deeply hurts Rosanna. The next day, Roberta initially refuses to admit her true feelings to Carlo, but ultimately accedes. Meanwhile, on 25 July, the news of Mussolini's ouster is announced. Carlo and Roberta continue to go on dates. However, Carlo's father is forced to flee, and his villa is confiscated by the military authorities. Carlo meets Roberta once again and spends a night with her, provoking  discontent from her mother, and Maddalena decides to leave. During a curfew, a patrol discovers the couple on the beach and finds out that Carlo's military exemption has expired. As his father has fled, he has no chance to renew it anymore. Roberta proposes that he hide at her villa in Rovigo, and the next morning they take a train. However, during the trip the tracks are bombed during an Allied air raid, and the couple barely escape death. After the air raid, Roberta gets back on the train, but Carlo refuses to join her until the war is over, and they part as the train leaves.\n\nParagraph 15: Kory Sheets started the 2013 CFL season with his career's best performance, rushing for 131 yards. He then beat his career best the following week, July 5, 2013, amassing 133 yards on the ground. The very next week he beat his career best again posting 178 rushing yards, helping the Riders to a 3-0 start to the season. Sheets owns the record of \"Most Rushing Yards In The First Three Games Of A Season\", being the first player in CFL history to have 442 rushing yards in the first three games of a season, earning \"Offensive Player of The Week\" in the CFL for Week 3. He ran for 130 yards in Week 4 and 140 yards in game 5, extending his consecutive games with 100 yards to 5 (142.5 average per-game). As result he now has the record for both \"Most Rushing Yards In The First Four Games Of A Season\" and \"Most Rushing Yards In The First Five Games Of A Season\". In Week 6, Sheets ran 133 yards against the Stampeders, going six consecutive games with 100+ yards rushing. Sheets' 6 game 100 yard rushing streak came to an end on August 17, 2013 (Week 8); rushing for 73 yards. However, the next week, on August 24 against the Edmonton Eskimos, Sheets ran for 139 yards and 2 touchdowns and was named Offensive Player of The Week.  Following the Roughriders game on October 19, Sheets was named the Offensive Player of the Week for Week 17. He rushed for 148 yards with 25 carries and one touchdown in the 35-14 win over the BC Lions.  This game was the ninth 100-yard rushing game by Sheets that season, tying him with George Reed for the Saskatchewan franchise record. Kory Sheets finished the season with 1,598 rushing yards, 215 yards behind Jon Cornish who led the league with 1813 rushing yards.\n\nParagraph 16: The film follows a group of young, college-going men and women. They spend much of their time hanging out at a downbeat tea shop. There are romantic involvements and clashes with their parents and other family members. Most of all, these young people feel a sense of uncertainty about the future. Urmi (Aparna Sen) is from an affluent family and has a fiancé who is an engineer. All the others are from middle-class families. Arun (Swaroop Dutta) resents being made to run small errands for his parents.  Halfway through the film, the graduation ceremony of the class takes place. As they listen to the platitudes being dished out from the stage, it is brought home to them that their carefree student days are over. Sujit (Mrinal Mukherjee) is in a relationship with Runu (Moushumi Chatterjee). However, they can't think of marriage until he has a job. He goes for a job interview which turns into a nightmare. Urmi invites the whole group to her place for high tea, and introduces them to her fiancé (Subhendu Chatterjee in a special appearance). Her friends are impressed by the big house and the refined lifestyle. However, the evening only reinforces their feeling of uncertainty about the future. Soon after the tea-party, it is discovered that Arun's mother has brain cancer. Meanwhile, Biman's girl friend Nandini runs away from home, and declares that she won't go back. The whole group pools in efforts to get the couple married and find them a temporary place to live in. Tiklu, who appears to be unromantic, even cynical, diverts money from his family's printing business to help the couple, and is mercilessly beaten up. Arun and  Urmi have a long conversation about life and love. Sujit stuns the group by announcing that he has landed a job. They have a celebration party at Biman and Nandini's place. Soon after, Arun's mother dies. A few days later, Arun gets a phone call from Urmi, asking him to meet her urgently. She informs him that she is pregnant, and that her fiancé has abandoned her and gone off to England. She asks him for help to \"get rid of it\". Arun thinks long into the night, and tells her that their friends will pick her up next morning in a taxi. When Urmi gets off the cab, she is surprised to find that they are not in an abortion clinic, but an office building. Arun tells her that they have an appointment with the registrar of marriages. Urmi protests that she has no intention of burdening him with another man's child. Arun confesses that he has always been in love with her. They get married and prepare to face an uncertain future together.\n\nParagraph 17: Joseph Smith broke with short-lived church leader John C. Bennett in 1841 over the public scandal that arose when Bennett's practice of \"spiritual wifery\" became known, and Nauvoo, Illinois \"rocked with tales that connected Joseph with Bennett's scandals.\" Bennett accused Smith of subsequently introducing new code words for polygamy—\"celestial marriage\", \"plurality of wives\", \"spiritual wifeism\"—to conceal the controversial practice. Sarah Pratt claimed in an 1886 interview that while in Nauvoo over forty years earlier, Smith was attracted to her and intended to make her \"one of his spiritual wives.\" According to Bennett, while Pratt's husband Orson was in England on missionary service, Smith proposed to Sarah by invoking the 1843 polygamy revelation: \"Sister Pratt, the Lord has given you to me as one of my spiritual wives. I have the blessings of Jacob granted me, as he granted holy men of old, and I have long looked upon you with favor, and hope you will not repulse or deny me\", to which Bennett claimed Pratt replied: \"Am I called upon to break the marriage covenant ... to my lawful husband! I never will. I care not for the blessings of Jacob, and I believe in NO SUCH revelations, neither will I consent under any circumstances. I have one good husband, and that is enough for me.\"\n\nParagraph 18: Flint reveals the truth. He was born in 3834 BC, and after falling in battle discovered he could not die. Flint has lived \"lifetimes\" as da Vinci, Brahms, and many others. He built Rayna to be his immortal mate and manipulated Kirk into teaching her how to love. Paranoid about the possibility that the Enterprise crew would reveal him and his location, Flint causes the Enterprise to disappear from orbit and reappear as a tabletop miniature in his laboratory, with the crewmembers in suspended animation. He proposes to keep them that way for up to 2,000 years. Rayna happens into the room and vehemently objects, so he restores the starship to its previous state. When Kirk professes his love for Rayna and pleads with her to leave with him, a fight breaks out between him and Flint for the possession of Rayna. Rayna stops them, claiming her right to choose her own future, and then, overwhelmed by indecision for fear of hurting either Kirk or Flint, dies.\n\nParagraph 19: Castellano did not reprise his role as Clemenza in The Godfather Part II (1974). He was reportedly excluded because Castellano and his agent insisted on having control over the character's dialogue. Director Francis Ford Coppola said that this was untenable, and wrote Castellano's Clemenza out of the movie, creating the new character Frank Pentangeli (played by Michael V. Gazzo) in his place.  This account was disputed by Castellanos widow in a 1991 letter to People magazine. Castellano said he did not have a part in the sequel because he did not believe that the character of Clemenza should become a traitor. He had other disagreements with Coppola, including confusion over how much weight he was expected to gain for the role. Bruno Kirby portrayed Clemenza as a young man in The Godfather Part II. He had played the son of Castellano's character in The Super.\n\nParagraph 20: Don and friends Cyril, Steve and Edwin are bus mechanics at the huge London Transport bus overhaul works in Aldenham, Hertfordshire. During a miserably wet British summer lunch break, Don arrives, having persuaded London Transport to lend him and his friends an AEC Regent III RT double-decker bus. They convert the bus into a holiday caravan, which they drive across continental Europe, intending to reach the South of France. On the way, they are joined by a trio of young women Sandy, Angie and Mimsie, who are a singing group Do-Re-Mi, and change their destination to Athens in Greece, which means passing through Yugoslavia.  They are also joined by a runaway singer Barbara pretending to be a boy, herself being pursued by her mother Stella and agent Jerry.\n\nParagraph 21: Chaosium had previously been involved in the collectible card game (CCG) business in the mid-1990s, printing Mythos, its Cthulhu mythos CCG. Chaosium discontinued the game in 1997 after poor sales. In 2004, Chaosium instead licensed the property to Fantasy Flight Games (FFG), allowing FFG to produce the official Call of Cthulhu Collectible Card Game. It was designed by Eric M. Lang as a more accessible introduction to gaming in the Mythos environment and to provide a fast and lively interplay with the usual elements of the mythos (e.g. arcane tomes and secrets, paranormal investigations, the elder gods and their terrible servants, dark sinister plots, inhuman conspiracies, and dangers from beyond the stars). The game is nominally set in 1928.\n\nParagraph 22: Vailahi entered the 1987 Crockett Cup with Bill Dundee, beating Tim Horner and Mike Rotunda in the opening round and lost to The Super Powers (Dusty Rhodes and Nikita Koloff) in the second round. Vailahi teamed with the likes of Manny Fernandez and Vladimir Petrov throughout 1987. In 1987, he appeared in the movie Body Slam, as Axe, of the tag team called The Cannibals. In late 1987, he formed a team with Ivan Koloff, who was also his coach. During this time, he formed The Powers of Pain with The Warlord and the team began feuding heavily with another team of big men, The Road Warriors (Animal and Hawk). Vailahi made his pay-per-view debut at the Bunkhouse Stampede Finals pay-per-view on 24 January 1988, as a participant in a Steel cage Bunkhouse Stampede. He was the runner-up, being eliminated by Dusty Rhodes. They injured Animal's eye in storyline during a weightlifting contest and soon after teamed with Ivan Koloff to beat Rhodes and Road Warriors to win the NWA World Six-Man Tag Team Championship at a live event on 12 February. Koloff and Powers of Pain would lose to Rhodes and Road Warriors in a barbed wire match at Clash of the Champions I on 27 March. The following month, Powers of Pain entered the 1988 Crockett Cup, defeating Mark Starr and Chris Champion in the second round and Road Warriors in the quarter-final and lost to eventual winners Lex Luger and Sting in the semi-final. In April 1988, Crockett decided he wanted the feuding tag teams to have a series of scaffold matches, which neither team wanted because they felt that they were too large to safely participate. This was especially so for the Powers of Pain, who were scheduled to lose the matches by falling off the scaffolding. Barbarian and Warlord decided to leave the company. The NWA announcers explained that the Road Warriors had run them off, even though they still held the World Six-Man Tag Team Championship.\n\nParagraph 23: The inverted pyramid marks the intersection of two main underground walkways beneath the Place du Carrousel and orients visitors towards the museum entrance under the Cour Napoléon. Tensioned against a ,  square steel caisson frame, the inverted pyramidal shape in laminated glass points downward towards the floor. The glass of the pyramid itself is  thick, while the glass above the pyramid at courtyard (ground) level, which must be able to support the weight of pedestrians, is  thick. The tip of the pyramid is suspended  above floor level.  Individual glass panes in the pyramid are connected by stainless-steel crosses  in length.

{"input": "The 1926 United States House of Representatives elections took place on November 2, 1926, with the exception of Maine, which held its elections on September 13. These elections occurred during President Calvin Coolidge's second term. Although the Republican Party, led by Coolidge, lost some seats to the Democratic Party, they still maintained a majority in the House of Representatives. The main national issues at the time revolved around the government's relationship with business and providing social aid, but no single issue dominated the election. Additionally, the Farmer-Labor Party, a small populist party, won two seats in the election.", "context": "Paragraph 1: Bodine's career in Cup started at Watkins Glen International Raceway on August 9, 1992 when he was 28 years old. He raced the No. 34 Diet Pepsi Ford Thunderbird for Cicci-Welliver Racing, finishing 37th. It was revealed in 2022 in The Scene Vault Podcast, that though the listed owner was Cicci-Welliver, the car was in fact owned by, and the team of, Junie Donlavey of Donlavey Racing. They re-numbered Junie's car as a team \"rental\" to further the attention of Bodine's Busch Series team. Bodine revealed in the podcast that the technicality of the listed car owner was disappointing after Donlavey's death in 2014, Todd was not listed as one of \"Junie's Army\", or Junie's many Cup Series drivers, as the two were friends. His first full-time season came in 1994 when he raced for Butch Mock Motorsports.  He raced the No. 75 Ford Thunderbird sponsored by Factory Stores. He missed one race the whole season and scored two Top 5s and seven Top 10s on his way to a 20th-place position in the points standings. He was unable to match those statistics in 1995 as he finished 33rd in the points with only one Top 5 and three Top 10s. Following his release from Butch Mock, Bodine spent 1996, filling in for Bill Elliott in a four-race span, finishing 10th at Pocono. He also drove three races apiece for David Blair Motorsports and Andy Petree Racing. In 1997, he filled in for Ricky Craven at Hendrick Motorsports at Texas and for his brother, Geoff at Charlotte Motor Speedway, before he won the pole at Watkins Glen for Cicci-Welliver in a one-race deal. He finished 35th due to engine problems in that race. Todd started races for five different teams in 1997. At Loudon, he relieved Jeff Burton, who had an inner ear problem, and exited his Roush Racing car after 68 laps.\n\nParagraph 2: He went on to form a stable known as The Dynasty, consisting of himself, Scorpio Sky, Scott Lost, and Chris Bosh. The four screwed the then PWG World Tag Team Champs Super Dragon and Davey Richards, ending their dominant reign as tag champs. Ryan would proceed to give Super Dragon a Moustache Ride through two tables, putting him on the shelf. After holding the PWG World Championship for a little over a year, winning usually due to cheating and interference, Ryan lost the title to Human Tornado in a Guerrilla Warfare match on January 13, 2007, at Based on a True Story. On January 27, 2008, Ryan and Scott Lost were awarded the PWG World Tag Team Championship after the titles were stripped off Super Dragon and Davey Richards. They eventually lost the belts to El Generico and Kevin Steen on March 21 at 1.21 Gigawatts. During the summer of 2009, Ryan attempted to stop Chris Hero's reign as the PWG World Champion in order to retain his record as the longest reigning PWG World Champion in history, but after he failed to regain the title in two separate title matches, Hero broke Ryan's record on August 17, 2009. Shortly afterwards Ryan turned face and on September 5, entered the 2010 Battle of Los Angeles, defeating Chuck Taylor in his first round match. The following night Ryan defeated Austin Aries and Claudio Castagnoli to advance to the finals, where he defeated Chris Hero to win the 2010 Battle of Los Angeles. After his win, Ryan dubbed himself \"The Hollywood Submission Machine\" and adopted a new submission finishing maneuver, the End Scene. When Davey Richards was after the tournament stripped of the PWG World Championship, Ryan and the three other Battle of Los Angeles semi-finalists, Brandon Gatson, Chris Hero and Claudio Castagnoli, were placed in a four-way match to determine a new champion. On October 9, 2010, at The Curse of Guerrilla Island, Ryan failed in his attempt to regain the PWG World Championship, when he was defeated by Claudio Castagnoli. Ryan received a one–on–one shot at the PWG World Championship on April 9, 2011, but was again defeated by Castagnoli. Afterwards, Ryan began regularly teaming with the returning Scorpio Sky and on August 20, the two defeated the RockNES Monsters (Johnny Goodtime and Johnny Yuma) to become the number one contenders to the PWG World Tag Team Championship. On September 10, Ryan and Sky failed to capture the PWG World Tag Team Championship from The Young Bucks (Matt and Nick Jackson). After signing a contract with Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA), Ryan wrestled his PWG farewell match on December 1, 2012, where he was defeated by Scorpio Sky.\n\nParagraph 3: After the events of the first Goat Story, the Goat leaves old Prague for the fairy cheese kingdom. The king loves cheeses from the castle on a steep hill, because of which, according to the cunning chamberlain Kobyel, he has already emptied the cash register. In the village of Jemmy's Mácou, their children Honzík and Zuzanka and the goat make cheese. The king goes to sleep in the smell of their cheese and picks it up. The mare is amazed in the morning, the cheese makers have already disappeared. If someone does not set them free within three days, they will never see them again. The children go on a rescue expedition with the goat. The King will get intoxicating cheese from Kobyel. A goat with children in a pub under the castle finds out that the road to hell leads through the Devil's Mill. The rescuers will take Tall, Broad, and Sharp-eyed to help. However, they are incompetent. The expedition sees explosions in the distance. Then he sleeps in the woods. The king plays with the cheesecakes, whose \"smell\" drives everyone out of the castle. The expedition arrives at the cottage where the devil's grandmother lives. Honzík subtly picks up her living water. The mare confiscates the king's cheese and puts it in a sack. It inflates like a balloon and hangs over the castle. Lifeguards get lost in the woods. The supernatural power of the three helpers has waned, but in the end, thanks to the Insight, they will find the right direction. The scent attracts the king again. He tells Kobyl that morning and shows him a piece of cheese. Believing that he was ordering cheese, he signs a letter to the chamberlain, according to which he surrenders to the throne in his favor. He has no idea that the servant locked up all the cheese makers in the castle cellar, where they make cheese day and night. The mare on the balcony in the tower changes shape: suddenly it looks like the devil. The rescuers who arrived at the Devil's Mill will see two confused devils at night, but will not talk to them. Suddenly, Kobyl arrives (he has special wings attached) and kidnaps Zuzanka to the castle. The others know him. Honzík \"revives\" the properties of fairy-tale companions with living water and everyone rushes to the castle. Široký drinks water from the castle moat to the waterman. When they get inside the secret corridor, they will return the water. The mare will take the monarch's crown. The throne is his. Panic breaks out. The king hides in the crown hall. The goat and her friends will also arrive there. The mare lets everyone fall into the famine and goes to bed. Zuzanka climbs out of the bag quietly, the rope from the balloon with the cheese runs through the castle and ties Kobyl's toe. As the balloon rises, the Mare pulls through the castle. At the same time, the walls of the famine and cheese factory are broken down, freeing the prisoners. The villain hangs over the castle. The children will meet their parents. The mare will bring the devils from the mill to the band.\n\nParagraph 4: Telling a digital story combines a narrative, whether it be fiction or non fiction, personal or general, and digital media.  Digital media includes imaging, video, sound and all other forms of media then can be portrayed visually, the most simple of digital stories can even be a power point.  The point is to convey a message through imagery, which a lot of times can be more effective then if just conveyed through sound.  Another outlet for digital storytelling can be articulated through some social media sites such as Facebook and Instagram, where one might be constantly posting images accompanied by captions in order to portray the story of one's life. \"A story can be as short as explaining how one misplaced one's keys in the morning or as long as a multivolume autobiography.\" The wonderful thing about telling a digital story is that there really are no rules. However, there are certain guidelines that are tried and true over time that make up better stories. The most important rule is don't be boring, tell a good story and the \"truth\" of a \"story\" lies in a process not the content. Joe Lambert and others who work at Storycenter and other places around the world train people in how to improve their stories during digital storytelling workshops by writing out the story and discussing many options of connecting with the material before recording it in a digital format and editing it into video. When one wants to capture the attention of one's audience, it is important to be passionate about the themes and or characters when telling any story.  In order to sell the story, regardless of the medium, the artist may need to ask oneself about what stories could be more compelling before relating the story to others. Some of the best stories begin with one's own personal insights in order to find an interesting and profound dramatic story. It also has more personal stories to tell.\n\nParagraph 5: Amaral was born in 1933 in Pleasanton, California, USA. His father was Portuguese and his mother was American of Italian descent. Amaral grew up in a rural environment in Pleasanton and remembers that period as \"living in an interior exile\". As a teenager he wrote poetry, which has always been his great source of inspiration. And years later it turned out to be vice versa - because of the lyrical aspect of Amaral's sculptures, drawings, oil paintings and graphic works, these have become illustrations for poems by such poets as Edoardo Sanguineti or Armando Rojas Guardia.After two years at the University of Washington, Seattle (1952–53) where he studied, among other subjects, history of art and architecture, Amaral finally decided for a career in the arts at the Stanford University and in 1954 graduated with a title Bachelor of Arts. \"When I abandoned United States I realized that art is my only option, the only place where I am not a foreigner\". He continued postgraduate studies at the Cranbrook Academy of Art in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan (1954-1955), where he met Colombian visual artist and future wife Olga de Amaral (got married in Colombia in December 1957). Before moving to Bogotá in 1958, Amaral spent two years (1955–57) in the Philippine Islands with the U.S. Navy (obligatory military service). In Bogotá, Amaral started working with a furniture and interior design company. Soon his son was born and Amaral decided to become a full-time artist and began casting bronze sculptures, making collages and abstract drawings. In 1960 his daughter was born. From 1966 to 1967 the Amaral family moved temporarily to New York. In 1967, after coming back to Colombia, Amaral traveled to the US again to teach drawing at the Penland School of the Arts and Crafts in North Carolina. In the same year he also started teaching drawing at the Universidad Jorge Tadeo Lozano in Bogotá. In the years 1970-1972 the Amaral family traveled around Europe, settling down for a longer period in Paris, where in the fall of 1971, at the Albert Loeb gallery, Amaral showed his work for the first time in Europe. The exhibition brought him great critical acclaim. He traveled to Paris again for longer periods in the years 1974-1975 and 1979-1980. In 1989 Amaral taught drawing at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). Currently he lives with his wife in Bogotá and works in Casa Amaral.\n\nParagraph 6: He found his true vein in drama, and produced over 30 plays, after having his first major success with The Man of Airlie (1867), which was shown in London and New York. In 1872 he was engaged by the Lyceum Theatre with an annual salary. Some of his most notable works there were Medea in Corinth, Eugene Aram, Jane Shore, Buckingham, and Olivia, a dramatisation of The Vicar of Wakefield, which had great success. Wills' plays were typically in verse, participating in the revival of verse drama at the time. From this time until 1887 his plays were rarely absent from the London stage.\n\nParagraph 7: The son of Mathieu de Crisafi and Françoise de Grimaldi, he was born in Messina in Sicily. Don Antonio Crisafi and his brother Thomas, who had a  good military background, as he had become Knight of Malta in 1670, took part in a revolt against Spain in Sicily. The important city of Messina had at that time (1674–1678) about 100,000 inhabitants and was a dynamic port with a strategic position in the Mediterranean sea.  When the senate of Messina decided to revolt against Spain, the Crisafi brothers were among the military leaders organising the defence. In 1675, Messina obtained the military support of France which was in war against Spain, and the Crisafi brothers continued fighting under the orders of the Duke of Vivonne, the commander of  the French troops and a noble who was very close to King Louis XIV. Messina was able to resist against Spain and the French fleet was able to win some important naval battles against the combined fleet of Spain and Holland. But, in 1678, Louis XIV concluded the peace of Nimega and Messina was abandoned in the hands of the Spaniards.  Antoine and Thomas Crisafy, like a lot of nobles of Messina, had to flee to France, leaving their assets behind.  Since that time they changed their name in Crisafy, according to the French pronunciation. Probably thanks to their connection with the Duke of Vivonne, they were received in Versailles and obtained a little pension from the Sun King. They were eventually accused of a complot  against France and were imprisoned for a short time at La Bastille, in Paris, before being freed as they were found to be innocent. Then, in April 1684, Louis XIV decided to name them captains and each led a company of the seven that were sent to New France in that year. Despite their difficulty to adapt to the Canadian cold climate, they were among the most brave and capable officers in Canada as confirmed in several letters sent by the Governors of New France to Versailles. In Canada, the Crisafy brothers had the chance to meet Henry de Tonty, the officer of Italian origins whose name is linked to Cavelier de la Salle in the exploration of the Mississippi river and the land of the Indian Illinois. In 1686, they took part with governor de Denonville in the expedition against the Iroquois at Niagara. In 1692, Antoine was given charge of the troops at Sault-Saint-Louis and was able to fend off an attack by 800 Iroquois. In 1696, Thomas died, leaving a very good memory for his personal qualities. Very close to Governor de Calliere, Antoine Crisafy was  named king's lieutenant at Montreal in 1697 and, the following year, appointed Knight of the Order of Saint-Louis. In 1699, he was named king's lieutenant at Quebec City. He married Marie-Claire, the daughter of François-Madeleine-Fortuné Ruette d'Auteuil de Monceaux in 1700. Following the death of François Provost, he became governor at Trois-Rivières. Crisafy died in office and was buried there on May 6, 1709. Neither Antoine nor Thomas had children and they did not become French citizens.\n\nParagraph 8: The Number 4 Shand Mason,  Curricle Ladders (1898) were ordered by the Metropolitan Fire Brigade in 1897, for use at Newtown fire station. The ladders are of a telescopic design and were pulled by a single horse. Following the ladders' arrival in 1898, the Newtown firemen were given a course of instruction. An additional man and horse were subsequently placed at Newtown once the men were conversant with the use of the ladder. A report by Charles Bown (President of the Fire Brigades Board) stated that the ladders proved to be \"a very valuable addition to the equipment of the Brigade\". Whilst attached to Newtown station, the Curricle Ladders was one of four sets of ladders involved in operations to extinguish one of Sydney's most famous major fires - the Anthony Hordern & Sons fire, at Haymarket, in 1901. 'No other fire in Sydney's history has evoked more publicity than the Anthony Hordern & Sons fire of Wednesday 10 July 1901'. This fire destroyed five major high-rise buildings, in which 1200 people were employed. Five people were killed in this blaze: four were burnt to death having been trapped inside the buildings, and another fell  to his death in Gipps Street (he jumped when it became obvious that the brigade's largest ladders could not reach him). These Curricle Ladders operated at this fire alongside another heritage-significant fire engine: No. 18 Shand Mason Steamer (1891) and today, they again stand side by side, on permanent display at the Museum of Fire, Penrith. In 1907, the Curricle Ladders appeared in a Fireman's Manual of Instruction with a brass number \"3\" attached to its hose box, suggesting that at the time, it was attached to Circular Quay fire brigade. This is further supported by a list of the Metropolitan Fire Brigade plant dated: 1 June 1909. Three months later, it was transferred to Headquarters fire station. By July 1913, the Curricle Ladders were at Darlinghurst Fire Station, from where it responded on the 18th of that month to a fire at No. 100 Brougham St, Darlinghurst, in which ten drays and three lorries were alight. It appears that the ladders were not much used at Darlinghurst after that. On 10 December 1917, Station Officer Arthur Wickham recommended that the curricle ladders be removed from Darlinghurst, for since the installation of a motorised engine in September 1913 (with its thirty-five foot ladder), the horse-drawn curricle ladders had not attended a call of fire. District Officer George Grimmond replied, \"I do not consider it advisable to remove same owing to the risk in this portion of this district\". He further advised Mr Wickham that the situation might be reconsidered when a \"motor and 65 foot ladder combination set\" could be installed at Darlinghurst. On 29 November 1922 the Curricle Ladders re-appear at Headquarters: awaiting repairs. They were no longer being drawn by horses; but rather, were towed by truck. The horse-drawn era of the fire brigade was fast drawing to an end, and by this time there were only sixteen brigade horses remaining in Sydney - all of them in the suburbs. The much-needed repairs did not take place, however, until after 26 July the following year. The brigade workshops were too busy to attend to them immediately, and so in the meantime, it was used in connection with the painting of Headquarters. The repairs were carried out after the painting was completed. It is known that the ladders were in service at Newcastle in June 1924, and that they returned to the Sydney Fire District . After being withdrawn from service, the Curricle Ladders were presented to the Powerhouse Museum. In 1979, they were reclaimed by the NSW Fire Brigades and presented to the Museum of Fire, Penrith.\n\nParagraph 9: The 1926 United States House of Representatives elections were elections for the United States House of Representatives to elect members to serve in the 70th United States Congress. They were held for the most part on November 2, 1926, while Maine held theirs on September 13. They occurred in the middle of President Calvin Coolidge's second term.  Coolidge's Republican Party lost seats to the opposition Democratic Party, but it retained a majority. The most pressing national matters at the time were fragmented, generally related to government's relationship to business or to providing social aid. However, no predominant issue was able to cast a shadow over the election. The small, populist Farmer–Labor Party also held two seats following the election.\n\nParagraph 10: On February 13, 2021, Espanto released his cover of LANY's song entitled, \"If This Is The Last Time\", as part of a project with various artists under MCA Music Inc. (Philippines), in coordination with Universal Music Group. On February 20, 2021, Espanto and AC Bonifacio joined the Your Face Sounds Familiar (Philippine season 3) family as online hosts via the KaFamiliar Online and other digital platforms, weekly episode of which airs every Saturday and Sunday. On April 18, 2021, Espanto did a homecoming production on ASAP Natin 'To where he was formally launched as \"Asia's Pop Heartthrob\" Darren. On May 28, 2021, Espanto released his newest single written and produced by Zack Tabudlo with the title, \"Tama Na\", under MCA Music Inc. (Philippines). The song climbed to number 3 of Apple's iTunes store Philippines in the first two hours of its release. On June 9, 2021, Espanto was launched as the main host for the weekly online show for TNT PH called TNT PopShow, along with co-host Adrianna So. On June 19, 2021, Espanto has successfully held a sold-out digital concert called \"Darren: Home Run (The Comeback Concert)\". A re-run of this event was made available on June 20, 2021. Also on June 20, 2021, Espanto and his team released the official music video of \"Tama Na\" which secured the top spot of music videos on Apple's iTunes store Philippines a day after its release, and reached Top 10 of YouTube's trending videos in music on its first week. On July 11, 2021, Espanto was the special guest performer on the 2021 Bb. Pilipinas' Coronation Night where he performed \"Together We Fly\" composed and re-arranged by Ms. Chochay Magno. On August 27, 2021, Star Music released the \"Marry Me, Marry You\" official soundtrack album which includes tracks interpreted by various artists including Espanto who interpreted the main OST of the series also entitled \"Marry Me, Marry You\". The song skyrocketed to number 10 of the Apple's iTunes store on the day of its release. On September 29, 2021, Espanto was reappointed as UNDP Philippines' Youth Advocate for the SDGs for a second term, focusing on climate action, biodiversity conservation and youth empowerment. On November 21, 2021, Espanto performed in one of the world's grandest World Expo, the Expo 2020 Dubai, representing the Philippines along with December Avenue. On November 23, 2021, ABS-CBN, in partnership with iQIYI Philippines, announced its first original Filipino shows to be streamed via the iQIYI app. These include \"Lyric and Beat\", a teen musical show where Espanto will be part of the main casts along with Andrea Brillantes, Seth Fedelin, AC Bonifacio, Sheena Belarmino, Jeremy Glinoga and Angela Ken. The series will premiere in 2022. On November 26, 2021, Espanto appeared as one of the special guests in Maymay Entrata's \"MPowered\" virtual concert.\n\nParagraph 11: Titan Quest was the brainchild of game designer Brian Sullivan: while he was working on Age of Empires, which sported a Grecian setting, he came up with the concept of creating a similar game while including the region's mythology. The concept work for Titan Quest began in 2000, when its developer Iron Lore Entertainment was formed by Sullivan and Paul Chieffo. The two brought together a skeleton team to create a demo with which to find a publisher. During this time, the game was described by producer Jeff Goodsill as being \"on the drawing board\". The creative leads on the project were Sullivan, Chieffo, programmer Max McGuire, and artists Rich Sullivan and Josh McHugh. According to Sullivan, the pre-production process lasted over a year. Iron Lore's January 2004 pitch to THQ was successful, and development began once they had secured a contract in 2004. The initial staff up to that time was just nine people working in a small office area: when production started and further staff were hired, the team size grew to 38, which included temporary and late development additions. Sullivan was involved in multiple areas of the development, but his main responsibility was game design and overseeing content creation. Titan Quest was aimed at both casual and hardcore gamers, as the necessary prices for games necessitated reaching out to a wide audience to get a profit. For this reason, the team chose the action role-playing genre. Developing the game was made more difficult by the necessity to create Iron Lore around it, recruiting and training new staff. Other studios were also involved with development. Towards the end of development, Demiurge Studios was brought in to help with the final stages during the alpha-beta-ship stages. Demiurge first helped with memory optimization; then worked on the level editor and modification functions so they worked as an independent function; and finally created installers for both the demo and the main game. Demiurge's involvement gave Iron Lore more time and energy to devote to fixing bugs and polishing gameplay. The CGI opening cinematic was created by Blur Studio.\n\nParagraph 12: During the 13th century, the majority of Estonians along the coasts were converted to Catholicism during the Livonian Crusade led by the Teutonic Order. During this time, the majority of Setos lived under the Novgorod Republic and remained followers of their native Baltic religion. Over the next two hundred years, the Setos were converted to Orthodox Christianity due to the influence from the neighboring Slavic states, but incorporated elements of their earlier pre-Christian religion. An early prevailing belief of the origin of the Seto community was that they were ethnic Estonians who had migrated east and adopted Orthodox Christianity under the influence of the Novgorod Republic.\n\nParagraph 13: In the financial literature, sterilization is a term commonly used to refer to operations of a central bank that mitigate the potentially undesirable effects of inbound capital: currency appreciation and inflation. Depending on the source, sterilization can mean the relatively straightforward recycling of inbound capital to prevent currency appreciation and/or a range of measures to check the inflationary impact of inbound capital. The classic way to sterilize the inflationary effect of the extra money flowing into the domestic base from the capital account is for the central bank to use open market operations where it sells bonds domestically, thereby soaking up new cash that would otherwise circulate around the home economy. A central bank normally makes a small loss from its overall sterilization operations, as the interest it earns from buying foreign assets to prevent appreciation is usually less than what it has to pay out on the bonds it issues domestically to check inflation. In some cases, however, a profit can be made. In the strict textbook definition, sterilization refers only to measures aimed at keeping the domestic monetary base stable; an intervention to prevent currency appreciation that involved merely buying foreign assets without counteracting the resulting increase of the domestic money supply would not count as sterilization. A textbook sterilization would be, for example, the Federal Reserve's purchase of $1 billion in foreign assets. This would create additional liquidity in foreign hands. At the same time, the Fed would sell $1 billion of debt securities into the US market, draining the domestic economy of $1 billion. With $1 billion added abroad and $1 billion removed from the domestic economy, the net capital inflow that would have influenced the currency's exchange rate has undergone sterilization.\n\nParagraph 14: By that time, shop gear and masts got damaged; while the health conditions of private soldiers were also unsatisfactory. On February 21, sailor Fedor Istomin died on Mirny. According to doctor Galkin, he died of Typhoid fever, though the Bellingshausen's report states that it was just a \"nervous fever\". On March 3, expedition participants observed significant noctilucent clouds: \"On the south we first observed two white-blue pillars, looking as fosforic fire that went out of clouds at a speed of rockets; every pillar was three sun diameter width. Thus this shining took that amazed us expanded on the horizon for almost 120°, passing zenith. Finally, closer to the end of the phenomenon, the whole sky was covered with such pillars. On March 4, we observed a different picture: \"all-sky, from the horizon at 12 or 15°, was covered with rainbow colored strips that as fast as a flash of lightning ran from south to north, and changed its color constantly\"; this phenomenon allowed the crews to get away from a collision with iceberg. Sailors on Mirny even claimed that the \"sky is on fire\". On March 4, Mikhailov depicted the biggest icebergs that they met during the travel, the height of which reached 408 pounds (122 meters), that even exceeded the height of the [Saints Peter and Paul Cathedral in Saint Petersburg. This day it was decided that the sloops would part: Vostok will travel directly to Sidney, while Mirny would explore vast territory to the South of Van Diemen's Land (Tasmania). Since there were more people on Vostok than on Mirny, for the period of Great Lent, Bellingshausen transferred to his board a priest who would have to return to Lazarev in Australia. As a result, the vessel lost topsails and staysails. Sailor hammocks were put on shrouds to perform a function of storm sails. Besides, the ship was carried into cohesive ice fields. Further, the waves leveled upwind hooks, water backstay, and krambal backstay on bowsprit. The crew put a great effort to save the mast from collapse. At night, it was \"very unpleasant to see the movement of parts of the sloop, and listen to its cracking\". At 3 am on March 10 Vostok passed destroying iceberg by a miracle. The weather was so bad that on March 11 it was impossible to control the vessel, and the ship just followed the wind, and wet snow made it impossible to make any outdoor repairs. Only by midnight on March 12, the weather got a bit better, and on March 13 the crew saw its last iceberg on the way to Australia.\n\nParagraph 15:  Road Test: As with all seasons of the show since the seventh season, the show's decisive drive takes place on the streets of Hamilton, Ontario, this year in a rented 2016 Chevrolet Corvette, with the beginning and ending at the Pier 7 Boardwalk on Discovery Drive. Tyler is up first and commits several errors while driving through the city, including running red lights, making unsafe, illegal turns and nearly failing to get onto the Chedoke Expressway, which he only remedies with an extremely unsafe lane change. After getting onto the highway, the rest of his drive goes without incident, but he ultimately racks up six ticketable offenses that would have cost $1,090 had he been caught. Daniella's drive up until she merges onto the Chedoke Expressway is virtually flawless, despite running a red light at the intersection of Golf Links Road and Stone Church Road early on, but she ultimately crumbles while on the highway to the point where she becomes so nervous and indecisive that Andrew has to guide her through every single decision she makes, something which persists even as she re-enters Hamilton and takes Andrew back to the starting parking lot. Krystal's run is last and, by far, the worst of the three, as she drives in an aggressive and highly unsafe manner throughout, often driving as much as 20 km/h over the limit (something that leaves Cam practically speechless), running red lights and stop signs, making illegal turns, one of which damages the rental car's wheel hubs, as she makes an ill-advised U-turn on James Street South, causing Krystal to become completely unglued to the point she wants to quit her drive right then and there, forcing Andrew to take over and drive into a nearby parking lot to allow Krystal to reconsider quitting her drive, although she would have been better off quitting her drive, as she races against other drivers and cuts them off, making lane changes without signaling or using her mirrors and generally being hostile toward Andrew. The final straw comes when, heading back to the starting point, Krystal responds to Andrew's requests to slow down by deliberately taking a corner at a dangerously unsafe speed, after which she shouts back at Andrew and defiantly makes a sudden brake when Andrew requests Krystal to pull over and stop. After this, Andrew finally decides that he has had enough and, for only the second time in the show's history (after the ninth season), calls a complete halt to the final drive, gets out of the car and storms off, to which Krystal replies by flipping him off and driving back to the starting point without him, leaving Andrew to head back to the starting point with a camera crew. \n\nParagraph 16: The United States lobbied against the resolution being brought to the UNGA, while Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman said that it was only exacerbating the situation and that a vote would trigger \"an extreme response from us.\" However, following Operation Pillar of Defense, and under pressure from the United States, Israel stopped its threats of punishment to Abbas for going ahead with the move to the UN. Lieberman also went to New York City to meet Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, while Ambassador Ron Prosor was scheduled to speak after Abbas. Israeli former Prime Minister Ehud Olmert wrote: \"I believe that the Palestinian request from the United Nations is congruent with the basic concept of the two-state solution. Therefore, I see no reason to oppose it. Once the United Nations will lay the foundation for this idea, we in Israel will have to engage in a serious process of negotiations, in order to agree on specific borders based on the 1967 lines, and resolve the other issues. It is time to give a hand to, and encourage, the moderate forces amongst the Palestinians. Abu-Mazen  (Mahmoud Abbas) and Salam Fayyad need our help. It's time to give it.\" There was a rally in support of the Palestinian bid in Tel Aviv's Rothschild Boulevard, which was organised by Gush Shalom, Peace Now, Hadash and Meretz. Former Foreign Ministry director Dr. Alon Liel said: \"As of today there is a Palestinian state. As of today we no longer control the life of a nation but the life of a separate state.\" Former Meretz MK Mossi Raz said: \"We call on Lieberman and Netanyahu: It's not too late. Order the ambassador to say 'Israel yes.'\" Arab-Israeli singer Mira Awad also performed at the rally and said that she was \"happy with Abbas' bid and very sad about the inexplicable refusal to finally give the Palestinian people a chance to move forward.\" Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard was criticised by Jewish groups for not rejecting the motion; she had initially wished to vote against the measure, but abstained instead due to opposition from her own cabinet and caucus. Netanyahu later downplayed the importance of the vote in saying that \"the decision at the United Nations will change nothing on the ground. It will not advance the establishment of a Palestinian state. It will delay it further. No matter how many hands are raised against us there is no power on earth that will cause me to compromise on Israel's security.\"\n\nParagraph 17: Five-hundred-and-seventy-seven overweight or moderately obese adults (BMI 25-39.9) were recruited nationally, primarily from large employers. Those randomly assigned to the treatment group received a stage-matched multiple behavior change guide and a series of tailored, individualized interventions for three health behaviors that are crucial to effective weight management: healthy eating (i.e., reducing calorie and dietary fat intake), moderate exercise, and managing emotional distress without eating. Up to three tailored reports (one per behavior) were delivered based on assessments conducted at four time points: baseline, 3, 6, and 9 months. All participants were followed up at 6, 12, and 24 months. Multiple Imputation was used to estimate missing data. Generalized Labor Estimating Equations (GLEE) were then used to examine differences between the treatment and comparison groups. At 24 months, those who were in a pre-Action stage for healthy eating at baseline and received treatment were significantly more likely to have reached Action or Maintenance than the comparison group (47.5% vs. 34.3%). The intervention also impacted a related, but untreated behavior: fruit and vegetable consumption. Over 48% of those in the treatment group in a pre-Action stage at baseline progressed to Action or Maintenance for eating at least 5 servings a day of fruit and vegetables as opposed to 39% of the comparison group. Individuals in the treatment group who were in a pre-Action stage for exercise at baseline were also significantly more likely to reach Action or Maintenance (44.9% vs. 38.1%). The treatment also had a significant effect on managing emotional distress without eating, with 49.7% of those in a pre-Action stage at baseline moving to Action or Maintenance versus 30.3% of the comparison group. The groups differed on weight lost at 24 months among those in a pre-Action stage for healthy eating and exercise at baseline. Among those in a pre-Action stage for both healthy eating and exercise at baseline, 30% of those randomized to the treatment group lost 5% or more of their body weight vs. 16.6% in the comparison group. Coaction of behavior change occurred and was much more pronounced in the treatment group with the treatment group losing significantly more than the comparison group. This study demonstrates the ability of TTM-based tailored feedback to improve healthy eating, exercise, managing emotional distress, and weight on a population basis. The treatment produced the highest population impact to date on multiple health risk behaviors.", "answers": ["Paragraph 9"], "length": 6421, "dataset": "passage_retrieval_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "15bea5614344e37d6157ed6d2b604496555f0c35ef84c94a"}
{"input": "Mick Campbell is a former resident of the House of Anubis. He is initially dating Amber but breaks up with her due to her involvement with Sibuna. He develops a crush on Mara and they kiss, but Mick tells his friends that he is not interested in her, causing Mara to change her behavior and become set on ruining him. However, they eventually become a couple after kissing during a school play. Mara tries to get Mick expelled by doctoring photos of him with a teacher, but Mick forgives her after she confesses. They decide to remain just friends but eventually get back together and support each other. Mick bribes a student to help Mara win the school election, but she breaks up with him out of anger. They reconcile when he apologizes with a cheer and they start a water fight. Mick also takes dance lessons from Amber for the prom and helps his friends encourage Fabian to confess his feelings for Nina. Mick and Mara have an on-again, off-again relationship and attend prom together at the end of season 1. Mick is not part of the Sibuna club.", "context": "Paragraph 1: Since entering service in the late 1970s, these small but agile and sophisticated submarines were continuously upgraded with newer systems to maintain their technological edge. They were somewhat unusual in that all boats of the class were at one point equipped with six-tube retractable Blowpipe surface-to-air missile launchers controlled from inside the boat, though these were later removed. The Israeli newspaper Maariv reports that Gal-class submarines were active in the 1982 Lebanon War. During the war, a Gal-class submarine fired two torpedoes and sank a Lebanese refugee boat, killing 25 people on board. During 1983 torpedo tube launched Sub-Harpoon anti-ship missiles and associated fire control systems were added to all boats of the Gal class. NT 37E torpedoes were acquired to replace the older Mk 37 models in 1987–88. All extensively overhauled in 1994–95, including improved sensors and fire control system. \n\nParagraph 2: At the 2004 World Single Distance Speed Skating Championships in Seoul he achieved the silver medal at this distance, only allowing Jeremy Wotherspoon to be faster. He became Russian Sprint Champion three times in a row, and was, because of his recently shown progress, a favourite to win an Olympic medal in the 500 metres distance at the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin. But in the summer of 2005, when his trainer Sergey Klevchenya organised a football-game, Lobkov got injured. His preparation for the Olympics was therefore too short. In his favourite 500 metres distance Lobkov ranked himself in fourteenth place.\n\nParagraph 3: Some, typically the younger generations, now cultivate rice and garden vegetables but many rely on their diets of sago (starch from the sago palm), jungle fruits and their prey which usually include wild boar, barking deer, mouse deer but also snakes (especially the reticulated python or kemanen), monkeys, birds, frogs, monitor lizards, snails and even insects such as locusts. Since they practice 'molong', they pose little strain on the forest: they rely on it and it supplies them with all they need. They are outstanding hunters and catch their prey using a 'kelepud' or blowpipe, made from the Belian Tree (superb timber) and carved out with unbelievable accuracy using a bone drill – the wood is not split, as it is elsewhere, so the bore has to be precise almost to the millimetre, even over a distance of 3 metres. The darts are made from the sago palm and tipped with poisonous latex of a tree (called the Tajem tree, Antiaris toxicaria) found in the forest which can kill a human in a matter of minutes. Everything that is caught is shared as the Penan have a highly tolerant, generous and egalitarian society, so much so that it is said that the nomadic Penan have no word for 'thank you' because help is assumed and therefore doesn't require a 'thank you'. However, 'jian kenin' [meaning 'feel good'] is typically used in settled communities, as a kind of equivalent to 'thank you'.\n\nParagraph 4: Guerrero Negro Jr. was introduced as part of Generacion 2012 in the fall of 2012. Generacion 2012 included Herodes Jr., Taurus, Genesis, Oro Jr., Espanto Jr. and Akuma. Generacion 2012 was not a group, but more the \"graduating class\" from the CMLL wrestling school. Some, like Guerrero Negro Jr., were not actual rookies but they had never worked for CMLL before and only made their CMLL debut after extensive training in the CMLL wrestling school. Guerrero Negro Jr. teamed up with Herodes Jr. for his CMLL debut on August 18, 2013, losing to the team of Genesis and Höruz in the first match of the evening. On January 1, 2013 Guerrero Negro Jr. worked for the CMLL affiliated Toryumon Mexico, wrestling in the Young Dragon's Cup. For the tournament Guerrero Negro Jr. teamed up with fellow Generacion 2012 member Akuma, only to lose to Taurus and Zumba in the first round. On February 1, 2013 Guerrero Negro Jr. made his debut on CMLL's main show, Super Viernes in Arena Mexico, teaming with Camorra as they lost to Soberano Jr. and Sensei in the opening match of the show. In March 2013 Guerrero Negro Jr. was one of 18 wrestlers who competed in the second annual Torneo Sangre Nueva (\"New Blood Tournament\"), a tournament for young or low ranking wrestlers. He competed in qualifying block B on March 5, 2013 for a place in the finals, the other wrestlers in Block B included Genesis, Robin, Sensei, Super Halcón Jr., Disturbio, Guerrero Negro Jr., Inquisidor, Taurus and Zayco who competed in a torneo cibernetico, multi-man elimination match. Oro Jr. was the fifth man eliminated over all when he was pinned by Disturbio. In late March, 2013 Guerrero Negro Jr. was announced as one of the Novatos, or rookies, in the 2013 Torneo Gran Alternativa, or \"Great Alternative tournament\". The Gran Alternativa pairs a rookie with an experienced wrestler for a tag team tournament. Guerrero Negro Jr. was teamed up with the veteran Último Guerrero for the tournament. The team competed in \"Block A\" on April 12, 2013 where they defeated Oro Jr. and Máscara Dorada and the team of Disturbio and Volador Jr. in the second round. In the semi-final the duo lost to Hombre Bala Jr. and Último Guerrero's long time rival Atlantis Picasso left CMLL in April 2014. He got shot in an incident in October 2015. He is expected to return to CMLL early 2016.\n\nParagraph 5: This taking of land led to conflict between the British colonists and the resident Indigenous population of the region. In the early 1870s, Native Police forces based at Waterview under the charge of Sub-Inspectors Thomas Coward and Ferdinand Macquarie Tompson, conducted missions to \"disperse\" groups of \"very troublesome\" Aboriginal people along the Herbert River. Cattle continued to be speared and in 1872 a Native Police detachment captured a group of Aborigines at Daniel Cudmore's property. They were made to gather firewood and were then shot, their corpses being burnt on the gathered wood. In 1873, the local Native Police barracks were moved to Fort Herbert (just west of the modern day town of Ingham) and placed under the command of Sub-Inspector Robert Arthur Johnstone. Over the next seven years, Johnstone conducted numerous punitive expeditions, \"dispersing mobs\" of Aboriginal people around the Herbert River region. James Cassady, a colonist who attempted to protect Aborigines in the region, described how Native Police officers during this period would order the shootings of peaceful Aboriginal people. In once instance, two young boys who survived these shootings were taken and given as presents to other colonists. The Native Police forces in the Ingham region were disbanded in 1881.\n\nParagraph 6: In the South the species is represented by the much larger gordius Sulz. (77 a), of which both sexes are bright yellow-red above, with very prominent and heavy black spots above and yellow instead of blue-grey underside to the hindwing. — There exist nearly all intergradations between gordius and the typical  form, for instance meliboeus Stgr. (77 a), in whose males, which are larger than alciphron, but smaller than most gordius, the yellowish red ground-colour breaks through the dark scaling, though it is less pure than in true gordius: in Greece, Asia Minor and North Persia; Greek specimens differ a little from those from  Anterior Asia, but the differences are not sufficient to justify a separate name. — granadensis Ribbe (77 b) has at the most the size of alciphron, being often even smaller, but the spots of the upperside are larger than even in gordius, with which it agrees in the bright yellowish red colour of the upperside; in Spain. — Among gordius there occur also aberrant specimens which are transitions to the name-typical form. Steffanelli described them as ab. intermedia from Boscolungo in Italy; the hindwing of the female is dark except for a yellowish red submarginal band. Also the black spots may vary in a similar way, as is the case in the preceding species of Chrysophanus: In ab. subfasciata Schultz (77 b), of which the type has been kindly lent to me for figuring, all the spots of the upperside are so large that those of the submarginal row are united to a band which is hardly interrupted by the veins. In ab. mutilata Schultz the ocelli situated in the cells on the underside are strongly developed, while the distal ones are nearly all absent. An aberration of gordius with the ocelli of the underside similarly reduced has received the name ab. evanescens Gillm. In ab. viduata Schultz, an aberration of alciphron, the ocelli of the underside are so weakly represented above that the upperside appears almost without spots, ab. infulvata Schultz is the name for females which are quite uniformly black-brown above, being even devoid of the reddish yellow submarginal band on the hindwing and corresponding to ab. nigra of hippothoe. The phenomenon often observed in hippothoe that the ocelli are modified into streaks is according to Schultz considerably rarer in alciphron; Schultz names such specimens ab. constricta. — Egg, as most Chrysophanus eggs, flattened, green-yellow, with the surface reticulate. Larva from August to early May, green, almost unicolorous, along the back and also on each side a whitish green longitudinal stripe shaded with dark; the head, which is only visible when feeding, black-brown; on Rumex. Pupa fastened near the ground by means of very thin threads, olive-green, with darker shadowy stripes. The butterflies are on the wing in June and July; they are less confined to definite restricted flight-places than the preceding species [hippothoe], but occur much more singly and like drier localities. They are busy visiting flowers, especially those of brambles at sunny waysides; gordius is especially fond of clusters of thyme and Sedum album according to Courvoisier, and ascends in the Alps up to 10 000 ft.\n\nParagraph 7: The series stars Gingka Hagane, a talented blader traveling all around Japan to get stronger so he can defeat the Dark Nebula, an evil organization that is also responsible for the supposed death of Gingka's father, Ryo Hagane. Gingka aims to recover the forbidden bey, Lightning L-Drago, which has been stolen by the Dark Nebula to use its powers to fulfill their wicked ambitions. Along with his bey, Storm Pegasus, Gingka must face and defeat many foes. Gingka's second-biggest rival is Kyoya Tategami, formerly head of a bad blader group, called the Face Hunters. Kyoya's goal is to defeat Gingka. Gingka is the blader who believes that every blader has a blader's spirit in them. The Dark Nebula recruits a blader named Ryuga, who is given L-Drago. He travels around the world, defeating and either recruiting or destroying the Beyblades of other bladers. Gingka battles Ryuga but is defeated. His friends are also defeated, including Kyoya. There is a tournament that the Dark Nebula has secretly organized called Battle Bladers, and Gingka hopes to battle Ryuga in the final match. Phoenix, a masked, mysterious blader that appears at the best times, often saving Gingka, his friends, and his rivals. In a fierce battle with Doji, the head of the Dark Nebula, Phoenix saves Hyoma and Kenta. After Gingka arrives, the ceiling begins to collapse, and a broken piece breaks Phoenix's mask, revealing that Phoenix is Ryo, Gingka's father. Ryo explains how Storm Pegasus and the Lightning L-Drago came into existence. After this event, it is Kyoya vs Ryuga, in which Kyoya starts off great but once the spirits of L-Drago enter and consume Ryuga's body he cannot hold his ground. Ryuga then explains that it is Gingka's fault that every one of his friends has been absorbed by the vicious L-Drago. It is the final battle and Ryuga seems to be using his full power against Gingka. Realizing that his friends will always be with him, he retaliates and calls for Pegasus. Before he can do that, it seems that L-Drago is trying to absorb Ryuga himself, changing him into a dragon/monster-like form. Gingka's friends are extremely worried and confused until Ryo comes and explains that nobody had been able to control L-Drago more than Ryuga. Furthermore, Ryo explains that the Lightning L-Drago is responsible for Ryuga's misbehavior. After that Gingka realizes that he needs to save Ryuga and free him of the dark power held in Lightning L-Drago. He uses a new special move, Galaxy Nova, and defeats L-Drago. Ryuga walks away disappointed, but not because he lost, but because he could not control Lightning L-Drago. Gingka tries to pick up Pegasus but Pegasus disappears because it went past its limits numerous times. Ryo reassures Gingka that Pegasus will come back, the crew then celebrates with Hikaru, Tsubasa, and Kyoya, who have just been released from the hospital.\n\nParagraph 8: After the closure of the Rozières saltworks in 1760 due to a drop in the salt-content of the water, there became available a large quantity of wood floating down to the town of Baccarat. One of the main owners of the Vosges forest where this driftwood came from, namely Monseigneur de Montmorency-Laval, bishop of Metz, wanted to find another use for it and set a lucrative fire pit in Baccarat which became a glassworks. To justify the creation of this enterprise in a request made to the king in 1764 by the owner of the site, Monseigneur de Montmorency-Laval wrote: \"Sire, France lacks artistic glassware, which is why the products from Bohemia enter in such great quantity: from which follows an astonishing export of deniers, at a time when the kingdom would need them so badly”.\n\nParagraph 9: The Medway valley has long been associated with papermaking. In February 2015 it was confirmed that the last major paper mill in the parish, Aylesford Newsprint, was to close with the loss of 233 jobs. Ditton's connection with the industry predates 1667, when a paper mill was already established at an ancient settlement known as Coldharbour, which stood at the northern end of the millpond which can still be found - albeit now bisected by the M20 - just to the northeast of Cobdown House. It is very likely that this mill, which by the nineteenth century had become known as Mill Hall Mill, was the earliest paper mill on the lower tributaries of the River Medway. In the modern era, in 1922, Albert E Reed and Company Limited, who already ran two successful paper mills at Tovil, built a large mill on the banks of the River Medway at New Hythe. Reed International became a major paper manufacturer who, at its height, had in the region of 1,500 employees. The business was seriously hampered by the advent of World War II, which caused a shortage of pulp to make newspapers and led to a different material, waste paper, being used in its place. Waste paper was then replaced by recycled fibre, which was fully utilised in the process of producing newsprint. The 60-acre Newsprint plant belonged to SCA, paper manufacturers from Sweden, in partnership with Mondi, and £250 million was invested in developing the site. Aylesford Newsprint was one of the world's leading manufacturers of newsprint, recycling around 500,000 tonnes of material to produce some 400,000 tonnes of final product. Media organisations in Europe, America, and the Far East relied on the recycled newsprint from the plant for their publications. The East Malling Stream, which at one time turned six mills on its short journey to the River Medway, four of them paper mills, was a vital water supply for the processes carried out in the plant.\n\nParagraph 10: The lieutenant governor of Manitoba (,  (if male) or  (if female) ) is the viceregal representative in Manitoba of the , who operates distinctly within the province but is also shared equally with the ten other jurisdictions of Canada, as well as the other Commonwealth realms and any subdivisions thereof, and resides predominantly in  oldest realm, the United Kingdom. The lieutenant governor of Manitoba is appointed in the same manner as the other provincial viceroys in Canada and is similarly tasked with carrying out most of the monarch's constitutional and ceremonial duties. The present, and 26th, lieutenant governor of Manitoba is Anita Neville, who has served in the role since 24 October 2022.\n\nParagraph 11: The sides form improved through December, with the team building a four match winning run on the back of a poor 2-0 defeat to Heart of Midlothian at Tynecastle on 30 November. However, the final two matches of 2016 saw the side collect only one point from a possible six with a draw away to St Johnstone and defeat in the third Old Firm derby of the season. This left the club second in the table going into 2017 and the mid-season break, two points ahead of third placed Aberdeen although the latter did have a game in hand. The January transfer window saw the club released several former youth prospects who had failed to meet expectations, while Warburton brought in two young loanee signings from English Premier League sides in the shape of Emerson Hyndman and Jon Toral from Bournemouth and Arsenal respectively. However, the lack of any permanent outfield signings drew criticism, as did the performances of the previous summers transfers, with particular focus being placed on the role of Head of Recruitment Frank McParland. On 10 February 2017, manager Warburton, assistant manager David Weir and McParland left Rangers, with the former being replaced by Graeme Murty who was placed in caretaker control of the first-team. Several reasons for the trio departure were highlighted by the media, as well as the club. The first-team's poor performance in the first half of the season a prominent cause, which crystallised after an embarrassing 4-1 defeat away to Heart of Midlothian on 1 February and an insipid 1-1 draw at home to Ross County three days later, a match which proved to be Warburtons last game in charge of Rangers. The poor signing policy was mooted, however, the club also stated that the management team were not committed to the job and reported the team had tendered their resignations five days before being replaced which Warburton later disputed. Early contenders for the role included former Rangers manager Alex McLeish and former Rangers defender Frank de Boer. On Valentine's Day 2017, Managing director Stewart Robertson announced that the club would seek to appoint a Director of Football to work alongside a new first-team manager. Meanwhile, Murty's time in charge, began with a fourth round Scottish cup win over Greenock Morton, however, league formed remained indifferent his first two league matches ende in away defeats to Dundee and Inverness CT. This left the side in third place, six points adrift of Aberdeen, at the beginning of March. A dramatic 3-2 win of St Johnstone saw Murty register his only league win in his six-game spell as manager with his last two games in charge seeing him set up to a Scottish Cup semi-final against Celtic after a 6-0 win over Hamilton Academical, the team's largest win of the season, before drawing the third league Old Firm match. On 11 March, Rangers confirmed Caixinha as the club's sixteenth manager with the Portuguese coach appointed two days later. However, the pursuit of a Director of Football was not as successful as the Board's first choice, Southampton's Ross Wilson, turning down the offer of the role.\n\nParagraph 12: The Lords Appellant were a group of nobles in the reign of King Richard II, who, in 1388, sought to impeach some five of the King's favourites in order to restrain what was seen as tyrannical and capricious rule. The word appellant — still used in modern English by attorneys — simply means '[one who is] appealing'. It is the older (Norman) French form of the present participle of the verb appeler, the equivalent of the English 'to appeal'. The group was called the Lords Appellant because its members invoked a procedure under law to start prosecution of the king's unpopular favourites known as 'an appeal': the favourites were charged in a document called an \"appeal of treason\", a device borrowed from civil law which led to some procedural complications.\n\nParagraph 13: On 15 November 2012, at a press-conference he called over a different issue, former Press editor-in-chief, columnist, and one of its founders Dragan J. Vučićević (at the time the editor-in-chief of Informer) took several questions about the paper's demise. He said on the occasion: \"Towards the end of 2010, Press got hijacked and taken away from me and the other founders by the people from top echelons of the authorities that ran Serbia at the time. They basically blackmailed us with a threat of laying off the 250 staffers that were employed at the paper at the time as well as the threat of making sure our loans don't get re-programmed. From the second half of 2010 until I eventually left in late December 2011 when they wouldn't allow me to continue writing my column, I was neither involved in the paper's business nor its editorial policy. All I did for the paper in 2010 and 2011 was writing a weekly column. Yes, I was listed at the same time as the managing board president of the Press Publishing Group, but it was only a formal title by the decision of some people that made decisions at the time — in reality I had nothing to do with the managing board, which by the way didn't even exist, and I'm not the right man to talk to about what went on in that paper during its last three years of existence. Yes, I was fictitiously listed as the managing board president. As far as Oliver Dulić and the payments from his environmental fund go, I learned of those only after I had already left Press. I had nothing to do with him. If you prove that I ever met him, signed any of his payments, or even talked to him over the phone I'll gladly go to jail. I never took a dinar from Dulić or anyone else from the Tadić authorities. I only suffered under those authorities. During the Tadić era in Serbia, only a few journalists dared to put up consistent and resolute resistance to his tyrannical rule and I feel that resisting Tadić and his cronies is one of the greatest highlights of my career in journalism. Especially under the circumstances when other journalists kept silent while cashing in their integrity from Dulić and other characters like Cole, Krle, and Šane\".\n\nParagraph 14: In 2000, Nelson began his post-collegiate career with the Cape Cod Crusaders of the USISL D3-Pro League.  That season, he earned D2-Pro League Goalkeeper of the Year honors after posting a 0.73 goals against average.  After the Crusaders were eliminated from the playoffs, Nelson joined the Boston Bulldogs of the USL A-League for three games, allowing only one goal.  The Columbus Crew then called him up for the last two games of the Major League Soccer season.  Nelson then moved to Ireland and joined Kilkenny City A.F.C.  He played sixteen league games before gaining his release outside of the transfer window in April 2001.  With that in hand, Nelson returned to the United States and joined the Portland Timbers but was released a month later.  In 2002, he signed with the South Jersey Barons of the USL D3-Pro League.  When the D3-Pro League season ended the last week of July 2002, the Hampton Roads Mariners quickly signed Nelson for the rest of the A-League season.  In 2003, the Mariners became known as the Virginia Beach Mariners.  Nelson stayed with the team through the 2006 season.  The Mariners folded at the end of the 2006 season and Nelson signed with the Harrisburg City Islanders of the USL Second Division in 2007.  That season, he recorded a league-leading ten shutouts and a 10–4–4 record.  He also had the league’s second best goals-against-average at 0.611 and was selected to the USL-2 All-League Second Team while backstopping the Islanders to the USL Second Division championship. On July 27, 2007 the Vancouver Whitecaps acquired Nelson on loan for the last three games of the USL First Division season.  The Whitecaps wanted Nelson to play for them in 2008, but he declined.  Nelson signed with Crystal Palace Baltimore in the USL Second Division on April 7, 2008.  In the second round of the Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup Nelson saved three penalties in a penalty shoot out against his former team, the Islanders, to send Palace through to the next round against MLS side New York Red Bulls.  Against the Red Bulls Nelson kept a clean sheet and made seven saves which helped send Palace through to the quarter finals of the competition against the New England Revolution.  Palace released Nelson from his contract on July 18, 2008 and he was reacquired by the Harrisburg City Islanders for the remainder of the 2008 season.\n\nParagraph 15: Mick Campbell is a former resident of the House of Anubis. His father was a doctor although he was more attached to sports than academics. At the beginning of the series he was dating Amber but broke up with her when she could not attend any of their \"dates\" because of Sibuna. He gained a crush on Mara and kisses her in one episode, however he told Jerome and Alfie that he was not interested, and made it sound like he thought she was boring. This caused her to take on a bad girl personality, and become set on ruining him. He kisses her again during a scene in the school play, but they continue kissing even after the curtain is down. After this they become boyfriend and girlfriend. He thought he would get expelled because Mara took pictures of him and Ms. Robinson training together, cropped and doctored the photos to look like the two were involved with each other, and sent them to Mr. Sweet. He almost was expelled until Mara came in and confessed, saving Mick. However he breaks up with her for it, saying that what she did was sick. He forgives her after she writes him a letter apparently saying sorry 17 times, but they decide to stay just friends. Soon after, he leaves for his sports scholarship tryout. He comes back later, and asks Mara out. She says yes and they become an official couple. He supported Mara all the way during the school election. He bribed Robbie, the ballot counter, for school rep with a date with Patricia. Mara eventually won legitimately because Robbie forgot to put the votes in the ballot box, which he left in his book bag. Mara still broke up with him out of anger, but forgave him when he performed his \"Apology Cheer\" with pom-poms, while wearing a 'Mara I'm Sorry' T-shirt. They made up when they were both doing the dishes, and they started a water fight. He starts taking dance lessons from Amber to prepare to the prom. Near the end of season 1 he(along with Mara and Amber) tried to get Fabian to confess to Nina that he likes her. He and Mara are an on again-off again couple. He goes to prom with Mara at the end of season 1. Mick is not part of the Sibuna club, along with Mara, Jerome & Joy.\n\nParagraph 16: On March 5, 2011, Cotto returned to IWA in a live event alongside Abbad and the WWC Women's Champion La Morena. The tag team was dissolved in the middle of a feud, due to an injury to his partner. Cotto continued to feud for the tag team championships, but once the opportunity took place, he was removed, in order to introduce Savio Vega's student, Diego de Jesús. He was subsequently fired as part of a storyline, returning masked under his El Illegal character. He continued wrestling unmasked in the independent circuit, even challenging for the Extreme Wrestling Organization's heavyweight title under his common character, in a contest that ended in a double disqualification. Cotto went on to pursue a feud with the Intercontinental and Undisputed Heavyweight Champion, Chris Angel. He was initially awarded the Intercontinental belt and Angel's undefeated record, but the result was revoked due to external interference from a second masked \"Illegal\" and an unclean pin. In a rematch, he won the Championship in a two on one contest, pinning Phillip Davian following an attack from a third masked wrestler. Zona 101 reunited on December 10, 2011, in Caribbean Wrestling Federation, an independent promotion based in the south region of Puerto Rico, where he teamed with one half of the CWF Tag Team Champions. The following week, the team was booked over Dennis Rivera and Noel Rodríguez. On December 17, 2011, Cotto won the EWO World Heavyweight Championship, only to be interrupted by IWA president Miguel Pérez. This was in response to a previous confrontation between both, that occurred following a benefit card where Cotto wrestled and defeated Mesias. After defending the title at Tierra de Nadie 2012, Pérez once again reclaimed his contract. This was followed by confrontations in IWA's Histeria Boricua and Kaos & Odissey, which expanded to include EWO's CEO, Richard Rondón, as well. On February 25, 2012, following more intervention from the IWA, Cotto issued a challenge to end the conflict, an unification match for the EWO World Heavyweight Championship and IWA Undisputed World Heavyweight Championship. On March 1, 2012, the challenge was accepted by Pérez and Rondón in a backstage segment. At Clash of the Titans, Cotto lost the EWO World Championship, losing to a masked wrestler only known as \"Bonecrusher\", whom he had defeated to win this belt and had since gained the IWA Undisputed Heavyweight Champion. In this match, a new angle was launched that involved him being involved in \"friendly\" confrontations with the other members of his stable, which was continued in the next event, Payback.\n\nParagraph 17: Tytler contributed papers to The Lounger, including one on the Defects of Modern Female Education in teaching the Duties of a Wife (No. 16). His first independent work, published in 1759, was The Inquiry, Historical and Critical, into the Evidence against Mary Queen of Scots, and an Examination of the Histories of Dr. Robertson and David Hume with respect to that Evidence. Anticipated in its stance of apologetics for Mary Queen of Scots in 1754 by Walter Goodall, his work held the field until the publication in 1869 of John Hosack's Mary Queen of Scots and her Accusers. It went through four editions, was translated into French in 1772, and again in 1860, and it was reviewed by Samuel Johnson and Tobias Smollett. He wrote a supplement on the Bothwell marriage, published in the Transactions of the Antiquarian Society of Scotland in 1792.\n\nParagraph 18: The group formed at the Sin pay-per-view on January 14, 2001. Scott Steiner was defending his title in a four-way match that included Sid Vicious, Jarrett and an unnamed wrestler. Flair inserted Animal as the mystery man and recruited Jarrett so Steiner could keep his title. However, none of it was needed as Sid broke his leg when he came off the ropes for a move. The next night on Nitro, Flair revealed all of this as a plan, announcing the creation of the stable which he named \"The Elite\". That prompted The Insiders (Kevin Nash and Diamond Dallas Page) and Rick Steiner to come out and confront the group as Nash challenged Scott Steiner to a title match. WCW's Commissioner, Ernest Miller, came out and booked the title match, which ended in a disqualification as both sides interfered. On the following episode Thunder, Miller booked Totally Buff in a match against KroniK, which they won after Jarrett interfered. DDP came to help and Flair booked him and Jarrett to fight in the main event. That match ended in no contest as Nash, KroniK, Miller, Scott Steiner, Luger, Bagwell and Animal interfered. On a special Tuesday Nitro, Nash demanded a title shot against Steiner at SuperBrawl Revenge, which Flair agreed to if Nash will defeat Buff  that night. Miller booked a match between Luger and DDP, where the winner will ref the Nash-Buff match, and banned Buff and Nash from interfering in that match. Luger won the match after Jarrett hit DDP with a guitar. Nash won his match after DDP knocked Luger out and counted the pin with Luger's hand, prompting a big brawl in the ring. The next edition of Thunder, KroniK fought against Steiner and Animal and won. A brawl ensued after the match, while Nash and DDP were knocked out in their locker room after an attack earlier that night.\n\nParagraph 19: Lee, now realizing that she was, in her previous life, a Japanese soldier, made efforts to compensate for the atrocities she committed in her previous life. Deciding to repay Big before she dies, Lee decided to find Big's childhood friend's killer, and she thinks the killer is hiding in the mountains somewhere. She went to the mountains and on the sixth day of her journey, she encounters the killer at a part of the mountains where Big never went to find his friend's killer. The killer runs away from her while she tries to help him. Then, the killer comes behind her, and drags her to a rocky place where she was hit by a rock in the head, and beheaded by the murderer. The whole incident was recorded by her video camera. The video camera was retrieved after a search party to look for her. Big saw the video after a police officer showed it to him and he gets angry and goes to the mountains. When he was on the mountains, he heard Lee's watch. He followed the sound to her buried body in the ground and her head in a tree. He became enraged and pursued a man, presuming he is Lee's killer into an underground temple. Big, expecting to find the killer in the temple but found his future self, a killer, bloodthirsty and vengeful. They argued and fought and came to terms peacefully in meditation.\n\nParagraph 20: Slide to Plays Tyler Feasel criticized the arena-based gameplay, and argued that a standard campaign mode would have been preferable. He was especially critical of the energy system, saying: \"To wait 30 minutes to \"earn\" a few minutes of gameplay is deflating and leaves the experience with a sour taste.\" He concluded that \"The Drowning doesn't feature a solid story or nuanced gameplay, but its solid arcade-shooting mixed with a nice amount of unlocks helps deliver a positive gameplay experience. Unfortunately this fun is crippled by an unbalanced timer system that limits game time in favor of an in-app purchase.\" MacLifes Chris Pereira said: \"While certainly enjoyable at times, The Drownings free-to-play implementation hampers the game to an inexcusable degree.\" Chris Carter of Destructoid was critical of the control system, writing, \"the overly-simplistic layout does not work.\" However, his strongest criticisms were in relation to the IAP system, writing, \"in the hands of another developer, The Drowning would have been something special. Without the energy mechanic and constant drip-fed weapon and item parts, I could easily see myself destroying an entire afternoon blasting apart zombies.\" Eurogamers Dan Whitehead was even more critical. He called the control system \"a clumsy and unnatural way to play an FPS.\" He was also heavily critical of the IAP system's integration into the core gameplay, saying: \"This is a game that cannot wait to start asking you to pay, and has at least four interlocked currencies designed to make you feel like you should. To assume that sort of aggressive monetisation isn't a factor in the game's obstructive, uphill design, which ekes out progress to non-paying players painfully slowly, is to be willfully blind to how this sort of thing works.\" He concluded that The Drowning \"is a transaction machine first, a headline-grabbing control scheme second and an actual game a distant third.\" Pocket Gamers Peter Willington was equally critical, writing, \"First-person shooters today are far more complex than The Drowning ever attempts to be. [...] Playing The Drowning is like travelling back in time to the Quake era - walk about a level and shoot everything until you win.\" He called the game \"a failed experiment,\" writing: \"The game ultimately fails at reinventing first-person shooter controls [...] fails at opening up the first-person shooter to the freemium model [...] fails at being a decent first-person shooter [...] It suffers from a paucity of enemy types, locations that barely change the way you play, minimal peripheral awareness, and some of the most rote shooting available on a touchscreen device.\"\n\nParagraph 21: Modern historians believe little, if any, of the detail provided by Livy for this battle derive from authentic records. Livy's battle-scenes for this time period are mostly free reconstructions by him and his sources, and as the historic first battle between Romans and Samnites the Battle of Mount Gaurus would be particularly susceptible to such inventions. Samnite losses have clearly been exaggerated. The role of Valerius Corvus in the events of the First Samnite War might have been exaggerated as well, especially, if as Salmon(1967) held, Valerius Antias was Livy's chief source for this part of his work, but other historians than Antias were capable of exaggerating the Valerii as well. Salmon(1967) suspected Valerius' victories in 343 could be doublets of Roman operations against Hannibal in the same area in 215, he also doubted the location of the battle at Mount Gaurus, close to Cumae, but far from Capua. Since the testimony of the Fasti Triumphales require some degree of Roman success in 343 and arguing that in this time period the Romans were more likely to defeat the Samnites on level than mountainous ground, Salmon(1967) therefore proposed that there was only one battle in 343 which was fought on the outskirts of Capua near the shrine of Juno Gaura, which Livy or his source has then confused with Mount Gaurus. This would explain Livy's description of the Capuans coming out to congratulate the Romans. The battle might not have been such a total rout of the Samnites as Livy describes. Fighting interrupted by nightfall was often used by Roman historians to hide Roman failures. This reconstruction is rejected by Oakley(1998) who does not believe there are any doublets in Livy's account for 343. The Samnites would have gained significant ground in Campania by the time the Romans arrived and Valerius' two victories could be the outcome of twin Samnite attacks on Capua and Cumae.\n\nParagraph 22: With funding from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, APSA has organized political science workshops in various locations in Africa, APSA Africa Workshops. The first workshop was convened in Dakar, Senegal in partnership with the West African Research Center from July 6–27, 2008. The annual residential workshops are led by a joint U.S. and African organizing team and aimed at mid-and junior-level scholars residing in Africa. They will enhance the capacities of political scientists and their resources in East and West Africa while also providing a forum for supporting their ongoing research. Each three week workshop brings together up to 30 scholars and cover substantive issues, methodologies, and reviews of research.

{"input": "The text provides information about the town of Arlit in Niger, which was founded in 1969 after the discovery of uranium and has since become centered around the mining industry. The mining operations in the area are run by both the National Mining Company of Niger (SOMAIR) and the French Compagnie Minière d'Akouta (COMINAK), with two open pit mines at Arlit and Akouta. The ore extracted from these mines is processed and transported by the French company Orano Cycle, which is part of the Orano group and owned by the French Commissariat à l'énergie atomique (CEA). The French nuclear power generation and nuclear weapons program rely on the uranium mined in Arlit.

This was a 3D art piece, fashioned from a real crucifix. Later it was remade as an early color photocopy and submitted to a Berkeley Photocopy show. A friend of Jello Biafra told him of the piece, and later Smith sent him samples of his work. This was the beginnings of the collaboration of Smith and Scotti with the Dead Kennedys. Scotti later became the drummer for The Feederz.\n\nParagraph 2: On February 2, 2007 Palermo was involved in a controversial away Sicilian derby, suspended for 30 minutes during the second half and followed by violence outside the Catania stadium in which policeman Filippo Raciti was killed by a small explosive launched by a Catania hooligan. This was followed by a two-weeks stop to all football leagues and national team matches in the whole country. Successively to these events Palermo, then clearly third-placed, did not manage to achieve a single victory, and dropped down to sixth position in the Serie A. Club chairman Maurizio Zamparini became more critical of Guidolin and finally sacked him on April 23, 2007 following a 3–4 home defeat to third-last placed Parma which extended the run of poor results to 11 games without a single win. Assistant coach Renzo Gobbo and youth team coach Rosario Pergolizzi, appointed as caretaker coaches at Guidolin's place, led the team for two matches, a 2–1 away win at Livorno in their debut which ended the negative run and two further defeats, including an upset 3–2 away loss against last-placed team Ascoli, already relegated to Serie B at the time, which left the rosanero in seventh place, the last UEFA Cup spot, only three points above Atalanta. The events led Zamparini to revoke Guidolin's dismissal and call him back for the remaining two matches. Guidolin's return brought two victories, to Siena and Udinese, ending the season in fifth place, obtaining thus qualification to the UEFA Cup 2007-08 for the third consecutive time and breaking its previous record of 53 points of two years before. On May 31, 2007 Palermo chairman Maurizio Zamparini announced Stefano Colantuono as new rosanero coach for the 2007–08 season. The first two signings for the new season, midfielder Giulio Migliaccio from Atalanta and goalkeeper Samir Ujkani from Anderlecht, were announced on June 8. Contemporarily, team captain Eugenio Corini, whose contract was due to expire within a few days, announced he was going to leave Palermo. Palermo's moves in the summer market included notable signings such as Boško Janković and Fabrizio Miccoli to replace Andrea Caracciolo and David Di Michele, sold to Sampdoria and Torino respectively. A fairly unimpressive start in the season, including a shock UEFA Cup elimination against Czech minnows FK Mlada Boleslav, however convinced Zamparini to sack Colantuono after a crush 5–0 loss to Juventus, re-calling Guidolin at the helm of the rosanero. Guidolin's fourth spell as Palermo boss proved to be even more unsuccessful, as Palermo struggled in the league, falling down to thirteenth place with concerns of being unexpectedly involved in the relegation battle. A 3–2 home loss to Genoa, the third in a row for Palermo, followed by Guidolin's controversial attacks against the supporting fanbase and the club management, brought in to Colantuono being reinstated as rosanero boss on March 24, 2008.\n\nParagraph 3: In 1952, Kuroya and his colleagues attempted to identify an infectious agent in human tissue samples at Tohoku University Hospital, Sendai, Japan. The samples were taken from the lung of a newborn child that was affected by fatal pneumonia. The primary isolate from the samples was passaged in mice and subsequently in embryonated eggs.  The isolated infectious agent was later called Sendai virus, which was used interchangeably with the name “Hemagglutinating Virus of Japan”. Kuroya and his colleagues were convinced that they isolated the virus, which is a new etiological agent for human respiratory infections. Later in 1954, Fukumi and his colleagues at the Japan National Institute of Health put forward an alternative explanation for the origin of the virus. It was suggested that the mice used to passage the virus were infected with the mouse virus. Thus, mouse virus was later transferred to embryonated eggs, isolated and finally named the Sendai virus. This explanation of Fukumi, pointing to the mouse rather than the human origin of the virus, has been supported by numerous scientific data later. The historical aspects of the Sendai virus isolation and controversy behind it are well described in the review. Thus, for some time, it was erroneously assumed that Sendai virus is human disease causing pathogen. The incorrect assumption that the virus was isolated from human infectious material is still reported by Encyclopædia Britannica and by ATCC in the description of the history of the viral isolate Sendai/52. It was also believed that the virus could cause disease not only in humans but also in pigs, because antibodies to the virus were often found in their organisms during the swine epidemic in Japan in 1953–1956. High incidence of seropositivity to the virus was observed in pigs in 15 districts of Japan.  An explanation was later found for this widespread detection of antibodies (see the section below). Yet, despite overwhelming evidence that indicate that SeV is host restrictive rodent pathogen, in some veterinary manuals. and safety leaflets, SeV is still listed as a virus that can cause disease in pigs. Similar information is provided by Encyclopædia Britannica. In reality, the multiple isolates of paramyxoviruses in pigs, using modern nucleic acid sequencing methods, have never been identified as SeV.\n\nParagraph 4: Amy Nicholson of LA Weekly gave the film a C−, saying \"Eva Green is sexy, funny, dangerous and wild - everything the film needed to be - and whenever she's not on screen, we feel her absence as though the sun has blinked off.\" Bill Goodykoontz of The Arizona Republic gave the film two and a half stars out of five, saying \"This is a great cast, but with the few exceptions they simply serve the effects.\" Kristin Tillotson of the Star Tribune gave the film two and a half stars out of five, saying \"Sin City: A Dame to Kill For is worth the watch if you expect nothing more than disparate comic-strip frames of action. But nine years in coming, this follow-up ultimately fizzles.\" Stephanie Merry of The Washington Post gave the film two out of four stars, saying \"The aesthetic quality is still there, even if there haven't been too many great leaps since Rodriguez unveiled Sin City in 2005. But the stories aren't nearly as engrossing.\" Joe Williams of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch gave the film two and a half stars out of four, saying \"As in the first film, there are judicious stabs of color. And Alba is a showstopper in a fringed cowgirl outfit. But nine years wiser, we know that pretty things aren't always worth killing for.\" Claudia Puig of USA Today gave the film two out of four stars, saying \"The cartoonish mayhem in Sin City: A Dame to Kill For aims for a film noir sensibility, but too frequently the script simply resorts to anachronistic scenes of Jessica Alba twerking.\" Rafer Guzman of Newsday gave the film two out of four stars, saying \"The movie's trademark mix of live action and drawing techniques (white silhouettes, reddened lips, an abundance of venetian blinds) looks fantastic. If it's depth you want, you've knocked on the wrong door.\"\n\nParagraph 5: Each of the two players sitting opposite each other takes a pack of 52 cards, without jokers, shuffles it and lets the opponent cut it. The one who took off the highest card starts. The first player places their first thirteen cards in a \"reserve pile\", with the top card open, and the next four cards in a column (the \"auxiliary columns\") face up between themself and the opposing player. In the picture this is the right hand column. The same is then built up on the left side by the second player. There must be space between the two auxiliary columns for the eight aces, which will be placed there during the game (in the picture the two middle columns).\n\nParagraph 6: In January 2000, Suzuki released \"Don't Need to Say Good Bye\" which debuted at number 5. A week later, Suzuki released her second studio album, Infinity Eighteen Vol. 1, which sold 1,063,000 copies and debuted at number one. Suzuki has said of this first period of her career that she was not free to do what she wanted and only followed what she was told, leaving her feeling \"pretty disheartened and down, like there was no future.\". Suzuki had been writing lyrics from an early age and passing them to her manager and producers. The first song to feature them, with the help of Mitsuko and Tetsuya Komuro, was her tenth Sony single, \"Don't Need to Say Good Bye\". The lyrics were influenced by events occurring in her personal life at that time, specifically her upcoming high school graduation and she has said: \"it was more important to me than sales and chart rankings to know that I had put my thoughts and feelings into what I was singing.\" Three months after Infinity Eighteen Vol.1, Suzuki released her twelfth single, \"Thank You 4 Every Day Every Body\" in the beginning of April and third studio album, Infinity Eighteen Vol.2 at the end of April. \"Thank You 4 Every Day Every Body\" sold a total of 234,000 copies reaching number one and Infinity Eighteen Vol.2 sold a total of 427,000 copies reaching number two. \"Reality/Dancin' in Hip-Hop\" was Suzuki's 12th single released under the Sony Music Japan label, on 27 September 2000. It reached number 3 on Oricon weekly chart and sold a total of 211,000 copies. A compilation album of Suzuki's tracks, Fun for Fan, was released on 30 May 2001. It reached number 1 on the Oricon charts, despite the fact that by this point, Suzuki herself had vanished from the public eye and Sony had taken all of her previous singles and albums off CD shelves.\n\nParagraph 7: Despite the usually close vote between the various right-leaning parties, the Canadian Alliance, Reform and Conservative parties have consistently won here from 1993 to 2011. Since 1953, the riding and its predecessor, Esquimalt—Saanich, have only gone to a non-conservative candidate five times: 1968 to Liberal David Anderson, in 1988 to New Democrat Lynn Hunter, and in 2011, 2015 and 2019 to Green party leader Elizabeth May, who in 2015 won every poll-district within the constituency. The 1988 Conservative loss is attributed to vote splitting between the Progressive Conservatives and the new Reform party. Despite a Conservative majority in 2011, the Greens won their very first elected seat here, and has since become their only stronghold in the country. The peninsular portion of the riding is more competitive, with significant support for all parties except the Liberals. However, the Gulf Isalnds have probably the strongest Green support in the country, with many voters being environmentally conscious, moderate retirees, as well as a notable artist population. This, combined with a very popular MP in Former leader Elizabeth May, Saanich Gulf Islands becoming the safest Green riding. Even with the Green collapse nationally in 2021, May held on with 37%, although it was her lowest voteshare in the riding.\n\nParagraph 8: Founded in 1969 following the discovery of uranium, it has grown around the mining industry, developed by the French government.  Two large uranium mines, at Arlit and nearby Akouta, are exploited by open top strip mining. One open pit mine was built in 1971 by the National Mining Company of Niger, SOMAIR. The Second open pit mine, as well as a third underground mine, was built by the French Compagnie Minière d'Akouta (or COMINAK). All the ore from both is now processed and transported by a French company Orano Cycle, a holding of the Orano group, itself a state owned operation of the French Commissariat à l'énergie atomique (CEA). The system of French nuclear power generation, as well as the French nuclear weapons program, is dependent on uranium mined at Arlit.  Orano Cycle alone employs 1600 foreign nationals on the site.\n\nParagraph 9: The word \"shaman\" originates from the Evenki word \"šamán\". The term came into usage among Europeans via Russians interacting with the Indigenous peoples in Siberia. From there, \"shamanism\" was picked up by anthropologists to describe any cultural practice that involves vision-seeking and communication with the spirits, no matter how diverse the cultures included in this generalisation. Native American and First Nations spiritual people use terms in their own languages to describe their traditions; their spiritual teachers, leaders or elders are not called \"shamans\". One significant promoter of this view of a global shamanism was the Beat Generation writer Gary Snyder, whose 1951 PhD thesis treated Haida religion as a form of shamanic practice, and whose subsequent poetry promotes the idea of the Pacific Rim as \"a single cultural zone and a single bioregion.\" Other writers promoting the idea of a generalised shamanic religion in this period also include Robert Bly, who stated that \"the most helpful addition to thought about poetry in the past thirty years has been the concept of the poet as a relative of the shaman ... I am a shaman.\" Snyder and Bly's remarks attest to the deep investment in shamanism in 1960s and 1970s counterculture. Leslie Marmon Silko would later condemn Snyder's appropriations of Native religions in her 1978 essay \"An Old-Fashioned Indian Attack in Two Parts\". Later, Michael Harner would develop the concept of neoshamanism, or \"core shamanism\", which also makes the unfounded claim that the ways of several North American tribes share more than surface elements with those of the Siberian Shamans.  This misappellation led to many non-Natives assuming Harner's inventions were traditional Indigenous ceremonies. Geary Hobson sees the New Age use of the term shamanism as a cultural appropriation of Native American culture by \"white\" people who have distanced themselves from their own history.\n\nParagraph 10: The illustrations were added by three different painters, all of whom used iconographic copybooks. The first worked on the Georgics and parts of the Eclogues; only two worked on the Aeneid. Each individual artist's illustrations are apparent based on their ability. The first artist is distinguished by his knowledge of spatial perspective and anatomy. His illustrations creates in the Georgics and Eclogues focus on his skill of creating distances and landscapes. The illustration of the herd being led to water is found in the artist's illustration of the Georgics. Each figure and object in the background is distinguishable with a realistic spatial arrangement.\n\nParagraph 11: H. maculosa has a very short life span with a large importance placed on reproduction. The average life span of a southern blue ringed octopus is around seven months. The octopus reaches sexual maturity at around four months old, at which time it focuses its last few months of life towards copulation and breeding. Both genders of this species are promiscuous, as they only have a limited set of gametes. The mating ritual of H. maculosa usually begins with the female initiating reproduction by changing color and posture. The male then mounts the female, inserts the hectocotylus under the mantle of the female, and releases the sperm into the female’s oviduct. For  this type of octopus, there is approximately a two-month window in which a female acquires and stores sperm from multiple males. She then carries the eggs with her, as opposed to depositing them somewhere stationary. During this time period, the mother rarely moves unless disturbed. When she is forced to move, she uses only two arms for locomotion. The female also does not eat during this time period. Because of this, the mother dies shortly after the eggs have hatched. It is highly unlikely that the male or female would live beyond one year. This unusual octopus maternal care system seems to be an advanced evolutionary development of the species. While this may seem strange, females only reproduce once in their lifetime, so it is vital to them that their egg clutch survives. Once hatched, the H. maculosa grow very rapidly. The southern blue-ringed octopus also differs from other marine invertebrates in that there is no planktonic stage. The young begin hunting around one month of age- they are said to be venomous from birth, while their blue rings don’t appear until six weeks after hatching. It was found in a study by Morse and Zenger that as size of the octopus increased, so too did willingness to mate. Same-sex attempts at mating were frequently noted, which implies distinguishing between male and female is difficult even for the octopus. It is also possible females use some form of refined sense of smell to single out attractive mates.\n\nParagraph 12: New York, with a population of 96,000 in 1810, surged far beyond its rivals, reaching a population of 1,080,000 in 1860, compared to 566,000 in Philadelphia, 212,000 in Baltimore and 178,000 in Boston. Historian Robert Albion identifies four aggressive moves by New York entrepreneurs and politicians that helped it jump to the top of American cities. Of greatest importance, it sponsored the Erie Canal, which began operations in 1825, forming a continuous water route from New York north to Albany via the Hudson River, then west to Buffalo using the new canal to reach the Great Lakes.  It opened a large new market in upstate New York and the Old Northwest. New York set up an auction system that efficiently and rapidly sold imported cargoes to the highest bidder. Exporters from Britain discovered New York offered the best prices for their goods, and they increasingly ignored Boston and Philadelphia, where the local merchants tried to impose higher markups by avoiding auctions.  New York began the world's first regular packet service to England with the Black Ball Line in 1818. By 1830, it dominated the nation's merchant marine.  Ambitious shippers reached beyond the natural hinterland to open large-scale coastal trade, especially one that brought Southern cotton to New York for export to textile mills in the Northeast and in Europe, and carried manufactured products to the South. By 1830, 40 cents of every dollar the mills paid for cotton went to New York brokers to cover the cost of shipping. The main rivals, Boston Philadelphia and Baltimore, tried to compete with the Erie Canal by opening their own networks of canals and railroads; they never caught up. Manufacturing was not a major factor in the city's growth in the 19th century—factories were chiefly being built in towns and smaller cities with waterfalls and fast rivers that were harnessed to generate the power, or were closer to coal supplies.\n\nParagraph 13: In the 1972–75 Goulandris era, Olympiacos had a solid presence in European competitions, eliminating great clubs, and losing their qualification to the quarter-finals of the 1975 European Cup in a highly controversial game. They managed to eliminate Cagliari in the 1972–73 UEFA Cup, a major force in Italian football during the late 1960s and the early 1970s, (1970 Serie A Champions, 1972 Serie A title contenders), with world-class Italian international players like Gigi Riva, Angelo Domenghini, Enrico Albertosi, Pierluigi Cera, Sergio Gori and Fabrizio Poletti. Olympiacos managed to beat Cagliari twice, 2–1 in Piraeus and 1–0 in Cagliari, becoming the first ever Greek football club to win on Italian soil. In the next round they faced the competition's defending champions Tottenham Hotspur, who were undefeated for 16-straight games in all European competitions. Olympiacos did not manage to qualify against Spurs, but they managed to get a 1–0 win in Piraeus, which ended Tottenham's undefeated streak and marked the first ever victory of a Greek football club against an English side. Two years later, Olympiacos entered the 1974–75 European Cup and they were drawn to face Kenny Dalglish's Celtic, one of the strongest teams in European football at that time and semi-finalists of the previous season. The first leg was played in Celtic Park, where Celtic had never been defeated, running an undefeated streak of 36 straight home games in all European competitions (27 wins, 9 draws) from 1962 to 1974. Olympiacos took the lead through Milton Viera's strike in the 36th minute, with Celtic equalising late in the game. The away draw gave Olympiacos the advantage and they finished the job in Piraeus, after a spectacular 2–0 win against the Scottish Champions with Kritikopoulos and Stavropoulos finding the net. In the next round, they were drawn to play against Anderlecht for a place in the quarter-finals of the competition. Anderlecht won the first leg with 5–1 and Olympiacos' task seemed impossible. In the second leg in Greece, however, Olympiacos put on a dominant display and almost reached a winning score in a match that was marked by referee Károly Palotai's decisions. Olympiacos beat Anderlecht 3–0, while Palotai disallowed four Olympiacos goals and did not give at least three clear penalties committed by Anderlecht players, while Stavropoulos was shown a red card for no good reason. The match is widely known in Greece as the \"Palotai massacre\" with Olympiacos coming close to one of the biggest comebacks in European Cup history.\n\nParagraph 14: In 1993 during the winter he played in Puerto Rico for the Cangrejeros de Santurce and the team won the league championship. They clinched a spot to play in the Caribbean Series representing Puerto Rico and went on to win the series. Villanueva played first base and had the honor of being named the MVP. In 1994 Héctor moved to Mexico where he played for the Tigres of Mexico City. He led the league in home runs and RBIs with a batting average of.333. He later signed a contract that year to play for the Expos on a minor league triple-A team for the Ottawa Lynx. Villanueva was never called up to the Majors so in 1996 he went back to play in the Mexican league. This time he played for the team in Monclova, Mexico. He then spent one season during 1997 playing baseball in the Chinese league for the China Times Eagles. He did not have a good experience in China because he was away from his family and had a misunderstanding with the team manager concerning tickets for his family members to visit him and watch him play. He also felt very uncomfortable with the type of gambling that was going on so he ultimately traveled back to play in Mexico again where would move from one ball club to another. After a while, Héctor became tired of the traveling he had to do in Mexico and decided to retire from playing summer baseball there. He took a job back in his hometown where he would be in charge of the baseball parks where he grew up. This meant he could also be with his family and be there for his kids as they grew up. He always played in the Puerto Rican winter league during the Major league offseason when he was a professional and a few years after his time in Mexico. He also managed a few amateur teams in Puerto Rico later on in his career. He finally quit playing baseball altogether after the 2002–2003 season in Puerto Rico. Villanueva was very passionate about the sport and loved to play the game. He was always a popular player among the fan base because of his likable character and easygoing personality. He displayed tremendous strength whenever he connected the ball but struggled as a defensive player. In The Puerto Rican league Héctor achieved 105 home runs, which ties him for third on the league's lifetime list. He also compiled 425 RBIs and a career batting average of .259 in 754 games. He ended up winning a total of three championships in the league.\n\nParagraph 15: The powerful owl is the top nocturnal predator of the forests and woodlands in its range. About 75% of the diet of the powerful owl is made up of arboreal mammals. Its diet consists largely of arboreal marsupials such as the greater glider (Petauroides volans), ringtail possums (Pseudocheiridae), brushtail possums (Trichosurus spp.), koala (Phascolarctos cinereus), sugar glider (Petaurus breviceps), and feathertail gliders (Acrobates pygmaeus). These prey species vary extensively in body size, from the feathertail possum, which has an adult weight merely of  to the koala, which is considerably larger in southern Australia, typically weighing . However, the powerful owl, while it has killed even adult koalas, only seldom takes the full-sized adults of the koala and even in some other mid-to-large prey species, such as the  brushtail possums or the ringtail possums, of about half that weight, small and young individuals are typically (but not always) represented as the individuals caught. Only 15% of the ringtail possums caught in one food study were full-grown adults. The greater glider and the common ringtail possum (Pseudocheirus peregrinus), both weighing from  in maturity, and the smaller sugar glider, weighing , are the most prominent prey species in the powerful owl's diet in most regions. The significance of individual species in the diet is dictated by the local abundance of prey. The average estimated prey weight per one study was approximately . However, another two studies stated the mean prey weight as  and . Not infrequently, prey weight averages between 50 and 100%, whereas in most other raptors, including large owls, there seems to be a \"rule\" that most prey weighs 20% or less of the raptors' own weight. The mean weight of prey for powerful owls can be up to 10 times greater relative to their body weight than the mean prey weight of similarly sized northern owls, such as great grey or great horned owls.\n\nParagraph 16: During the ten years between solo albums Guthrie worked as a composer, scoring music for television ads, films and video games, in addition to his work on the side project Human Highway with Nick Thorburn of Islands. He received acclaim for the music he composed for the 2011 computer and tablet video game, Superbrothers: Sword & Sworcery EP. The score was published as a digital and analogue (vinyl) album, Sword & Sworcery LP: The Ballad of the Space Babies, in April 2011. His work on the project drew the attention of filmmakers James Swirsky and Lisanne Pajot, who asked Guthrie to score their documentary Indie Game: The Movie, using tracks from the album, as well as new original tracks. Guthrie's music has also appeared in several commercials including ads for the ALS Society of Canada and Capital One. On April 15, 2015, a book titled Jim Guthrie: Who Needs What was released.\n\nParagraph 17: After Kago departed from Up-Front Agency, her mother attempted to sign her to a new talent agency in her hometown, Nara. Later that year, Josei Seven published an interview with her mother, revealing that Kago left Japan and started residing in New York City. Kago herself later revealed that she had actually not gone to New York, but rather to Los Angeles for three months because she felt like a criminal in Japan. During her stay, she met people who encouraged her, including Winona Ryder, and was able to reflect on her situation. She also considered suicide and cut her wrists.\n\nParagraph 18: Yuna Kagurazaka (神楽坂 優奈 Kagurazaka Yuna). Voiced by (Japanese) Chisa Yokoyama, (English) Cynthia Martinez. Yuna is the main protagonist of the series. At first, she was just another normal schoolgirl: a first-year student at Yokohama's Shiraokadai All-Girls' High School, enrolled in class 1-B, commuting from home to school each day via the local train route. Sometime prior to the first game, Yuna and several other girls entered the \"Miss Ojousama Contest\", an intergalactic beauty pageant, with Yuna herself being chosen as the winner. In doing so, she became an instant celebrity, and began a career as a popular idol singer. One night, the Matrix of Light Elner appeared to Yuna. She introduced herself as part of Yuna's personality (literally translated, \"her other self\"), and asked her to become the Savior of Light. Yuna then learned a great evil was about to invade the universe, and that Yuna herself had been charged with its protection. Thus began the first of Yuna's intergalactic adventures. Yuna is sometimes a bit clumsy and prone to making silly mistakes, and at first glance, one would think she is a natural airhead. However, she has a very energetic and positive personality that more than makes up for her shortcomings. She is not very skilled as an idol singer, nor is she quite diligent in her studies and exercise routine, and both her enemies and friends often wonder whether she has any potential talent that has yet to be unlocked. During battle or times of great personal danger, Yuna undergoes a transformation sequence and appears wearing her armored battle suit, the Light Suit. Her Light Suit has a very large array of weaponry to use in her battle against the forces of evil, ranging from a sword and rifle to an incredibly powerful beam cannon called the Matrix Divider (In \"Galaxy Fräulein Yuna 2: Eternal Princess\", it is upgraded to a more powerful version known as the Matrix Divider Plus). Yuna is also a big fan of the TV superheroine Ojousama Kamen Polylina (or Polylina the Masked Maiden), proudly boasting her status as \"the #1 fan of the \"Polylina-sama Fanclub\". This fandom borders on complete obsession, with Yuna even going as far as referring to Polylina as her \"one and only\". Her heroine is in fact a TV character played by her best friend Lia, but for some reason, Yuna never manages to figure it out. In fact, Yuna's affection for Polylina is a major running joke in the series, with Lia often reacting in some (usually humorous) fashion to Yuna's fangirlish (and somewhat misguided) proclamations of shōjo-ai for her idol. Her friends call her by a variety of nicknames, including \"Yuna\", \"Yuna-rin\", and \"Yuna-san\". Yuna Kagurazaka currently lives with her parents, Naoko and Yuuichiro Kagurazaka, on Earth, in Japan's Yokohama Prefecture.\n\nParagraph 19: The Belgica expedition was poorly equipped and did not have enough winter clothing for every man on board. There was a shortage of food, and what there was lacked in variety. Penguins and seals were hunted and their meat stored before the onset of winter left the region devoid of wildlife. Warm clothing was improvised from the materials available. On 21 March 1898, Cook wrote: \"We are imprisoned in an endless sea of ice ... We have told all the tales, real and imaginative, to which we are equal. Time weighs heavily upon us as the darkness slowly advances.\" Several weeks later, on 17 May, the perpetual darkness of polar night set in, and lasted until 23 July.\n\nParagraph 20: The Tigers scored three runs, largely due to three Cub errors, in the eighth inning and held a 3–1 lead going into the bottom of the ninth inning. The Cubs loaded the bases on a single, walk and infield error with one out.  Detroit conceded a run on a ground ball for the second out, and Cub player-manager Frank Chance then pinch hit Del Howard for Joe Tinker.  Wild Bill Donovan (25–4 in the regular season) struck him out, but the ball got away from catcher Boss Schmidt, allowing Harry Steinfeldt to score the tying run.  Donovan got the next hitter, but the damage had been done.  The teams then played three scoreless extra innings before the game was called on account of darkness and declared a tie, a World Series first.\n\nParagraph 21:  The class of right-angled Artin–Tits groups includes the free groups of finite rank, corresponding to a graph with no edges, and the finitely-generated free abelian groups, corresponding to a complete graph. Every right-angled Artin group of rank r can be constructed as HNN extension of a right-angled Artin group of rank , with the free product and direct product as the extreme cases. A generalization of this construction is called a graph product of groups. A right-angled Artin group is a special case of this product, with every vertex/operand of the graph-product being a free group of rank one (the infinite cyclic group).\n\nParagraph 22: The first editor was Martha Fulton, who had been hired that summer by Preston Davis, the major owner of the Press, and Harrison Sayre, who became managing editor. Sayre, also the editor of World News, a paper for high school students, had been urged to start a paper for grade schools by teachers he had met in June 1928, while on a sales trip in Indiana. Martha Fulton, who was a friend of Sayre's wife, Mary, and a graduate of Wells College, enjoyed travel and adventure. During World War I, she had been an American Red Cross worker in France. She also had \"a remarkable rapport with children and had lively interests in every direction.\" The lead article was about the boyhoods of Herbert Hoover and Al Smith. There were two shorter articles: \"Wings for Safety\", about street crossing guards; and, \"Sky Medicine\", which was about the healthful qualities of the Sun. The most popular was a letter from \"Uncle Ben\" about a ride in a German glider on Cape Cod. Fulton wrote all these articles. Her sister Peg was the first artist, though soon replaced by her friend Mary Sherwood Wright. Beginning with the third issue, Eleanor Johnson, director of elementary schools in York, Pennsylvania, designed tests for the back page.\n\nParagraph 23: Sagat ranked at number 22 in the list of Best Characters of 1991 from the February 1992 issue of Gamest magazine in Japan. IGN ranked Sagat at number eleven in their \"Top 25 Street Fighter Characters\" article, noting him as one of the few characters in the original Street Fighter and adding \"The shaved head, the scarred chest, and most of all the eyepatch, they come together to make a guy who means business.\" GameDaily listed him at number eight on their \"Top 20 Street Fighter Characters of All Time\" article, citing his role as the first boss in the series and praising his appearance. UGO Networks placed him at the first spot on their list of \"Top 50 Street Fighter Characters\", stating \"Sagat is arguably the strongest fighter in the series and an important part of the overarching storyline of the series.\" UGO also listed him eleventh in their article of best scarred character as the scar symbolizes Sagat's defeat at the hands of Ryu and his desire to continue fighting. GameSpy named him one of the \"25 Extremely Rough Brawlers\" in video gaming with comments focused on his appearance. In a humor article by GameSpy, Sagat was labelled as an overpowered character in his Street Fighter II incarnation. Similarly, his Street Fighter IV received similar complaints to the point of being compared with the game boss, Seth. In response to this, Ryota Niitsuma, assistant producer of the arcade version of the game, admitted that the two ended up being overpowered, but players could still defeat them without too many difficulties. Complex ranked Sagat as the \"30th most dominant fighting game character\", stating \"This insanely tall Muay Thai champion is revered and respected. He doesn't have eye pupils plus he sports a nasty scar on his chest.\" Complex also ranked Sagat as the \"6th best Street Fighter character\", commenting \"Sagat and Ryu have some history, but Sagat can hold his own in a fight, and if he had him in our hands on that fateful battle, he would have wrecked Ryu, plain and simple.\" In 2016, Screen Rant named Sagat the \"9th Most Powerful Street Fighter Character\", commenting \"His battle prowess to warrant being a final boss again has likely long been surpassed, but he’s still a worthy rival even for somebody of the caliber of Ryu.\" In a 2018 worldwide poll by Capcom, Sagat was voted seventh most popular Street Fighter character.\n\nParagraph 24: Rationalist author Joseph McCabe stated that despite Podmore's \"highly critical faculty\" he was misled in the Piper case by Richard Hodgson. This was based on a letter he saw in the 2nd edition Spiritualism and Oliver Lodge by Dr. Charles Arthur Mercier, from a cousin of George Pellew to Edward Clodd, alleging that Hodgson claimed that Professor Fiske from his séance with Piper was \"absolutely convinced\" Piper's control was the real George Pellew, but that when Pellew's brother contacted Fiske about it, he replied it was \"a lie\" as Piper had been \"silent or entirely wrong\" on all his questions. However, Alan Gauld, referring to this letter as published by Clodd, stated that it was \"wholly unreliable\", noted that Hodgson in his original report wrote that Fiske had a negative attitude, and that Hodgson himself considered the Fiske sittings to be of no evidential value.\n\nParagraph 25: In August 1900 work began on a new chapel for the College. It was blessed and opened on 3 May 1901. Its architect was Commanditori Leonardi, the papal architect for Pope Leo XIII and a friend of Verdon's. Built in true Roman style, with semicircular windows, marble altar, gilded copper ceiling and classic ionic pilasters, the chapel was an important part of Verdon's attempt to recreate at Mosgiel the spiritual atmosphere of Rome. The first ordination in the chapel occurred in 1902 when Patrick O'Neill was ordained a deacon. In 1902 the enrollment had doubled to 22. On 12 December 1909 Verdon ordained the first six priests from the seminary. The establishment of Holy Cross College was a significant step forward for the Church in New Zealand ensuring an adequate supply of clergy trained in New Zealand and also creating \"a very real bond between the secular priests of the country\". From the beginning Holy Cross Seminary was designed to equip priests to minister within an established minority community and to preserve the identity of that community. The seminary gave to its students a monastic type formation. Only by separating people from the world and giving them a new vision would they be able to re-enter the world and save people from it. Over the next 50 years the College became even more like a monastery. Even though it was located near the bustling city of Dunedin, it was yet set apart in relative isolation. It became an oasis of prayer, study and seclusion. The gradual establishment of various institutions like a printery, bindery, butchery, darkroom and farm separated it from the life of the surrounding community. New buildings were added as the twentieth century progressed. In 1963 a new chapel, called the Verdon chapel, was completed and the remains of Bishop Verdon were reinterred there during a Pontifical Requiem Mass offered by Archbishop Liston The function of preparation for entering Holy Cross College was fulfilled from 1947 by the founding of Holy Name Seminary, Christchurch, a minor seminary operated by the Jesuits. From 1954, this seminary assumed responsibility for teaching the Philosophy section of the seminary curriculum as a major seminary. The monastic and separatist ideal was challenged after the Second Vatican Council and the publication of Gaudium et spes (\"the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World\"). The emphasis changed to interaction with the world. The College collaborated with the University of Otago in the introduction of Bachelor of Theology degree and courses in pastoral studies were introduced in addition to the traditional focus on theology and philosophy. The College was staffed by secular clergy and others until 1934 and then by the Vincentian order until 1989. In the 98 years that the College was at Mosgiel (1900-1997) it had 1302 students. Of those, 648 were ordained at the end of their studies as priests.\n\nParagraph 26: The term technocracy was initially used to signify the application of the scientific method to solving social problems. In its most extreme form, technocracy is an entire government running as a technical or engineering problem and is mostly hypothetical. In more practical use, technocracy is any portion of a bureaucracy run by technologists. A government in which elected officials appoint experts and professionals to administer individual government functions, and recommend legislation, can be considered technocratic. Some uses of the word refer to a form of meritocracy, where the ablest are in charge, ostensibly without the influence of special interest groups. Critics have suggested that a \"technocratic divide\" challenges more participatory models of democracy, describing these divides as \"efficacy gaps that persist between governing bodies employing technocratic principles and members of the general public aiming to contribute to government decision making\".\n\nParagraph 27: The crater-like structure was discovered by petroleum geoscientists Simon Stewart and Philip Allen. Analyzing seismic data for a region  off the Humber estuary, Allen noticed an unusual set of concentric rings. Thinking they resembled a meteor-strike but lacking experience in impact structures, he hung an image of them on the wall of his office, hoping someone else might be able to shed light on the mystery. Stewart, who had long predicted that a crater would be found on 3D seismic data, saw the image and suggested it might be an impact feature. The discovery of the crater and the impact hypothesis were reported in the journal Nature in 2002.", "answers": ["Paragraph 8"], "length": 7033, "dataset": "passage_retrieval_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "cfdc31e732f122a22691783a1de0e98d5ba8b215d74cb420"}
{"input": "The text describes the characteristics and abilities of vampires in The Darren Shan Saga, highlighting their differences from vampires in popular culture. These vampires are alive and can be killed by various means, such as bullets or decapitation. They do not have fangs and do not drink blood from the neck; instead, they cut a vein with their sharp nails and drink small amounts of blood. Vampires have the ability to scale walls like spiders using their nails. Drinking all of a human's blood allows them to absorb part of the victim's spirit and see into their memories. Vampires have partial immunity to sunlight and can be active during the day if they stay in the shade. Garlic, silver, and holy objects do not bother them. Vampires cannot reproduce, and their aging process is slower than humans. They cast reflections and shadows but cannot be photographed. Additionally, they sleep in coffins.", "context": "Paragraph 1: In 1848, Donaldson was elected a member of the original unicameral Legislative Council of New South Wales, representing the County of Durham from February 1848 to January 1853. Comments made while running for re-election in 1851, led Sir Thomas Mitchell to demand a public apology. While Donaldson complied Mitchell was not satisfied and challenged Donaldson to a duel with pistols. Both men missed but they remained antagonised. He supported the development of steam ship services to Australia and the work of Caroline Chisholm. In 1852 he achieved the carriage of a motion recommending that £10,000 should be applied to supporting Chisholm's work. He travelled to England in 1853–1854.\n\nParagraph 2: Bangladesh elects on national level a legislature with one house or chamber. The unicameral Jatiyo Sangshad, meaning national parliament, has 350 members of which 300 members are directly elected through a national election for a five-year term in single-seat constituencies while 50 memberships are reserved for the women who are selected by the ruling party or coalition. The Prime Minister is the head of the government. The president who is the head of the state is elected by the National Parliament. The president of Bangladesh is a ceremonial post and does not exercise any control over the running of the state.\n\nParagraph 3: Because the ILOs enforcement and sanction mechanisms are weak, there has been significant discussion about incorporating labour standards in the World Trade Organization's operation, since its formation in 1994. The WTO oversees, primarily, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade which is a treaty aimed at reducing customs, tariffs and other barriers to free import and export of goods, services and capital between its 157-member countries. Unlike for the ILO, if the WTO rules on trade are contravened, member states who secure a judgment by the Dispute Settlement procedures (effective a judicial process) may retaliate through trade sanctions. This could include reimposition of targeted tariffs against the non-compliant country. Proponents of an integrated approach have called for a \"social clause\" to be inserted into the GATT agreements, for example by amending article XX, which gives an exception to the general trade barrier reduction rules allowing imposition of sanctions for breaches of human rights. An explicit reference to core labour standards could allow action where a WTO member state is found to be in breach of ILO standards. Opponents argue that such an approach could backfire and undermine labour rights, as a country's industries, and therefore its workforce, are necessarily harmed but without any guarantee that labour reform would take place. Furthermore, it was argued in the Singapore Ministerial Declaration 1996 that \"the comparative advantage of countries, particularly low-age developing countries, must in no way be put into question.\" Accordingly, it is argued that countries ought to be able to take advantage of low wages and poor conditions at work as a comparative advantage in order to boost their exports. Similarly it is disputed that business will relocate production to low wage countries from higher wage countries such as the UK, because that choice depends mostly on productivity of workers. The view of many labour lawyers and economists remains that more trade, in the context of weaker bargaining power and mobility for workers, still allows for business to opportunistically take advantage of workers by moving production, and that a coordinated multilateral approach with targeted measures against specific exports is preferable. While the WTO has yet to incorporate labour rights into its procedures for dispute settlements, many countries began to make bilateral agreements that protected core labour standards instead. Moreover, in domestic tariff regulations not yet touched by the WTO agreements, countries have given preference to other countries who do respect core labour rights, for example under the EU Tariff Preference Regulation, articles 7 and 8.\n\nParagraph 4: Recordings include Nita Conley Korn and Eileen Estes on their album \"The Apple Tree Project,\" Scantily Plaid on their album, \"Just Checking In\", Édain on \"JOYceFUL\", Éilís Kennedy on \"One Sweet Kiss\", Tríona Ní Dhomhnaill on Donal Lunny's Coolfin, Allison Barber on \"Traveling Home\", Órla Fallon from Celtic Woman on the album of the same name, Lisa Kelly (who was also with Celtic Woman) on \"Lisa\", Ciúnas on \"Celtic Tiger\", Aoife Ní Fhearraigh on \"If I Told You\", Maighréad Ní Dhomhnaill & Iarla Ó Lionáird on \"Sult\", Anúna on \"Invocation\" with Lucy Champion, Connie Dover on \"The Wishing Well\", Akelarre Agrocelta on \"La Amenaza Celta\", Nora Butler on Geantraí and Siobhan Owen on \"Purely Celtic\".\n\nParagraph 5: Nova's armada left India in January 1502. On his return journey, Nova is said to have discovered the South Atlantic island of Saint Helena on 21 May 1502, the feast day of Helena of Constantinople. However, a paper published in 2015 reviewed the discovery date and suggests Jan Huyghen van Linschoten was probably the first (in 1596) to state that the island was so named because it was found on the 21 May. Given that Linschoten correctly stated Whitsunday fell on the Western Christian date of 21 May 1589 (rather than the Orthodox Church date of 28 May), the paper suggests that Linschoten was referring to the Protestant feast-day for Saint Helena on 21 May, not the Orthodox Church version on the same date. It is then argued the Portuguese found the island two decades before the start of the Reformation and the establishment of Protestantism, and it is therefore not possible that the island was so named because it was found on the Protestant feast day. An alternative discovery date of 3 May on the Catholic feast-day celebrating the finding of the True Cross by Saint Helena in Jerusalem, as quoted by Odoardo Duarte Lopes in 1591 and by Sir Thomas Herbert in 1638, is suggested as historically more credible than the Protestant date of 21 May. The paper observes that if da Nova made the discovery on 3 May 1502, he may have been inhibited from naming the island Ilha de Vera Cruz (Island of the True Cross) because Pedro Álvares Cabral had already assigned that same name to the Brazilian coastline, which he thought to be a large island, on 3 May 1500. News of Cabral’s discovery reached Lisbon directly from South America before da Nova’s fleet set off on the voyage to India in 1501. If da Nova knew the True Cross name had already been assigned, the most obvious and plausible alternative name for him to give the island was \"Santa Helena\".\n\nParagraph 6: While still holding the championship, Battalino decisively defeated 1930 world lightweight champion Al Singer, before a crowd of 17,000 at New York's Madison Square Garden on December 11, 1931.  Battalino may have bobbed and weaved away from Singer's early volleys in the first, and was likely shaken by a blow or two, but his counterattack was devastating to his opponent.   Though Singer started strong very early in the opening round, he was soon put down three times by Battalino, and went down in the second from a series of rights to the chin for a count of seven.  After he rose, he was chased around the ring by Battalino who put him down again with a right to the chin for a count of four, just before the referee justifiably called the bout a technical knockout and helped move Singer to his corner.   Singer's labored retreat from Battalino after he was first put down, his inability to defend himself, and his struggle to mount an attack, indicated a boxer who had, at least for the moment, lost most of his physical faculties.  Both boxers were above the featherweight limit preventing any chance of the match being a featherweight title match.\n\nParagraph 7: Born in 1953 into a family belonging to Haryana, Ujjwala was thirty years younger than Tiwari. Her father, Prof. Sher Singh, a prominent politician, served as India's Union Minister for Education and for Defense Production from 1967 to 1980, serving successively under Indira Gandhi and Morarji Desai. Ujjwala's mother, Prabhat Shobha Pandit, was a homemaker. The family lived in a large government bungalow (No.3, Krishna Menon Marg), where N.D. Tiwari was a frequent visitor. In 1970, at the age of 17, Ujjwala was married to Bipin Sharma and they became the parents of a son, Siddharth Sharma. According to reports, Ujjwala and her husband separated shortly after Siddharth's birth, but they did not obtain a divorce until 2006. Ujjwala and Tiwari had met for the first time in 1968, before her wedding, but their affair took off around 1977, and Rohit Shekhar was born in the late 1970s. Tiwari's marriage had remained childless and his wife, Sushila Tiwari, died of cancer in 1991 after over 40 years of marriage. After her death, Ujjwala reportedly tried to claim her place, but was rebuffed by Tiwari; an incident happened in 1995 when Ujjwala and Rohit tried to enter Tiwari's official residence to meet him, but were stopped and pushed back by his security guards, after which they sat in protest outside his house, to no avail. Tiwari had totally distanced himself from Ujjwala by this time; the scandal of marrying the divorced mother of two would ruin his career, which was at its zenith in the period 1991–96, under P.V. Narasimha Rao. Tiwari had had little or no contact with either Ujjwala or Rohit for more than a decade before Rohit Shekhar began his campaign to establish his paternity. He began this campaign in 2007–08, very shortly after the divorce of Ujjwala and Bipin Sharma in 2006. It culminated in the wedding of 88-year-old widower Tiwari and 60-year-old divorcee Ujjwala in May 2018.\n\nParagraph 8: The vampires in The Darren Shan Saga are different from vampires found in popular culture. They are alive, meaning that they can be killed by a well-placed bullet, mutilation, decapitation or piercing of the heart (though they will wake up within a day or less if their neck is broken). Vampires do not have fangs and they do not drink blood from the neck. Rather, they drink blood from the victim by cutting a vein with their hard, and sharp nails; drinking small amounts of blood, and then healing it with their saliva. Their nails can also be used to scale walls in a spider-like manner. Draining all of a human's blood would have a vampire absorb a part of the spirit of the victim, allowing the vampire to see into their memories (Darren does this in The Vampire's Assistant, to save the spirit of his dying friend). Vampires have a partial immunity to Sunlight; which means they can stay in pure daylight for 4-5 hours before disintegrating or burning up. However, despite this, Vampires can be active during the day (provided they stay in the shade). By contrast, Half-Vampires have complete immunity to Sunlight by default. Vampires are not bothered by garlic, silver, or holy objects. Fresh human blood is the most nutritious for vampires, but they can feed on preserved human blood or the blood of certain animals if necessary. Some animals' blood, however, is toxic to vampires. Vampires cannot reproduce, due to all their fluids being frozen. Vampires are created via blood-to-blood contact with humans, traditionally through the fingertips, but if any creature, human or animal, were to orally ingest vampire blood, it would be driven into a murderous frenzy and then die (similar to rabies). Full Vampires age one year in appearance for every ten human years that pass (1/10), where as half-vampires age one year in appearance for every five human years that pass (1/5). This comes into play in the series when Darren meets an old girlfriend he had; now they are adults but Darren still looks about the same as he did when they first met. The oldest vampire in the series is Paris Skyle, who was \"Blooded\" at age two and lived for over eight hundred years. Vampires cast reflections and shadows but cannot be photographed due to a particular vibration of their atoms. Also, as in folklore, vampires sleep in coffins.\n\nParagraph 9: In early 1962, LDS Church president David O. McKay authorized construction of the nonprofit center as a way to provide employment and scholarships for students at BYU-Hawaii and to preserve the cultures of Polynesia. It has its roots in 1940s and 1950s hukilau and luau beach gatherings to earn money to rebuild a local chapel belonging to the LDS Church, which had been destroyed in a fire. \"The Hukilau Song,\" made famous by Alfred Apaka, was written following the composer and song's original singer, Jack Owens, visit to Lāi.e.'s hukilau. In October 1980, Guangdong Party first secretary Xi Zhongxun, father of current Chinese leader Xi Jinping, visited the PCC during a tour of the United States. After the September 11 attacks attendance suffered at the PCC. In 2004, the PCC doubled its advertising budget, \"to promote local music, dance and food festivals\".\n\nParagraph 10: As the fall of Thessalonica appeared imminent, Pope Honorius excommunicated Theodore, ordered an embargo on horses, troops, and supplies from the Adriatic ports, and sent letters to Constantinople urging assistance to Demetrius. Demetrius himself went to Italy to seek aid, being received by the Pope in Rome in March 1222 and by Emperor Frederick II () soon after. A crusade was proclaimed against Theodore, and troops began to gather in Italy. In the meantime, the Latin Empire, now under Robert of Courtenay (), was once more embroiled in warfare with Nicaea as it supported Laskaris' brothers in their challenge against the new Nicaean emperor, John III Doukas Vatatzes (). The first detachments of the assembling crusade, under Count Oberto II of Biandrate, arrived at Thessalonica in summer 1222 and joined the de facto regent, Guy Pallavicini. Theodore now hastened his move against Thessalonica. After preliminary operations in late 1222, in early 1223 he laid siege to the city. Honorius excommunicated him again, and redoubled his effort to promote the crusade, which had come to a standstill in the meantime. At the Pope's urging, Venice and Emperor Frederick promised aid. Robert of Courtenay also pledged to assist, while Honorius called upon the Latin princes of southern Greece to join in the effort. The crusade finally assembled at Brindisi in March 1224. In his instructions to his legate, however, Honorius did not rule out the possibility of Theodore coming to terms with the Crusaders. True to his word, in April 1224 Robert of Courtenay sent an army to besiege Serres. During the siege, the Latin generals learned of the disastrous defeat of the main Latin army at the hands of John III Doukas Vatatzes at the Battle of Poimanenon. They lifted the siege and hastened back to Constantinople, only to be intercepted by Theodore's men; most of the Latin army were killed or taken prisoner.\n\nParagraph 11: The town of Tabuco was located near the corner of a river and the lake of Ba-i which was made bancas or raft as the common means of transportation going to the town of Tabuco. There were many trees of kabuyaw growing around the area. The fruit of kabuyaw was used as shampoo. So, when the priest asked for the name of the place, the native women readily answered \"kabuyaw\", thinking that the priest was asking for the name of the trees growing around the wharf. From then on, the priests and other Spanish officials called the town of Tabuco as Cabuyao.\n\nParagraph 12: In Pakistan, all adult citizens must register for the Computerised National Identity Card (CNIC) with a unique number upon reaching the age of 18. It serves as an identification document to authenticate an individual's identity as the citizen of Pakistan. Before introduction of the CNIC, manual National Identity Cards                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     (NICs) were issued to citizens of Pakistan. Today, the Government has shifted all its existing records of National Identity Cards (NIC) to the central computerised database managed by NADRA. New CNIC's are machine-readable and carry facial and fingerprint information.\n\nParagraph 13: Stone delivered his rebuttal argument on the afternoon of September 26. He began by dismissing one of Schwartz's tactics in his closing argument: the illustration of the circumstantial evidence as not being definitive proof of his client's guilt and of simply accusing him due to similar fact evidence regarding the Trotter and Wells incident. Stone then stated that the prosecution's case was constructed from both physical and circumstantial evidence—all collectively illustrating Schaefer's guilt. Referring to those who had testified, he began by defending the testimony of Lucille Place; emphasizing the crucial role in her accurate recording of Schaefer's license plate to ultimately linking him to the murders before inferring to the testimony of numerous individuals who had also testified, substantiating her identification of Schaefer and his vehicle. Stone also hearkened toward the positive identification of Jessup's purse by her mother, sister, and friend, who had each positively identified the item as belonging to Jessup, before inferring the defense witnesses who had also identified the item had lied to protect Schaefer, stating: \"How many of them picked it up, looked at it? The first thing they [all] did was say, 'Yes, I recognize it. He brought it back from Morocco in 1970.'\" He then referenced the testimony of Schaefer's own wife, who had stated to the court she had been given the item by her husband as a gift in November 1972, and had never seen the item prior. \n\nParagraph 14: Israeli Legislation: Kuperman cooperated with Israel's Ministry of Transportation on bettering the status of cancer patients and recognizing their unique needs. She solicited the support of former Israeli President Reuven Rivlin to support young cancer survivors. As part of her legislative efforts, Kuperman advocated a change in the manner in which the Israeli Government assists recovering cancer patients. She advocated for changes in the bureaucratic system in Israel, and raised the issue in Israeli legislator committees. She called to amend the Israeli \"Sal Shikum\" (a governmental support program) so that it would target young cancer patients, involve professional workshops, and further assist in the return of patients to the workforce. Her advocacy affected the legislation and the program she advocated for in turn became an integral part of the National Insurance Institute of Israel.''Israel Mortgage Reform: Kuperman advocated for recognition of what she called the \"enormous challenges\" of young-adult cancer patients. In Israel, 60% of young cancer survivors are not hired back to work. In addition, due to life insurance policies, young cancer survivors are not eligible for mortgage. Kuperman launched a national campaign to raise awareness and to change legislation. According to Kuperman, \"those who recover are discriminated against by the state twice - they are no longer entitled to a disability allowance from the National Insurance Institution, nor are they eligable for a mortgage.\" Kuperman demanded for the status-quo to be amended, stating that \"those who won this battle [of cancer] are entitled to return to the arena of the living.\" She joined hands with Israeli Knesset member Karine Elharrar to amend the legislation existed at the time. As a result, a new legislation was passed in the Israeli Knesset, forbidding refusal of mortgage to the disabled.Activism for cancer survivors: In 2021 Kuperman wrote for the Israeli Globes Magazine regarding the state of affairs of cancer patients. She lamented the current situation of patients being \"illogical and harmful,\" and wrote that Israel \"must act to change it\". She called young cancer patients the \"transparent population\", moreso due to Covid-19. She called for equal rights for cancer survivors in the workforce. Kuperman criticized the current treatment of young cancer patients, who are treated along elderly patients, as \"absurd\", due to the fundamental difference between the groups, beginning from their social status, their mental and emotional needs, and their hormonal and biological systems. Kuperman urged change and recognition for cancer patients in the young-adult category. She called for \"decision makers and the healthcare system to adapt to the new world and recognize them and their unique needs as a separate category.\" According to The Lancet, \"Social networks can be a powerful tool for oncologists to learn from their patients about what truly matters to them. At the challenging point of transitioning to survivorship, social digital media can be a platform to buffer this transition.\"Creator of clinics: Kuperman established dedicated clinics in hospitals with large oncological centers for young adults. She worked with the Rambam Hospital in Haifa, to establish a clinic dedicated to young-adult cancer patients. \n\nParagraph 15: At the request of Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, the U.S. Coast Guard started pre-construction plans for a chain of Loran-C radio stations to serve Southeast Asia 15 January 1966 in support of Operation Tight Reign during the Vietnam War. The actual construction of Station Con Son began during April with the delivery of construction materials by  and award of construction contracts to Morrison-Knudsen Corp. and Brown and Root Company. Station Con Son was one of five stations in the Southeast Asia chain and was designated SH-3 Yankee.  It consisted of a  tower, transmitter equipment buildings, fuel tanks, generators and barracks for personnel located on the north end of Con Son Island. The personnel complement for the station was two officers and 23 enlisted men. After commissioning on 2 September 1966 the station began the testing phase of operations and the five station chain was fully operational by 04:00 on 28 October, just nine months after the initial request from the Department of Defense. The station provided, along with its sister stations in the chain, signals that allowed aircraft and ships to receive accurate all-weather positioning data for navigation purposes. During January 1973 the operation of the station was turned over to civilian contractors who were responsible to the United States Coast Guard for all functions of the station. The Coast Guard continued to supply logistical and technical support on an as needed basis. When the fall of the South Vietnamese government was imminent, Station Con Son was directed to stay on the air until the last possible minute to provide navigation signals to aircraft and ships fleeing South Vietnam. Station Con Son stayed on the air until 1246 local time on 29 April 1975, after which the crew oversped the generators and damaged critical pieces of electronic gear.\n\nParagraph 16: In 1964, Schneemann began production of her 18-minute film Fuses, eventually finishing it in 1967. Fuses portrayed Schneemann and her then-boyfriend James Tenney (who also created the sound collages for Schneemann's Viet Flakes, 1965, and Snows, 1970) having sex as recorded by a 16 mm Bolex camera, as her cat, Kitch, observed nearby. Schneemann then altered the film by staining, burning, and directly drawing on the celluloid itself, mixing the concepts of painting and collage. The segments were edited together at varying speeds and superimposed with photographs of nature, which she juxtaposed against her and Tenney's bodies and sexual actions.  Fuses was motivated by Schneemann's desire to know if a woman's depiction of her own sexual acts was different from pornography and classical art as well as a reaction to Stan Brakhage's Loving (1957), Cat's Cradle (1959) and Window Water Baby Moving (1959). Schneemann herself appeared in some Brakhage films, including Cat's Cradle, in which she wore an apron at Brakhage's insistence. Despite her friendship with Brakhage, she later described the experience of being in Cat's Cradle as \"frightening,\" remarking that \"whenever I collaborated, went into a male friend's film, I always thought I would be able to hold my presence, maintain an authenticity. It was soon gone, lost in their celluloid dominance--a terrifying experience--experiences of true dissolution.\" She showed Fuses to her contemporaries as she worked on it in 1965 and 1966, receiving mostly positive feedback from her peers. Many critics described it as \"narcissistic exhibitionism\" and described it as self-indulgent. She received an especially strong reaction regarding the cunnilingus scene of the film. While Fuses is viewed as a \"proto-feminist\" film, Schneemann felt that it was largely neglected by feminist film historians. The film lacked the fetishism and objectification of the female body as seen in much male-oriented pornography. Two years after its completion, it won a Cannes Film Festival Special Jury Selection prize. Pop artist Andy Warhol, with whom Schneemann was acquainted, having spent time at The Factory, drolly remarked that Schneemann should have taken the film to Hollywood. Fuses became the first in Carolee Schneemann's Autobiographical Trilogy. Though her works of the 1960s such as this shared many of the same ideas with the concurrent Fluxus artists, she remained independent of any specific movement. They formed the groundwork for the feminist art movement of the late 1960s and 1970s.\n\nParagraph 17: Of the different words or rather sounds that are used in cheering, \"hurrah\", though now generally looked on as the typical British form of cheer, is found in various forms in German, Scandinavian, Russian (ura), French (hourra). It is probably onomatopoeic in origin. The English hurrah was preceded by huzza, stated to be a sailors word, and generally connected with heeze, to hoist, probably being one of the cries that sailors use when hauling or hoisting. The German hoch, seen in full in Hoch lebe der Kaiser, &c., the French vive, Italian and Spanish viva, evviva, are cries rather of acclamation than encouragement. The Japanese shout banzai became familiar during the Russo-Japanese War. In reports of parliamentary and other debates the insertion of cheers at any point in a speech indicates that approval was shown by members of the House by emphatic utterances of hear hear. Cheering may be tumultuous, or it may be conducted rhythmically by prearrangement, as in the case of the Hip-hip-hip by way of introduction to a simultaneous hurrah. The saying \"hip hip hurrah\" dates to the early 1800s.  Nevertheless, some sources speculate possible roots going back to the crusaders, then meaning \"Jerusalem is lost to the infidel, and we are on our way to paradise\". The abbreviation HEP would then stand for Hierosolyma est perdita, \"Jerusalem is lost\" in Latin.\n\nParagraph 18: During the presidency of Barack Obama, the Republican Party experienced internal conflict between its governing class (known as the Republican establishment) and the anti-establishment, small-government Tea Party movement. In 2012, The New York Times identified six wings of the Republican Party: Main Street Voters, Tea Party Voters, Christian Conservatives, Libertarians, The Disaffected, and The Endangered Or Vanished. In 2014, the Pew Research Center split Republican-leaning voters into three groups: Steadfast Conservatives, Business Conservatives, and Young Outsiders. In 2019, during the presidency of Donald Trump, Perry Bacon Jr. of FiveThirtyEight.com asserted that there were five groups of Republicans: Trumpists, Pro-Trumpers, Trump-Skeptical Conservatives, Trump-Skeptical Moderates, and Anti-Trumpers.\n\nParagraph 19: According to World Steel Association (Chinese companies data were provided by China Iron and Steel Association), the corporation was ranked the 5th in 2015 the world ranking by production volume (2nd in China for 34.938 million metric tons). A plan to merge with Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation was announced on 21–22 September 2016, which would make the combined production volume the second highest in the world (34.938 million + 25.776 million), after ArcelorMittal (97.136 million in 2015), surpassing Hesteel Group (47.745 million in 2015). Since Baosteel Group and Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation also announced targets of cutting 3.95 and 4.42 million metric tons production capacity respectively in June and July 2016, and a further cut for Baosteel Group of 2.10 million while a 3.15 million cut was already planned the final ranking may still significantly change.\n\nParagraph 20: At night the children ask their father to tell them a story, Ilea asks for Hercules to tell her about when he and Deianeira first met. Hercules begins relating how the fire had vanished from the Earth and that Deianeira's village needed fire, and how he got the fire back from Hera's temple. Halfway through the story Hercules realises the children are asleep. He and Deianeira retire to bed and she asks him if he misses his adventures and battling monsters, he says truthfully that he does miss it. The following day, Hercules is working in the stables and sees something flit past the door, he goes to look but sees nothing. As he walks back into the stable a man jumps down upon him, Hercules turns to see it is Iolaus. They begin talking about their adventures and the time when they had to fight the Lernaean Hydra that Hera had sent to kill them. The two men go inside to get a drink, Iolaus tells Hercules that he met a man who taught him some new moves that allow smaller men to overpower a bigger man. Hercules says he will not fight Iolaus, but he is eventually persuaded. The two men strip off their tops and prepare to spar. When Hercules attacks Iolaus he is overpowered by the smaller man, but after a short while Hercules gets the best of Iolaus as he sees Deianeira and Ilea standing in the doorway. Deianeira tells Iolaus that since Hercules gave up his adventures he has become depressed. A man arrives at the stable looking for Hercules, he tells him that he must help his village and that a monster has taken his brother. Hercules says he cannot go and the man says he has to because he is Hercules. Later that evening Deianeria asks him why he refused to help and he tells her that he promised to stay and raise the children with her. She tells him that he should not try to stop being Hercules, not for her or the children. She tells him to go and the next day her and Iolaus set off for Alturia. As they travel to Alturia a young couple are looking for somewhere quiet, they find the cave and enter. While they are making out the Minotaur comes and attacks them.\n\nParagraph 21: The false gharial is dark reddish-brown above with dark brown or black spots and cross-bands on the back and tail. Ventrals are grayish-white, with some lateral dark mottling. Juveniles are mottled with black on the sides of the jaws, body, and tail. The smooth and unornamented snout is extremely long and slender, parallel sided, with a length of 3.0 to 3.5 times the width at the base. All teeth are long and needle-like, interlocking on the insides of the jaws, and are individually socketed. The dorsal scales are broad at midbody and extend onto the sides of the body. The digits are webbed at the base. Integumentary sensory organs are present on the head and body scalation. Scales behind the head are frequently a slightly enlarged single pair. Some individuals bear a number of adjoining small keeled scales. Scalation is divided medially by soft granular skin. Three transverse rows of two enlarged nuchal scales are continuous with the dorsal scales, which consist of 22 transverse rows of six to eight scales, are broad at midbody and extend onto the sides of the body. Nuchal and dorsal rows equals a total of 22 to 23 rows. It has 18 double-crested caudal whorls and 17 single-crested caudal whorls. The flanks have one or two longitudinal rows of six to eight very enlarged scales on each side.\n\nParagraph 22: Mickey Smith is first introduced in the series' 2005 reboot première episode, \"Rose\". When Mickey's girlfriend Rose (Billie Piper) begins investigating a mysterious alien called the Doctor (Christopher Eccleston), Mickey is captured by the alien Nestene Consciousness, from which a living plastic facsimile of him (an 'auton') is created. Mickey, terrified by the revelation that alien life exists, fails to impress the Doctor, who only invites Rose to be his travelling companion in time and space. In the year since Rose absconded with the Doctor, Mickey has been the prime suspect for Rose's disappearance and has become distressed as a result. However, he assists the pair in defeating the Slitheen, a family of extraterrestrial criminals; using his computer hacking skills, he commandeers a military harpoon missile which he targets at 10 Downing Street to kill the Slitheen. Mickey then declines an invitation from the Doctor to join him and Rose in the TARDIS. A much younger Mickey, played by Casey Dyer, appears briefly when Rose attempts to alter her childhood in \"Father's Day\". In \"Boom Town\", Mickey later meets up with the Doctor, Rose and new companion Captain Jack (John Barrowman) in Cardiff, where he helps them foil a Slitheen plot. In the series' finale episode \"The Parting of the Ways\", when Rose becomes stranded at home at the Powell Estate, Mickey uses a recovery truck to crack open the TARDIS's console, through which Rose is able to absorb the time vortex and save the universe from an invasion of the hateful mutant alien Daleks.\n\nParagraph 23: Clint Bowyer was the fastest in the first practice session with a time of 47.788 and a speed of . Kyle Busch was the fastest in the final practice session with a time of 49.056 and a speed of . Brian Vickers won the pole with a time of 48.825 and a speed of . “I thought that coming to three (laps) to go that we literally no shot,’’ said Vickers, who scored his first career Sprint Cup victory at this track in 2006. “We were way back. Like a half a straightaway behind the whole field and they all checked up and gave me a chance and gave me a run.’’ Justin Allgaier, Joe Nemechek and Ricky Stenhouse Jr. failed to qualify. “I thought being the last car in line would be beneficial for us,’’ Stenhouse said. “We had Jeff Gordon leading the pack there I thought we would have a good shot at putting a good lap in, but my spotter was telling me, ‘Hey, you have 30 seconds to get across the start-finish line’ as we were entering Turn 3. I don’t guess Eddie d'Hondt (No. 24 team spotter) was giving him a lot of information. He kept slowing the pack down, and we didn’t get a good lap and never got across the start-finish line in time. My spotter was giving me the information I needed, and I wish (Gordon’s spotter) would have been doing the same.” Jeff Gordon started 43rd for only the second time in his career. “The plan was shot before the plan started,’’ Gordon said. “I messed up ultimately. I just mistimed getting to the line. The whole group was going so slow, I knew I had to have a gap. When I came across the line, I thought I had enough to be able to complete that lap and get one more, which was the only way we were going to be to make it (to the second round), but we came up short. It’s a mess out there. It’s not easy.’’ Originally, Nemechek made it through the first round, but his time was disallowed after the oil tank encasement was found to be improperly installed. This allowed Reed Sorenson, who originally failed to qualify, to start the race. Brad Keselowski qualified fifth, but due to an alternator change (parc fermé rules are in effect at Talladega), started from the rear along with Matt Kenseth, who changed an engine. Terry Labonte, who made his final start, qualified ninth (although he had to go to the rear of the field due after NASCAR made the team change their paint scheme). It was his best qualifying performance since Sonoma 2005. \"You know, it's only about the third time I've said this is gonna be my last race, but this is really gonna be the last one,\" he said Saturday. \"It's been fun.\"\n\nParagraph 24: Fritz Köberle was born in Eichgraben, Austria, and studied medicine at the University of Vienna, Austria, graduating magna cum laude in 1934. He began to work in the Institute of Pathology while he was a student and, soon after his 1935 graduation, he was admitted as an assistant professor. With the annexation of Austria to Germany (Anschluss), Köberle was drafted into the Army as a medical lieutenant and worked as a pathologist in the Central Army Hospital of Vienna. With the outbreak of the Second World War hostilities, Köberle was attached as field pathologist to the XII Army Group of the Wehrmacht in 1940 and served in the fronts of France, Belgium, Poland and Russia. He was able to acquire during this period an enormous experience on the pathology of infectious diseases (bacterial dysentery, typhus, typhoid fever, tularemia and malaria) as well as war-inflicted wounds, and performing more than four thousand autopsies.  After the war, Köberle returned to the University of Münster as Privatdozent, continuing his activities as professor and researcher of medical pathology until 1945. He returned shortly to the University of Vienna, and, in 1946, accepted a post as director of the Serological and Pathological Institute of the General Hospital of St. Pölten, Lower Austria.\n\nParagraph 25: Nancy and Lee have an argument, which causes Ollie (now Charlie Harrington) to fall off his highchair. Mick and Linda do not witness this, and when Mick insists they should get Ollie to hospital, Linda states he seems fine, but she later finds Ollie is not breathing. She successfully resuscitates him, only for him to suffer a seizure. Ollie is taken to hospital where a doctor tells the Carters that he could have brain damage after a head injury. Linda, in denial about the severity of Ollie's condition, argues with Mick, especially when he blames Nancy for the incident, however, she soon realises that Mick is right about Ollie having changed when he does not respond to her in the usual way. Linda is delighted by Johnny's (now played by Ted Reilly) return but saddened by Nancy's departure. Linda is devastated when Dean is acquitted but tells Mick she has become a strong person and that their relationship has become stronger. The Carters are later devastated when a pregnant Whitney suffers a miscarriage but are delighted when Lee and Whitney get married. The Carters are traumatised by a violent robbery on The Queen Vic, during which Linda's favourite necklace is stolen. Linda is inspired to make Christmas great as a result, and is overjoyed when Ollie takes his first steps. Linda is devastated to learn that Elaine has had a stroke in Spain on Christmas Eve, and she flies out there with Johnny to support her mother. Later, Johnny returns to Walford while Linda relocates with Elaine to Watford to aid her mother's recovery. Mick visits Linda and informs her that Babe has caused the pub to be fined £20,000 because of her selling alcohol illegally outside of licensing hours. When Mick struggles to cope with the pub's mounting debts, Jane Beale (Laurie Brett) calls Linda, worried about Mick. Linda returns the following day and Mick informs her of Lee's departure and the debts he left. Linda initially blames Whitney and an argument ensues, causing Whitney to leave. Mick explains to Linda that it was Lee's fault, causing another argument, although they make up and have sex. After a heart-to-heart with Whitney, Linda decides to return to Elaine, which angers Mick as Linda saw the state he was in and left anyway. Linda then sends Woody Woodward (Lee Ryan) to work in The Queen Vic as a bar manager. With Lady Di needing an expensive operation and mounting debts, Shirley convinces Linda to sell the freehold of The Queen Vic, and they agree not to tell Mick. Linda signs the paperwork and Shirley forges Mick's signature. Linda returns to Walford for her birthday and meets Fi Browning (Lisa Faulkner), The Queen Vic's business consultant sent by the freeholder, Grafton Hill, and with the changes, she feels that The Queen Vic is not her home. She leaves again in the middle of the night, saying Elaine has fallen, but she is fine and Linda tells Elaine that she could not talk to Mick.\n\nParagraph 26: Frank J. Oteri asks whether Montezuma and the operas of Dallapiccola ought to be regarded as being among the \"important 12-tone operas\", along with Berg's Lulu, Schoenberg's Moses und Aron, and Zimmermann's Die Soldaten. Andrea Olmstead agrees that Montezuma may aptly be compared with Berg's Lulu and Wozzeck, but primarily because of their shared extensive use of ostinato rhythms. Michael Steinberg says that it is \"arguably the richest opera yet written by an American composer\", and like Olmstead compares it to Wozzeck and Lulu (as well as to Les Troyens, Moses und Aron, War and Peace, and Palestrina) because, like them, Montezuma has long remained a \"legend\". Andrew Porter echos the \"legendary\" characterization and the comparison to Pfitzner's Palestrina, adding that these two operas, as well as Busoni's Doktor Faust, Hindemith's Harmonie der Welt, and Dallapiccola's Ulisse are \"both personal and closely argued\". At the same time, he cautions that \"both text and music are insistent, unrelaxed, and reject passive acceptance\", placing unusually high demands on the audience through the combination of Borgese's \"Wardour Street diction\" and Sessions's musical setting, which frequently superimposes two different vocal settings or accompanies the voices with orchestration that \"amounts in performance to stiff competition\". Patrick Smith agrees with the comparison to Moses und Aron because both are works \"of the mind rather than of the opera stage\". However, he does not find Sessions the match of Schoenberg's \"ramrod genius\", so that Montezuma \"remains a tableau-oratorio\" in which the salient moments (including a love duet inspired by Verdi's Otello) fail to be \"drawn into a cohesive and ongoing whole.\" He finds the opera's greatest defect is its libretto, a \"farrago of poetasty\", which is \"a ghastly example of self-parody that even a Robert Benchley could not have topped\". John Harbison similarly finds parallels between the act-1 endings of both Montezuma and Otello, but also notes similarities to Aida and Tristan und Isolde.\n\nParagraph 27: The rise of literature coincided with the rise of nationalism and independence in Cape Verde.  Literature flourished in the 20th century.  Diário was published in 1929 by Portuguese António Pedro, it would plant the seeds for the creation of Claridade along with the Portuguese magazine Presença which was also read in Cape Verde and modern Brazilian literature. Francisco Xavier da Cruz, better known as B. Leza, a writer that was also a musician wrote several works including Uma partícula da Lira Cabo-Verdiana (1933) which features 10 mornas by himself and a text which explains its ideas about Cape Verdean music.  A few works about Africa were made by Augusto Casimiro, one of them was Ilhas Crioulas (Creole Islands) published in 1935 which was set in the archipelago and may be considered the last ingredient for the creation the review a year later.  Manuel Lopes, Baltasar Lopes da Silva, better known as Osvaldo Alcantarâ and Jorge Barbosa founded a review known as Claridade in 1936 which would relate to Cape Verdean independence, originally a newspaper, it would settle for a magazine.  The first book published with Claridade was Arquipélago, published in 1935, others would later be published including Chiquinho in 1947, Chuva Braba in 1956 and Os Flagelados do Vento Leste in 1960.  Claridade shut down its doors.  Similarly, the same literary magazine released literary seeds that would germinate in other major Cape Verdean publications, such as, Certeza (1944), Suplemento Cultural (1958), two after independence including Raízes (1977) and Ponto & Vírgula (1983).  Certeza was first published in March 1944 and made a milestone in Cape Verdean literature, it was a review that featured a literary work made by a female, the review was banned by the censor in January 1945.  Not long after Claridade was founded, António Aurélio Gonçalves published his first work titled Aspecto da Ironia de Eça de Queiroz in 1937.  Henrique Teixeira de Sousa later became an icon of Cape Verdean literature.  Cape Verdean born Italian Sergio Frusoni published poems and short stories in Cape Verdean creole in that time.  Jorge Barbosa also wrote Caderno de um Ilhéu (An Islander's Notebook) in 1955 which won the Camilo Pessanha Award, the first Cape Verdean book to be awarded.  Aguinaldo Fonseca was the forgotten poet, though his poems were published in \"Linha do Horizonte\" collection in 1951.\n\nParagraph 28: Historical records show that Stewarton has existed since at least the 12th century with various non-historical references to the town dating to the early 11th century. The most famous of these non-historical references concerns the legend of Máel Coluim III the son of Donnchad I of Scotland who appears as a character in William Shakespeare's play Macbeth. As the legend goes, Mac Bethad had slain Donnchad to enable himself to become king of Scotland and immediately turned his attention towards Donnchad's son Máel Coluim (the next in line to the throne). When Máel Coluim learned of his father's death and Mac Bethad's intentions to murder him, he fled for the relative safety of England. Unfortunately for Máel Coluim, Mac Bethad and his associates had tracked him down and were gaining on him as he entered the estate of Corsehill  on the edge of Stewarton. In panic Máel Coluim pleaded for the assistance of a nearby farmer named either Friskine or Máel Coluim (accounts differ) who was forking hay on the estate. Friskine/Máel Coluim covered Máel Coluim in hay, allowing him to escape Mac Bethad and his associates. He later found refuge with King Harthacanute, who reigned as Canute II, King of England and Norway and in 1057, after returning to Scotland and defeating Mac Bethad in the Battle of Lumphanan in 1057 to become King of Scots, he rewarded Friskine's family with the Baillie of Cunninghame to show his gratitude to the farmer who had saved his life 17 years earlier. The Cunninghame family logo now features a \"Y\" shaped fork with the words \"over fork over\" underneath - a logo which appears in various places in Stewarton, notably as the logo of the two primary schools in the area - Lainshaw primary school and Nether Robertland primary school.\n\nParagraph 29: The  show's teaser, set June 25, 1876, depicts an army scout, a sergeant and a trooper finding evidence of Indians. An arrow strikes the scout in the back while the regular soldiers fire their carbines at an unseen foe. The time jumps ahead to the present, June 25, 1964, the 88th anniversary of the Battle of the Little Bighorn. Three United States Army National Guard soldiers (Connors, McCluskey and Langsford) are in a M3 Stuart tank participating in a war game near the site of the Battle of the Little Bighorn, where General George Armstrong Custer made his last stand. Their orders coincide with the route of Custer and his men. As they follow the route, they hear strange things such as Indian battle cries and horses running when nobody is there. Connors wonders if they have somehow gone back in time. When they return, Connors reports to his Captain Dennet what occurred and is reprimanded.", "answers": ["Paragraph 8"], "length": 7962, "dataset": "passage_retrieval_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "7ee700ad65b275d5c264f0231371cdde892cd44171a96878"}
{"input": "The text discusses the success and skills of college football player Pat White. In his sophomore season, White passed for 1,655 yards and 13 touchdowns and rushed for 1,219 yards and 18 touchdowns, earning him the title of Big East Offensive Player of the Year. He was also named to the first-team all-Big East squad. White was considered the leader of his team and had standout performances in several games, including the Gator Bowl, a loss to Louisville, and the annual rivalry game against Pittsburgh. He was praised by opponents and teammates alike for his abilities as a quarterback and his impressive performances on the field. White also overcame injuries in the Gator Bowl and led his team to a come-from-behind victory. In another game against Syracuse, he rushed for a career-high 247 yards and scored four touchdowns.", "context": "Paragraph 1: In their opening match against Lancashire, Derbyshire opened with 111 to which Lancashire replied with 84. Although Derbyshire only managed 51 in their second innings, Lancashire fared worse with 44 to give Derbyshire a 34 run victory. Against Hampshire, Derbyshire made 115 in the first innings and Hampshire scored 105 in response. Derbyshire's second innings reached 242, although no player scored 50 or more. Hampshire were only able to make 63 in reply giving Derbyshire a 189 run victory. Against MCC,  Derbyshire were playing a side which included W G Grace who made 83 runs and took 14 wickets. In the first innings MCC made 112, being checked by Mycroft who took 8 wickets while Derbyshire replied with 117.  In the second innings MCC made 123 while Derbyshire made 78 to lose by 40 runs. In their second match against Lancashire, Lancashire set an opening target of 215 and Derbyshire made 110 in reply and 114 in the follow-on. Lancashire made the necessary 10 runs to win by 10 wickets. Against Kent, Kent made 191 in the first innings due to 80 by Lord Harris and Derbyshire replied with 127. In Kent's second innings Harris was out for a duck and Kent made 124, while Derbyshire's reply of 189 thanks to 54 not out by Foster gave them the match by one wicket. George Gibbons Hearne   took 14 wickets for Kent in the match. In Derbyshire's first County match against Yorkshire, Yorkshire scored 210 and Derbyshire who made 108 were forced to follow on. Derbyshire's second innings total of 189 left Yorkshire with 88 to make which they achieved with the loss of one wicket. In the second Kent match, Kent made 149 in the first innings and Derbyshire replied with 110. Kent's second innings score was 78 and Derbyshire reached 119 to win with three wickets to spare. In the second Hampshire match Hampshire opened with 120 and Derbyshire ran up 319 in reply. Although both R Smith and Rigley were injured in the innings this was compensated for by a score of 115 by Platt. Hampshire scored 86 in their second innings to give Derbyshire a victory by an innings and 113 runs. In the final match against Yorkshire, Yorkshire began with 278 and with a first innings reply of 74, Derbyshire had to follow-on needing over 200. However Derbyshire made 220 with 90 not out by Platt to save the match as a draw, and as there was insufficient time for Yorkshire to bat.\n\nParagraph 2: The title Die kinders van Kain immediately points to those excluded from the rest of society. The collection reflects the progress of his first two books and in depicting the provocation, the melancholy and loneliness of the brown people and can be seen as an important milestone in African poetry. The statement of most of the poems is sober and less desperate, while a larger number a number contain a transcendent purity. Beautiful poems include Kinders van Kain (where the fate of those kicked out is contrasted with the promise of the New Day); Die drumpel (The threshold), in which the harsh manner in which coloured people are treated is challenged by an accusation that, as a racial group, they originated from the immoral behaviour of white pioneers; Kinderland (Childhood), with its melancholy about the utterly lost dreams of childhood; and Die veles (The many) follows the path of common people through life in rather a witty manner. Bergies (Mountain dwellers) is also noteworthy, with its witty imagery of this marginalised sector of society, while Windermere  touches the social needs of the people. Kaapse naweek describes the superficial lifestyle of revellers. Die toring Babel (The Tower of Babel) makes of discrimination not simply a local but a universal issue, while Kamee (Cameo) portrays the cheerfulness of the brown woman in the midst of her suffering.Suiderkruis, in two sections, contains poems about of the memories of a youth in the rural areas. on the one hand and events within the contemporary urban environment on the other. Each section ends with a suite of five poems, Ballade – a series about the \"platteland\", the countryside, and one on the \"Confession of the city dweller\" showing the contrasts in the feeling of freedom. Memories of country life find expression in poignant poetic memoirs such as  Tuiskoms (Homecoming) and Sekelgat, where former joys are played off against the sadness of remembrance. Well portrayed are also the marginalised of the city, Koerante-verkopertjie (News vendor) and Die doofstomme (The deaf-mute).Alleenstryd (\"Single combat\" or \"the lonely struggle\") is a label he himself finds appropriate for poetry up to that point. It fits the loneliness and the life struggles to which his poems give voice, characterised in the progression from rural nature verses to the more realistically-oriented poems of city life.Nag is verby, dedicated to I.D. du Plessis deals with how the question of skin colour can dominate one's judgements on the value and dignity of the human being, and the search for one's own identity in trying to find the sense of security that was present in the parental home. . The collection includes poems of resistance, landscape poetry, poems of remembrance and travel, the latter inspired by journeys both at home and abroad. The title reflects a optimistic outlook, a move away from a situation of frustration to one of greater hope and equality, which is also reflected in the content of the poems. The title poem develops a prophetic vision of human freedom. Noteworthy poems are Stadsmens (City dweller), depicting the hand-to-mouth existence of this group; Kaapse Vlak (Cape Flats) about the violent death of a young boy; and Landelik (Rural), beautiful images from this carefree and simple world. There are also several memory verses, the best of them, Drie dromertjies (Three little drummers), Die witborskraai (The pied crow) and Sekelmaan (The sickle moon).\n\nParagraph 3: The score received positive reviews. Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian opined Marx's \"nerve-jangling\" score underlined the \"inner anxiety of the intense, claustrophobic black comedy\". Stephen Saito for Moveable Fest described the score as Marx's version of the Jaws theme. IndieWires Jude Dry wrote that the \"tense string score ratchets up the tension, though this technique loses its bite after a few too many uses\", while Katie Rife of The A.V. Club praised it, likening it to the work of Harry Manfredini. Alex Godfrey of Empire wrote that Marx's \"discordant, unsettling score — like [Krzysztof] Penderecki doing klezmer — ratchets up, strings picked and plucked and screeched like nails on a blackboard\". The Hollywood Reporter-based Jon Frosch wrote that \"Ariel Marx's anxiogenic score, with its nervous string plucking and piano plinking, both builds and punctuates the tension.\" Shreya Paul of Firstpost wrote that \"Ariel Marx's menacing, staccato strings-centric score enhances the angst that each character experiences while also highlighting the sheer comedy behind their exposé.\" Praising the music and sound design, The Harvard Crimson's Megan Gamino wrote:\"Ariel Marx artfully includes the chaotic noises of the shiva, making for particularly grounding and grating moments in the music. The use of intense “Jaws”-like string instruments puts viewers on edge, and clever sound mixing of a crying baby helps emphasize the film’s most harrowing moments [...] These types of sound interpolations help to bridge the gap between viewers and Danielle. The audience reacts to the shrill score at the same moment Danielle is dealing with the baby’s shrill crying after an increasingly tense day.\"CineVue-based Christopher Machell wrote \"There is a symbolic cacophony to it all, made manifest by the plucked strings of Ariel Marx’s score and the brilliant, maddening sound design, layering Marx’s stabbing music and a growing diegetic clutter to breaking point.\" The Austin Chronicle's Richard Whittaker wrote that Marx's \"scratchy string-and-timpani soundtrack\" brings a \"a sensation of queasiness further unbalanced by the score\". Andrew Parker for The GATE also touched on the score's horror-like qualities, saying it worked well for its contribution to the claustrophobic storytelling. Ty Burr of The Boston Globe noted Ariel Marx's score, \"pulling plucks and squawks out of an abused violin\" is \"dinner music for an ulcer\". Emily Moss of the student newspaper Varsity (Cambridge) compared the score of the film to that of Get Out and Hereditary. Writing for the Jewish independent magazine The Forward, Mira Fox felt that Marx's \"high-pitched and plunky soundtrack\" felt akin to the shreiking violins played in the score for Psycho (1960).\n\nParagraph 4: In the Mosaic law, for monetary matters, women's and men's rights were almost exactly equal. A woman was entitled to her own private property, including land, livestock, slaves, and servants. A woman had the right to inherit whatever anyone bequeathed to her as a death gift, and inherited equally with brothers and in the absence of sons would inherit everything. A woman could likewise bequeath her belongings to others as a death gift. Upon dying intestate, a woman's property would be inherited by her children if she had them, her husband if she was married, or her father if she were single. A woman could sue in court and did not need a male to represent her.\n\nParagraph 5: The show had originally four judges, namely musician, instrumentalist, and Indonesian jazz icon Indra Lesmana, Indonesian pop diva Titi DJ, radio personality Meuthia Kasim, and film director Dimas Djayadiningrat a.k.a. Dimas Djay. In season three, radio and television personality Indy Barends replaced Meuthia Kasim because of Meuthia's health. Indy stayed only for one season and left the show before season four. In season four, MTV video jockey, actor, and radio host Jamie Aditya replaced Indy Barends and musician, singer, producer, and impresario Anang Hermansyah replaced Dimas Djay who left the panel after three seasons. In season five, Jamie left the panel and only three judges, Indra, Titi, and Anang were the judges. In 2010, Indra Lesmana and Titi DJ left the panel and replaced by composer and conductor Erwin Gutawa and Indonesian superstar Agnes Monica. Indonesian and Malaysian pop diva Rossa joined panel to be the fourth judge. And in 2012, Anang Hermansyah and Agnes Monica return as judges, while a frontman of Dewa 19, musician, composer, and hits-maker music producer Ahmad Dhani replaced Erwin Gutawa in the panel. In 2014, Titi DJ returned to the panel after an absence of three seasons. while Agnes Monica left the panel of judges and being replaced by singer and vocalist of Kotak Band Tantri Syalindri. Anang and Dhani still returned as judges. In 2018, RCTI announced all judges from last season would not be returned and the formation panel were changed from four judges into five judges. Pop-rock singer and ex-frontman of Dewa 19 Ari Lasso, frontman of Gigi and songwriter Armand Maulana, music producer and musician Maia Estianty, famous actress and pop singer BCL, and runner-up of Indonesian Idol season 2 Judika were all set for the panel. On the upcoming season 10 or called \"Idol X\", all the judges from previous season was confirmed to come back, except Armand due to his duties on another talent show, and being replaced by previous seasons judge Anang Hermansyah after one hiatus season. In 2020 season, BCL being replaced by pop diva Rossa due to BCL's mental conditions after her husband's death at the same year. In 2022 season, Maia and Ari being replaced by BCL, previous seasons judge and ex-frontman of Naif, David Bayu, new judge.\n\nParagraph 6: White followed up a tremendous freshman season with a great sophomore season, in which he passed for 1,655 yards and 13 TDs and rushed for 1,219 yards and 18 touchdowns on his way to being named the Big East Offensive Player of the Year and was named to the first-team all-Big East squad. He was considered the leader of the team and his three best performances of the year came in the Gator Bowl, in the loss to Louisville when White continued to try to come back late in the game, and against Pittsburgh in the annual rivalry game, a 45–27 win, when he threw for 204 yards and two touchdowns, and ran for 220 yards and two touchdowns. His 200+ rushing and passing yards makes him one of only eight players in NCAA history to do so in a game. He was also caught on camera mocking the Pitt Panther growl by a national ESPN audience in that game. Pittsburgh linebacker H. B. Blades, who was an all-Big East selection that season, said, \"Pat White is the best quarterback in college football,\" after the loss. In the Gator Bowl against Georgia Tech, White battled ankle, neck, and wrist injuries and a 35–17 third-quarter deficit to bring the Mountaineers back to win 38–35 without the help of back Steve Slaton, who was out with injuries as well. White took the ball on 10 of the last 12 plays, gaining 54 yards and four first downs, to run out the clock for the Mountaineers. Georgia Tech linebacker Philip Wheeler said when asked the three players he liked to watch in college football, \"Three? Forget it. How about one? Pat White. Dude is unbelievable. I mean, he can do it all. He's fast, he stronger than he looks and he can throw it. Yeah, I love watching him -- as long as he's not doing it to us.\" Also against Syracuse, White rushed for a career-high 247 yards and scored four touchdowns.\n\nParagraph 7: Squires and Kennison's thesis was that there is no coordinated approach to the development of police firearms policy in Britain, and that the response Waldorf's shooting was an example of the British police's event-driven policy making. They noted that the reforms emanating from the Dear Report did not prevent similar incidents, and believed that \"each incident exposed failings at several levels of police critical incident management and execution\". In 1986, the Home Office established another working group to build on the Dear Report, following two more mistaken police shootings—those of Cherry Groce, which sparked the 1985 Brixton riot, and John Shorthouse a five-year-old boy accidentally shot dead in Birmingham. Peter Waddington, a sociologist specialising in police policy on the use of force, suggested that these incidents, taken together with Waldorf's shooting, caused a permanent shift in the public's perception of armed policing and that police shootings—even of armed criminals and where police procedure had been followed correctly—became much more controversial from then on. The report endorsed Dear's recommendations on training and selection of AFOs. Its main recommendation was that police forces place greater emphasis on specialist teams of armed officers, such as the Met's D11, and concentrate the use of firearms on a smaller, but better-trained, group of officers. It also suggested research into roving armed patrols, which in the 1990s became armed response vehicles, and recommended that local detectives (as Finch was) should no longer be AFOs; members of central squads (such as C11 or the Flying Squad) would be the only plainclothes officers to hold AFO status. As a result of these reforms, the number of AFOs in the Met reduced by about almost half over the following decade. Many of the report's other findings were overtaken by the 1987 Hungerford massacre, which prompted further reforms to armed policing. In a 2023 book chapter, Squires argued that the effects of Waldorf's shooting continued to be felt and that the lessons from it and other incidents remained relevant.\n\nParagraph 8: As the successor to William Nicol, in 1853, Harkness was appointed professor of geology in Queen's College, Cork, and in 1856 he was elected fellow of the Royal Society. During this period, he wrote some articles on the geology of parts of Ireland, and exercised much influence as a teacher, but he returned to England during his vacations and devoted himself assiduously to the geology of the Lake district. He was also a constant attendant at the meetings of the British Association. In 1854 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, his proposer being John Hutton Balfour.\n\nParagraph 9: 1.

Backpacks must be clear or mesh unless it is in conjunction with a school-approved activity (i.e., cheerleading, Pantherettes, athletics). 19. Student IDs must be worn at all times.\n\nParagraph 10: \"When the contest is only with native rulers, and with such native strength as those rulers can enlist in their defence, the answer I should give to the question of the legitimacy of intervention is, as a general rule, No. The reason is, that there can seldom be anything approaching to assurance that intervention, even if successful, would be for the good of the people themselves. The only test possessing any real value, of a people's having become fit for popular institutions, is that they, or a sufficient portion of them to prevail in the contest, are willing to brave labour and danger for their liberation. I know all that may be said, I know it may be urged that the virtues of freemen cannot be learnt in the school of slavery, and that if a people are not fit for freedom, to have any chance of becoming so they must first be free. And this would be conclusive, if the intervention recommended would really give them freedom. But the evil is, that if they have not sufficient love of liberty to be able to wrest it from merely domestic oppressors, the liberty which is bestowed on them by other hands than their own, will have nothing real, nothing permanent. No people ever was and remained free, but because it was determined to be so....\"Mill's argument for humanitarian intervention, however, is not compatible with modern international law. International law after World War II establishes the principle of sovereign equality, and therefore to subject a sovereign state to outside intervention is generally considered illegal. To deal with this potential conflict between humanitarian intervention and the international legal system, there are some philosophical attempts to conciliate the two concepts and specify conditions for ethically justified interventions. John Rawls, one of the most influential political philosophers of the twentieth century, offers his theory of humanitarian intervention based on the notion of \"well-ordered society.\" According to Rawls, a well-ordered society should be peaceful and legitimate, and it must respect basic human rights. Between such well-ordered societies, the principle of non-intervention should uphold. On the other hand, expansionist or human rights violating regimes are not shielded from the international law: in grave cases such as ethnic cleansing, coercive intervention by others is legitimate.\n\nParagraph 11: Introduced in 2010, the amp featured Hand-wired turret board construction (against cheaper PCB construction), Birch-ply cabinets featuring solid bracing and a natural high frequency diffuser (versus MDF cabinets and no high frequency diffuser); All-tube design (different from the Custom series tube pre/power amp but solid-state rectifier); ECC83/12AX7 preamp tubes (×3) EL84 power tube quartet; (AC30 models); EL84 Duet (AC15 models); GZ34 rectifier (AC30 models); EZ81 rectifier (AC15 models); came factory-fitted with matched Ruby Tubes to provide extended dynamic range; maintained the traditional VOX two-channel design (Top Boost and Normal. High and Low inputs for each channel); the Normal channel features an additional BRIGHT switch; The top boost channel features a HOT/COOL switch to achieve even more gain. A Master Volume/BYPASS switch completely bypasses the Master Volume section allowing incredible levels of gain and sustain to be achieved. OP mode switch cut the amp's Output Power level in half (30 > 15 on the AC30, 15 > 7.5 on the AC15) allowing higher levels of saturation to be achieved at lower volumes. A Vintage fawn-colored vinyl covering, reminiscent of the 1960 classic AC30 and was available with either Celestion Alnico Blue or Celestion G12M Greenback speakers. A VFS1 footswitch controls the Top Boost channel's HOT/COOL switch was also included. The Heritage series 50th anniversary models incorporate the classic EF86 pre-amp tube, which although subject to failure in the late '50s had been re-introduced and improved. The classic EF86 pre-amp tube is remarkable for its high gain and for the notable harmonic overtones it produces and feeds to the power tubes when driven into distortion, providing the creamy distinctive VOX sound of the early hand made amplifiers produced by Jennings of Dartford. Clapton, Cream, Pink Floyd and Queen are ambassadors to the success of the early AC30s. The Heritage series 50th anniversary model stands alone as either the AC15 or AC30 with this distinct circuitry not found in the current VOX line-up.\n\nParagraph 12: The Moore 24 is a development of Grendal, a prototype sailboat that was intended for a Transpacific Yacht Race for boats under  in length. That race was never held, but Grendal went on to win the 1970 Midget Ocean Racing Class (MORC) championships. Grendal had a beam of under , but the production boat was given a wider beam of . The Moore 24 also received a raised deck to increase headroom below, a relocated keel and a new sail plan. Development has continued though the production period of the boat and production boats in 2021 were all flush-decked, with open transoms, while remaining class-legal.\n\nParagraph 13: The park is home to several different facilities for recreation and activity purposes. The park is home to five different beach access points, the three primary points on the gulf side of the park, and two additional, smaller access points on the Santa Rosa Sound side of the park. Two of these five access points also have diving reefs for snorkeling and scuba diving The park has a roughly one mile long path for walking, running, and bicycling. In addition, the park has a dozen pavilions with picnic tables and coal-fueled stoves, for picnics and outdoor meals. All five beach access points have public restrooms.", "answers": ["Paragraph 6"], "length": 4200, "dataset": "passage_retrieval_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "a4e106517f2a6a49ea1e90bb825378d25f0bb4860659ee46"}

Ryan MacDonald of GameSpot noted the easy control scheme and the well-designed graphics of the PlayStation version. MacDonald noted that the game's offerings would give reason for players to \"retire\" from Twisted Metal 2. Shawn Smith of Electronic Gaming Monthly noted the N64 multiplayer mode offered more fun and ran relatively smoothly in high-resolution mode. Edge gave the PlayStation version seven out of ten, calling it \"a competent and interesting game for anyone who enjoys trashing automobiles. But the definitive car combat would probably exploit the sensation of cars driving at speed, while enabling players to indulge in violence.\" Next Generation gave both the Nintendo 64 and PlayStation versions favorable reviews in two separate issues, saying that the latter version was \"more fun than Interstate '76 and currently the best game of its type on PlayStation\" (#45, September 1998); and later saying of the former version, \"If you're craving some driving action with guns for your N64, this is the title to get\" (#53, May 1999). In Japan, where the PlayStation version was ported and published by Syscom on November 12, 1998, Famitsu gave it a score of 28 out of 40.\n\nParagraph 2: A feminist, her novels promoted gender equality and were mostly protagonised by young women yearning for independence. Kate O'Brien's determination to encourage a greater understanding of sexual difference — several of her books include positive gay/lesbian characters —,  make her a pioneer in queer literary representation. O'Brien was herself lesbian, and had a number of relationships with women, including the novelist E.M. Delafield, and the artist Mary O'Neill, who has been described as her 'life partner'. She was very critical of conservatism in Ireland, and the banning of her books highlighted the absurdity of the Irish censorship laws. Following a debate on the banning of The Land of Spices in the Irish senate, and a campaign supported by Seán Ó Faoláin and others, the censorship laws were somewhat reformed in 1946 by creating an Appeals Board. The Land of Spices which had been banned in 1941 was 'unbanned' in 1949, but Mary Lavelle was never officially 'unbanned'. In this way, O'Brien helped bring to an end the cultural restrictions of the 1930s and 40s in the country. She lived much of her life in England and died in Faversham, near Canterbury, in 1974. At the time of her death, she was poor and most of her books were out of print. In the 1980s, her work was recovered by feminist scholars and reprinted by feminist publishers such as Arlen House in Dublin and Virago in London. She is now considered to be a major twentieth century Irish writer.\n\nParagraph 3: Phonological awareness is an auditory skill that is developed through a variety of activities that expose students to the sound structure of the language and teach them to recognize, identify and manipulate it. Listening skills are an important foundation for the development of phonological awareness and they generally develop first. Therefore, the scope and sequence of instruction in early childhood literacy curriculum typically begins with a focus on listening, as teachers instruct children to attend to and distinguish sounds, including environmental sounds and the sounds of speech. Early phonological awareness instruction also involves the use of songs, nursery rhymes and games to help students to become alert to speech sounds and rhythms, rather than meanings, including rhyme, alliteration, onomatopoeia, and prosody. While exposure to different sound patterns in songs and rhymes is a start towards developing phonological awareness, exposure in itself is not enough, because the traditional actions that go along with songs and nursery rhymes typically focus on helping students to understand the meanings of words, not attend to the sounds. Therefore, different strategies must be implemented to aid students in becoming alert to sounds instead. Specific activities that involve students in attending to and demonstrating recognition of the sounds of language include waving hands when rhymes are heard, stomping feet along with alliterations, clapping the syllables in names, and slowly stretching out arms when segmenting words. Phonological awareness is technically only about sounds and students do not need to know the letters of the alphabet to be able to develop phonological awareness.\n\nParagraph 4: Nick Carter first appeared in the story paper New York Weekly (Vol. 41 No. 46, September 18, 1886) in a 13-week serial, \"The Old Detective's Pupil; or, The Mysterious Crime of Madison Square\"; the character was conceived by Ormond G. Smith, the son of one of the founders of Street & Smith, and realized by John R. Coryell.  Coryell retired from writing Nick Carter novels and the series was taken over by Frederick Van Rensselaer Dey, who wrote 1,076 novels and stories from 1890 until his suicide in 1922. The character proved popular enough to headline its own magazine, Nick Carter Weekly.  The serialized stories in Nick Carter Weekly were also reprinted as stand-alone titles under the New Magnet Library imprint. By 1915, Nick Carter Weekly had ceased publication and Street & Smith had replaced it with Detective Story Magazine, which focused on a more varied cast of characters.  There was a brief attempt at reviving Carter in 1924–27 in Detective Story Magazine, but it was not successful.\n\nParagraph 5: were rebellious or autonomous groups of people that were formed in several regions of Japan in the 15th-16th centuries; backed up by the power of the Jōdo Shinshū sect of Buddhism, they opposed the rule of governors or daimyō. Mainly consisting of priests, peasants, merchants and local lords who followed the sect, they sometimes associated with non-followers of the sect. They were at first organized to only a small degree; if any single person could be said to have had any influence over them it was Rennyo, the leader of the Jōdo Shinshū Hongan-ji sect at that time.  Whilst he may have used the religious fervour of the Ikkō-ikki in the defence of his temple settlements, he was also careful to distance himself from the wider social rebellion of the Ikkō movement as a whole, and from offensive violence in particular.\n\nParagraph 6: Nearly every governorate saw its own demonstrations with big ones taking place in several cities all over Egypt, including Mansoura, Damanhour, Mahalla, Suez, Port Said and Minya. In the Nile Delta's Menoufia, hundreds staged anti-Morsi protests in the city of Ashmoun. Some in other parts of the governorate have cut off the Cairo-Alexandria agricultural road while others have closed off seven city council buildings, among them Menouf's, with chains and signs reading \"Closed by order of the people\". Sharqia, where Morsi had lost before to his rival candidate Ahmed Shafik by about 160,000 votes in the 2012 election, had thousands demonstrating across the province with the capital Zagazig hosting several protests concentrated around the governorate building and in Orabi Square. The FJP office was attacked by armed assailants just hours after an Al-Ahram interview with the local party leader Ahmed Shehata when he presented his own version of Sunday's protests claiming that the number of \"real revolutionaries\" protesting peacefully that day would not exceed 20,000 across Egypt. The attack claimed the life of 21-year-old student Hossam Shoqqi, who had previously served tea for the reporters. Zagazig overall had a strong anti-Morsi sentiment already and was prominent with graffiti and posters slamming the Muslim Brotherhood. Gharbia saw tens of thousands of demonstrators in the capital Tanta. Several marches were delayed till afternoon prayers in Mahalla, known for its strong revolutionary spirit. But the city witnessed major protests and the numbers dramatically increased afterwards, with workers forming the majority of the protesters. Textile workers went on strike across the city, have previously warned several times that under Morsi their factories are threatened with closure altogether. The protesters chanted slogans like \"Abdel Nasser said it before, the Muslim Brotherhood are not to be trusted\". Prominent labour activist Kamal el-Fayoumi told Al-Ahram that \"Mahalla contributed heavily to the removal of Mubarak from power, and we will do the same thing with Morsi\". Hundreds participated in demonstrations in Kafr El Zayat against Morsi with anti-Muslim Brotherhood chants such as \"National unity against the Brotherhood\" and \"You who rule in the name of religion, where is justice and where is religion?\" The Dakahlia Governorate city of Mansoura saw hundreds of thousands continuously flocking in the city's main Al-Shaheed Square from several rally points. Chants included \"Go, you're two-faced, you've divided the people in two\" and the protests had notable persons participating such as Mohamed Ghonim, a leading Middle East urologist, in a different mass march in the city. Similarly to the events in Sharqia and Gharbia, the city of Desouk in Kafr el-Sheikh had demonstrators closing the city council building and the governorate complex. The protesters said the buildings would be locked down until the regime was ousted. This kind of action also took place in Beheira. Thousands demonstrated in Damanhour's main square, where some carried police officers on their shoulders chanting against the government, and marches in the city attracted around 30,000 protesters, along with 10,000 in Kafr el-Dawwar and 5,000 in Kom Hamada. The port city of Damietta in the north was estimated to have several thousand demonstrators in the streets, according to a member of the Socialist Popular Alliance, with some in Al-Saa'a Square demanding early presidential elections. Around 250 fishing boats sailed in the Nile heading to the square using megaphones to chant anti-Mori slogans. They have taken over the governorate headquarters and the offices of the local educational authority and also planned to occupy other government buildings to prevent governor Tarek Khedr from entering his office.\n\nParagraph 7: Although the majority of the season eight episodes were executive produced by Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein, former executive producers Al Jean and Mike Reiss had signed a deal with Disney that allowed them to produce four episodes of The Simpsons. The idea for this episode originated several years before its airdate when Jean and Reiss were the regular showrunners. The idea was pitched at a writers' retreat by Jean but nobody had wanted to flesh it out. After being allowed to come back to produce some episodes, Jean and Reiss decided to write this episode. At first, Reiss was against the episode and felt that it was a bad idea. He felt that the plot was slightly ridiculous and that the show should not feature any magic; except for a few moments, he largely kept magic out of the episode. He now considers it one of the best episodes that he co-wrote. At the time, \"Simpsoncalifragilisticexpiala(Annoyed Grunt)cious\" had more music in it than any other episode. While writing, Jean thought that the songs would stretch out and make the episode the proper length but it was considerably shorter than required. Several additional scenes, such as the Itchy & Scratchy segment, were added to pad out the episode. There was originally a sequence where Bart, Lisa and Shary visit Patty and Selma who sing \"We Love to Smoke\", a parody of \"I Love to Laugh\". The song was cut because it wasn't getting any laughs but the full version was included on the album Go Simpsonic with The Simpsons and a brief animated version was included as a deleted scene on the Season 8 DVD. During the end song, Homer can be seen dancing along but not singing; this was because the producers forgot to record Dan Castellaneta. Many of the scenes were animated by Eric Stefani, a former member of No Doubt, who specialized in animation for musical numbers.\n\nParagraph 8: Dingo-samples that have been collected in the 1960s and 1970s indicated that half of the wild dogs of southern Australia were dingo-hybrids; analyses from the early 1980s supported the trend of increasing interbreeding. Based on skull features researchers found out that the proportion of \"pure\" dingoes in the highlands of the Southeast decreased from 49% in the 1960s to 17% in the 1980s. During examinations in the year 1985 in Southeast-Australia only 55% of the 407 studied \"dingoes\" weren't hybrids. 36% of the dogs were dingo-hybrids and the rest wild dogs of other origin. In the middle of the 1980s the proportion of \"pure\" dingoes to dingo-hybrids in Central Australia was estimated (based on skull features) to be 97.5% and 2.4% respectively. In contrast, in Southeast-Australia the estimates were 55.3% and 33.92% respectively. It was reasoned from these findings that mixed populations can be expected in areas where human settlements exist and wild dogs remain, furthermore that hybrids can be expected to be rarer in remote areas. Broken colour-patterns, red with white, black or bluish spots, completely black, brown or bluish, black-and-white and piebald striped patterns were also more prevalent in the second area (34.8%) than in the first (5.7%). In Southeast-Australia there were no differences between areas near farmlands and forest concerning the frequency of the colourations. Many of these colourations also occurred in breeding experiments of reddish dingoes with variously coloured other domestic dogs. All in all about 50% of the populations in Eastern and Southern Australia consisted of hybrids in the 1980s. Depending on the area in Southeast-Australia it was estimated that the proportion of \"pure\" dingoes was at least 22% and at its most 65%. 100 dog skulls from the Queensland Museum were measured and analysed, to determine the frequency of dingoes in the dog-populations of Queensland. The highest frequency of dingoes (95%) was found among skulls from central Queensland and the highest frequency of other domestic dogs and dingo-hybrids (50%) was found in the Southeast of the state. K'gari had only a low frequency of hybrids (17%) that were mostly limited to the southern half of the island. It was estimated back then that the proportion of dingo-hybrids in the continent-wide population was about 78%. At the turn of the millennium only 74% of 180 skulls from seven main areas of Australia could be classified as dingo-skulls during measurements and none of the populations consisted exclusively of dingoes. According to Laurie Corbett some examined wild dog populations in New South Wales consisted entirely of hybrids.\n\nParagraph 9: Moody's political awakenings begin during her teenage years, chronicled in the book's second section, \"High School.\" During her first year in high school, Emmett Till, an innocent 14-year-old black boy visiting Mississippi from Chicago, is tortured and murdered for allegedly whistling in a flirtatious and offensive manner at a white woman. His murder is a defining moment in Moody's life. When Moody asks her mother questions about why the boy was killed and by whom, she is told, \"an Evil Spirit killed him;\" and that \"it would take eight years to learn what that spirit was.\" For the first time, she realizes the extent to which many whites in Mississippi will go to protect their way of life — white supremacy — and the appalling powerlessness of the blacks — what most whites considered savages. When she asks her mother for the meaning of \"NAACP\" (referring to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People), after hearing it from Mrs. Burke, the white woman she works for, her mother tells her never to mention that word in front of any white person, and, if possible, not at all. Shortly thereafter, Moody discovers that there is one adult in her life who could offer her the answers she seeks: Mrs. Rice, her homeroom teacher. Mrs. Rice plays a pivotal role in Moody's maturation. She not only answers Moody's questions about Emmett Till and the NAACP, but she volunteers a great deal more information about the state of race relations in Mississippi. Moody's early curiosity about the NAACP resurfaces later when she attends Tougaloo College. It is during this time, at fifteen years old, that Moody makes the claim that she began to hate white people. She also moves to Baton Rouge that same summer. While in Baton Rouge, Moody learns some tough lessons when she is ripped off by a white family for two weeks' pay, and when she is betrayed by a co-worker, which resulted in her losing her job. Working for Mrs. Burke was something Moody viewed as a challenge; one that she overcame when she quit after Mrs. Burke wrongfully accused her younger brother, Jr. When Moody returned to New Orleans the following summer she worked as a waitress and was able to save money for college. Moody graduated high school in the summer of 1959 and made the decision to return to New Orleans for good.\n\nParagraph 10: The first settlers arrived on the island by the end of the second quarter of the 15th century. The expansion of settlement occurred after initiatives by the island's third donatary captain, Rui Gonçalves da Câmara (son of João Gonçalves Zarco, resulting in northern colonies from peoples from Madeira. Although the early settlement of Ribeira Grande is mired in murkiness owing to the lack of resources, the best sources indicate that settlement began in the late-15th or early-16th centuries. The first settlers to this region are to the northern part of the island by the end of the 15th century. On arriving, these colonists established their settlement along the ravine, which they eventually named after the river course: Ribeira Grande. What is certain is that before 1507, in the urban areas of today's Ribeira Grande, there were already colonists of a \"certain social stature\" living and raising cattle. One of these was Antão Rodrigues da Câmara, the bastard son Rui Gonçalves da Câmara, donatary-captain of São Miguel. His parentage was legitimized on 6 January 1499, and his property (situated in Ribeirinha) was described as an estate, with lands of woodlands, pasture and waters, with houses supported by granaries, haylofts, pastel engine, vineyards and orchards, received as part of his morgadia dated 17 April 1508.\n\nParagraph 11: In 2001, after gaining power, Ashraf Ghani had envisioned the creation of several national development projects which would create public trust in governance. These programs included a National Emergency Employment Program to provide jobs across the country, a National Health and Education Program to get basic health packages to citizens and get children back in school, a National Transportation Program to make Afghanistan a land bridge for South and Central Asia and the Gulf, a National Telecommunications Program to set up a cell phone network across the country and attract private investment and a National Accountability Program to build good financial management (Ghani and Lockart, 2008).  The NSP is inspired by the Kecamatan Development Program, a community-based program started in Indonesia by Scott Guggenheim of the World Bank in the late 1990s.\n\nParagraph 12: The theme of Risalah is emphasized with reference to the accounts of some prophets of Islam such as Nuh (Noah), Hud, Musa (Moses) and Isa (Jesus), noting that all of them delivered the same message of monotheism, but were disbelieved and opposed by the people they preached to, and that all of them were helped and rescued by Allah. A reference is also made to the similar unbelief and opposition of the Meccan leaders to the message delivered to them by Muhammad. The Surah ends with another reference to the inevitability of the Day of Resurrection and pointing out that man will not have a second chance to return to the worldly life and make amends for his lapses and mistakes.\n\nParagraph 13: After being approved for a mortgage, Stella and Karl buy The Rovers from Steve in January 2012, making Stella the new landlady. She supports Leanne when she discovers that Peter has been having an affair with Carla, who Stella previously supported throughout her rape ordeal, and Leanne leaves Weatherfield briefly because she can no longer trust Peter. Stella confronts Peter and Carla in and condemns them for breaking Leanne's heart. Stella is furious when it also emerges that Carla was driving the car instead of Frank when she was knocked down, and threatens Carla to tell the police to get her imprisoned. She eventually agrees, however, that Carla didn't know what she was doing and leaves that bit out of it. She vows that if Leanne doesn't return, then she'll kill Carla. Leanne returns a couple of months later, and begins a custody fight for the full-care of her and Peter's son, Simon. When money goes missing from the till, Stella accuses several people, including Tina McIntyre (Michelle Keegan), Sean Tully (Antony Cotton), Sunita Alahan (Shobna Gulati) and Tommy Duckworth (Chris Fountain). However, Stella is horrified when Karl reveals that he took the money to gamble with it. Stella bans Karl from using the till, or dealing with any money in the premises. Unbeknown to Stella, Karl begins an affair with her friend Sunita, who helps Karl with his gambling addiction - however when Karl wins a large sum of money in the casino, Sunita takes care of it for him. When Sunita's twins Aadi (Zennon Ditchett) and Asha (Tanisha Gorey) discover the money, it sparks Sunita and her husband Dev (Jimmi Harkishin) to separate and Sunita stays with Stella, where Eva becomes suspicious of Karl and Sunita's relationship. Stella later attempts to act impartial when Leanne reunites with ex-husband Nick Tilsley (Ben Price), who had recently ended his relationship with Eva; the argument causes Leanne and step-son Simon (Alex Bain) to move out of the pub. Stella invites Leanne and Eva on a girls night out in order to repair their broken relationship and upon their return they discover Karl and Sunita together. Stella then throws Karl out and reveals that Sunita has been cheating to Dev and Karl has been cheating on her. She also slaps Sunita in the process. She throws Karl out of his home and he sleeps in his taxi after declining a bed offer by both Steve and Michelle Connor (Kym Marsh). Despite numerous beggings from Karl, Stella ends their relationship and it emerges that it is not the first time Karl has slept with another woman.\n\nParagraph 14: The effect is inducted by looking at a test image similar to that below. It contains oppositely-oriented gratings of lines, horizontal and vertical. Next, the subject stares alternately at two induction images similar to the ones directly beneath the top image. One image should show one orientation of grating (here horizontal) with a colored background (red) and the other should show the other orientation of grating (here vertical) with a different, preferably oppositely colored background (green). Each image should be gazed at by the subject for several seconds at a time, and the two images should be gazed at for a total of several minutes for the effect to become visible. The subject should stare approximately at the center of each image, allowing the eyes to move around a little. After several minutes, the subject should look back to the test image; the gratings should appear tinted by the opposite color to that of the induction gratings (i.e., horizontal should appear greenish and vertical pinkish).\n\nParagraph 15: Raja Ravi Varma, a celebrated Indian painter and artist, closely related to the royal family of Travancore (Trivandrum), visited Udaipur at the invitation of Maharana Fateh Singh, from Saturday 6 April 1901 onward to commission his portrait. Varma writes in his autobiography ‘Raja Ravi Varma: Portrait of an Artist’\"We met Fatehlal Mehta, a noble of Mewar state, with whom we had a long correspondence on the subject of their visit, at the Public Gardens. Mr Fatehlal Mehta had returned only the day before from the pilgrimage. He is the son of Rai Pannalal Mehta, CIE and former Dewan of Udaipur….”Raja Ravi Varma liked the charismatic and photogenic face of Pannalal so much, that they requested Fatehlal to ask his father to sit for a photo session. They then completed his portrait at Travancore (Trivandrum). Varma writes in his book (25 June 1901). \"Rai Pannalal Mehta, our friend’s father, sat to us this evening for his portrait which we intend finishing at home, as our departure is approaching. His features are very regular and his complexion is fair. He has a dignified and noble air. He was Dewan of the state for nearly thirty years and had during his administration introduced many reforms of improvement.”Capt Pitney, then a British Resident in India once described Pannalal Mehta as,“I have met royal persons and dignitaries in my life and sometimes been disappointed but one person I shall never forget is Rai Pannalal Mehta, former Pradhan of Mewar. I saw him first when he called on me in plain and spotless white with his uncurled white Rajput beard framing the face like smoothly wrinkled parchment. He moved with such dignity that in slightness of his figure seemed of no account but his gaze defied flattery and deceit. Though he spoke softly, every syllable could be heard in rush, which his calm presence created. I thought of myself that if that was the result of over five hundred years of breeding and generations of Mehtas, there was clearly something to be said for preserving such qualities for the further well-being of this clan”.Rai Pannalal Mehta passed away at Udaipur in December 1919. He was cremated with full state honours at Mahasatiyaji in Oswal nobles’ (Musaddi’s) cremation area. A cenotaph (Chatri) in the memory of Pradhan Rai Pannalal Mehta was constructed by his son Mehta Fatehlal in 1920. At the time of his death he was survived by his son Fatehlal, grandsons Devilal and Udailal, who all distinguished as able high-profile administrators in the state of Mewar. Pannalal’s younger brother Laxmilal predeceased him in 1906 and youngest brother Takhat Singh passed away in 1924. Pannalal was the last Pradhan of Mewar state and also from Bachhawat clan, who held this exalted position in the reign of four successive Maharanas, starting with Swarup Singh, Shambhu Singh, Sajjan Singh and ending with Fateh Singh.\n\nParagraph 16: On 30 May 1990, the new Croatian Parliament held its first session. President Tuđman announced his manifesto for a new Constitution (ratified at the end of the year) and a multitude of political, economic, and social changes, notably to what extent minority rights (mainly for Serbs) would be guaranteed. Local Serb politicians opposed the new constitution. In 1991, Croats represented 78.1% and Serbs 12.2% of the total population of Croatia, but the latter held a disproportionate number of official posts: 17.7% of appointed officials in Croatia, including police, were Serbs. An even greater proportion of those posts had been held by Serbs in Croatia earlier, which created a perception that the Serbs were guardians of the communist regime. This caused discontent among the Croats despite the fact it never actually undermined their own dominance in SR Croatia. After the HDZ came to power, many Serbs employed in the public sector, especially the police, were fired and replaced by Croats. This, combined with Tuđman's remarks, i.e. \"Thank God my wife is not a Jew or a Serb\", were distorted by Milošević's media to spark fear that any form of an independent Croatia would be a new \"Ustashe state\". In one instance, TV Belgrade showed Tuđman shaking hands with German Chancellor Helmut Kohl (who would be the first government leader in the world to recognise independent Croatia and Slovenia) accusing the two of plotting \"a Fourth Reich\". Aside from the firing of many Serbs from public sector positions, another concern among Serbs living in Croatia was the HDZ's public display of the šahovnica (Croatian checkerboard) in the Croatian coat of arms, which was associated with the fascist Ustaše regime. This was a misconception as the checkerboard had a history going back to the fifteenth century and was not identical to the one that was used in the WW2-era Independent State of Croatia. However, Tuđman's xenophobic rhetoric and attitude towards Croatian Serbs as well as his support for former Ustaše leaders did little to ease Serb fears.\n\nParagraph 17: Evidence of prehistoric human activity has been discovered in the hills surrounding the town. Early records show that in Norman times Ramsbottom was part of the Forest of Rossendale. There are a number of Bronze Age burial sites around the town, the most notable of which is Whitelow Cairn, one mile (1.6 km) southeast of the town centre and three miles (4.8 km) north of Bury. The cairn was excavated by Bury Archaeological Group between 1960–62, under the leadership of Norman Tyson. Finds include one main and seven secondary cremations, four in urns, dating to the mid Bronze Age. Artefacts found during the excavation are housed in Bury Museum.\n\nParagraph 18: The pacific viperfish is classified as one of the most ferocious deep seas fish for its size. They are iridescent dark silver-blue color in life with pale fins. They can also be a light black color with blue fins. The coloration of the Pacific viperfish has what is known as ultra-black skin to reduce the reflection of other bioluminescence surrounding them to better camouflage in the deep sea. This ultra black skin reduces the amount of light reflected from the body of the viperfish which scatters the light using the melanosomes in its skin that are optimized for reduced reflectance. Looking at the mouth and curvature of teeth one can easily recognize the pacific viperfish.  The fangs of the pacific viper are abnormally long that its jaw is extended out, so its teeth can fit outside of its mouth.  The fangs rest near the viper’s eyes.  These fangs are the viper’s way of killing fish, the viper will swim at high speeds at its prey and impale them in the process.  The jaw of the Pacific Viperfish is also hinged in order to fit large sized prey for its size. It also has a loosejaw that improves the closing of the jaw by facilitating faster closing to better capture prey that may be harder to catch. Furthermore, its hinged skull allows it to rotate upwards when looking to attack and, ultimately, swallow a large prey. High speed collisions and force in bites have cause the viperfish to adapt to high impact. The vertebrae that is located right behind its head is used a shock absorber, very similar to an air bag. They are excellent maneuvers in areas that receive significantly less sunlight than uppermost regions. This is accredited to a protein in the rods known as rhodopsin, composed of the transmembrane protein opsin, and retinal. The viperfish lacks a swimbladder and has large amounts of acidic glycosaminoglycans in its gelatinous tissue that are hypothesized to be used as a possible buoyancy mechanism.\n\nParagraph 19: A promise is enforceable if it is supported by consideration, that is, where consideration has moved from the promisee. For example, in the case of Tweddle v Atkinson, John Tweddle promised William Guy that he would pay a sum of money to the child of William Guy, and likewise William Guy promised John Tweddle that he would pay a sum of money to the child of John Tweddle, upon the marriage of the two children to each other. However, William Guy failed to pay the son of John Tweddle, who then sued his executors for the amount promised. It was held that the son could not enforce the promise made to his father, as he himself had not actually given consideration for it - it was his father who had done so instead. The son didn't receive any consideration, so he cannot enforce the promise. This particular rule of consideration forms the basis of the doctrine of privity of a contract, that is, only a party to a contract is permitted to sue upon that contract's terms. (Note that the doctrine of privity has been somewhat altered by the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999.) Therefore, consideration from the promisee was indulgent of the claim. Although consideration must move from the promisee, it does not necessarily have to move to the promisor. The promisee may provide consideration to a third party, if this is agreed at the time the parties contracted.\n\nParagraph 20: In mid 1981 Kung Fu and Kato Kung Lee left Empresa Mexicana de Lucha Libre (EMLL) and joined the rival promotion Universal Wrestling Association (UWA). In the UWA Kung Fu and Kato began teaming with Black Man, forming a trio called Los Tres Fantásticos (\"The Fantastic Three\") that would soon become the top tecnico (Face or \"good guy\") trio of the UWA. Los Tres Fantásticos became the first ever UWA World Trios Championship on March 18, 1984 when they defeated Solar, Super Astro and Ultraman in the finals of a tournament to crown the first champions, during a time period where the UWA shows in El Toreo were the biggest drawing shows in Mexico. Kung Fu, Kato and Black Man lost the UWA Trios title at some point in 1984. In 1984/85 EMLL and the UWA ran a series of joint shows, sharing wrestlers between the two promotions, including Los Tres Fantásticos. When the cooperation ended Kung Fu decided to stay with EMLL, Black Man remained with the UWA and Kato Kung Lee began wrestling on the independent circuit, ending Los Tres Fantásticos. Several attempts to recreated the Fantásticos have been made since then, but none had the popularity of success of the original trio. On October 17, 1986 Kung Fu won the NWA World Middleweight Championship from Gran Cochisse, winning one of the top championships in all of Mexico. Kung Fu held the title for approximately 10 months before losing the title to El Dandy on July 17, 1987. Kung Fu regained the title on October 6, 1987 and held it until July 10, 1988 where he lost it to Atlantis. By the time Kung Fu lost the NWA title Kato Kung Lee had returned to EMLL, he had also turned rudo (Heel or \"Bad guy\") and lost his mask in a match against El Hijo del Santo. Kung Fu and Kato Kung Lee started a storyline feud, old partners who are now enemies. The feud between the two saw Kung Fu win two Luchas de Apuestas in 1988, both times causing Kato Kung Lee to be shaved bald after the match. In 1990 Kung Fu worked a feud with Atlantis, a feud that let to Kung Fu being unmasked on October 26, 1990 as he lost a Luchas de Apuestas match. After losing his mask Kung Fu seemed to have lost a step or two in the ring, losing part of appeal when he lost the mask, something which is not uncommon in Lucha libre. After his mask loss Kung Fu turned rudo, using his nunchuks to attack other wrestlers. After an initial push as a rudo Kung Fu started to sink in the ranks, being used more and more to help young wrestlers gain experience and make them look good. Kung Fu remained with EMLL (by then renamed Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL)) until 1994, where he began working on the independent circuit. Around the same time Cuesta introduced \"Kung Fu, Jr.\" to the wrestling world, unlike some family relationships in Lucha libre that are fictional Kung Fu, Jr. is actually the son of Raymundo Cuesta. After touring with Kung Fu, Jr. for a while Cuesta went into semi-retirement and began working for the Mexican Government instead. He made occasional appearances for years, never fully retiring from wrestling.\n\nParagraph 21: ATR is a serine/threonine-specific protein kinase that is involved in sensing DNA damage and activating the DNA damage checkpoint, leading to cell cycle arrest in eukaryotes. ATR is activated in response to persistent single-stranded DNA, which is a common intermediate formed during DNA damage detection and repair.  Single-stranded DNA occurs at stalled replication forks and as an intermediate in DNA repair pathways such as nucleotide excision repair and homologous recombination repair.  ATR is activated during more persistent issues with DNA damage; within cells, most DNA damage is repaired quickly and faithfully through other mechanisms. ATR works with a partner protein called ATRIP to recognize single-stranded DNA coated with RPA. RPA binds specifically to ATRIP, which then recruits ATR through an ATR activating domain (AAD) on its surface. This association of ATR with RPA is how ATR specifically binds to and works on single-stranded DNA—this was proven through experiments with cells that had mutated nucleotide excision pathways. In these cells, ATR was unable to activate after UV damage, showing the need for single stranded DNA for ATR activity. The acidic alpha-helix of ATRIP binds to a basic cleft in the large RPA subunit to create a site for effective ATR binding. Many other proteins exist that are recruited to the cite of ssDNA that are needed for ATR activation. While RPA recruits ATRIP, the RAD9-RAD1-HUS1 (9-1-1) complex is loaded onto the DNA adjacent to the ssDNA; though ATRIP and the 9-1-1 complex are recruited independently to the site of DNA damage, they interact extensively through massive phosphorylation once colocalized. The 9-1-1 complex, a ring-shaped molecule related to PCNA, allows the accumulation of ATR in a damage specific way. For effective association of the 9-1-1 complex with DNA, RAD17-RFC is also needed.   This complex also brings in topoisomerase binding protein 1 (TOPBP1) which binds ATR through a highly conserved AAD. TOPBP1 binding is dependent on the phosphorylation of the Ser387 residue of the RAD9 subunit of the 9-1-1 complex. This is likely one of the main functions of the 9-1-1 complex within this DNA damage response. Another important protein that binds TR was identified by Haahr et al. in 2016: Ewings tumor-associated antigen 1 (ETAA1). This protein works in parallel with TOPBP1 to activate ATR through a conserved AAD. It is hypothesized that this pathway, which works independently of TOPBP1 pathway, is used to divide labor and possibly respond to differential needs within the cell. It is hypothesized that one pathway may be most active when ATR is carrying out normal support for replicating cells, and the other may be active when the cell is under more extreme replicative stress.\n\nParagraph 22: Natural light also played a major part in the design. In the drafting room, Wright used translucent canvas to act as a roof (later replaced by plastic because of the intense wear from the Arizona sun). In the south-facing dining room, Wright did not take the masonry walls from floor to ceiling, and designed the roof to hang past the walls preventing unwanted sun rays from penetrating but allowing for horizontal light to pass through the room. Wright believed natural light aided the work environment he had his apprentices in, keeping the inside of his building in touch with the natural surroundings.\n\nParagraph 23: The Ur-Quan are a fictional race of predatory alien caterpillars in the Star Control series of video games, created by Paul Reiche III and Fred Ford. Introduced in 1990, the Ur-Quan are the primary antagonist of the first game, leading a galactic empire that seeks to enslave Earth. They reprise their role in Star Control II, which expands on their history as former slaves who since vowed to fiercely defend themselves. During the game, the Ur-Quan enter into a civil war over their ideology, giving Earth an opportunity to defeat them. In Star Control 3, which was developed by a different team, the Ur-Quan ally with Earth against a different antagonist and their role is scaled back. They appear once again in The Ur-Quan Masters, the 2002 open source remake of Star Control II.Reiche and Ford developed the Ur-Quan based on the concepts for unique spaceships in Star Control; their insectoid appearance was inspired by a National Geographic photo of a caterpillar. Their role in Star Control II has earned acclaim among the best game villains in history, praised for their menacing persona, as well as their surprising depth and humanity. The Ur-Quan have also influenced other game studios, inspiring concepts in games such as Mass Effect and Stellaris.\n\nParagraph 24: Operations against New Madrid, Mo., and Island No. 10, Mississippi River, March 4 - April 8, 1862.

{"input": "The Rokenbok vehicles, crane, and elevator were controlled using controllers similar in design to those of the Xbox or PlayStation. The first generation controller was wired and required users to press a button to cycle through the vehicles they wanted to control. The successor to this was the \"Rok-Star\" controller, a wireless controller that allowed players to select a vehicle by pointing a red light at the vehicle's receiver. This eliminated the limitation on the number of vehicles that could be controlled by a player and the number of players who could play at once. The control pads had three sections. The left section had a four-way directional pad for controlling the movement of the vehicles. The center of each pad had a button to cycle through available units and vehicles that could be controlled. The right section had four function buttons: A, B, X, and Y, with different functions for each vehicle. The Rok-Star controller also had buttons for sounding a siren and backup alarms. Above each handle, at the top of the control pad, were two shoulder buttons, one to switch to the last vehicle used and the other to slow down the vehicle. The directional pad and shoulder buttons had the same function for each vehicle.", "context": "Paragraph 1: In December 1849, the Church of England obtained a block of land facing Melbourne Street and extending to Grey Street and Stanley Street (approx , now the site of the Queensland Museum), a total of 1 acre, 3 roods, 8 perches of land, on which to erect a church, a school and a parsonage. However it is not until August 1858 that the school house was constructed on the site with the expectation that it would also be used for \"occasional\" public worship. The building was  of hammer-dressed stone. On 6 September 1858 Miss Clothier opens a school there. In 1859 it is described as an \"English Church\" at \"South Brisbane\".  By May 1862 the church has a resident minister enabling regular services. The church was adversely impacted by the construction of the 1874 Victoria Bridge as the bridge was higher and the approach roads had to be built up accordingly, resulting in the church being below the new road level, forcing the parishioners to approach the church from the rear. It is unclear when the church was named for St Thomas but that name is in use by October 1877.\n\nParagraph 2: The main engineering works performed in 1988 and 1989 featured studies, design, and tests on water wave generation and propagation. As the Typhoon Lagoon was one of the first wave-makers applied to a theme park, one of its prime objectives was to produce surfable waves. Waves are generated by a 12-cell prestressed concrete tank in the background of the lagoon covered with the shipwreck scene. Computer modeling techniques were used at the time to study fluid-structure interaction, stress concentrations, and fatigue to ensure integrity and safety. Prior to its opening, the Typhoon Lagoon was tested to determine wave shape, surf-board ride duration, and the extent to which the waves give a natural feeling as they propagate and break on the artificial beach downstream.\n\nParagraph 3: Meanwhile, Becca is outraged when her religious parents (who do not know about her sexual history) decide to send her to boarding school, and Hannah is alienated at school because of her mother. She leaves her house one night and goes to her friend Tommy's house. They both realize they like each other and make out. Hannah wants to have sex, but Tommy refuses, explaining that he likes her but wishes to wait, as they are too young. Hannah becomes even more emotionally distraught, thinking he is not interested because she has been called a 'slut' and runs off. When Hannah's parents return home and see that she is gone, her mother goes off to find her. Walking around by herself in the street, Hannah calls Dawn and Becca. Dawn is grounded and is not allowed to speak with Hannah, and Becca is making out in a car with two boys and does not hear her phone. Hannah goes to a party, where many of the kids from her school are present, looking for Becca. Brad, the party's host, directs Hannah to the basement, and when she realizes that Becca is not there, he attempts to have sex with her. She refuses, but he tries to force her into it. Tommy barges into the room, takes a picture of Brad and threatens to send it to 9-1-1. Brad leaves Hannah and ends the party. Tommy takes Hannah back to his house and calls her parents. They come to fetch her, relieved to see she is alright. Hannah apologizes to them and her mother promises that things will be better from now on. The end of the film shows Becca has snuck back into her room and begins to cry. Dawn is playing Scrabble with her mother as her sister, Tess, who is not playing, sneaks off to Dawn's room. In there, she picks up one of Dawn's \"sexy\" shirts, takes off her glasses and models in front of the mirror, implying she may try to be 'like Dawn'. At the end of the film, Alexis Dziena appears to give a public service announcement urging teens to wait to have sex because of both physical and emotional consequences.\n\nParagraph 4: On the first working day following the incident, uproarious scenes were seen in the national parliament. Numerous members of Parliament condemned the attacks. They also indirectly criticised railway minister Lalu Prasad Yadav while noting that even in their regions, the maximum recruitments being made were those of people from Bihar and not from the state where the recruitment drives were held, adding some credence to the MNS' drive. Speaking first on the issue, RJD leader Devendra Prasad Yadav demanded that the Centre take action in the state under Article 355. He noted that despite the attacks, the Maharashtra chief minister has maintained a silence on the issue, adding that such actions threaten the unity and integrity of the country. Other MP's also demanded the invocation of Article 355 in the light of the attacks. Shahnawaz Hussain of the BJP made such demands in asking if people from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh needed a permit to travel to other parts of the country. The CPI M's Mohammed Salim said that such incidents threaten the country's integrity and send a wrong signal to the rest of the country. Anant Geete of the Shiv Sena, however, tried to give the other side of the story by noting the 4.2 million educated and unemployed youth in Maharashtra. The CPI (M) strongly condemned the attack, terming them a \"blatant\" assault on the Constitution and demanded the immediate arrest of party chief Raj Thackeray, adding that any leniency shown to \"divisive forces\" will have far-reaching consequences. The CPI(M) Politburo said the attack on the Constitution was a poor showing on the Maharashtra government which is duty bound to protect and take stringent action against the perpetrators of such crimes. \"That it has failed to do so and in fact showing leniency to the leader of the outfit shows the utter bankruptcy of the politics of Congress and its coalition partner.\" The CPI also said such attacks should not be tolerated and Thackeray and his supporters must be \"immediately arrested and prosecuted\". Maharashtra Chief Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh said his government is responsible for failure in preventing attacks and ordered a probe into the incident, which will also inquire into why the job advertisements where not given in Marathi newspapers. He said: \"What has happened is not good. Such incidents take place because of loopholes in the law. One can't hold only the Home Ministry responsible for it, it is (entire) Government's responsibility. Such incidents are affecting the image of the state and I have instructed the DGP to take stern action.\" On Raj Thackeray's accusation that job advertisements were not published in local newspapers to keep out Maharashtrian candidates, he said, \"An inquiry would also be conducted about why advertisements about the examination were not given in Marathi newspapers and the number of Marathi candidates invited for the exam.\" He also assured that such incidents of vandalism would not take place in future.\n\nParagraph 5: The Rokenbok vehicles, crane, and elevator were controlled with controllers, not unlike the Xbox's or PlayStation's in design. The first generation controller was wired and required that the user pressed a button to cycle to the vehicle number they wished to control. The successor to this was the \"Rok-Star\" controller, a wireless controller that allows players to select a vehicle by pointing a red light onto the vehicle's receiver. This removed the limit on how many vehicles could be controlled by a player, and how many players could play at once. The control pads, consist of three sections, the left contains the four-way directional pad, or D-pad, that controls the movement of the vehicles. On the center of each control pad is a button which the player presses to cycle through available units and vehicles that can be controlled (up to eight on the older RC controllers, chosen by setting a LED light on a number 1-8, presented in a circular fashion, each corresponding to the numbered radio keys in each vehicle on the Classic RC base, or on the ROK star controller, there is a large \"R\" button the player presses and holds and then points at a ROK star vehicle to select it). On the right section, there are four function buttons: A, B, X, and Y.  They have different functions for each vehicle. The ROK star controller also has buttons to sound a siren (and change its pitch) and sound back-up alarms. Above each handle, at the top of the control pad, are two shoulder buttons. The left-hand shoulder button will switch to the last vehicle the player used; the right-hand shoulder button will slow the vehicle down. The D-pad and shoulder buttons provide the same function for each vehicle.\n\nParagraph 6: In 2009, FC Volendam suffered its latest relegation from the Eredivisie. In the 2007–08 season, Volendam had won the Eerste Divisie championship under the leadership of former professional footballer Stanley Menzo, who had secured the club's participation in the highest division in the following season. Menzo, however, did not extend his contract, which meant that Frans Adelaar took over as new head coach for the 2008–09 season. On 10 May 2009, the last matchday of the season, Volendam suffered relegated to the Eerste Divisie once again, after De Graafschap drew (2–2) and Roda JC's beat Feyenoord (2–3). The following season was dramatic for Volendam: they finished in 16th place in the second tier. In the 2010–11 season, Volendam was led by head coach Gert Kruys, who had come over from FC Dordrecht. Volendam finished in 6th place in his first season. In the following season, Volendam did not win a period title for the first time in a long time, which cost Kruys his job at the club. Between 2012 and 2015 and again between 2018 and 2019, the club was led by Hans de Koning, who had come over from Helmond Sport the first time. In the 2012–13 season, Volendam finished in 2nd place after losing its last game to Go Ahead Eagles. They were then defeated again by Go Ahead Eagles in the final of the playoffs for promotion. In that season, Volendam also managed to win a period title. Due to missing out on promotion, Volendam, for the first time since the start of the Eerste Divisie (1956), competed for more than five seasons in a row at the second level. In the 2014–15 season, Volendam again lost in the final of the promotion play-offs by losing 0–1 to De Graafschap at home, after the first leg had finished 0–0 in Doetinchem.\n\nParagraph 7: Arsenal began their 2022–23 campaign with a 2–0 win away to Crystal Palace on 5 August 2022. The victory was Arteta's 50th league win as Gunners boss, making him the second-quickest manager to reach 50 top-flight wins for the Arsenal after Arsène Wenger. On 20 August, the Gunners beat Bournemouth 3–0 in matchweek 3. The win vaulted them to the top of the Premier League for the first time since 2016, and ensured it was the first time Arsenal had won their opening three fixtures since the 2004–05 season. On 27 August, Arsenal beat Fulham 2–1 at Emirates Stadium, marking Arteta's 100th Premier League game in charge. The Gunners finished the month with a 2–1 win at home over Aston Villa on 31 August. It was the fourth time Arsenal had started a top-flight season with a run of five wins, after 1930–31, 1947–48 and 2004–05. Mikel Arteta became the 11th manager to have won the first five games of a Premier League season, after Kevin Keegan, Carlo Ancelotti, Alex Ferguson, Arsène Wenger, Alan Curbishley, José Mourinho, Manuel Pellegrini, Pep Guardiola, Maurizio Sarri, and Jürgen Klopp. After leading the Gunners to wins in all five of their Premier League matches of August, Mikel Arteta was named Premier League Manager of the Month, winning the award for the third time following his previous successes in September 2021 and March 2022.\n\nParagraph 8: The surah begins with various explanations and decrees on or relating to corrupt sexual acts, family law, and specifications on the giving of testimony. Foremost amongst these rulings is God's punishment for adultery. This section ends with the pronouncement that good men and women should be paired together, as should corrupt men and corrupt women. This discussion turns into reflections on privacy and modesty, namely of hosts and women. Contained herein are several regulations and explanations of modesty, most directly lines traditionally used to argue for the wearing of hijab. After these prohibitions are cast for women, the text turns towards men, asking them not to oppress slavegirls into prostitution, and to marry those women who need husbands, despite their poverty.\n\nParagraph 9: Scribner's Magazine was the second periodical publication of the  Scribner's  firm, after Scribner's Monthly was published from 1870 to 1881. Scribner's Monthly was later moved to another publisher, and renamed The Century Illustrated Monthly Magazine. Charles Scribner announced to a New York Times reporter that they would make a new monthly publication \"as soon as the necessary arrangements could be perfected\". It was also announced that the editor would be Edward Burlingame, the son of Anson Burlingame, who was already connected to the publishing house as literary adviser. Charles Scribner also noted that the magazine would not be a revival of the formerly published Scribner's Monthly. Charles Scribner's Sons spent over $500,000 in launching Scribner's Magazine   to compete with the already successful pictorials, The Atlantic Monthly and Harper's Magazine. Burlingame hired the best artists in his country for the magazine; Howard Pyle, Howard Chandler Christy, Charles Marion Russell, Walter Everett, Maxfield Parrish and Frederic Remington. Before the first issue was released, Charles Scribner's Sons had their first annual \"Scribner's Magazine\" dinner at their main offices. Scribner's Magazine was launched in January 1887, the first issue of which was to be published from January to June of that year. The magazine was printed and bound by Trow's Printing and Bookbinding Company. Scribner's Magazine was also the first magazine to introduce color illustrations later on. The first issue opens with the literary article \"The Downfall to the Empire\". by E.B. Washburne, the former minister to France. An early morning fire in 1908 at the Charles Scribner's Sons offices heavily burned the third and fourth floors, where the  magazine was produced. In May 1914, the magazine's editor, Edward L. Burlingame, retired and Robert Bridges took over as editor. (Bridges was a lifelong close friend of President Woodrow Wilson ever since the two had met as students at Princeton University.)  During the First World War, the magazine employed authors, Richard Harding Davis, Edith Wharton and John Galsworthy, to write about the major conflict. During the time of 1917, when the United States joined the war, the magazine had four to six articles on the subject. On the date of November 19, 1922, the first editor of the magazine, Edward L. Burlingame, died. In January 1928 the magazine had a change in format, with the first of the newly formatted issue having a cover design by Rockwell Kent.\n\nParagraph 10: Immediately after the Parliament elected in 1818 had assembled in 1819, a petition was presented to the House of Commons, complaining in the usual terms, that gross bribery and corruption had been practised in the return of the two Members for the Borough of Grampound, in Cornwall. In the course of the Session the matter was minutely investigated and the alleged guilt incontrovertibly proved. The course of procedure in such cases was to pass an act disfranchising the place convicted, and transferring the right so abused and forfeited, to some other body of Electors. It devolved upon Lord John Russell, who had conducted the proceedings in the House of Commons ... to originate a Bill for the above purpose. On the meeting of the New Parliament, April 28th, Lord J. Russell gave notice that he should bring in his proposed bill for disfranchising Grampound and transferring the privilege to Leeds. The Bill was ... framed to extend the right of voting to all Householders rated at or over £5 per annum, which it was estimated would constitute a body of, at least 8,000 Electors for the Borough. When the ... measure came under discussion ... Mr Beaumont ... suggested that the County of York should be divided into two Counties, one consisting of the West Riding and the other of the North and East Ridings combined; and, that instead of giving two representatives to Leeds, they should be granted to either of these divisions - Mr Wynn ... objected ... but was the first to recommend that the two new Members be transferred to the County of York, in addition to the two it already returned. ... The Legislature ... assembled in January 1821 ... Mr Beaumont renewed his objection ... upon which a division took place. The numbers were, for the amendment 66, against it 126, leaving a majority of 60 in favour of the measure peoposed by Lord John Russell. The Bill, as introduced this session, so far deviated from that of the previous year as to confer the Elective franchise upon the Mayor and Corporation of Leeds, and all Householders within the Borough, assessed at not less than Ten Pounds instead of Five Pounds per annum to the poor and parish rates. This provision, it was found on examination, would still have thrown the right of returning members, chiefly into the hands of the inferior classes, and necessarily have fostered those impure and unprincipled practices, notoriously prevalent in places similarly privileged. Mr J.A.S. Wortley to remedy this defect, moved ... that the qualification should be limited to Householders rated at not less than Twenty Pounds per annum ... in its amended form the Bill passed the House of Commons. \n\nParagraph 11: Pálinka is a traditional fruit spirit (or fruit brandy) with origins in Carpathian Mountains, more exactly  known under several names, and invented in the Middle Ages. Protected as a geographical indication of the European Union, only fruit spirits mashed, distilled, matured and bottled in Hungary and similar apricot spirits from four provinces of Austria can be called \"pálinka\", while \"Tótpálinka\" refers to wheat-derived beverages. Törkölypálinka, a different product in the legal sense, is a similarly protected pomace spirit that is commonly included with pálinka. While pálinka may be made of any locally grown fruit, the most common ones are plums, apricots, apples, pears, and cherries.\n\nParagraph 12: In 1933, Phelan succeeded Farley, who resigned from the board to become United States Postmaster General, as chairman of the New York State Athletic Commission. In 1934, Phelan reversed the decision of the Tony Canzoneri–Cleto Locatelli bout after he discovered the ring announcer had misread one of the judge's ballots. In 1935, Phelan and fellow commissioner Bill Brown ordered a reversal of the decision in the Vince Dundee–Eddie Risko fight. The fight was originally declared a victory for Sisko, with Judge Sidney Scharlin and referee Jed Gahan voting in favor of Sisko and the other judge, Jack Britton, voting in favor of Dundee. Phelan, who was sitting at ringside, immediately performed an inspection of the ballots and found that Britton gave seven to Dundee and three to Risko and Scharlin scored five rounds for Dundee with four to Risko. Phelan, Brown, and Scharlin conferred and the decision was reversed in favor of Dundee. In 1936, Phelan and Brown voted to cancel a bout between Hank Bath and Red Burman after they received a telegram from the secretary of the California State Athletic Commission reporting that two of Bath's fights in that state were \"questionable\". That same year, Phelan was able to convince Mike Jacobs to hold the Joe Louis vs. Max Schmeling fight in New York City. In 1937 the commission fined Joe Gould and James J. Braddock $1,000 for canceling Braddock's scheduled fight with Max Schmeling. In February 1938, the commission suspended the licenses of manager Joe Jacobs and boxer Tony Galento for Galento's failure to fight Harry Thomas. Galento's license was restored within a few months, however the commission refused to license Jacobs for the Louis-Schmeling rematch later that year. At the 1938 convention of the International Boxing Federation, Phelan was instrumental in defeating a proposal that would require all championships to have the approval of a special committee on which Americans would have minority representation. In 1939 he and Brown sued boxing promoter James J. Johnston for libel over Johnston's allegations that the two commissioners had a financial interest in the Twentieth Century Sporting Club. The suit ended when Johnston made a statement denying that he had used the word \"financial\" and added that he never meant to accuse Phelan and Brown of \"malfeasance or misfeasance of any kind\". Following Joe Louis's knockout victory over Billy Conn, Phelan undertook a search for the judge's ballots, which had gone missing after the fight. On June 20, 1941, Phelan announced that he had founded the ballots and that they showed the Conn had been ahead on points prior to being knocked out. Due to a shortage of boxers during World War II, Phelan recommended lowering the minimum age for boxers to 16.\n\nParagraph 13: In 2020, CCP general secretary Xi Jinping and the rest of the CCP began propagating the idea of \"winning a battle against America\" in containing the coronavirus pandemic. The numbers are notably misrepresented by Chinese authorities, but the CCP has continued to take to the media, pointing out \"the failures of America\", even though the numbers are manipulated. The now former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo accused the CCP of spreading disinformation on 17 March. Chinese officials in Japan have referred to the disease as the \"Japanese coronavirus\", even though there is no such evidence it originated there. The CCP has also used transmitting \"positive energy\" to promote itself. After Mike Pompeo's accusation that the virus originated in a lab in Wuhan, which Anthony Fauci denied on 5 May, Chinese officials launched a smear campaign on the same day against him with multiple propaganda outlets calling him a liar. During the George Floyd protests, the CCP criticized the US for failing to address racial equality. On 30 May 2020, Morgan Ortagus urged on Twitter for \"freedom loving people\" to hold the CCP to impose plans on Hong Kong for national security legislation. Her counterpart, Hua Chunying, responded back with \"I can't breathe\", obviously a reference to Floyd's last words. Some people responded with \"I can't tweet\" and some have accused the government of using the same police brutality tactics that killed Floyd, with Chinese censors simply deleting the complaints.   Recently, in Wuhan, where the outbreak first emerged, television shows and documentaries portrayed the response positively, as a heroic success taken care of by \"warriors in white coats\". Alexander Kekulé's theory of coronavirus-disease 2019 coming from Italy instead of Wuhan which was taken out of context has sparked Chinese propaganda newspapers following the narrative, with even one headline saying, \"China is Innocent!\" Kekulé himself says it is pure propaganda. State-owned outlets such as Xinhua and the People's Daily have blamed elderly deaths in Norway and Germany on COVID-19 vaccines, even though there is no scientific evidence, and have accused English media of downplaying it.\n\nParagraph 14: At a March 10, 1933, press dinner, Wynn reviewed his plans: \"My idea is to give the listener more radio and less advertising ballyhoo. There is one thing that attracts the average listener to his receiver. He wants entertainment. The spot on the dial where he finds the most entertainment is the spot where the dial will stand. So I want Amalgamated to give the listener a maximum of the best entertainment possible with the least possible advertising talk.\" It was planned to greatly limit commercial messages, in order to \"limit the ballyhoo to thirty words—a curtain announcement at the beginning and the end\". (The restriction of advertising messages to short announcements at the start and close of each program had been the original network radio policy, until NBC and CBS abandoned it as the 1930s progressed.) Moreover, \"in the broadcasting station the plan for the whole day's schedule should be in the hands of the program manager. No prerogatives should be surrendered there to commercial interests.\" Wynn stressed the need for high quality programming, so that: \"The listener will know that by tuning in one of our programs at any time from 8 a. m. until 1 a. m. he will be able to hear a fine program.\" He also hoped that, with the country mired in the depths of the Great Depression, his network would provide an additional source of employment for the numerous unemployed actors and other entertainers.\n\nParagraph 15: Several television programs originating in the Twin Cities have been aired nationally on terrestrial and cable TV networks.  KTCA created the science program Newton's Apple and distributes a children's program today. A few unusual comedic shows also originated in the area. In the 1980s, KTMA (now WUCW) created a number of low-budget shows, including the cult classic Mystery Science Theater 3000 (which later aired on The Comedy Channel/Comedy Central from 1989 to 1996 and the Sci-Fi Channel from 1997 to 2004). The short-lived Let's Bowl (which aired on Comedy Central) started on KARE, and the PBS series Mental Engineering originated on the St. Paul public-access television network.\n\nParagraph 16: Girard's main contribution to philosophy, and in turn to other disciplines, was in the psychology of desire. Girard claimed that human desire functions imitatively, or mimetically, rather than arising as the spontaneous byproduct of human individuality, as much of theoretical psychology had assumed. Girard found that human development proceeds triangularly from a model of desire who indicates some object of desire as desirable by desiring it themselves. We copy this desire for the object of the model and appropriate it as our own, most often without recognizing that the source of this desire comes from another apart from ourselves completing the triangle of mimetic desire. This process of appropriation of desire includes (but is not limited to) identity formation, the transmission of knowledge and social norms, and material aspirations which all have their origin in copying the desires of others who we take, consciously or unconsciously, as models for desire.\n\nParagraph 17: On the 18th the regiment received orders to march for the front. General Whittaker was at the head of the column. The command had marched five miles in the direction of Ringgold, when it came suddenly upon the rebel pickets, who fired upon the General and staff, but with no result, except to hasten forward our skirmishers. A detail was at once sent forward and skirmished with the enemy till dark. The Eighty-Fourth was formed in line of battle on the left of the Ringgold road, near a small stream called Pea Vine, or Little Chickamauga. The rebel batteries threw several shells over and around them, but did no damage, the command being protected by a slight elevation in front. After dark the regiment moved one hundred yards in advance, where the men lay down in line of battle, on their arms, for the night. Next morning they fell back to McAfee church, distant one mile, where the men prepared breakfast. Two companies were thrown forward as skirmishers, and were soon reinforced by a third; all under command of Major Neff. Three scouts being called for to act as videttes, E. D. Baugh, C. N. Taylor and John Wall, of Company E, tendered their service, and started for the front. They had hardly disappeared from view when the sharp crack of the rebel rifles was heard, answered at once by the fire of the scouts. Our skirmishers at once advanced, became sharply engaged with those of the enemy, and drove them back upon his main line. The reserve of the regiment then moved to the support of the skirmishers. The Eighty-Fourth was formed on the right of the Ringgold road behind a fence. A brisk fight ensued, lasting an hour and a half, the regiment losing twenty-two killed, wounded and missing. No support arriving, the command was forced back. They had been fighting a brigade of the rebel General Longstreet's command. In fact, owing to the heavy woods and thick underbrush obstructing the vision, and the enemy's familiarity with the country, the regiment was nearly surrounded before they were aware of their situation. The Fortieth Ohio and the One Hundred and Fifteenth Illinois, however, covered their flanks and rear, and saved them from being captured. They bivouacked that night near the McAfee church. The weather was extremely cold, a heavy frost covering the surface of the earth. Many of the men were compelled to build fires to keep from freezing, having no blankets. Drawing rations, and eating supper, the men lay down, little dreaming of the dreadful shock of arms on the battle-field of Chickamauga, which followed on the morrow.\n\nParagraph 18: Kamloops Lake in British Columbia, Canada is situated on the Thompson River just west of Kamloops. The lake is 1.6 km wide, 29 km long, and up to 152 m deep. In prehistoric time, the lake was much longer, perhaps 20x,  with adjacent silt cliffs defining ancient lake bottoms 100 meters higher than present water levels.   At the outlet near Savona, a large tumbled rock, gravel moraine indicates the toe of a glacier once melted away here.  The community of Savona is located at the west end of the lake, near the Thompson River outlet. The city of Kamloops is located a few miles east of the head of the lake, at the confluence of the North and South Thompson Rivers.  The name, Kamloops, derives from a local Indigenous word, Tk’emlúps, meaning a meeting of waters. \n\nParagraph 19: The so-called Roman-Hungarian legend of Korwin starts in the 16th century under the influence of Renaissance humanism culture and vivacious contacts between Polish nobility and Hungarian Royal Court. In that kingdom, the Wallachian-Hungarian family of Korvin had flourish in 1400, and a baroque legend argues them descending from one of the Roman gens Valerii. At one time there was in Rome a distinguished tribune named Marcus Valerius Corvus, a Roman general who got the agnomen Corvinus in the following manner: In 349BC, the Roman Army moved against the Barbarians, and before the battle began, a warrior of great size and strength came forward and challenged anyone in the Roman cavalry to single combat, whereupon Valerius stepped forward. Just as he was about to engage the barbarian, a raven flew from a trunk, perched upon Valerius's helmet, and began to attack his foe’s eyes with its beak so fiercely that the warrior was blind. With this, the Roman beat him easily, and from that time, Valerius was called Corvinus (from Corvus, \"raven\"). His descendant, Marcus Valerius Messalla Corvinus (64BC – 8AD) was chosen to the Roman consulate with Caesar Augustus and the Baroque authors understand he became a big landowner in the Dacian-Panonnian frontiers. If however any of his supposed Hungarians descendants, and a Polish branch of this family carried on the name, nobody really knows… \n\nParagraph 20: The concept of rationality in economics is essentially no different than the manner with which philosophers view practical rationality as it applies to other disciplines in which there exist models of sound judgment, inferencing, and decision-making. Rationality is thus understood as the process through which reasonable conclusions are reached on the basis of thoughtful consideration of demonstrable proof so that the optimal result may be achieved. The fundamental cost-benefit analysis is a typical manifestation of the rationalization process in that the calculated advantages or rewards received will demonstrably outweigh the incurred sacrifice required to obtain those gains. Where the term becomes complicated is the point at which rationality is presumed to label a decision as being successful or unsuccessful, when the reality is that rational decision-making refers to the actual process of making a choice and not the choice itself. When individuals decide what is the best course of action, they do so according to what they perceive is most beneficial and/or fulfilling to them, based on whatever data they have available for consideration. So long as the outcome is consistent with the reasons for electing to behave in that way, the decision is a rational one. The comic book collector who pays thousands of dollars for a collectible issue that completes a long-incomplete series in lieu of buying groceries for the family may not be making a wise choice or even a prudent decision. If this behavior is consistent with the collector's past choices and has been a stated long-term goal, however, then such behavior is nevertheless rational. Rationality is applicable to why a choice was made and what motivated that decision rather than being applied as an evaluative assessment of the choice itself.\n\nParagraph 21: (), also called  () or  () in China, are referred as  knots, Chinese frog closures and decorative toggles in English language, is a type of ornamental braiding closure made out of cord, consisting of a button (oftentimes a Chinese button knot for a traditional oriental style) and a loop; it is used to fasten garments without creating an overlap. Its purpose is to act as a fastener as well as providing a decorative closure for the garment. It is especially used on the cheongsam, where the  represents the cultural essence of the dress. This form of decorative fastener originated from China and was later introduced to other countries outside of China where they are now called frog closures, frogs, and frogging in English-speaking countries. It was first adopted in the military uniform of Western countries, where they gained popularity, before eventually making its way into civilian clothes of both genders, such as overcoats, spencers, and pelisses. Frog fasteners are usual to garments of Asian design, such as a shirt or coat with a mandarin collar, which features frog fasteners at the shoulder and down the front of the garment. In the design of a garment, frogging is the use of braided, frog fasteners is a detail of the overall design of the garment.", "answers": ["Paragraph 5"], "length": 5911, "dataset": "passage_retrieval_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "e826584988dcbc94b9a767cac28746e64b655255dadf9634"}
{"input": "Billy Halleck, a wealthy lawyer who is overweight and arrogant, accidentally kills an elderly Romani woman while his wife is distracting him. He uses his connections in the legal system to avoid punishment. However, the woman's father places a curse on Billy, causing him to rapidly lose weight. Desperate for answers, Billy consults doctors, but they are unable to determine the cause. The judge and the policeman involved in his case also suffer strange afflictions and commit suicide. Billy hires private detectives and teams up with a former client connected to organized crime to track down the Romani people and plead for the curse to be lifted. After a violent confrontation, the Romani leader agrees to stop the weight loss temporarily by adding Billy's blood to a strawberry pie. However, the weight loss will resume unless Billy passes the curse to someone else. In a twist, Billy discovers that his wife and daughter have already eaten from the pie. Realizing they are doomed, he decides to join them in death.", "context": "Paragraph 1: DearS was adapted into a twelve episode television and single original video animation anime by MSJ with co-production by Bandai Visual, Geneon Entertainment, Lantis and TeaM DearS. The series was directed by Iku Suzuki. The series was broadcast on Chiba TV, TV Kanagawa, TV Saitama, Tokyo MX TV, TV Santerebi, TV Aichi and TVQ Kyushu from July 10 to September 26, 2004. Four DVD compilation volumes were released from August 2, 2005 to February 21, 2006. The anime's opening theme is  by Under17 and the ending theme is \"Happy Cosmos\" by Poppins. The anime has been re-licensed by Discotek Media.\n\nParagraph 2: In 2004, Lucky (now Greg Vaughan) and Elizabeth reconnect while they work together to save Emily from Helena's attempts to kill her, and help Nikolas evade charges for Helena's supposed death. Helena shoots Lucky, putting him into a coma, and they get back together when he wakes up. They eventually move in together, and their financial struggles prompt Elizabeth to serve as a surrogate mother for Courtney (Alicia Leigh Willis) and Jasper Jacks (Ingo Rademacher), upsetting Lucky. Elizabeth miscarries in September 2005, and Lucky comforts her. They marry in October, and Lucky acts as a father figure to her son, Cameron. They get into a train crash during their honeymoon where Lucky almost dies. In 2006, Elizabeth is kidnapped by Manny Ruiz and Jason comes to her aid, hurting Lucky's pride. Lucky sustains a serious back injury during the incident, and becomes addicted to his painkillers during the stress of his recovery. He becomes paranoid that Elizabeth is having an affair with Patrick Drake. He starts getting pills from Maxie Jones (Kirsten Storms) and starts having an affair with her. In August, Elizabeth catches them in bed together and sleeps with Jason. Elizabeth later learns that she is pregnant and Jason is the father, but keeps it a secret while Lucky goes to rehab and they divorce. Elizabeth hopes to keep the baby safe from Jason's lifestyle and keep Lucky from relapsing by claiming him as the father. Lucky makes a drastic character change away from his previously known quick thinking and street smarts, he is oblivious to Elizabeth's lies of Jake's paternity, and also when Maxie Jones fakes a pregnancy. TVSource Magazine called Lucky “Port Charles' bumbling police detective who just can't catch a break,” while Entertainment Weekly stated he was “a character who's been written as earnest (he's Johnny Law to his father's rebel) if not the brightest bulb (a girlfriend’s fake pregnancy, Elizabeth’s carrying another man’s child).” Liz and Lucky remarry in March 2007 and Elizabeth gives birth to Jacob Spencer that May. Elizabeth seeks Jason's help when Jake is kidnapped and their continued friendship causes both Lucky and Jason’s girlfriend, Sam McCall (Kelly Monaco) to become jealous. In November 2007 Lucky discovers the truth about Jake's paternity but agrees to keep the paternity a secret to protect Jake. Angry with Elizabeth, Sam begins an affair with Lucky as payback. Elizabeth and Lucky continue to drift apart and divorce again.\n\nParagraph 3: Tisdale has supported various charitable organizations and causes during her career. She collaborated with the Make a Wish Foundation in 2008 by visiting sick children in hospitals and helping to raise funds for the organization. Tisdale is also a supporter of Habitat for Humanity, a charity devoted to building homes for people in need. She was scheduled to perform on Idol Gives Back 2008, along with her High School Musical co-star Vanessa Hudgens. However, they were unable to appear due to their High School Musical 3: Senior Year filming schedule; they recorded a video from the film's set to support the cause instead. She contributed to the A Very Special Christmas 7 album with her rendition of Wham!'s \"Last Christmas\"; proceeds from sales benefited the Special Olympics. Tisdale was a phone operator during Hope for Haiti Now: A Global Benefit for Earthquake Relief, a charity telethon held in January 2010 to raise funds for seven non-profit organizations that carried out relief work in Haiti following the 2010 Haiti earthquake. Tisdale volunteered for the \"Get on the Bus\" charity campaign in 2011, which was hosted by the television series Extreme Makeover: Home Edition. She helped to build a house for a family and later performed some of her songs to raise funds. In 2012, she became the face of Project Pink, a campaign launched by Puma SE to raise money for the research of breast cancer treatments. As part of the campaign, she visited Los Angeles' BEST After School Enrichment Program at Pacoima Charter School in California and presented each child that attended with shoes, clothes, and gift cards. In 2013, Tisdale recorded her song titled \"You're Always Here\" and later released it to digital stores as a charity single. During an interview with On Air with Ryan Seacrest, she confirmed that 30 percent of the proceeds of the song would go to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital.\n\nParagraph 4: Billy Halleck, a successful, arrogant and morbidly obese lawyer, is distracted while driving across town by his wife Heidi giving him a handjob and runs over and kills an elderly Romani woman. Billy uses his connections within the local police and criminal court to get himself acquitted and avoid punishment. The woman's father, Taduz Lemke, exacts vengeance by imposing a curse upon Billy outside the courthouse—using the word \"thinner\"—and Billy begins to lose weight rapidly regardless of how much he eats. Worried, Billy consults a series of doctors, suspecting cancer but the doctors are unable to determine the cause of his weight loss. Later, Billy discovers that the judge who presided over his case has grown scales on his skin and the policeman who committed perjury on Billy's behalf has been struck with severe acne. Both men eventually commit suicide. With the help of private detectives and Richie \"The Hammer\" Ginelli, a former client with ties to organized crime, a now emaciated Billy tracks the Romani band north along the seacoast of New England to Maine. He confronts Lemke at their camp and tries to persuade him to lift the curse but Lemke refuses to do so, insisting that justice must be done upon Billy. The Romani inhabitants throw Billy out of their camp but not before Lemke's great-granddaughter Gina slingshots him through the hand with a ball bearing. Billy calls for help from Richie, who sends a mob doctor to treat Billy's hand and then arrives in person to terrorize the Romani camp. After Richie finishes with the inhabitants, Lemke agrees to meet with Billy. Lemke brings a strawberry pie with him and adds blood from Billy's wounded hand to it. The weight loss will stop for a short time but then resume unless Billy passes the curse to someone else by getting them to eat the pie. Lemke implores Billy to eat the pie himself so that he may die with dignity. After finding Richie's severed hand in his car and learning that he has been murdered, Billy returns home and intends to give the pie to Heidi, whom he has come to blame for his predicament. The next morning, though, he finds that both she and their daughter Linda have eaten from the pie. Realizing that they are both doomed, he cuts a slice for himself so that he can join them in death.\n\nParagraph 5: During Smithers' subsequent prison sentence in Seagate Federal Penitentiary, he was contacted telepathically by Mentallo, who was being held in a stasis field in the same prison. Mentallo was still capable of using his powers and he used them to orchestrate a break-out of his fellow prisoners, which included the hero Hawkeye (who was serving time for crimes he performed while a member of the Thunderbolts) and Headlok (whom Mentallo had possessed). The criminals, remotely \"chained\" to one another, escaped as the so-called Chain Gang. The Chain Gang reluctantly agreed to work together to search for a way to survive, deactivate their security manacles, and search for a weapon of great power left behind by the death of the criminal industrialist Justin Hammer. The weapon had come to the attention of Mentallo by Hammer himself before he died, as Hammer awakened Mentallo's powers while he was in the stasis field. Unknown to his associates, Hawkeye was actually working undercover on behalf of S.H.I.E.L.D. Ultimately, the Chain Gang was tracked down by Hawkeye's former teammate Songbird, who helped Hawkeye defeat the villains. They discovered that Hammer's legacy was a biological toxin that had been ingested by every single villain who had ever worked for him. Smithers was the carrier. Hawkeye, Songbird, and Smithers began a new search for the trigger that would release Plantman's toxin so that it would not fall into the wrong hands.\n\nParagraph 6: The Mount Nimba Strict Nature Reserve is a 12 540 hectares-large UNESCO Natural World Heritage Site which is threatened by local subsistence pressures (hunting, farming, fire, logging, grazing) and potential future iron-ore mining (see here). The nature reserve shares its area between Forested Guinea and Côte d'Ivoire. It is mostly mountainous, with forested areas at the foot of the mountain ranges. Mount Nimba is the highest point of the Nimba range, at an elevation of 1752m. About two-thirds of the reserve is covered by rainforest, and it is home to more than 2,000 vascular plant species, 107 mammals species, 210 bird species, and 2,500 invertebrate species with exceptionally strong level of endemism. Its dynamic and seasonal ecosystems have produced \"one of the most remarkable diversities of the whole West African region\". It meets criteria IX and X of the UNESCO Criteria for Selection, reflecting the importance of its processes of evolution and development of flora and fauna, and conserving its biological diversity. These qualities are evidenced in species such as the Nimba otter shrew, the viviparous toad, and observed tool use by chimpanzees. Since the 1960s, the Nimba Range has become a source for iron and diamond ore mining, which has led to the degradation of the nature reserve.\n\nParagraph 7: The map shows the cities of Catigara (near longitude 180° and latitude 10°S) and Mallaqua (Malacca, near longitude 170° and latitude 20°S) on the western coast of the great peninsula that projects from the southeastern part of Asia, or INDIA MERIDIONALIS (Southern India) as Waldseemüller called it. This peninsula forms the eastern side of the SINUS MAGNUS (\"Great Gulf\"), the Gulf of Thailand. Amerigo Vespucci, writing of his 1499 voyage, said he had hoped to sail westward from Spain across the Western Ocean (the Atlantic) around the Cape of Cattigara mentioned by Ptolemy into the Sinus Magnus.  Ptolemy understood Cattigara, or Kattigara, to be the most eastern port reached by shipping trading from the Graeco-Roman world to the lands of the Far East. Vespucci failed to find the Cape of Cattigara on his 1499 voyage: he sailed along the coast of Venezuela but not far enough to resolve the question of whether there was a sea passage beyond leading to Ptolemy's Sinus Magnus. The object of his voyage of 1503–1504 was to reach the fabulous spice emporium of \"Melaccha in India\" (that is, Malacca, or Melaka, on the Malay Peninsula). He had learned of Malacca from one Guaspare (or Gaspard), a pilot with Pedro Álvares Cabral's fleet on its voyage to India in 1500–1501, whom Vespucci had encountered in the Atlantic on his return from India in May 1501. Christopher Columbus, in his fourth and last voyage of 1502–1503, planned to follow the coast of Champa southward around the Cape of Cattigara and sail through the strait separating Cattigara from the New World, into the Sinus Magnus to Malacca. This was the route he understood Marco Polo to have gone from China to India in 1292 (although Malacca had not yet been founded in Polo's time). Columbus anticipated that he would meet up with the expedition sent at the same time from Portugal to Malacca around the Cape of Good Hope under Vasco da Gama, and carried letters of credence from the Spanish monarchs to present to da Gama. The map therefore shows the two cities that were the initial destinations of Amerigo Vespucci and Christopher Columbus in their voyages that led to the unexpected discovery of a New World.\n\nParagraph 8: Liz Wyatt of CBR.com referred to Lockjaw as one of Marvel's \"fan favorite animal companions,\" stating, \"Lockjaw is perhaps the cutest Inhuman out there...though we might be biased on that count. Lockjaw is not only extremely adorable, loyal, and okay...he's massive as well, but he's also very useful. You see, Lockjaw can teleport almost as well as he can drool. Which is saying something! Lockjaw is a massive bulldog, and an Inhuman to boot. He's made friends and allies with more than one Marvel character, and we're not surprised by that fact. This is one dog who has plenty of room for love in his heart. And that is why we love him so much.\" Chase Magnett of Comicbook.com called Lockjaw \"one of the longest-lasting and most beloved super pets in existence,\" writing, \"The bottom line with Lockjaw is that he's a very good dog. One of the best. If there were a We Rate Dogs Twitter in the Marvel universe, it would almost certainly give Lockjaw a 15/10. As a character, he reminds us of everything we love about our canine companions with an extra dose of superheroic powers and adventure on top. Lockjaw is loyal and loving, filled with fun, and there whenever his people need him. Whether you have a dog in your home or prefer to admire them from afar, the appeal of the species is obvious when looking at this big, jowled face. He's just such a good dog.\" CA Staff of ComicsAlliance asserted, \"It's hard to imagine anyone not loving Lockjaw. He's a huge puppy dog who teleports you to where you need to go! He's so smart that for a while the story was that he wasn't a dog at all — but thankfully that was retconned, because Lockjaw is the best dog, and not letting him be one kind of ruins him. He's loyal to the Inhuman Royal Family — he even has a tuning fork on his head to match his master — but he's also spent time with the Thing and Ms. Marvel, two of Marvel's best characters. who are made even better with Lockjaw around. He may not star in many stories of his own, but if you could magically wish one comics character to life and hang out with them, Lockjaw would be an excellent choice.\" Simon Winter of WhatCulture said, \"Despite being a dog, Lockjaw is by far the best member of the Inhumans. As 'Companion to the Royal Family of the Inhumans', Lockjaw plays an important part in keeping New Attilan safe from the countless threats it faces. However, if you think he's just a giant slobbering eating machine... Well, you'd be mostly right, but there's way more to this lovable mutt than meets the eye. In one of Marvel's greatest decisions, Lockjaw got his own Avengers team in 2009's Lockjaw and the Pet Avengers.\"\n\nParagraph 9: The earliest sauropterygians appeared about 247 million years ago (Ma), at the start of the Middle Triassic: the first definite sauropterygian with exact stratigraphic datum lies within the Spathian division of the Olenekian era in South China. Early examples were small (around 60 cm), semi-aquatic lizard-like animals with long limbs (pachypleurosaurs), but they quickly grew to be several metres long and spread into shallow waters (nothosaurs). The Triassic-Jurassic extinction event wiped them all out except for the plesiosaurs. During the Early Jurassic, these diversified quickly into both long-necked small-headed plesiosaurs proper, and short-necked large-headed pliosaurs. Originally, it was thought that plesiosaurs and pliosaurs were two distinct superfamilies that followed separate evolutionary paths. It now seems that these were simply morphotypes in that both types evolved a number of times, with some pliosaurs evolving from plesiosaur ancestors, and vice versa.\n\nParagraph 10: Due to the importance of Mainz as a fortified city, the \"Hartenberg\" also had a military function. Those who controlled it could fire from there to the city centre of Mainz. When the town was extended, a new rampart was built around it, the Rheingauwall. It was built in the Neo-Prussian style of fortification and enclosed parts of what is now the district. Several forts have been partially preserved, such as Fort Hauptstein, the Cavalier Prince Holstein, Fort Hartmühl in Hartenberg Park north of the water features and the New Golden Ross Barracks. At the Mombacher Tor, an army cannery was built at the suggestion of Field Marshal Edwin von Manteuffel, of which only the foundations can be seen today. During the expansion of the Südwestrundfunk in 2003, parts of the Gonsenheimer Tor were rediscovered during excavation work. The parts were salvaged and restored near the site. Extensive parts of Fort Hartenberg, built in the 19th century, including its mining galleries, also came to light when excavation work began on the site of the Hartenberg Primary School (later Peter-Jordan School), which was built around 1965 and demolished in 2018, for a planned residential development in Hartenberg Park. Here, in September 2019, a construction freeze of three months came into effect to allow the archaeologists to survey and document the facilities before they gave way to residential buildings.\n\nParagraph 11: Created by Founder and original owner Steve Allison in 1989 (Allison Broadcast Group, Inc.), the EDGE was basically an evolution of Allison's Phoenix radio station, KEYX \"KEY 100.3\" an alternative station which he founded in 1986. Allison bought then-KZRK for $3.6 million cash. KZRK programmed the syndicated heavy metal format ZRock. Soon after debuting KDGE, Allison then immediately took on the construction of a 2,000-foot tower in Collinsville, Texas in order to improve the station's signal. Steve Allison chose the name \"The EDGE\" and changed the call letters to KDGE. He also designed the station's logo and chose and developed its format. Larry Neilson, the former program director of KEYX in Phoenix was chosen as the original EDGE Program Director. Wendy Naylor, who had worked for Allison at his various stations in Phoenix since 1982, was chosen as the music director and morning show co-host along with KEYX alumni Roger King. Also relocating to Dallas from Phoenix was Tom Duran as the Sales Manager and a major player in helping create The EDGE's promotion and concerts. Months before The EDGE debut in June 1989, the KEYX Phoenix crew was formulating the station's format, promotions, etc. from a temporary suite while the EDGE studios were being built out next door. Two weeks before the EDGE debut, Program Director Larry Neilson was contacted by Dallas local George Gimarc about possibly doing a speciality show on The EDGE. Neilson was impressed by Gimarc's music knowledge, consulted with Owner/General Manager Steve Allison, and made the decision to put Gimarc on as the afternoon drive air personality. Gimarc proved to be a good hire and his influence on the station over time was invaluable, but he had nothing whatsoever to do with the \"founding\" of \"The Edge\". \"The Edge\" became an important force in the local music scene in Dallas, is the only station to play local and national \"alternative\" styles. (KEGL had swit
