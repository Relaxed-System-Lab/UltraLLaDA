The largest case of fraud brought to the Department of Justice took place between 2007 until 2016.  Philip Esformes, 48, owner of more than 20 assisted living facilities and skilled nursing homes was the leader of the ring. Former Director of the Outreach Program at Larkin Hospital in South Miami, Odette Barcha, 50, was Esformes’ accomplice along with Arnaldo Carmouze, 57, a physical assistant in the Palmetto Bay Area. These three constructed a team of corrupt physicians, hospitals, and private practices in South Florida. The scheme worked as follows: bribes and kickbacks where paid to physicians, hospitals, and practices to refer patients to the facilities owned and controlled by Esformes. The assisted living and skilled nursing facilities would admit the patients and bill Medicare and Medicaid for unnecessary, fabricated and sometimes harmful procedures. In addition to that, some of the charges to Medicare and Medicaid include prescription narcotics prescribed to patients addicted to opioids to entice the patients to stay at the facility in order for the bill to increase. Another technique used by the dream team was to move patients in and out of facilities when the patients have reached the maximum number of days allowed by Medicare and Medicaid. This was accomplished by using one of the corrupt physicians to see the patients and coordinate for readmission in the same or a different facility owned by Esformes. Per Medicare and Medicaid guidelines, a patient is allowed 100 days at a skilled nursing facility after a hospital stay. The patient is given an additional 100 days if the he/she spends 6 days outside of a facility or is readmitted to a hospital for 3 additional days. The facilities not only fabricated medical documents to show treatment was done to a patient, they also hiked up the prices to equipment and medications that were never consumed or used.  The role of Barcha as the Director of the Outreach program was to expand the group of corrupt physicians and practices. She would advise the community physicians and hospitals to refer patients to the facilities owned by Esformes and they will receive monetary gifts. The group would refer patient to the facilities and receive kickbacks. The law against kickbacks is called the Anti-Kickback Statute or Stark Law. This law makes it illegal for medical providers to refer patient to a facility owned by the physician or a family member for services billable to Medicare and Medicaid. It also prohibits providers to receive bribes for patient referrals. The involvement of Carmouze in the grand scheme was to prescribe unnecessary prescription drug to patients who may or may not have needed the medications. He also facilitated community physicians to visit the patient in the assisted living facilities owned by Esformes in order for the physician to bill Medicare and Medicaid and Esformes received kickbacks. Carmouze also assisted in falsifying medical documentation to represent proof of medical necessity for many of the medications, procedures, visits, and equipment charged to the government. Esformes has been detained since 2016. In 2019, he was convicted for charges that add up to 20 years in prison.

Women and girls were an afterthought of a system designed for men. The authors explain that more recent research has shown how women's and girls' victimization narrows their choices and provide the background for their entrance into unemployment, prostitution or survival sex, drug use and abuse, homelessness and other criminal acts. The authors explain that girls' pathways to crime are further affected by the gendered nature of society. The authors also discuss the increased rates of women's and girls' imprisonment in the 21st century, and ask: \"What led these women into criminal behavior? Are today's women more violent than their counterparts in the past decades? How could such a change in public policy towards women (that led to their increased imprisonment) have happened with so little fanfare?\" They explain that society must stop punishing girls and women based on myths bolstered by bad information and instead seek recourse in the real causes of their offending. As well, the lack of civil rights guaranteed to youth makes their arrest possible and normal, in the case of girls, even when they are fleeing horrific situations. Chesney-Lind and Pasko explain that the answer to the last question, how could the dramatic increase in the prison population of women, lies in the societal anxiety that surrounds women and girl offenders. Furthermore, because the majority of people are arrested and imprisoned are poor and therefore without a voice and the authors argue to counter these challenges we must focus attention on girls and women offender, engage them as persons, listen to their story and ultimately turn the prisoner into a person. The authors claim that to fix these problems we could choose not to imprison marginalized girls and women, as we often do for white women and girls. They posit this would be unlikely to cause a surge in crime as most women and girls are in need of training, education and support, not punishment. They also suggest society should work to strengthen the bond between women, their communities and their children. The authors support their claims by showing that the increased imprisonment of women is not a result of new crimes and that decreases in the prison population would not only save taxpayers money but could be achieved through policy changes. The authors end the book by explaining that if society can begin to stop relying on imprisonment for women we can begin to consider this approach for men as well. They explain that the majority of male offenders are also marginalized by racism and poverty and furthermore, that they are the brothers, fathers and sons of marginalized women.", "answers": ["6"], "length": 3615, "dataset": "passage_count_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "0358aa51ab38acc1b97405f4307203e982cbb19500435368"}
{"input": "", "context": "Paragraph 1: Two years later, on 29 September 1977, another attempted launch of an Intelsat (Intelsat IVA F-5) communications satellite took place on AC-43.

Shepitko herself did not ask for or require special treatment and her colleagues remembered her as an example of courage, faith, patience, and extraordinary care. For example, Boris Plotnikov was dressed very lightly and quickly grew numb from the cold and the piercing winds in the open field; but after the command \"Stop! Cut!\" the director came over to him to warm him up and to thank him. She also had to warm up Vladimir Gostyukhin who later wrote: \"It was worth it “to die” in the scene to be able to feel her gratitude.\" He said that almost no one knew what effort Shepitko gave when shooting each frame. Sometimes Gostyukhin had to carry the director from the car to the hotel room by himself: Shepitko was sometimes not very physically well and occasionally her strength weakened. Long before The Ascent, Shepitko became ill with hepatitis on the set of the movie Heat. Ignoring advice to go to Moscow, she went on to shoot the picture from a stretcher on which she was brought from the infectious barracks. Moreover, Shepitko did not recuperate enough, and the consequences of the disease adversely affected her well-being in the future, in particular on the set of The Ascent. In addition she experienced extreme pain which was caused by her recent spinal trauma. But Shepitko still rose two to three hours before the crew to have time to prepare, after which she worked to the maximum limit of her capabilities throughout the day. For example, in one long scene, the partisans are running away with difficulty through the thick snow from their pursuers. On screen it was necessary to show the deadly fatigue of the flushed, panting people. To prevent hypocrisy in the scenes, the director ran alongside the actors while filming, experiencing their exhausted state with them. With this dedication the shooting took place without interruption and was completed one month ahead of schedule.\n\nParagraph 4: The Académie Royale de Danse, founded by Letters Patent on the initiative of King Louis XIV of France in March 1661, was the first dance institution established in the Western world. As one of King Louis’ first official edicts after the death of royal adviser Jules Mazarin, the “Letters Patent of the King to Establish a Royal Academy of Dance in the City of Paris” represented a critical step towards the young King's wielding of consolidated personal power. Structurally, the Académie consisted of thirteen dancing masters selected by King Louis XIV for being the “most experienced in the Art [of dance].” This \"experience\" was determined by each dancer's history of success in previous royal productions of ballets de cour. Most famously, eight of the selected dancing masters performed with King Louis XIV during his portrayal of Apollo, the Sun King, in Le Ballet de la nuit (1653). Although the object of the Académie was to reflect, analyze and normalize matters of dance, no document relating to its activity or to this theorization has survived. The Académie Royale de Musique, founded in 1669 as the Académie d'Opéra, was a closely related opera and ballet company, and although the two institutions never merged, members of the dance academy were also associated with the opera. Little by little, recruitment of dancers into the royal entourage gave way to recruitment into the ballet-corps of the Opéra. This slowly altered the Académie's profile, making it and its members more dedicated to dance training alone. By 1775, the Académie was nearing the end of its life. On joining the Académie, Jean-Georges Noverre, one of ballet d’action’s most influential choreographers, commented on its ineffectiveness in making meaningful contributions to the dance world. But Noverre’s dismissive remarks concerning the organization cannot be taken at face value, since on a number of accounts, his statements are polemical, biased and misleading. It is often claimed that the Académie ceased to exist after 1778, merely because a list of the thirteen members was no longer published after this date, or alternatively after 1789, with the coming of French Revolution and the abolition or nationalization of royal institutions. In a tribute to his deceased brother Maximilien published in the  Courrier des spectacles  (30 September 1798), Pierre Gardel, the head choreographer at the Paris Opéra at that time, writes that “these positions, which came with a pension [of 500 livres], passed in turn to the most distinguished dancers. Citizens [Auguste] Vestris and [Pierre] Gardel, currently at the Théâtre de la République et des Arts, are the last to have enjoyed these.” It appears then that the Académie was indeed defunct by 1798. The opera and ballet company has survived and today is known as the Opéra National de Paris.\n\nParagraph 5: In the harsh conditions in which the shoot took place, this factor was very important: extras and crew members were frostbitten, but no one complained.

He has studied kickboxing, Seido-kaikan karate, and boxing. His nickname was \"Lights Out\" because of his high level karate and boxing skills, and one punch knock out power. He has won many world kickboxing titles, and reached as high as 10th in the highly respected World Boxing Council's & World Boxing Organisation's (W.B.C & WBO) Cruiserweight ratings. In 2000, he challenged WBO cruiserweight champion Johnny Nelson for his title. Watt holds the notable distinction of being the first athlete to fight for world Karate, kickboxing and boxing titles.\n\nParagraph 7: Television proved to be a hit, and within a year there were at least 53,194 television sets owned in the country, which equaled one for every 42 Puerto Ricans. Within two years, radio had experienced a sharp decline, with stations losing both advertisements and entertainers amidst the instability. Radio personalities complained that there were difficulties entering into the new medium, which had since created its own clique. Ramón Rivero continued to thrive in both mediums with his character of \"Diplo\". Ante la ley, the first Puerto Rican telenovela, was aired on August 22, 1955, by WKAQ-TV. WAPA-TV responded with Mar Brava, perpetuating the genre in local television for decades to come. Local radio technicians traveled abroad to become acquainted with the new technology, while foreign personnel also arrived to participate in the nascent industry. By 1956, the growing quantity of foreign entertainers coming to work in Puerto Rican television shows had caused an increasing anger in the local entertainers. During that year's summer, three shows produced by Tommy Muñiz held the top spots in the ratings. On April 29, 1959, El colegio de la alegría was revived at WAPA-TV, with its original cast and the addition of Velda González and Yoyo Boing. By early 1961, the amount of TV sets in Puerto Rico had increased to nearly 218,000 sets. This trend continued until Puerto Rico became the place with most television sets by square mile in Latin America and the Caribbean. Entering the 1960s, the prime-time slots were occupied by Myrta Silva's Una hora contigo and Rendezvous Nocturno hosted by Vilma Carbia and Tony Chiroldi. Foreigners such as Gaspar Pumarejo would replace this group. Meanwhile, WKAQ-TV only counted with El Show Libby's hosted by Luis Vigoreaux and El Show Ford hosted by Cordero as its local productions, with most being imported. By this time WKAQ, WAPA, WIPR and WKBM were based in San Juan, WRIK and WSUR at Ponce, WORA and WIPM at Mayagüez and WOLE at Aguadilla. WKBM-TV was founded by Rafael Pérez Perry, a radio entrepreneur. In February 1960, WKAQ debuted its videotape equipment, the first in Latin America. However, the complications that arose from using a costly new technology meant that most shows were still filmed live, with it becoming more popular for soap operas and commercials. WAPA, WIPR and WKBM introduced the technology as well and some years later it was predominant. By September 1956, however, the local channels had begun airing more kinescope, which were cheaper to air than a live production.\n\nParagraph 8: Two years later, on 29 September 1977, another attempted launch of an Intelsat (Intelsat IVA F-5) communications satellite took place on AC-43.

In the aftermath of the accident, NASA inspected their inventory of Atlas vehicles and found several more improperly brazed pipes which needed replacement.\n\nParagraph 9: During the Vietnam War, Nguyễn Văn Linh was the party secretary for the Vietcong in South Vietnam, which had seen him direct the guerrilla resistance against the American-allied government there, but most of his duties were organizational rather than military. He also specialised in propaganda, studying and attempting to influence American politics in favour of North Vietnam. He trained special undercover Vietcong spies who infiltrated government organisations in Saigon. In 1968, Linh directed the Tet Offensive against South Vietnam. This surprise attack throughout most South Vietnamese towns and cities was a turning point of the Vietnam War. After the end of the Vietnam War and the re-unification of Vietnam in 1975, Linh was inducted to the Communist Party's Politburo and became party chief of the capital Saigon. He favoured a slow transformation of the formerly capitalist southern part of the country causing him to come into conflict with his party colleagues. In the late 1970s, though considered a promising party politician, he had repeated arguments with Lê Duẩn, Ho Chi Minh's successor as party leader, preventing him from rising further in the hierarchy. In 1982, he was even removed from the Politburo. According to his friends, Linh resigned after an argument over the future of South Vietnam, in which he defended private capital.\n\nParagraph 10: In the harsh conditions in which the shoot took place, this factor was very important: extras and crew members were frostbitten, but no one complained. Shepitko herself did not ask for or require special treatment and her colleagues remembered her as an example of courage, faith, patience, and extraordinary care. For example, Boris Plotnikov was dressed very lightly and quickly grew numb from the cold and the piercing winds in the open field; but after the command \"Stop! Cut!\" the director came over to him to warm him up and to thank him. She also had to warm up Vladimir Gostyukhin who later wrote: \"It was worth it “to die” in the scene to be able to feel her gratitude.\" He said that almost no one knew what effort Shepitko gave when shooting each frame. Sometimes Gostyukhin had to carry the director from the car to the hotel room by himself: Shepitko was sometimes not very physically well and occasionally her strength weakened. Long before The Ascent, Shepitko became ill with hepatitis on the set of the movie Heat. Ignoring advice to go to Moscow, she went on to shoot the picture from a stretcher on which she was brought from the infectious barracks. Moreover, Shepitko did not recuperate enough, and the consequences of the disease adversely affected her well-being in the future, in particular on the set of The Ascent. In addition she experienced extreme pain which was caused by her recent spinal trauma. But Shepitko still rose two to three hours before the crew to have time to prepare, after which she worked to the maximum limit of her capabilities throughout the day. For example, in one long scene, the partisans are running away with difficulty through the thick snow from their pursuers. On screen it was necessary to show the deadly fatigue of the flushed, panting people. To prevent hypocrisy in the scenes, the director ran alongside the actors while filming, experiencing their exhausted state with them. With this dedication the shooting took place without interruption and was completed one month ahead of schedule.\n\nParagraph 11: After failing to envelop Hood's left flank at the Battle of Ezra Church, Sherman still wanted to extend his right flank to hit the railroad between East Point and Atlanta. He transferred Maj. Gen. John M. Schofield's XXIII Corps of the USA Army of the Ohio from his left to his right flank and sent him to the north bank of Utoy Creek. Although Schofield’s troops were at Utoy Creek on August 2, they, along with the XIV Corps, Army of the Cumberland, did not cross until August 4. An initial attack by the Regular Brigade against J. Patton Anderson's Division CSA of Stephen Dill Lee's Corps was unsuccessful.  In addition the Confederates dismounted a brigade of cavalry, Armstrong's, in the front of the federals in a deception plan, a feinted attack that was successful in delaying the combined force of the XXIII and XIV Corps USA.  Schofield made an additional movement to exploit this situation on the morning of August 5. Although initially successful, Schofield had to regroup his forces, which took the rest of the day. The delay allowed the Confederates to strengthen their defenses with an abatis, which slowed the Union attack when it restarted on the morning of August 6. The Federals were repulsed with heavy losses by William B. Bate's division and failed in an attempt to break the main defenses to gain the railroad. On August 7, the Union troops moved toward the Confederate main line skirmishing and extending to their right and entrenched. Several attacks were made at Sandtown Road (Campbellton at Adams Park) on 10 August and East Point on 18 August. Here US Forces remained, as far south as the Atlanta Christian College, until late August 1864 when the failure of Schofield's offensive operations convinced Sherman to move on the Confederate lines of communication and supply.\n\nParagraph 12: His first-team debut came as an 85th-minute substitute in the League Cup match against Rotherham United on 28 October 2003. During extra time he attempted to chip Rotherham goalkeeper Mike Pollitt, who handled the ball outside his penalty area and was sent off. With the score 1–1 after 120 minutes the game was decided in a penalty shootoutthe first ever shootout featuring Arsenal at Highburywhich Arsenal won, although Quincy missed his kick. He scored his first goal for the first team in the same competition on 9 November 2004 against Everton, a match in which he also made two assists, and contributed two appearances to Arsenal's victorious 2004–05 FA Cup campaign. He produced an impressive performance against Reading during the Gunners' 2005–06 League Cup run.\n\nParagraph 13: Born in Luxembourg City on 22 October 1965, Lentz grew up in the Luxembourg town of Echternach. He studied at the Luxembourg Conservatoire and later at the Paris Conservatoire (1982–1986) and the Musikhochschule Hannover (1986–1990). In 1989, he began working on a cycle of compositions titled Caeli enarrant.... His music is being recognised increasingly around the world, with performances at the Berlin Philharmonie, the Vienna Musikverein and Konzerthaus, Concertgebouw Amsterdam, Wigmore Hall London, Carnegie Hall New York, Kennedy Center Washington, Suntory Hall Tokyo, Sydney Opera House. Many orchestras have performed his works, including the BBC Symphony Orchestra in London, BBC National Orchestra of Wales, Hallé Orchestra of Manchester, Deutsches Symphonieorchester Berlin, Bamberger Symphoniker, Kölner Philharmoniker, Düsseldorfer Symphoniker, Netherlands Radio Symphony Orchestra, ORF Symphony Orchestra in Vienna, Warsaw Philharmonic, St. Louis Symphony Orchestra, Tokyo Metropolitan Symphony Orchestra, New Japan Philharmonic, Sydney Symphony Orchestra and Melbourne Symphony Orchestra among others. His orchestral work Guyuhmgan, from part VII of the cycle Mysterium was the foremost recommended work at UNESCO's 2002 International Rostrum of Composers in Paris. His compositions include a work for viola, orchestra and electronics called Monh written for Tabea Zimmermann, as well as Ingwe for solo electric guitar, written for the Australian guitarist Zane Banks.", "answers": ["10"], "length": 3667, "dataset": "passage_count_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "ec5670be0aea90e8e1a05d687158371f45f64a07f6177b69"}

It is the component of breath (pneuma) that shapes the material provided by the female into the correct form.\n\nParagraph 3: O'Connell suggested that the group needed a bassist and brought in Shaun Cooper, though the rest of the band needed convincing since they did not know him. Cooper, who had played with O'Connell in various bands throughout school, auditioned for Taking Back Sunday at the end of December 2000, playing his first show on New Year's Eve. In February 2001, the band released a five-track demo The Tell All Your Friends Demo; copies were given to anyone associated with a record label. The group then spent the year touring, during which they received offers from labels that ultimately amounted to nothing. Among these offers was one from Triple Crown Records, who were apprehensive as they had just signed Brand New, and Drive-Thru Records, whose co-owner Richard Reines had mistaken Nolan for Lacey. Eventually, the band's friend Michele Logo was in a car with Victory Records sales and A&R representative Angel Juarbe. She had the band's demo playing during the journey, before Juarbe inquired who it was. He sent a copy to Victory founder Tony Brummel, who asked to see a live performance. Within two weeks of seeing them live, a contract was written up, and the band signed to Victory in December 2001.\n\nParagraph 4: Marcus Ticotin, Sahaj's older brother and Abandon Entertainment president, financed Sahaj's first record while Sahaj was living in Greenwich, CT with mentor and friend Rob Jones.  They held open auditions in New York City to fill out the lineup with a drummer, guitarist, and bassist.  Skoota Warner was chosen as a drummer who fit in well with the blend of funk and hard rock in Sahaj's writing style.  R&B bassist Kirk Lyons and guitarist Ben Mauro, the latter of whom would later play with Lionel Richie and Britney Spears, completed the initial configuration of the band.  The members' influences did not completely mesh, but the lineup did produce one commercial track in \"Crazy Little Voices,\" which appeared as the end title track for the movie The Rage: Carrie 2.\n\nParagraph 5: Because of its high alcohol content, Bacardi 151 was particularly flammable among liquors.

{"input": "", "context": "Paragraph 1: Austrian consul Johann Georg von Hahn collected an Albanian tale titled Taubenliebe: a king wants his only daughter to find a husband. One day, a dove flies into her room and talks to her. The dove tells her to have a milk bowl ready for it the next day. The dove returns, bathes in the milk and becomes a handsome youth. The youth warns her to never tell anyone about him, and to wait for him for three years. They exchange rings as a vow. Some time later, the queen wants to betroth the princess to a suitor, but she mentions she is already betrothed. After, the dove does not return, and she goes on a quest for him for three years, walking in iron shoes and with three iron canes. Her quest is not successful, and she returns home. She asks her parents to build a bath house, and that any guest can enter by telling a story. One day, the daughter of a woman that lives in town wants to go to the bath house, but first she goes to the fountain to get some water. At the spring, she sees a rooster with footwear. The girl follows the rooster to a garden and to a house. Inside the house, she spies on 11 pigeons flying into the room, bathing in milk and becoming men. A 12th pigeon appears and mopes about his fiancée, who betrayed the secret. The girl returns to her mother and both decide to go to the princess's bath house to tell her the story. The tale was translated by Angelo de Gubernatis  as Il Principe Colombo (\"The Pigeon Prince\"); by Parker Fillmore as The Pigeon's Bride: The Story of a Princess who Kissed and Told (sourced as from Yugoslavia), and by Albanologist Robert Elsie as For the Love of a Dove.\n\nParagraph 2: The Huamanga Cathedral (also known as the Cathedral of Ayacucho) is the main Baroque cathedral in Ayacucho, Peru.

It is built with pink stone in the center and gray stone in the towers. Its construction began in 1632 and ended in 1672. It is considered one of the most beautiful cathedrals in Peru, especially for its interiors decorated with a Churrigueresque style.

She is very interested breaking down boundaries between genres. In an interview with Lucy Ives describing the differences between prose and fiction, Gladman described her desire to blur the two forms: Fiction is interested in a certain kind of unfolding or sequence of events. Time is more intact in fiction. Prose, I think, introduces the element of the awareness of yourself in language as you are unfolding things in time and allowing yourself to be distracted or interrupted, allowing yourself to question the difficulty of what you’re doing and be stalled, not to move. I want more fiction to do this, because it changes the way we read and understand story. With fiction that repairs all doubt and interruption and experiment by being fluid, coherent; what we expect doesn’t leave much room for me as a reader. But I think the more you talk about these categories, their distinctions, the quicker they break down. Ultimately, what I want is for there to be a blur over everything.Gladman's Ravicka cycle, four interrelated fictional books taking place in the author's invented country of Ravicka, has been compared to the fiction of Samuel Beckett, Anne Carson, and Julio Cortázar. Zack Friedman of BOMB has characterized the Ravicka series as “social science fiction,” a label that Gladman herself prefers: I definitely would prefer social science fiction to science fiction, as I really didn’t intend these books to ask deep questions about technology or bioengineering or inter-galaxy relations. Instead, they wonder about city living, architecture, language and communication, desire, and community—the same things I wonder about in my own life. For me, it needs to stay on this side of reality... and it needs to be pushing for physical space in this world.Gladman has described the very short essays that comprise Calamities as \"ditties\" becausethey feel less like they’re trying to travel; there is just one point that gets made in a quick circle. It’s funny to call them essays anyway, because they fail as essays. They don’t sustain an argument, they don’t go anywhere, they don’t conclude anything, and the half-paragraph ones seem even more so, kind of absurd.Gladman's 2017 book Prose Architectures develops Gladman's long-term interest in architecture and in the relationship between language and image in a set of drawings created through illegible script that are as visual as they are linguistic.

She is very interested breaking down boundaries between genres. In an interview with Lucy Ives describing the differences between prose and fiction, Gladman described her desire to blur the two forms: Fiction is interested in a certain kind of unfolding or sequence of events. Time is more intact in fiction. Prose, I think, introduces the element of the awareness of yourself in language as you are unfolding things in time and allowing yourself to be distracted or interrupted, allowing yourself to question the difficulty of what you’re doing and be stalled, not to move. I want more fiction to do this, because it changes the way we read and understand story. With fiction that repairs all doubt and interruption and experiment by being fluid, coherent; what we expect doesn’t leave much room for me as a reader. But I think the more you talk about these categories, their distinctions, the quicker they break down. Ultimately, what I want is for there to be a blur over everything.Gladman's Ravicka cycle, four interrelated fictional books taking place in the author's invented country of Ravicka, has been compared to the fiction of Samuel Beckett, Anne Carson, and Julio Cortázar. Zack Friedman of BOMB has characterized the Ravicka series as “social science fiction,” a label that Gladman herself prefers: I definitely would prefer social science fiction to science fiction, as I really didn’t intend these books to ask deep questions about technology or bioengineering or inter-galaxy relations. Instead, they wonder about city living, architecture, language and communication, desire, and community—the same things I wonder about in my own life. For me, it needs to stay on this side of reality... and it needs to be pushing for physical space in this world.Gladman has described the very short essays that comprise Calamities as \"ditties\" becausethey feel less like they’re trying to travel; there is just one point that gets made in a quick circle. It’s funny to call them essays anyway, because they fail as essays. They don’t sustain an argument, they don’t go anywhere, they don’t conclude anything, and the half-paragraph ones seem even more so, kind of absurd.Gladman's 2017 book Prose Architectures develops Gladman's long-term interest in architecture and in the relationship between language and image in a set of drawings created through illegible script that are as visual as they are linguistic. Gladman has cited Youmna Chlala, who also both draws and writes poetry, as an inspiration.\n\nParagraph 10: Male, female. Forewing length 4.2 mm.

Against the Philadelphia Eagles in week 5, Julius rushed for 72 yards in the first half but suffered a high ankle sprain that bothered him the entire season and was forced to sit out for 3 games. For the second straight year, Jones was considered to be injury-prone and unable to carry the load of a franchise back. Rookie running back Marion Barber III turned in several strong performances in Julius' absence creating a running back controversy.  Against the Detroit Lions Jones had rushed for 92 yards, but on 1st and goal from the 1-yard line, he was stopped 3 consecutive times. Later against the Carolina Panthers, Jones once again demonstrated his playmaking ability when rushed for two touchdowns and 194 yards. Former Cowboys quarterback and now Fox Network commentator Troy Aikman, commented on Jones' speed burst and agility, something he had not seen since Julius' rookie season in 2004. The Cowboys finished the season with an uninspiring loss the next week to the St. Louis Rams at Texas Stadium.

The west wall is standing almost intact to gable height, although the lining of the original door has been replaced by modern brickwork. The north transept is  long and  wide. The east wall of the transept is entirely gone, except for traces of its junction with the north wall. At the south end of this wall once stood a pillar; the opposite pillar, west of the south door, is almost complete and in a good state of preservation. Also in the transept there is a doorway which leads to what is thought to be a sacristy, and is the only doorway remaining in its original form. The architrave is almost complete. West of the transept there is a small chapel  long and  wide. Most of the chapel's window mouldings survive.

After the death of Bishop Cotton in 1866, Pratt started a Hill Schools' Nomination Endowment Fund to help support Bishop Cotton's scheme of starting schools in the pleasant climate of the hills for the benefit of the children of poorer English residents in India who could not afford an education in England. Pratt married Hannah Maria Brown, daughter of George Francis Brown, a Bengal Civil Servant, at Bhagalpur on 6 March 1854. He was elected Fellow of the Royal Society in 1866. Pratt served as president of the Calcutta Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals founded by Colesworthey Grant in 1861. He died from cholera when he was on a visit to Ghazipur, India, on 28 December 1871. At the instigation of Bishop Robert Milman, a memorial to Pratt was erected in St. Paul's Cathedral, Calcutta.\n\nParagraph 5: In 1988, Adrian Adonis returned to NJPW, immediately reuniting with Murdoch, reforming their tag team, and later forming a trio with Owen Hart. Murdoch and Adonis' only title match occurred on June 23, where they unsuccessfully faced reigning IWGP Tag Team Champions Masa Saito and Riki Choshu. The duo teamed together until Adonis' death on July 4, and after that date, Murdoch would not return to Japan for 5 months. In November 1988, Murdoch returned to NJPW, taking part into the Japan Cup Tag Team Elimination League, a round-robin tournament of trios consisting of six-man tag team elimination matches. Murdoch teamed up with Scott Hall and Bob Orton Jr., wrestling their first tournament match on November 17, defeating the six-man combination of Antonio Inoki, Riki Choshu and Kantaro Hoshino, with Murdoch last eliminating Inoki with Orton's assistance. They suffered their first loss at the hands of Masa Saito, Tatsutoshi Goto and Seiji Sakaguchi, but quickly rebounded by defeating Super Strong Machine, The Tiger and The Jaguar, with Murdoch last eliminating the Strong Machine. They later defeated Kengo Kimura, Yoshiaki Fujiwara and Osamu Kido, even though Murdoch got eliminated by Kimura during the match, his team got the win after Orton last eliminated Fujiwara. Their winning streak continued when they defeated George Takano, Steve Armstrong and Tracy Smothers, after Murdoch last eliminated Takano. However, they suffered another loss at the hands of Tatsumi Fujinami, Shinya Hashimoto and Masahiro Chono, but once again quickly rebounded by defeating Hiro Saito, Shiro Koshinaka and Kuniaki Kobayashi, after Murdoch eliminated Kobayashi and Saito. After defeating Buzz Sawyer, Manny Fernandez and Kendo Nagasaki by forfeit, they once again faced the Saito, Sakaguchi and Goto combination. In what would seem to be another loss after Hall and Orton were the two first eliminated, Murdoch single handedly eliminated Sakaguchi and Saito, before finally making quick work out of Goto, eliminating him and avenging their loss. However, the team couldn't reach the finals due to the two losses they suffered.\n\nParagraph 6: In 1988, Adrian Adonis returned to NJPW, immediately reuniting with Murdoch, reforming their tag team, and later forming a trio with Owen Hart.

Following the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire, the Egyptian and Sudanese monarchy emerged as the most important in the Middle East and the wider Arab world. Finding themselves as mere figureheads during the period of British control, Egypt and Sudan's monarchs saw their powers increased following the recognition of independence, and the subsequent adoption of the 1923 Constitution, the most liberal in the country's history. Although King Fuad I often ruled as an autocrat, partly because he repeatedly overrode some provisions of the Constitution, Egypt and Sudan had the freest parliament in the region. During Fuad's reign and that of his son, Farouk, the country witnessed six free parliamentary elections and enjoyed a free press as well as an independent judiciary. According to historian Philip Mansel, \"the Egyptian monarchy appeared so splendid, powerful and popular that King Farouk's ignominious end seems inexplicable.\" The Muhammad Ali Dynasty's downfall is often regarded as having begun with the Abdeen Palace Incident of 1942, which greatly discredited the King. It accelerated with the growing discontent of Egypt's armed forces following the country's defeat in the First Arab-Israeli War. Disgruntled members of the military formed the Free Officers Movement, which led a coup d'état on 23 July 1952, thereby marking the beginning of the Egyptian Revolution of 1952. The toppling of the monarchy, and the resultant establishment of a revolutionary republican government, was the first of its kind in the modern Arab world, and was a crucial event in the region's history; it accelerated dramatically the rise of Pan-Arabism, and had a domino effect leading to similar military overthrows of the monarchies of Iraq (1958), North Yemen (1962), and Libya (1969). Egypt has had a republican form of government since the end of monarchical rule. Although the establishment of genuine democratic rule was one of the six core principles of the Revolution, political parties were banned in 1953 and the country was turned into a military dictatorship. The thriving pluralism that characterized political life during the latter period of the Muhammad Ali Dynasty's rule was thus brought to an end. Even though a multi-party system was officially restored in Egypt in 1976, the country has never recovered the level of political freedom it had enjoyed during the monarchy. In common with most deposed royal families, the Muhammad Ali Dynasty was initially vilified by the new revolutionary regime. Nonetheless, it has undergone re-evaluation in recent years; nostalgia for the former monarchy has been growing among some in Egypt, largely fuelled by the airing in 2007 of a hugely successful serial about the life of King Farouk I.\n\nParagraph 8: Soon, Sayadaw founded a forest monastery in the \"Ledi forest\" and began practicing and teaching intensive meditation. It was from this monastery that he would take his name, Ledi Sayadaw, meaning \"respected teacher of the Ledi forest.\" In 1885, Ledi Sayadaw wrote the Nwa-myitta-sa (), a poetic prose letter that argued that Burmese Buddhists should not kill cattle and eat beef, since Burmese farmers depended on them as beasts of burden to maintain their livelihoods, that the marketing of beef for human consumption threatened the extinction of buffalo and cattle and that the practice was ecologically unsound. He subsequently led successful beef boycotts during the colonial era, despite the presence of beef eating among locals and influenced a generation of Burmese nationalists in adopting this stance.\n\nParagraph 9: Soon, Sayadaw founded a forest monastery in the \"Ledi forest\" and began practicing and teaching intensive meditation.

{"input": "", "context": "Paragraph 1: The Tự Đức Bảo Sao or Đồng Sao (銅鈔, billets of copper) were introduced by the Ministry of Revenue (戸部, Hộ Bộ) in the year Tự Đức 14 (1961) for large transactions and taxes on behalf of stores of the government of Đại Nam, the introduction of the Tự Đức Bảo Sao marked the redefinition of the tiền or mạch denominations and the quàn (strings of cash coins) where the quàn was made equal to 10 mạch and the mạch was made the equivalent of 60 zinc cash coins, under these exchange rates 1 quàn was worth a string of 600 zinc cash coins. The Đồng Sao series of cash coins was introduced as zinc cash coins were heavy in quantity to carry around for the payment of larger sums of money, to this end the government introduced a system of monetary units determined by their nominal value in zinc cash coins as opposed to their intrinsic market value, it is possible that this might have been inspired by contemporary Chinese coinage of the Xianfeng era in the Qing dynasty where large denomination coins from 4 up to 1000 văn circulated alongside each other with little to no difference in intrinsic value in a fiduciary system, this system was also used by the Vietnamese. When the Tự Đức Bảo Sao was first proposed the Mandarins of the imperial court of Đại Nam suggested to simply increase the weight of the brass Tự Đức Thông Bảo to make them worth more relative to the zinc Tự Đức Thông Bảo cash coins as 1 brass cash coin with a weight of 9 phần was worth four zinc cash coins. The value of the Đồng Sao cash coins was indicated on the reverses of the coins expressed in their worth in zinc cash coins preceded by the character  (chuẩn, regarded as equal to), despite the fact that Sao (鈔) means \"paper money\", though imperfectly the denominations of these coins attempted to take the respective value of brass and zinc cash coins into account which means that they can't be fully qualified as a fiat currency. The Ministry of Revenue of Đại Nam originally set the exchange rate between the brass Tự Đức Bảo Sao and zinc cash coins heavily in favour of the larger denominations which wasn't accepted by the market which resulted in the imperial court attempting to adjust the exchange rate more to the contemporary exchange values of brass and zinc cash coins that were in circulation. In January 1868 by decree the exchange rate between brass 9 phần cash and zinc cash coins was fixed 1:4 replacing the early ratio of 1:2.67 that had been in place since 1858. The Tự Đức Bảo Sao was generally well received by the population of Đại Nam despite the fact that their circulation was reduced due to their high purchasing power relative to their intrinsic value until their weight was decreased, which was done by the government to conform to the new official exchange between brass and zinc cash coins.\n\nParagraph 2: Day rose to the top of his profession during the reign of Edward VI (1547–1553). At this time, restrictions on publishers were relaxed, and a wave of propaganda on behalf of the English Reformation was encouraged by the government of the Lord Protector, Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset. During the reign of the Catholic Queen Mary I, many Protestant printers fled to the continent, but Day stayed in England and continued to print Protestant literature. In 1554, he was arrested and imprisoned, presumably for these illicit printing activities. Under Queen Elizabeth I, Day returned to his premises at Aldersgate in London, where he enjoyed the patronage of high-ranking officials and nobles, including William Cecil, Robert Dudley, and Matthew Parker. With their support, he published the Book of Martyrs and was awarded monopolies for some of the most popular English books, such as The ABC with Little Catechism and The Whole Booke of Psalmes. Day, whose technical skill matched his business acumen, has been called \"the master printer of the English Reformation\".\n\nParagraph 3: Makai Club bounced back at Wrestling World 2003. Yanagisawa won the Young Generation Cup defeating Kenzo Suzuki in the semi-finals and Yutaka Yoshie in the finals. Meanwhile, Makai #1 and one night only member, Dai Majin, defeated Hiro Saito and Tatsutoshi Goto. The new members Makai #4 (being Young Lion Katsuyori Shibata) and Makai #5 (former All Japan Pro Wrestling competitor Mitsuya Nagai) defeated Takashi Iizuka and Masahito Kakihara. The group would suffer one loss with Yasuda and Murakami losing to their former Makai #3 partner Ohara and Shinsuke Nakamura. On February 1, 2003, Makai Club entered the Teisen Hall Six-Man Tag Team Tournament with Yanagisawa, Makai #1, and Makai #2 forming one team, while Kazunari Murakami, Makai #4 and #5 formed another team. However neither team would win with, as both teams lost to eventual winners Shinsuke Nakamura, Hiro Saito, and Tatsutoshi Goto. Also in February, Makai Club entered a #1 contenders tournament for the IWGP Tag Team Championship. On January 30, Makai #1 and #2 lost an entrance match to Saito and Goto, Makai #4 and #5 lost in the first round to Iizuka and Kakihara on February 6, and Yasuda and Murakami would make it to the finals where they lost to Mike Barton and Jim Steele. Despite the loss, Yasuda and Murakami would ultimately be granted the title match after Steele suffered an injury a few days later. On February 16, 2003, Yasuda and Murakami challenged Cho-Ten for the IWGP Tag Titles but would fail to win the titles, and in the main event, Yanagisawa challenged Yoshihiro Takayama for the NWF Heavyweight Championship, but lost. By the spring, the group began a feud with the Crazy Dogs (Tatsutoshi Goto, Hiro Saito, Michiyoshi Ohara and Enson Inoue) and Makai #5 began a feud with Takashi Iizuka, who recognized him as Nagai (who got him injured in June 2001) with Iizuka defeating him in a best of series (with Nagai even unmasking for the final match). On April 23, 2003, Yasuda challenged Yuji Nagata for the IWGP Title in a rematch from a year ago (where Nagata won the title from Yasuda), but Yasuda lost. At Ultimate Crush on May 2, 2003, Ken Shamrock joined the Makai Club for one night defeating Takashi Iizuka, while Murakami lost to Enson Inoue. Following Ultimate Crush, Makai Club for the most part of the year, went to the midcard and would only receive a few more title shots afterwards. On July 9, 2003, Makai #4 and #5 challenged Hiroshi Tanahashi and Yutaka Yoshie for the IWGP Tag Team Championship, but came up short. On July 13, Yasuda challenged Takayama for the NWF Heavyweight Championship, but he also came up short. Yasuda and Shibata, who abandoned his Makai #4 profile, entered the 2003 G1 Climax, with Shibata finishing third, while Yasuda finished last in their block. In the fall of 2003, Makai #2 and #5 unmasked and began going by their real names, also during this time Yasuda and Makai #1 entered the 2003 G1 Tag League finishing in 5th place with 7 points.\n\nParagraph 4: The Triangle Link is part of two routes, European route E39 and County Road 542. The section from Stord to Sveio, including the Stord Bridge and the Bømlafjord Tunnel, is part of the E39 highway (the Coastal Highway) which runs along the west coast of Norway. The section from the interchange on the island of Føyno, including the Bøla Bridge and the Spissøy Bridge, is on County Road 542. The link acts both as a mainland connection for Stord and Bømlo to the mainland at Sveio, as well as a link between the two island communities, which have a combined population of 30,000.\n\nParagraph 5: As the game began Gordon-Cumming discussed the tapestry with Wilson, commenting that the different colours of the cloth made it difficult to see the counters; Gordon-Cumming put a piece of white paper in front of him on which to place his now highly-visible stake. Although many of the inexperienced party were playing for small stakes, Gordon-Cumming was betting between £5 and £25 for a coup; he played the  system of betting, in which if he won a hand with a £5 stake, he would add his winnings to the stake, together with another £5, as the stake for the next hand. Soon after play began Stanley Wilson thought he saw Gordon-Cumming add two red £5 counters onto his stake after the hand had finished, but before the stake had been paid—a method of cheating known in casinos as ; after he thought that this had happened a second time, Wilson turned to Levett and, according to the later court transcripts, whispered \"My God, Berkeley, this is too hot!\" further explaining that \"the man next to me is cheating!\" After Levett also watched for a few minutes, he agreed, saying to Wilson \"this is too hot\". After half an hour the game was completed and the prince congratulated Gordon-Cumming on his play; the future king also asked Mrs Wilson for a more suitable table for the following day. Wilson instructed the butler to move a longer, three-foot wide table in and cover it with green baize. Stanley Wilson then discussed the cheating with Levett. The two men were uncertain what steps to take, and agreed that Stanley would ask his brother-in-law, Lycett Green, for his advice. Although Lycett Green thought it impossible that Gordon-Cumming would have cheated, Stanley told him that he was certain, as was Levett.\n\nParagraph 6: Makai Club bounced back at Wrestling World 2003.

She states that if Carmel does not take the children, they will be put into care. Matthew is unwilling but after Carmel's father has a stroke, Maxine brings the children to Carmel so they move in with her and Matthew. He resents them as Carmel's time is being diverted from him; finding Junior, in particular, difficult to cope with. They regularly clash, causing further animosity between Matthew and Carmel and Matthew becomes violent again, punching Carmel during an argument about Junior. She has some nasty bruises but once again a tearful Matthew convinces her to forgive him. Matthew's behaviour alternates between contrite and caring to hot-tempered and violent, for seemingly no reason. Nevertheless, Carmel loves him and stays with him as she believes she can help him combat and contain his rage but Junior soon realises why his aunt is constantly bruised and tries to stop the violence by telling people about the abuse but this only makes matters worse. Matthew becomes irrationally jealous of Carmel's friendship with Dr. David Samuels (Christopher Reich), and during a family meal, he turns violent again and attempting to protect Carmel, Junior stabs Matthew with a kitchen knife and he is rushed to hospital, where he tries to convince Carmel that he has changed. She allows him to come home and tries to get him professional help but Matthew refuses, appalled by the idea and begins smashing up the house and threatening Carmel with more violence. Finally realising that she cannot help Matthew, Carmel ends their relationship. She throws Matthew out and he leaves Walford in July 1989. The following month, Carmel's father dies, so she leaves Walford with Junior and Aisha to look after her mother.

Letterman's contract included the right to control the time slot that follows his and produce the Late Late Show and it was his production company (Worldwide Pants) that selected Ferguson as host and with whom his contracts were negotiated. With Letterman's departure, CBS would become the sole producer of the show and it is the network that determines what is done with the time slot and with which any contract is negotiated. CBS had been ambiguous in regard to Ferguson's future as host of The Late Late Show.

{"input": "", "context": "Paragraph 1: The PlayStation version received positive reviews. Andrew Collins of the Official UK PlayStation Magazine believed the features are \"massively improved\" over the original, and said its \"superbly polished\" gameplay made it one of the best PlayStation racing games. His main criticism was that he thought the Destruction Derby Practice mode can make players complacent. The Electric Playground complimented the scenery and damage effects. Electronic Gaming Monthlys two sports reviewers praised the larger tracks and improved crashes, and both assessed it as \"Better in every way than the first game\". Johnny Ballgame of GamePro stated that \"The original Destruction Derby looks like a mere hubcap compared to the gold-rimmed gameplay and trunkful of new features of Destruction Derby 2.\" He cited the longer tracks, arena mode, and light sourcing, but gave the game less than perfect scores as he found the announcer grating and judged the worsened steering after crashes to inordinately favor realism over enjoyment. Game Revolution described the Stock Car Racing as \"almost perfect\", and the tracks as \"extremely cool\", but criticised the steering sensitivity. Ed Lomag of Computer and Video Games lauded the improved car mechanics and track design and also liked that the UK PAL version runs in full screen at a full frame rate, thus proving British developers could make decent British PlayStation games. Despite these compliments, he criticised the game's limited re-playability. Edge praised the improved damage system resulting from the new physical modelling routines, saying the crashes are much more intense than the original. The 3D engine was described as \"impressive\", but the lack of a link-up multiplayer mode was criticised. Next Generation commented, \"As with most ground-breaking titles ... Destruction Derby created as many new problems as solutions, and the developers of Destruction Derby 2 have done an extremely nice job of correcting these faults with a much improved sequel.\" The reviewer elaborated that the game's larger tracks than the original allow the player to both build up more momentum for crashes and enjoy more of a conventional racing challenge, and that the added ability for cars to leave the ground enables true 3D crashes. Absolute PlayStation described the game as a \"vast improvement\" over the original, but said the gameplay is identical and \"rather shallow\". Gamezilla's Mark Skorupa described the graphics as \"top notch\", but also said that it breaks what was good in the original game. IGN believed that the game compensates too much for the lack of difficulty of the first game through an overly aggressive artificial intelligence and by making it \"impossible\" to catch up with the other cars. Despite this, they praised the car physics and graphics. Jeff Kitts of GameSpot extensively praised the improved crashes and new tracks: \"The winding, narrow, claustrophobic roadways of the first Destruction Derby have been replaced with huge, wide superspeedways worthy of games like NASCAR Racing and The Need for Speed.\" He remarked that the slippery road surfaces make the game more difficult to play, but considered it overall a major improvement over the first game. Jeuxvideo.com praised the playability of the game and the soundtrack, but criticised the commentary as \"repetitive\".\n\nParagraph 2: In Pakistan Television was first introduced in an exhibition near Mazar-e-Quaid on 16 September 1955. This event was arranged by American consulate in Karachi. The idea of establishing the television industry in Pakistan was conceived by the National Education Commission with the support of President Ayub Khan. Originally a private sector project in 1961 by prominent industrialist Syed Wajjid Ali who signed a joint venture agreement with Nipon Electric Company (NEC), leading Pakistani engineer Ubaidur Rahman was appointed by Wajjid Ali to head the television project. By 1962, after a series of pilot transmission tests, the project was quickly taken over by the Ayub Khan Government in 1963 for the \"greater national interest of Pakistan\". President Ayub Khan re-appointed Ubaidur Rahman in 1963 under the Ministry of Information to continue with the NEC joint venture collaboration to launch Pakistan Television or PTV. The project began with a tent on the back lot of Radio Pakistan Lahore where a transmission tower and a studio were constructed. On 26 November 1964, the first official television station commenced transmission broadcasts from Lahore, followed by Dhaka in 1965 (then the capital of East Pakistan). A third centre was established in Rawalpindi-Islamabad in 1965 and the fourth in Karachi in 1966. Later centres in Peshawar and Quetta were established by 1974. PTV was given under Television Promoters Company in 1966 which was established under Ministry of Information and Broadcasting in the same year. TPC was upgraded to Pakistan Television Corp in 1967. In 1972 PTV Corporation was nationalized. Originally broadcast in black and white, PTV's experimental colour transmission began on 20 December 1976. With this new upgrade in techniques and equipment, the Pakistan Television Academy was founded and opened in 1987 to teach students who wished to work in the medium. As with the other agreement, the government financed most of the funds while the private venture capitalists offered to fund the remainder. Late 1980s morning transmission started on PTV.\n\nParagraph 3: Hunting mainly consist of the owl watching from a perch for prey activity and then swooping down swiftly once prey is spotted. The prey is often killed quickly by the eagle owl's powerful grip and talons though is sometimes bitten on the head to be killed as well. Then the prey item is swallowed whole or torn into pieces with the bill. The same basic hunting and killing methods are used by all owls in the genus Bubo, except that the  snowy owls (Bubo scandiacus) and fish owls regularly watch for prey from a ground position (on a bank in the case of fish owls). Most hunting occurs in wood-cloaked openings, often those carved out by wetlands or watersheds. While they can and do hunt within woodlands, they are not well suited to hunting in areas with dense understories, thick foliage or tree thickets, as they seem to hunt firstly by vision and only secondarily by sounds, unlike some other owls. Eurasian eagle-owls are too heavy with relatively modest wing areas to hunt extensively on the wing although this species’ relatively short, broad wings allow it low-speed maneuverability in the moments of take off after spotting a prey item. Because of the limits of its flying abilities, the Eurasian eagle-owl requires ample, elevated perches from which to watch for prey activity and thus in most areas it will not hunt extensively in open, treeless areas, unlike smaller owls like the barn owl (Tyto alba). Tree branches are often the main hunting perches used but they will also use rock formations, rubble with large rocks, hills with tall grasses or even a building, tall pole or other elevated manmade perch. Occasionally, they may capture other birds on the wing, including nocturnal migrants, taking advantage of their distraction and diminished visual acuity to intercept them in mid-flight. They seem to hunt mostly by opportunity, taking whatever detectable prey item that is available, preferably those that are active. Most prey, even up to the size of small rabbits, are swallowed whole. While a small rodent can easily be swallowed in an instant, if the prey item is large, the swallowing process can appear grueling and grotesque and in some cases eagle-owl nestlings have choked to death while attempting to swallow overly large prey (i.e. moorhens). Small prey is often swallowed immediately after capture, although occasionally it is carried in the bill to the nest for the young or to a roost for quick consumption. Larger prey is normally carried in the owl's feet and is more likely than smallish prey to be brought to the nest due to its nutritional value. Exceptionally large prey (probably any over ) is consumed on the ground where it is killed, possibly being torn apart into manageable pieces. This leaves the owl vulnerable to loss of their prey to scavengers or to confrontations with heavier predators. The undigestable portions of prey are regurgitated in the form of pellets as in all owls. Pellets of the Eurasian eagle-owl average around , thus they are around the same size as those of most other large Bubo owls, even the notably smaller great horned owl (B. virginianus). In some cases, pellets of Bubo owls can range up to  in length. Eagle-owl pellets average slightly larger (about 10%) than those of great grey owls (Strix nebulosa). As is the case with all owls, pellets are indisputably the best method to examine the main diversity of prey consumed by an owl. However, it is also important to examine the prey remains left around a roost or nest when available. Larger prey, which may be torn apart before the eating of portions or fleshy parts of the prey item, is frequently determined solely by remains rather pellets as are birds, in which the wings, feet and some feathers may be removed before consumption. As in the great horned owl, after capturing larger prey, the Eurasian eagle-owl often beheads it. In part, this may be due to making prey easier to carry off and, in both large owl species, it is considered a signature indicator for predator identification.\n\nParagraph 4: The process of finding qualified individuals begins with call for nominations put out each spring by the Saskatchewan Honours Advisory Council, which then makes its selected recommendations to the lieutenant governor. Posthumous nominations are accepted within one year of the date of death and in 2001 the Provincial Emblems and Honours Act was amended to allow for honorary membership in the order, granted to those who are neither current nor former residents of Saskatchewan; Prince Charles, Prince of Wales, was the first honorary member of the Saskatchewan Order of Merit, having been appointed on 24 April 2001. The lieutenant governor, who is ex officio a member and the Chancellor of the Saskatchewan Order of Merit and remains a member following his or her departure from viceregal office, then makes all appointments into the fellowship's single grade of membership by letters patent bearing the viceroyal sign-manual and the Great Seal of the province; thereafter, the new Members are entitled to use the post-nominal letters SOM and have their portrait added to the Athabasca Gallery at the Saskatchewan Legislative Building.\n\nParagraph 5: The process of finding qualified individuals begins with call for nominations put out each spring by the Saskatchewan Honours Advisory Council, which then makes its selected recommendations to the lieutenant governor.

For instance, there is the so-called neuromantic imagination that inspire architects. Here, the cybernetic frame of mind is fired by the concept of the \"third nature,\" which is occupied by those who inhabit not the actual terrain in which we live, work, and play but the virtual space of media flows that enter the \"unconscious\". According to Rowan Wilken, neuromantic architecture favors virtuality in techno-spatial and philosophical senses as well as a lack of engagement with actual reality and the questions about place and community. \n\nParagraph 7: The process of finding qualified individuals begins with call for nominations put out each spring by the Saskatchewan Honours Advisory Council, which then makes its selected recommendations to the lieutenant governor.

Fairchild subsequently manufactured a larger, stretched version of the F-27 named the Fairchild Hiller FH-227, which was operated by U.S.-based air carriers Delta Air Lines, Mohawk Airlines, Northeast Airlines, Ozark Air Lines, Piedmont Airlines (1948-1989),  and Wien Air Alaska.\n\nParagraph 9: Hunting mainly consist of the owl watching from a perch for prey activity and then swooping down swiftly once prey is spotted.

Twice in this portion (lines 514 and 540) that sund is used is in the same lines as rēon, and both times forming the three-word phrase on sund rēon, which would seem to mean \"rowing on the sea\" – but there is an Anglo-Saxon word, onsund, which means “sound, physically strong, uninjured”, in most transcriptions of the Beowulf text it does not occur, but in the original manuscript, at line 513 on and sund have apparently been rewritten after being scraped from the parchment and seem slightly closer together than two separate words ordinarily are (although Zupitza's transcription treats them as two separate words), and in line 540 the manuscript clearly uses onsund as a single word and Zupitza transcribes it as a single word – although he drew a thin line of separation after on, which may indicate that he did not know that onsund was a word with a meaning of its own. Onsund is found in a lot of other Anglo-Saxon artifacts. In Icelandic, at least, sund requires a preposition, not found here in Beowulf, to mean swimming rather than merely something aquatic.\n\nParagraph 11: The Union Pacific Railroad's M-10003, M-10004, M-10005, and M-10006 were four identical streamlined 2-car power car diesel-electric train sets delivered in May, June, and July 1936 from Pullman-Standard, with prime movers from the Winton Engine Corporation of General Motors and General Electric generators, control equipment and traction motors. One was for the City of San Francisco, two were for the City of Denver, and one was a spare set intended for both routes. In 1939, M-10004 was split and converted into additional boosters for the other sets, now renumbered CD-05, CD-06, and CD-07, all running on the City of Denver. The M-10001 power car became the other third booster. In this form, the three power sets ran until they were replaced by E8 locomotives in 1953, at which point they were scrapped.\n\nParagraph 12: The Union Pacific Railroad's M-10003, M-10004, M-10005, and M-10006 were four identical streamlined 2-car power car diesel-electric train sets delivered in May, June, and July 1936 from Pullman-Standard, with prime movers from the Winton Engine Corporation of General Motors and General Electric generators, control equipment and traction motors.

Their 1957 song \"Do the Bop\" came to the attention of Dick Clark, who suggested they rename it to \"At the Hop\".  After limited initial success with the song, it became a worldwide hit when it was played on American Bandstand. The Juniors went on to have two more hits \"Rock and Roll Is Here to Stay\" and \"Twistin' USA\". The Juniors released several more records in the 1960s but were not able to produce any more hits.

Beowulf and Breca could have been rowing together or competing to see who was the more prodigious rower. The Old English term rēon, used twice in this portion of Beowulf (namely lines 513 and 540), is not translated as “swim” in any other Anglo-Saxon poetry.

All of a sudden, Nisa has to swerve out of the way because of a flaming truck that's been knocked sideways on the road- which turns out to be the truck that was carrying the Hydra agents. Nisa is doubly shocked to see a shadowy figure in the middle of the flames that looks like Angela, Loki's sister and bodyguard.

The setting then changes to Doomstadt, Latveria- the home of Doom's Children, a terrorist organization, the members of which are inspecting two men in a van upon their entrance to the city, who reveal after their inspection that they intend to get weapons from the inside. After a brief scene where Loki talks to a fan at the Iowa State Fair about an entire meal on a stick- a partly caramelized apple, a few onion rings, and a hamburger, all on an ice cream cone, the god of mischief goes to a debate with the other two presidential candidates. Nisa, who is inside but still covering the debate, remarks that Angela, last seen at the site of the truck crash, is at the corner of the debate, looking unharmed. The scene only covers the first question of the debate, which is about the response of the U.S. to the political situation in Latveria, since Doctor Doom, a super villain and former leader of Latveria, is gone. While the two other candidates agree that the U.S.A. should send troops to Latveria, and express their discontentment with Loki's campaign ad- revealing that unlike the ad, the candidates had apparently not requested a Skype meeting with Doom's Children. However, Loki simply acknowledged the lie- arguing that it was indeed true that the female candidate, who had brought up the Skype statement, would prefer a peaceful and diplomatic solution, and that the ad was then accurate. He then asks why he is the only person being berated for lying, and that he does not think that American soldiers should go die in Latveria. Meanwhile, Nisa purchases a ticked to Latveria, and when the scene changes to a few days later, in Doomstadt, the reader can see Nisa, in disguise among a group of masked Latverians, revealed shortly thereafter to be the Latverian New Prosperity Alliance, all infiltrating Doctor Doom's castle. After they sneak in to the castle, they attempt to open a weapon cache door, failing the first time but succeeding the second. However, before they can escape the castle with their weapons, they are stopped by Doom's Children and an unidentified person from the Latverian New Prosperity Alliance creates an explosion, killing both groups. The scene flashes to a battlement above the explosion, where one of the Latverian New Prosperity Alliance men changes appearance and is revealed to be Loki in disguise, who then steps through a magic portal to see the United Metal Workers of Wisconsin.

In other words, it happens quite often that certain dates do not appear in the Tibetan almanac and certain dates occur twice. But there are no natural days or week days that occur twice or which are omitted.\n\nParagraph 6: Ceol was the son of Cutha (or Cuthwulf), the son of Cynric of Wessex. He reigned from either 591 or 592 to 597. According to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, he began his reign in 591, but it was only in the following year that he drove out his uncle Ceawlin in a battle at Woden's Barrow in Wiltshire, thus denying the throne to the rightful heir, Ceawlin's son Cuthwine. Upon his death the throne passed to his brother Ceolwulf. Because his son Cynegils was presumably too young to inherit the throne, it was given to the brother, as was probably the custom among the Saxons.  In 1967 Wright and Jackson found a stone at Wroxeter in a Sub-Roman context (dating to c. 460 – 475 AD[4]) with the inscription CUNORIX MACUS MAQVI COLINE, which translates as \"Cunorix ('Hound-king' = Cynric) son of Maqui-Coline ('Son-of-Holly'), both of which are regarded as Irish personal names.\n\nParagraph 7: A Tibetan calendar month normally starts with the week day or natural day ( or ) in which the first tithi () ends.

The episode \"My Intern's Eyes\" was shown through (but not narrated from) Keith's point of view. Keith was introduced as a timid intern who became very popular amongst his fellow interns and some senior staff. J.D. took Keith under his wing and taught him the ropes. Despite all this, J.D. grew to irrationally dislike Keith, who quickly began to excel in his hospital duties, and furthermore because Keith was a \"booty call\" that progressed into a relationship with Elliot. However, J.D. soon decided that he would like Keith because Elliot did, and admitted that Keith had genuine skills as a doctor, with the two becoming good friends soon after. J.D. also admitted in one episode that, had Elliot never worked at the hospital, he and Keith would probably have immediately become best friends. Despite J.D.'s dislike of Keith, the two have a great deal in common—which may explain Elliot's interest in him. Elliot, who spoke fluent German, informed J.D. that Keith's last name meant \"master of dudes\" in German. Keith and Ted would eventually become best friends. In \"His Story IV\", Keith revealed himself to be a Republican, which strengthened his relationship with Elliot, as she was also one. Eventually, Keith moved in with Elliot and she confessed that she loved him. Keith later proposed to her, and they quickly began to plan a wedding. Elliot, doubting her love for Keith, had second thoughts and cold feet, responding by nearly cheating on Keith with J.D. She decided to break off the engagement. Their relationship became very strained, with Keith insulting Elliot whenever he saw her. While he eventually acted professionally at work with her, he alternated between anger and depression outside of the workplace. Elliot made jokes about her leaving him, but Ted informed her that Keith was still hurt and pretended to be over it only when she was around. Elliot finally realized his feelings in \"My Jerks\" and sincerely apologized for hurting him. Keith responded by saying he had really needed to hear that. He appeared again in \"My Finale\" in J.D.'s final daydream of all the people he had met at Sacred Heart.\n\nParagraph 9: Part of the Colcombe estate was purchased by William Pole Esquire (d. 1588), who had purchased Shute House in 1560. His son Sir William Pole (1561–1635), the antiquary, purchased the remaining shares from the heirs of the Courtenays, and rebuilt the house, as he recorded after 1618 in his \"Collections towards a History of Devon\": A goodly building was here intended by the last erles but altogether unfinished, and nowe the whole being reduced from all ye co-heires unto my possession, I have newe built the howse and made it the place of my residinge\". Sir William resided most of his younger life at Shute, until 1618, during which time he let his son John, later the 1st Pole baronet, live in the former building at Colcombe, as is evidenced  by the record of the birth of John's second  son Courtenay Pole, which described his father as  \"John Pole of Colcombe\". In 1618 Sir William Pole exchanged residences with his son John, to whom he let Shute, and himself moved to Colcombe, which he then set about rebuilding and where he died in 1635.  During the Civil War it served in 1644 as the headquarters of Prince Maurice (d. 1652), who used it as a base for his attack on Stedcombe, then being used as a garrison for parliamentary troops by its owner Sir Walter Erle. It was almost completely destroyed, with only part of the kitchen and a large fireplace having survived. During the conflagration, many of the volumes of the manuscripts of the antiquary's great work on the history of Devon, with substantial additions made by his son the 1st baronet, were destroyed. After the Civil War part was rebuilt on the other side of a lane as  a farmhouse. Colcombe appears to have passed out of the Pole family after the time of the 1st baronet, but was repurchased by  Sir John de la Pole, 6th Baronet (1757–1799), the builder of New Shute House, possibly from Sir George Yonge of Colyton, from whom he had acquired several large properties in 1790. The 6th baronet seems to have decided to re-build it in the grand style of its former existence when owned by Henry Courtenay, 1st Marquess of Exeter, 2nd Earl of Devon (1498–1539). However he died before his plan could be effected and stipulated in his will that his heirs should build \"a good substantial dwelling-house  with suitable offices and at least five acres of land in Colcombe Park where his widow should live\". It is unlikely the request was ever acted upon. His widow is known to have spent her last days at Lindridge House near Plymouth tending her sick brother.\n\nParagraph 10: A Tibetan calendar month normally starts with the week day or natural day ( or ) in which the first tithi () ends.

{"input": "", "context": "Paragraph 1: Alexander was a son of the penultimate king of the Kingdom of Kartli and Kakheti in eastern Georgia, Heraclius II, who entrusted him various military and administrative tasks. After the death of Heraclius in 1798, he opposed the accession of his half-brother George XII and the new king's renewed quest for Russian protection. After the Russian annexation of Georgia in 1801, Alexander fled the country and spent decades in a series of attempts to undermine the Russian control of his homeland. Eventually, Alexander's reliance on the Persian support and North Caucasian mercenaries deprived him of popular support. After his last major rebellion was defeated in 1812, Alexander permanently settled in Persia, where he died in obscurity in 1844.\n\nParagraph 2: Problems with the management of Washington Harbour first became public on October 27, 1987, when the complex's lead restaurant, Warner LeRoy's high-priced and luxurious Potomac, closed without warning. The Washington Post, quoting unnamed restaurant industry sources, said Potomac offered mediocre food at a high price, spent too much constructing the restaurant, was too large, and did not turn over diners fast enough. But LeRoy blamed Western Development, saying that tenant fees skyrocketed to $300,000 a year from $45,000 a year, trash collection was poor, landscaping was incomplete, fire alarms rang when there was no fire, management did not complete a covered walkway from the parking lot to the entrance, and the plumbing was poor. LeRoy further claimed that he spent $1 million on legal fees fighting Western Development (which managed the property). The Post quoted another unnamed restaurant owner in the building who agreed that Western Development was \"a pain\" to deal with. (A lawsuit filed by LeRoy against Western Development was settled out of court in November 1987.) By the end of October, other anonymous retail and office tenants were complaining to The Washington Post that they, too, encountered high unexpected costs and that Western Development was unresponsive to their complaints about physical plant problems. Several condominium owners in the complex also complained of rising costs, which included charges to cover real estate tax increases, fees for routine janitorial services (such as trash collection, sidewalk cleaning, and window washing), and parking garage charges. Some unidentified tenants also claimed they were misled about the project's operating costs, learning only too late that they did not cover all operating costs nor the real estate taxes; that space was often not finished until six months after the delivery date; that construction errors were not corrected; and that on-site employment (which retailers depended on for sales projections) would be 2,500 people but ended up being only 1,200 people (even though 85 percent of the complex was leased). The Washington Post quoted an unnamed industry source, who said Western \"mistreated tenants\" and \"had no regard for their needs\". But other tenants, such as Arthur Young & Co., Holcomb & Co., and Tony & Joe's said they were satisfied with Western Development's management of Washington Harbour. Western Development blamed the District government for rising costs, claiming the city had doubled the real estate tax on the complex in the past year. The rising operating fees caused the Hays Harmon gift shop to close and the owner of Cafe Rose to attempt to sell the business.\n\nParagraph 3: On August 26, Maj. Gen. Stonewall Jackson led his corps of the Army of Northern Virginia through Thoroughfare Gap, on his way to raiding the Union supply depot at the Manassas Junction. In response to the raid, the following day Union Maj. Gen. Irwin McDowell set out from Warrenton to Manassas Junction to engage Jackson. In order to protect his army's left flank, he dispatched Brig. Gen. James B. Ricketts's brigade and the 1st New Jersey Cavalry under Sir Percy Wyndham towards the Gap. Ricketts stopped at Gainesville,  to the east, while Wyndham occupied the gap. Maj. Gen. James Longstreet's corps, meanwhile, followed in the path of Jackson's march and was approaching the gap from the west late on the evening of August 27.\n\nParagraph 4: Problems with the management of Washington Harbour first became public on October 27, 1987, when the complex's lead restaurant, Warner LeRoy's high-priced and luxurious Potomac, closed without warning. The Washington Post, quoting unnamed restaurant industry sources, said Potomac offered mediocre food at a high price, spent too much constructing the restaurant, was too large, and did not turn over diners fast enough. But LeRoy blamed Western Development, saying that tenant fees skyrocketed to $300,000 a year from $45,000 a year, trash collection was poor, landscaping was incomplete, fire alarms rang when there was no fire, management did not complete a covered walkway from the parking lot to the entrance, and the plumbing was poor. LeRoy further claimed that he spent $1 million on legal fees fighting Western Development (which managed the property). The Post quoted another unnamed restaurant owner in the building who agreed that Western Development was \"a pain\" to deal with. (A lawsuit filed by LeRoy against Western Development was settled out of court in November 1987.) By the end of October, other anonymous retail and office tenants were complaining to The Washington Post that they, too, encountered high unexpected costs and that Western Development was unresponsive to their complaints about physical plant problems. Several condominium owners in the complex also complained of rising costs, which included charges to cover real estate tax increases, fees for routine janitorial services (such as trash collection, sidewalk cleaning, and window washing), and parking garage charges. Some unidentified tenants also claimed they were misled about the project's operating costs, learning only too late that they did not cover all operating costs nor the real estate taxes; that space was often not finished until six months after the delivery date; that construction errors were not corrected; and that on-site employment (which retailers depended on for sales projections) would be 2,500 people but ended up being only 1,200 people (even though 85 percent of the complex was leased). The Washington Post quoted an unnamed industry source, who said Western \"mistreated tenants\" and \"had no regard for their needs\". But other tenants, such as Arthur Young & Co., Holcomb & Co., and Tony & Joe's said they were satisfied with Western Development's management of Washington Harbour. Western Development blamed the District government for rising costs, claiming the city had doubled the real estate tax on the complex in the past year. The rising operating fees caused the Hays Harmon gift shop to close and the owner of Cafe Rose to attempt to sell the business.\n\nParagraph 5: On August 26, Maj. Gen.

Construction commenced in May 1982. The station was built under two interfacing construction contracts. The 7.6-metre-diameter station tunnels (which contain the platforms) were built by Nishimatsu Construction, a Japanese contractor, under particularly difficult geological conditions. The off-street station concourse was constructed by a joint venture formed by Gammon Construction, Kier, and a now-defunct Scottish contractor called Lilley. The concourse was constructed within diaphragm walls from the top down, and was designed to support a new Urban Council complex and residential estate (called Felicity Garden) above it.\n\nParagraph 7: On August 26, Maj.

It has an ending that comes not only as a complete surprise — which would be easy enough — but that also pulls everything together in a new way, one we hadn't thought of before, one that's almost unbearably poignant.\" Ebert ranked Night Moves at No. 2 on his year-end list of the best films of 1975, behind only Nashville. Vincent Canby of The New York Times wrote that he had \"mixed feelings\" about the film, elaborating that the characters \"seem to deserve better than the quality of the narrative given them. I can't figure out whether the screenplay by Alan Sharp was worked on too much or not enough, or whether Mr. Penn and his actors accepted the screenplay with more respect than it deserves.\" Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune gave the film three stars out of four and stated that the protagonist is the \"kind of mixed-up character\" that \"seems to be Hackman's specialty\", while Alan Sharp's screenplay \"provides the character of Paula (Jennifer Warren) with some of the best scripting for any woman this year\". Arthur D. Murphy of Variety called the film \"a paradox. A suspenseless suspenser, very well cast with players who lend sustained interest to largely theatrical characters ... There's little rhyme or reason for the plot's progression, and the climax is far from stunning. But the curious aspect about the Warner Bros. release is that it plays well.\" Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times described the film as \"a stunning, stylish detective mystery in the classic Raymond Chandler-Ross Macdonald mold,\" as well as \"a fast, often funny movie with lots of compassionately observed real, living, breathing people. This handsome Warners presentation is still another triumph for ever-busy, ever-versatile Gene Hackman, director Arthur Penn and writer Alan Sharp.\" Gary Arnold of The Washington Post was negative, stating, \"The fatal weakness is Alan Sharp's screenplay, a pointlessly murky, ambiguous variation on conventional private-eye themes ... we're supposed to be so impressed by the dolorous, world-weary tone that we overlook some pretty awesome loopholes and absurdities in the story itself, which never generates much mystery, suspense or credible human interest.\"\n\nParagraph 9: During the construction of a road in 1961, an ancient burial complex was discovered in the eastern part of the site. An archaeological expedition by the Israel Antiquities Authority led by Joseph Naveh (1928-2011) of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem found two Iron Age II multi-chamber burial caves. One cave consisted of three chambers cut into the chalky limestone. Eight skeletons lay on limestone ledges around the sides of the chambers, untouched since being laid to rest. A ring, a bronze earring and a bronze plaque were also found in the cave, which contained carved drawings and inscriptions. Three of the drawings were of human figures: a man holding what might be a lyre, a man raising his arms, possibly in a prayer gesture, and a man wearing a headdress. Two sailing vessels were sketched on another wall. Two other figures may be an encampment and a tent. The ships lead scholars to believe that the chambers were reused by Israelite refugees fleeing the Chaldaean armies in the sixth century BCE, probably Levites. Ships are a common motif in ancient Near Eastern burial chambers. The other cave had been looted at some point, and analysis revealed that the interred individuals belonged to a group of different origin than the first group.\n\nParagraph 10: The site of the present-day station concourse was home to the old Sai Wan Ho Market, operated by the Urban Council, which was demolished to make way for the MTR station.

This place is also revered as the mystical land of Shambhala by Tibetans. According to another tradition, the Siddhashrama is located in the Tibetan region, nearby Kailash parvat. Though any Sadhu, Sannyasi, Yeti, Monk and Yogi might have known 'Siddhashram' by any name or various cults might have used different worship or Sadhana methods according to their beliefs.The context of this supernatural land has been mentioned in many ancient scriptures along with four Vedas. The Siddhashram is described as a divine place in spiritual journey. Thus it is also believed that while discharging their divine works in this universe the spiritually empowered Yogis remain in constant touch with Siddhashram and they visit it regularly. Siddhashram is considered as the base of spiritual consciousness, heart of divinity and the mortification land of great Rishis. Thus, the Siddhashram is assumed as a very scarce divine place. It's believed by Hindus, Buddhists that it is possible to get the divine power to enter this scarce place by doing hard works through Sadhana procedure and following Sadhana path. Siddhashram is considered to be a secret and mystical land deep in the Himalayas, where it is said and is believed by Hindus that great siddha yogis, sadhus, and sages live. Siddhashram is believed to be the ashram of Ancient saints, sages & Yogis of high order. It is referred to in many Indian epics, the Veda, Upanishads and Puranas including the Rigveda, one of the oldest scripture of human civilization. Siddhashram is considered to be the society for the enlightened people or siddhas. The person, who reaches high level in sadhana can reach the mystical siddhashram with the blessings of the guru, who is the regular of this place, as considered by believers. Its believed that this ashram lies near the Mansarovar lake and the Kailash.

Many Siddha yogi, yoginis, Apsara (Angel), saints are believed to be found meditating in this place. Those who allegedly went there say that the beautiful flowers in the garden, trees, birds, siddha-yoga lake, meditating saints and many other things of the place cannot be described in words. The exact location of this legendary kingdom is unknown as it is believed that Gyanganj artfully camouflages (willingly hides itself) itself from humans, as well as mapping technologies.

Rajiv is smitten by her and manages to woo her with the help of his friend Rocky. Meanwhile, Mambo and Payal become close, Mambo tries to cheer her up and always be with her. Payal still cares a lot for Rajiv and is silently hurt at seeing Alisha and Rajiv together. Nevertheless, she continues to talk to Rajiv and wishes him a happy birthday. Rajiv is taken aback because Payal and not Alisha bothered to wish him first, as Alisha is busy with her modeling shoot. Rajiv starts noticing that Payal and Mambo are coming close, which concerns him a lot. Rajiv is surprised to find Payal at his birthday party in a pub. Payal gets emotional and tells him she now thinks that her views about love were wrong, and that is why Rajiv is so happy with Alisha, something which was not with Payal. Mambo and Rajiv come to blows because of Payal, and Alisha slowly starts disliking Payal. The final straw is when Alisha sees Rajiv and Payal talking, and she learns from a mutual friend that they were together before she entered the college. She confronts Payal, behaves rudely with her, and accuses her of stealing her boyfriend. Mambo tries to defend Payal, and Alisha puts him off, which infuriates him. Rajiv and Mambo get into a big fight. Alisha and Rajiv leave with everyone accusing him of fighting with his friends. At Alisha's flat, Rajiv cannot think of anything else but how Payal loved him and let her go, and how after their break up, she still cared for him and the recent fight. Alisha gets insecure and keeps asking him to profess his love. He, imagining Alisha to be Payal, hugs her and says, \"I love you, Payal.\"\n\nParagraph 3: The Outfit rose to power in the 1920s under the control of Johnny Torrio and Al Capone, and the period was marked by bloody gang wars for control of the distribution of illegal alcohol during Prohibition.

At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted mean rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 63, based on eight reviews, which indicates \"generally favorable reviews\". The New York Times was very positive about Own the Night and wrote this third album \"elevates this group's fecklessness to high art. It makes no apologies for its blunt-force tactics. It owns its shamelessness. That cocksure stance helps to make it one of the most convincing albums of the year, a huge leap forward for a group that threatened to become famous without leaving a true mark.\" Giving it a four stars rating out of five, Country Weekly Jessica Phillips appreciated that \"For the most part, Lady Antebellum strikes a nice balance between the two -creating something different while replicating some elements of the previous album, keeping the penchant for bighearted ballads and the vocal chemistry between Charles Kelley and Hillary Scott intact\". Billy Dukes of Taste of Country gave the album a 3.5 stars out of 5 commenting \"In an effort to break new ground on their just released album, Own the Night,  Lady Antebellum occasionally forget their strengths and weaknesses. Not every courageous step they take lands on solid ground, but it’s difficult to criticize a band for taking artistic chances.\" Entertainment Weekly gave the album a \"B\" grade commenting \"With their easy pop-country tempos and ingratiating white-soul harmonies, Charles Kelley, Hillary Scott, and Dave Haywood are masters of the soft sell, an approach they employ here with characteristically genteel results.\" Randy Lewis of The Los Angeles Times found that \"everything sounds bigger, brighter and shinier than on Lady A's first two albums. That'll probably go over well with fans of grandiose country pop\" but he noted that \"the all-stops-out production gradually loses impact.\" However, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic was less enthusiastic about the album. He gave it a three stars rating and described it as \"mood music but the aim isn't amorous; it's nothing more than a spot of relaxation, which doesn't quite amount to compelling listening no matter how immaculate the execution.\" American Songwriter found Own the Night not \"high art\" and despised the \"clichéd country images\" but did appreciate the singing \"with the band stacking its harmonies three voices deep at every twist and turn\" and that's why the album received a three stars rating. Nevertheless, Rolling Stone Will Hermes was not convinced by the new album and gave it a two stars rating out of five. Jonathan Keefe of Slant Magazine negatively reviewed Own the Night: \"In the past, the trio has been able to elevate their unremarkable songwriting with spirited performances, but that isn't the case on Own the Night\". He found the band \"across-the-board amateurish and anonymous\".\n\nParagraph 9: The Outfit rose to power in the 1920s under the control of Johnny Torrio and Al Capone, and the period was marked by bloody gang wars for control of the distribution of illegal alcohol during Prohibition.

The most prominent of them was the Chutiya rulers who held the areas of the present district for long, until the outbreak of the Ahom-Chutiya conflict in the 16th century and eventually the area came under the rule of the Ahom dynasty. The Ahoms created a new position called Bhatialia Gohain to control the region. The area was later given by Ahoms to the Baro-Bhuyans to rule like feudal lords, as they had helped defeat the Chutiya and Kachari kingdoms. There was a Chutia principality formed by the king Lakshminarayan in the start of the 15th century upon which the district has been named. The copperplate inscription of a land grant given by the Chutia king in the year 1403 CE in the west of the Subansiri river as well as the ruins between Dhal and Ghagar rivers (near present-day North Lakhimpur town) shows the evidence of the settlement. The Burmese, who had ruined the native kingdoms, at the end of the 18th century, was in 1826 expelled by the British under the Treaty of Yandabo. They placed the southern part of the state, together with Sivasagar under the rule of Purandar Singha; but it was not till 1838 that the whole was taken under direct British Administration.\n\nParagraph 3: On July 25, 2010, it was announced that Toyota would make her first wrestling appearance in the United States, wrestling for the Chikara promotion in September.

The following day in Brooklyn, New York, Toyota and Mike Quackenbush defeated the Bruderschaft des Kreuzes (Claudio Castagnoli and Sara Del Rey) in a tag team match. On February 10, 2011, Chikara announced that Toyota would be returning to the promotion in April to take part in the 2011 King of Trios tournament, where she would team up with Jigsaw and Mike Quackenbush. On April 15, Toyota, Jigsaw and Quackenbush defeated Amazing Red, Joel Maximo and Wil Maximo in their first round match in the 2011 King of Trios. The following day, Toyota, Jigsaw and Quackenbush were eliminated from the tournament by Team Michinoku Pro (Dick Togo, Great Sasuke and Jinsei Shinzaki).

The most prominent of them was the Chutiya rulers who held the areas of the present district for long, until the outbreak of the Ahom-Chutiya conflict in the 16th century and eventually the area came under the rule of the Ahom dynasty. The Ahoms created a new position called Bhatialia Gohain to control the region. The area was later given by Ahoms to the Baro-Bhuyans to rule like feudal lords, as they had helped defeat the Chutiya and Kachari kingdoms. There was a Chutia principality formed by the king Lakshminarayan in the start of the 15th century upon which the district has been named. The copperplate inscription of a land grant given by the Chutia king in the year 1403 CE in the west of the Subansiri river as well as the ruins between Dhal and Ghagar rivers (near present-day North Lakhimpur town) shows the evidence of the settlement. The Burmese, who had ruined the native kingdoms, at the end of the 18th century, was in 1826 expelled by the British under the Treaty of Yandabo. They placed the southern part of the state, together with Sivasagar under the rule of Purandar Singha; but it was not till 1838 that the whole was taken under direct British Administration.\n\nParagraph 5: The objectives of the RDAs were set out in the Regional Economic Strategy (RES) of each region.  The RES was a document created and maintained by the RDA for the whole region, i.e. it was not simply a document to guide the RDA, it was intended to guide the work of other organisations also.  Each RDA updated their RES on a regular basis (approximately every three years) by consulting widely with their partners, and stakeholders in the region, including local government, voluntary organisations, private organisations, and other interested groups. The RES was submitted to the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills for formal approval.\n\nParagraph 6: Lakhimpur figures largely in the annals of Assam as the region where tribes from the east first reached the Brahmaputra.

The following day in Brooklyn, New York, Toyota and Mike Quackenbush defeated the Bruderschaft des Kreuzes (Claudio Castagnoli and Sara Del Rey) in a tag team match. On February 10, 2011, Chikara announced that Toyota would be returning to the promotion in April to take part in the 2011 King of Trios tournament, where she would team up with Jigsaw and Mike Quackenbush. On April 15, Toyota, Jigsaw and Quackenbush defeated Amazing Red, Joel Maximo and Wil Maximo in their first round match in the 2011 King of Trios. The following day, Toyota, Jigsaw and Quackenbush were eliminated from the tournament by Team Michinoku Pro (Dick Togo, Great Sasuke and Jinsei Shinzaki).

When Sylvia's lesson is over Julia tells her to go play and take her new doll with her but Sylvia says that she lost it. While going out with Carlos and Eugenio, Marina is driving and feels a strong pain in her wrist causing her to almost crash the car. That evening the adults hear Yago whimpering in pain and go outside to check him but Julia stays inside and go to check on Sylvia who is already in bed but instead finds her looking out the window. Julia asked Sylvia what she's doing and Sylvia turns around with a smirk on her face and tells Julia that the dog is dead. Unable to explain Yago's death they bury him in the yard the next day. As Julia is brushing Sylvia's hair she talks to her about the importance of going to school and reading but Sylvia says that those things aren't necessary because Hugo has knows everything thanks to a book about black magic. She also tells Julia that Hugo was the son of a black magic sorcerer who before dying learned of a way to revive after a thousand years but he had to make sure that his son would take care of the book until his revival so he made hugo hold the book and turned him into stone. Marina then starts having a strong pain in her leg so Eugenio takes her to their room and call a doctor. While Mariana is getting medical attention Julia tells Eugenio and Carlos what Sylvia said about Hugo but Eugenio still believes she is mentally ill and is repeating something she heard. The doctor tells Eugenio that Mariana's leg is better but now she has a headache. Mariana tells Eugenio that she feels threatened by something sinister and spiritual and that she can't stop thinking of Hugo. While Carlos is painting a portrait of Hugo's statue, the statue disappears frightening him. He runs away and is then frightened by Sylvia who ask him why he was painting Hugo. They walk back to the statue and it is again in its place but Sylvia get angry at Carlos saying he ruined her fun. He goes back to painting and Julia compliments his painting before going to look for Sylvia but instead finds Sylvia's doll hung up in the courtyard with needles stuck in the same parts where Mariana felt the pain. She shows the doll to Carlos and they decide that instead of telling Eugenio they want to talk to Sylvia. In her next lesson Sylvia sees the doll and is frightened by it claiming she doesn't want it anymore.\n\nParagraph 11: Lakhimpur figures largely in the annals of Assam as the region where tribes from the east first reached the Brahmaputra.

I knew no other condition, I doubted not that the world was all friendly. But when I was torn from the companions of my childhood, and removed to a distance from kindred and home, and placed among strangers, I found, to my sad disappointment, that I was of little consequence to the world around me, and that none but myself cared for my comfort and welfare. Then it was that I learned to value the joys, and thousand social endearments of home. Then it was, that I learned duly to estimate the consolation which springs from the mature sympathy of school-fellows. Then, and not till then, did I know what it was to want a friend to smooth down the bed of sickness…  For it is a law of nature, that we know not the worth of our enjoyments, until the time arrives when they are to be interrupted. Then, and not till then, do we feel the wants of them…   I want you to reflect upon the many happy hours you have here enjoyed, that you may, in after years, when surrounded, perhaps with disease, and danger, and death, receive comfort and consolation by the retrospection.  It will be so delightful, yet so deeply affecting, when old age is upon you, to tell over the scenes and the frolics of your school-boy days! I have been acquainted with many village schools, but none did I ever witness so much mutual good will, so great manifestations of true and sincere friendship, as I have witnessed in this. You have always seemed to me, to constitute one great Family; and I have often thought you are indeed a band of Brothers and Sisters! For my own part, having spent two winters with you, I am, and shall always be ready to bear testimony to your depth of sympathy and kindly feeling as friends, and your faithfulness and diligence as scholars. During the last winter, my attention was so strongly attracted by these qualities, and by the kindness with which I was uniformly treated, that I formed an attachment to you, which not ever time, but death alone can sever… And am I no more to have my ears greeted with the endearing title of Master? - a title which has always suggested to my mind, so many pleasing emotions!  … Be assured, I shall not forget you.\"", "answers": ["2"], "length": 3849, "dataset": "passage_count_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "a7a94aecaea08f0d2799fe3ca3af73a9fc5317a7860d7909"}
{"input": "", "context": "Paragraph 1: The late Lippy Espinda, a used car salesman and Oahu-based entertainer, has also been named as a possible creator of the shaka. Espinda, who frequently appeared as an extra in Hawaii Five-O as well as The Brady Bunch episodes shot in Hawaii, used the term and the sign during his television ads in the '60s. Though the claim that he is the originator of the shaka sign is debatable, he is credited with increasing its popularity and that of Hawaiian Pidgin as well. The shaka has achieved great popularity in Australia, primarily among teenagers on social media sites such as Instagram and Facebook.\n\nParagraph 2: In late 1943 the 2nd Panzer Division was sent to France for refitting after the heavy losses it suffered on the Eastern Front. The division was equipped with Panther tanks. Following the invasion of Normandy, the division was moved to Normandy in June 1944; it engaged British troops of the 50th Infantry Division and the 7th Armoured Division. From June 6 until mid July the division stood in the Caumont area engaged in daily skirmishes with British units. During Operation Epsom a group of six Panther tanks of the Pz.Rg.3 was used for a counterattack to take Cheux but that attack failed and five of their tanks were lost. Although the 2nd Panzer Division was very experienced the German doctrine overall was flawed and could not be exploited in Normandy. All German Panzer divisions in Normandy suffered severe defeats when counterattacking. The division was relieved at Caumont by the 326th Infantry Division and sent to the Verrières ridge southwest of Caen. During the Canadian Operation Spring a Kampfgruppe from the division (Kampfgruppe Sterz) was sent to reinforce the 272nd Infantry division at St. Andre sur Orne and St. Martin. The Kampfgruppe took St. Martin, destroying The Black Watch in the process and got involved in street fighting in St. Andre sur Orne. Kampfgruppe Zollhöfer of the 9th SS Panzer Division took over and struck towards Point 67. After Operation Spring 2nd Panzer was sent to the US sector to help in halting Operation Cobra. They could stop the drive of the US 2nd Armored for a moment but were too weak to cover the whole front. The division retreated and with its last 25 tanks it took part in Operation Luttich, the failed German counterattack at Mortain. It was later encircled in the Falaise pocket, but broke out with heavy losses in materiel and troops. At Falaise it was responsible for taking and holding St-Lambert-sur-Dive but was only able to take one part of the village. Nevertheless due to the efforts of the 2nd Panzer Division other German units, notably the 10th and the 12th SS, were able to cross the bridge over the Dives and escape eastwards. The division was reorganised in Germany, absorbing the depleted 352nd Infantry Division. Due to the shortage in materiel, the division's complement of tanks was significantly reduced. Some tank companies only had assault guns, although one battalion received Panther tanks.\n\nParagraph 3: Critical opinion regarding the film has been overwhelmingly positive. The Village Voice critic J. Hoberman, who in 1981 included the film in his list of the ten best films commercially released in the United States during that year, more recently wrote that the film is one \"of the richest avant-garde features of the 1970s\" and praised its \"winning combination of sexual frankness and visual wit,\" while another critic, Dennis Schwartz, wrote that the \"film's beauty is derived from its sexual frankness and playfully drawn out intimate relationship scenes, witty use of photography, and its originality as it breaks free of conventional unities of body, space and time. Export skillfully edits montage and integrates video, still photography, and performance art with elements from Cubism, Surrealism, Dada and avant-garde cinema.\" Artforum noted in November 1980 that \"[w]atching their scenes together, we realize how seldom, if ever before, the details of sexual intimacy have been shown in film from the point of view from a woman. Export privileges rupture over unity and never settles for one-dimensional solutions\" and it was called one \"of the most original films in this year's exposition\" and a \"tour de force of cinematic invention\" grounded in the director's \"fresh and intelligent sensibility, characteristically self-referential. Her visual resources include mirrors, still photography, video, dance, and films within the film, all employed with a bold and surprising inventiveness\" by the catalogue notes of the 1978 Los Angeles International Film Exposition. Similarly, critic Alison Butler wrote that the \"film is a witty and visually brilliant essay on gender and experience, culture and environment\" and program notes used by the San Francisco Cinematheque during a screening quote critic Amy Taubin as opining that the film \"makes you reconsider what you and everyone else is doing – in life and in art\" and critic Steve Anker underscoring that it is an important \"crossover film\" combining \"avant-garde and theatrical sensibilities, made during the mid-1970s. It chronicles the nightmarish breakdown of a fashion photographer as she confronts her waning identity and security as a career woman; blending narrative experimentation, fantasy, fact and theoretical critique, it has enormous impact on independent features which followed it.\" PopMatters noted that the film has \"enough originality to nag at patient viewers and get at least partially under our skin\" and critic Michael Atkinson wrote that it is a \"weird, restless, beguilingly offbeat bit of dreamwork.\" The film was presented for the first time at the Berlin International Film Festival in 1977, it has won a Special Jury Prize at the Venice Film Festival and was recently called \"seminal\" during a screening at a repertory cinema, \"a strong and humoristic showdown\" at another and \"a sonically-complex, montage-rich, darkly funny and uriniferous cornerstone of avant-garde cinema\" during a screening at a New York University class. Critic Peter Hajek wrote in the Austrian newspaper Kurier that \"Valie Export presents this psychopanoptic view of the present in solid, striking images and often in unexpected humorous passages.\" Critic Chris Holmlund, author of the scholarly article \"Feminist Makeovers: The Celluloid Surgery of Valie Export and Su Friedrich,\" referred to Invisible Adversaries as a feminist version of Invasion of the Body Snatchers, noted that the film includes references to famous paintings and to Un Chien Andalou, and wrote that therefore it \"is visually rick, entertaining, striking, but also demanding.\" A few reviews, however, were negative. For example, London's Time Out wrote about the film that it is \"[n]ot unlike W.R.: Mysteries of the Organism\" and that it will \"probably age as badly\" and a reviewer for The Heights wrote that \"I was expecting a great feminist work here, but got mediocrity. I cannot recommend that you see this film,\" though he nevertheless praised the film as a \"cornucopia of video spectacle [in which] Export delights, confounds and amuses the audience with her antics.\"\n\nParagraph 4: In July 1952, Fred Trosko was hired as head football coach at Michigan State Normal College. Trosko had been a star college running back at Michigan under head coach Fritz Crisler. The team improved markedly during Trosko's early years as head coach. In his first seven seasons, the team attained a record of 41–19–2, including a 7–1–1 record in 1953 and an 8–1–0 record in 1954. His teams won Interstate Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (\"IIAC\") championships in 1954 and 1957. The team's success came to an abrupt end in 1959. Trosko's teams had a 29-game winless streak (0–27–2) starting with the third game of the 1959 season and continuing through the fifth game of the 1962 season.  The precipitous decline followed the decision of the Eastern Michigan administration not to follow an IIAC policy that allowed member schools to award scholarships. Competing with non-scholarship athletes against conference schools with scholarship athletes, Trosko's Eastern Michigan teams were unable to compete.  In August 1965, Trosko announced his resignation as the school's head football coach, and it was reported that the resignation was the result of \"an apparent break with school administrators over policy.\" Trosko had the second longest tenure of any head coach at the school.  He also taught at Eastern Michigan and remained on the faculty at Eastern Michigan after retiring as football coach.  He ultimately retired in 1981 as a professor emeritus.  In 1982, he was inducted into the Eastern Michigan Sports Hall of Fame. Jerry Raymond was the head football coach of the Hurons for the 1965 and 1966 seasons, and his coaching record at the school was 8 wins, 7 losses and 2 ties. As of the conclusion of the 2010 season, this ranks him No. 12 at Eastern Michigan in total wins and No. 13 at the school in winning percentage ().\n\nParagraph 5: In line with his understanding of the Akshar Purushottam Upasana, Gunatitanand Swami continued discoursing around Gujarat and along with his primary spiritual mission, helped initiate various social reforms throughout the region. In 1826, along with other prominent paramhansas, he laid the foundation stone of the Junagadh mandir. As one of the earliest Swaminarayan mandirs in the region, the mandir at Junagadh would go on to become a prominent center of learning and spiritual pilgrimage. Taking into account the socio-religious landscape of Junagadh, Swaminarayan decided to appoint Gunatitanand Swami as the mahant (religious and administrative head) due to his leadership abilities and experience. Gunatitanand Swami played a significant role in shaping the administration of Junagadh Mandir. His emphasis on listening to spiritual discourses and attaining spiritual knowledge became de rigueur for all aspirants. Furthermore, he encouraged devotional service as a means of putting the theory of the discourses into practice and insisted that everyone, regardless of social standing, engage in service. For many decades, even into his old age, Gunatitanand Swami would perform the menial task of sweeping the mandir courtyard himself despite being the head of the temple. Gunatitanand Swami served as the Mahant of Junagadh mandir for 40 years. It was during this time that Gunatitanand Swami met Pragji Bhakta, or Bhagatji Maharaj as he became known, regarded by the BAPS as his successor, . While Bhagatji Maharaj had initially served under Gopalanand Swami, he accepted Gunatitanand Swami as his guru after Gopalanand Swami told him that true liberation would only be possible through the Jogi of Junagadh (a reference to Gunatitanand Swami). Over a period of time, Bhagatji Maharaj's nuanced understanding and absolute realization of Gunatitanand Swami’s teachings, in particular the Akshar Purushottam Upasana became apparent to all. Furthermore his renunciation of worldly desires and strong adherence to the principles of ekantik dharma were a pivotal component of his relationship with Gunatitanand Swami who referred to him as \"someone who has profound faith and spiritual zeal\". According to the BAPS, Gunatitanand Swami would eventually install Bhagatji Maharaj as his successor and would often tell devotees that \"I have now handed over the key to Akshardham to Bhagatji Maharaj.”\n\nParagraph 6: Al Cohn - Al Haig - Alan Skidmore - Alec Dankworth - Andrew Cleyndert - Anita O’Day - Anita Wardell - Art Farmer - Arturo Sandoval - Barbara Dennerlein - Barney Kessel - Benn Clatworthy - Benny Carter - Benny Goodman - Bill Holman - Bill Perkins - Bill Watrous - Bobby Hutcherson - Bobby Shew - Bobby Wellins - Bob Wilber - Bosko Petrovic - Buddy Childers - Buddy DeFranco - Bud Shank - Carmen McRae - Charles McPherson - Charlie Mariano - Chet Baker - Chico Freeman - Chucho Valdes - Clark Terry - Conte Candoli - Count Basie - Dame Kiri Te Kanawa - Dave Green - David Gazarov - David Mowatt - Davide Petrocca - Dexter Gordon - Dick Morrissey - Dizzy Gillespie - Eddie Daniels - Eddie \"Lockjaw\" Davis - Ella Fitzgerald - Frank Rosolino - Frank Wess - Freddy Hubbard - Gareth Williams - Gene Harris - George Coleman - Georgie Fame - Gil Evans - Hank Jones - Harold Land - Harry \"Sweets\" Edison - Herb Ellis - James Moody - James Morrison - Jean Alain Roussel - Jim Hart - Jim Mullen - Jimmy Smith - Jimmy Witherspoon - J.J.

Powerful, innovative Puerto Rican leaders including Luis Muñoz Rivera, José de Diego, Rosendo Matienzo Cintrón, Manuel Zeno Gandía, Luis Lloréns Torres, Eugenio Benítez Castaño, and Pedro Franceschi contributed to the rise of multiple successful political parties. However, the birth of multiple political groups led to a diversion of the island's interests: uniting as a statehood with the US, becoming a US territory commonwealth, or declaring independence altogether. In 1900, the  was formed during the US military rule of the island after the Spanish–American War. It was formed by Luis Munoz Rivera and other members of the Autonomist Party. The  favored immediate transformation of Puerto Rico into an organized unincorporated territory and eventually join US statehood. The  were founded by Santiago Iglesias Pantin. Over time the  was also in favor of statehood with the US. The  campaigned for assimilation into the United States and wanted to develop prosperously with their best interests under the new US administration. They wanted to fully integrate US law and government. Their plan was to become a territory and have representation through a delegate and eventually become a US state with no restrictions. The  did not advocate for independence. Instead party leader, Santiago Iglesias Pantin, advocated for statehood and change in economic policies which were influenced by his practice in founding the Federación Regional de Trabajadores (Regional Workers Federation) and labor newspaper Ensayo Obrero. The party was based on the principles of the Socialist Labor Party of America and received much support from American colonial authorities. After the dissolution of the Federal Party, Luis Muñoz Rivera and José de Diego founded the  in 1904. The Unionist Party of Puerto Rico aimed to secure “the right of Puerto Rico to assert its own personality, either through statehood or independence.” The beginning of the , the independence party, was in 1909. Rosendo Matienzo Cintrón, Manuel Zeno Gandía, Luis Lloréns Torres, Eugenio Benítez Castaño, and Pedro Franceschi founded the party which was the first political party whose agenda was the independence of Puerto Rico. Another change occurred during the year the party was founded. The Olmsted Amendment changed the Foraker Act, which was designed to switch the Puerto Rican government from a military one to a government ran by the civilians. Instead, the Olmsted act called for the government to be managed solely under the executive branch.\n\nParagraph 4: The château is located on the west side of the Canal de Caen à la Mer, on the southeast edge of the town of Bénouville, and just southwest of the Pegasus Bridge, made memorable on D-Day. During World War II the château/maternity hospital was run since 1935 by Madame Lea Vion surnamed 'la comtesse', director (from 1947-1953 she was even mayor of Benouville) who also led a resistance group of the GMO belonging to the réseau 'Centurie'. The maternity hospital became a hearth of resistance for the region. Fugitive Allied pilots and French youth unwilling to work for the Germans found a safe haven here. Weapons and a maquis-wireless transmitter were hidden here. Vion  was in frequent contact with resistance activists Leonard Gille, Rene Duchez and Henri Leveille. One of her informants was Georges Gondrée, the café owner near the bridge over the Caen Canal, who secretly collected information on German defences there for the benefit of D Company 2nd Ox and Bucks under Major John Howard who would storm the bridge successfully in the night before D-Day. Via Madame Vion this important information from Gondree was sent through to England. On D-Day morning soldier Wally Parr, a sniper from the Ox and Bucks, fired some rounds from a German 5 cm. anti tank-gun towards and over the château, because he erroneously thought German snipers to be present upon the roof of the building after he had seen 'something flickering'(most probably the fieldbinoculars of an observing  German Lieutenant). Major Howard made him stop this dangerous activity. Howard told Parr there were women in labour inside the chateau. At this very same moment, however, German Lieutenant Hans Hoeller, artillery officer from 8. Kompanie (Schwere Waffen), 192. Panzergrenadierregiment, Kampfgruppe Rauch, 21st Panzerdivision was standing on top of the château together with a sergeant and soldier in order to observe the canal bridge. Earlier Hans Hoeller had frustratingly found that his anti-tank troop could not pass through Benouville, because of too heavy resistance from British parachutists belonging to A Company, 7th Para Battalion under command of Nigel Taylor. He sought a suitable place to set up his batteries. Madame Vion had tried in vain to stop Lt. Hoeller from entering the \"chateau\". Hoeller and his colleagues were subsequently forced by Wally Parr's shelling to retreat downstairs immediately before opening their own fire on the Ox and Bucks defending the canal bridge nearby.\n\nParagraph 5: Jackson jokingly considered it a \"national anthem for the Nineties\", leading her to develop Rhythm Nation 1814, titled after the year \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" was written.

In November that year she was promoted to Komsomol organizer of the 426th Infantry Regiment, which she served with for the remainder of her life. On 23 June 1944 her unit fought in the battle for Kireevo village in Vitebsk, where they had to crawl down when they approached an anti-tank ditch, where they came under intense machine-gun fire from nearby enemy bunkers. There, she became the first soldier to climb up a ladder from the ditch, telling her subordinates to follow her, and proceeded to attack the enemy machine-gun nest with a grenade, but was killed by machine-gun fire in the process.

After the attack she flagged down another vehicle passing by, and had the wounded soldiers transferred to that car and sent to Kalinin, where she was treated in the hospital for her injuries.

Starting off as a clerk in the headquarters of the 31st Army, she went on to become a political instructor at a field hospital before eventually getting a post on the front lines in March 1943 as the deputy commander for political affairs of the 221st Separate Communications Company; she was admitted to the Communist Party in 1942. While crossing the Vopets River in May 1943 she fell behind from the rest of her unit and lost her bearings; nevertheless, she crossed the river alone and was eventually able to establish communications.

{"input": "", "context": "Paragraph 1: Trenton Webb reviewed Requiem: Grim Harvest for Arcane magazine, rating it a 7 out of 10 overall. Requiem: Grim Harvest is a boxed set containing three booklets: Death Triumphant, Necropolis and Requiem. Death Triumphant is the conclusion of the Grim Harvest campaign in which the player characters battle against Azalin, the Lich lord of Darkon. Necropolis is a geographical guide to the land where Death Triumphant is set. Requiem extrapolates from the party's position at the end of the campaign to create its own sub-game system. He quotes the George Romero zombie film line \"when Hell is full the dead will walk the earth\" and notes that with this \"This rather functional, if wonderfully horrific, philosophy [...] Requiem: Grim Harvest enables Ravenlofters to experience a world in which something spookily similar is occurring. And it's not very nice. Good fun, certainly, but not very nice.\" Webb comments that \"This three-book boxed set – Death Triumphant, Necropolis and Requiem - is an odd mix\" and notes that the Necropolis book would be useful \"so that after the adventure has run its (un)natural course the party can continue to romp around this most gothic of countries\", while \"Requiem, is a truly queer fish [...] and it is breathtakingly different.\" He comments on the adventure itself: \"As the final installment of the trilogy, Death Triumphant really delivers. Picking up the pace from the slightly more sedate second episode, the players are instantly thrown into conflict with the most powerful denizens of Ravenloft as they race against the clock to avert an apocalypse. With a heart-stopping (quite literally) midsection and an exciting closing chase, this adventure is a frantic and fitting climax to a truly excellent series.\" Webb comments that \"Necropolis is a good guide, crammed with fine and highly transportable adventure seeds. So even if you never run another Darkon adventure, you'll be able to plunder a few fine ideas and characters for other Ravenloft campaigns. The best of these being the absolutely ghastly Maggot Golem, which is pure Clive Barker and should definitely be used to turn players' stomachs the length and breadth of the land immediately.\" He comments that \"Requiem, however, presents many problems - not the least of which is that the sub-system evolves out of Death Triumphant'''s climax, and so by describing its basis the adventure's shocking twist would be ruined. Essentially, Requiem inverts one of the basic tenets of AD&D game mechanics with dramatic effects. The resultant system is elegant and well executed, although it does feel a little clinical and contrived at times. It would make an ideal holiday game when you're looking for a quick hit adventure with some temporary characters, but otherwise this fine design exercise doesn't really have the legs for long-term play.\" Webb concludes the review by saying \"The introduction of a boxed set at the endgame of a trilogy seems a little mercenary, especially when the first two episodes are so good that both players and referees will be desperate to see the campaign through to the end. But this climactic adventure is well worth the expense on its own. With the added benefit of some excellent adventure ideas in Necropolis and the curious Requiem system, you'd be mad not to inflict this most horrifying of sets on your players.\"\n\nParagraph 2: From 1882 through 1897 newspaper reports refer to this competition consistently as 'The Leinster Challenge Cup'. From 1898 through 2006, press reports refer to the competition as 'The Leinster Senior Cup'. How and why did this change in title come about? The change in reference title probably had more to do with semantics rather than any change(s) in the rules governing the competition. At a General Meeting of the Leinster Branch of the I.R.F.U. held in the Wicklow Hotel on 11 November 1888, a resolution was adopted to inaugurate a Leinster Junior Cup competition on the same basis as applied to the Leinster Challenge Cup. Following the Hon. Treasurer's report to the Annual General Meeting a month earlier, it had been proposed that the Leinster Branch purchase a 'Challenge Cup' for such competition. At the Leinster Branch A.G.M in October 1891, a motion that the 2nd XVs of Senior Clubs be allowed to compete in the Leinster Junior Cup was rejected. Essentially the same motion returned the Leinster Branch AGM in October 1895, but was amended to refer the matter to a subcommittee to draft rules to govern the proposed competition under which the latter might be approved and discussion adjourned to the next General Meeting. At the reconvened meeting in November 1895, delegates were informed that the original motion had been withdrawn because of intense opposition. The meeting then reconstituted itself as a special meeting to consider a new resolution \"that a Cup be presented by the Leinster Branch for competition amongst Second Fifteens of senior clubs on a league basis\". After much discussion and consideration of umpteen amendments and counter proposals, the final phrase of the original motion was amended to read \"amongst Junior Clubs and Second Fifteens of senior clubs on a league basis\". This was passed unanimously. Thus the Leinster Branch I.R.F.U. from the 1886-87 season now had a Leinster Junior Cup, the winners of which received a Challenge Cup, a Junior League Cup for Junior Clubs and the 2nd XVs of Senior Clubs, and a Leinster Challenge Cup, contested by Senior Clubs. Thus, to avoid confusion in reports of competitions, the Leinster Challenge Cup became referred to as the Leinster Senior Cup, the winners of which were presented with the original Challenge Cup.\n\nParagraph 3: Green vehicles can be powered by alternative fuels and advanced vehicle technologies and include hybrid electric vehicles, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, battery electric vehicles, compressed-air vehicles, hydrogen and fuel-cell vehicles, neat ethanol vehicles, flexible-fuel vehicles, natural gas vehicles, clean diesel vehicles, and some sources also include vehicles using blends of biodiesel and ethanol fuel or gasohol.

He is the son of Dante Innocenti, a blacksmith who owned two hardware stores and a small ironmongery (Ferramenta Innocenti) where Ferdinando used to work. In 1923, he moved to Rome with his brother to grow their sales and they found there a booming construction industry boosted by the rise of fascism. The brothers sold metal pipes and scaffolding kits. In 1931, Innocenti opened a large factory in Rome and diversified the company's ventures. At the dawn of World War II, his company was awarded important contracts by the Ministry of War. His factories manufactured 17% of Italy’s total wartime production.\n\nParagraph 6: Ferdinando Innocenti grew up in Grosseto.

After her death, Bagapsh changed tactics, urging his supporters to leave the parliament building, but then to remain outside, in a similar tactic to that used successfully in the Orange Revolution in Ukraine several weeks later. Bagapsh's supporters then detained two presidential guards over Shakryl's death, and brought them to the prosecutor's office. Security forces loyal to outgoing president Vladislav Ardzinba (Khadjimba's mentor) subsequently launched a raid on the prosecutor's office and freed the two men. However, this only exacerbated tension, and resulted in the decision of 2,000 police members to refuse to follow government orders. In many ways as a result of this crisis, Khadjimba backed down several weeks later, agreeing to run as Bagapsh's deputy in a re-vote.\n\nParagraph 8: The name Cold Ash dates from the 16th century and is mentioned in a 1549 deed of settlement from John Winchcombe to his third son, Henry. During the English Civil War, troops camped on Cold Ash Common before taking part in the Second Battle of Newbury. The area was largely unpopulated before 1800 and consisted of moorland, the oldest part of the village is believed to be Bucklebury Alley. By the end of the 19th century, there were four principal landowners in Cold Ash and a large number of small tenanted dairy farms.  Cold Ash Convalescent Home and Children's hospital was opened by a nurse, Agnes Maria Bowditch, in her home in Cold Ash in 1886. By 1901, the hospital had expanded to accommodate 20 patients and specialised in respiratory illness. The hospital closed in 1964 and was demolished, the cul-de-sac, Sewell Close, was built in its place.\n\nParagraph 9: Trenton Webb reviewed Requiem: Grim Harvest for Arcane magazine, rating it a 7 out of 10 overall.

{"input": "", "context": "Paragraph 1: A hoard of 65 silver coins from the reign of King Stephen was found in the Sedgley Park area in 1972. The Prestwich manor emerged in the Middle Ages and in 1212 was assessed as four oxgang of land held by Adam de Prestwich whose father, Robert held it in 1193. The lord of the manor held the advowson for the church. Another Adam de Prestwich settled the manors of Prestwich, Alkrington and Pendlebury on his son John in 1297 but remarried and in 1313 settled the same manors on Thomas de Prestwich, his son by second wife. Thomas de Prestwich had daughters, Margaret who became a nun at Seaton Priory in 1360, but left the convent to marry Robert de Holland, and Agnes who married John de Radcliffe but died childless in 1362. Thomas de Prestwich granted his manors to Richard de Radcliffe for life and after that the manor was held by Richard de Langley. In 1371 Robert de Holland claimed the manor as the right of his wife. Roger de Langley was a minor and ward of the Duke of Lancaster in 1372 when Robert de Holland and a troop of armed men took possession of the manor by force and retained it until 1389. The Langleys regained the manor after 1403.\n\nParagraph 2: When St. Ansgar, the Apostle of the North, went to Sweden in 829, the Swedes were still heathen and the country contained many sacrificial groves and temples for the worship of Germanic pagan idols. One of the most celebrated of the latter was the temple at Uppsala in what is now called Old Uppsala, the centre of idolatrous worship not only for Sweden but for all Scandinavia. Even after Christianity had spread through Sweden, heathen sacrifices were still maintained at Uppsala. The \"Bishops' Chronicle\", written by Adam of Bremen in the years 1072–76, says, \"The Swedes have a well-known heathen temple called Upsala\", and \"Every ninth year, moreover, a great feast is celebrated at Upsala, which is observed in common by all the provinces of Sweden. None is permitted to avoid participation in the feast ... More horrible than any punishment is that even those who have become Christians must purchase exemption from participation in the feast ... The sacrifices are made thus: Nine heads are offered for every living creature of the male sex. By the blood of these the gods are appeased. The bodies are hung up in a grove not far from the temple. Dogs and horses may be seen hanging close by human beings; a Christian told me he had seen seventy-two bodies hanging together.\"\n\nParagraph 3: In 1955, Franco was among a loose group of Leopoldville musicians that began working together under the auspices of the Loningisa studio; the group was known as Bana Loningisa (children of Loningisa).  In 1956, an original founding core of six of those musicians, with Franco as the sole guitarist, agreed to accept a regular, paid gig at the O.K. Bar, named after its owner, Oskar Kashama.  A few weeks later, needing a name for a contract, the band used OK Jazz, from the place it had begun (it has also been said that O.K. stood for Orchestre Kinois, or the band of Kinshasa), and they were \"baptized\" under that name at a June 6, 1956 show at the O.K. Bar.  While clarinetist Jean Serge Essous was the original leader of O.K. Jazz, Franco was a prolific songwriter; Essous called him a \"kind of genius\" for having written over a hundred songs in his notebooks at that time.  O.K. Jazz quickly became a rival to the leading established local band of that time, African Jazz under Joseph Kabasele. In December 1956, after some personnel changes, the new (and short-lived) lineup of O.K. Jazz released a rumba written by Franco' that would become the band's motto: \"On Entre O.K., On Sort K.O.\"\n\nParagraph 4: Honey and Billy's first attempt at getting married in June 2006 ends in disaster when Honey is admitted to hospital, due to food poisoning. They try again in July, but due to a series of unfortunate events — starting with a prank performed on Billy's stag night — the groom doesn't get to the ceremony on time. Their third attempt in September is arranged as a surprise by Peggy Mitchell (Barbara Windsor). Honey is heavily pregnant and goes into labour, during the ceremony. As Billy leans in for a kiss after they are pronounced husband and wife, Honey reveals that her waters have broken. Honey gives birth to a girl, Janet (named after Honey's mother), but her happiness is short-lived when she discovers that Janet has Down syndrome. Devastated, Honey rejects her baby, changing her name to Petal, as she does not have the \"perfect\" Janet she had wanted. Honey and Billy go to a support group for parents of children with Down syndrome, but this depresses Honey further. She breaks down and destroys Petal's nursery, admitting to Billy that she wants to put Petal up for adoption. Billy is against this and their relationship suffers as a result. Honey tries, but cannot accept her baby and at her lowest ebb, considers smothering Petal with a pillow, but cannot do it. Petal is fostered by Tony (Enzo Squillino, Jr.) and Kim Smith (Lorraine Arnold) in December 2006, but the next day, Dr. May Wright (Amanda Drew) tells Billy that Petal needs a heart operation. Billy arranges for Petal to be baptised in case she does not survive, and after reading a heartfelt letter from Billy to Petal, Honey decides to keep her daughter after all. She attends the baptism and informs the vicar that the baby's name is Janet.

The \"Bishops' Chronicle\", written by Adam of Bremen in the years 1072–76, says, \"The Swedes have a well-known heathen temple called Upsala\", and \"Every ninth year, moreover, a great feast is celebrated at Upsala, which is observed in common by all the provinces of Sweden. None is permitted to avoid participation in the feast ... More horrible than any punishment is that even those who have become Christians must purchase exemption from participation in the feast ... The sacrifices are made thus: Nine heads are offered for every living creature of the male sex. By the blood of these the gods are appeased. The bodies are hung up in a grove not far from the temple. Dogs and horses may be seen hanging close by human beings; a Christian told me he had seen seventy-two bodies hanging together.\"\n\nParagraph 7: A hoard of 65 silver coins from the reign of King Stephen was found in the Sedgley Park area in 1972. The Prestwich manor emerged in the Middle Ages and in 1212 was assessed as four oxgang of land held by Adam de Prestwich whose father, Robert held it in 1193. The lord of the manor held the advowson for the church. Another Adam de Prestwich settled the manors of Prestwich, Alkrington and Pendlebury on his son John in 1297 but remarried and in 1313 settled the same manors on Thomas de Prestwich, his son by second wife. Thomas de Prestwich had daughters, Margaret who became a nun at Seaton Priory in 1360, but left the convent to marry Robert de Holland, and Agnes who married John de Radcliffe but died childless in 1362. Thomas de Prestwich granted his manors to Richard de Radcliffe for life and after that the manor was held by Richard de Langley. In 1371 Robert de Holland claimed the manor as the right of his wife. Roger de Langley was a minor and ward of the Duke of Lancaster in 1372 when Robert de Holland and a troop of armed men took possession of the manor by force and retained it until 1389. The Langleys regained the manor after 1403.\n\nParagraph 8: When St. Ansgar, the Apostle of the North, went to Sweden in 829, the Swedes were still heathen and the country contained many sacrificial groves and temples for the worship of Germanic pagan idols.

In 1956, an original founding core of six of those musicians, with Franco as the sole guitarist, agreed to accept a regular, paid gig at the O.K. Bar, named after its owner, Oskar Kashama.  A few weeks later, needing a name for a contract, the band used OK Jazz, from the place it had begun (it has also been said that O.K. stood for Orchestre Kinois, or the band of Kinshasa), and they were \"baptized\" under that name at a June 6, 1956 show at the O.K. Bar.  While clarinetist Jean Serge Essous was the original leader of O.K. Jazz, Franco was a prolific songwriter; Essous called him a \"kind of genius\" for having written over a hundred songs in his notebooks at that time.  O.K. Jazz quickly became a rival to the leading established local band of that time, African Jazz under Joseph Kabasele. In December 1956, after some personnel changes, the new (and short-lived) lineup of O.K. Jazz released a rumba written by Franco' that would become the band's motto: \"On Entre O.K., On Sort K.O.\"\n\nParagraph 10: In 1955, Franco was among a loose group of Leopoldville musicians that began working together under the auspices of the Loningisa studio; the group was known as Bana Loningisa (children of Loningisa).

They try again in July, but due to a series of unfortunate events — starting with a prank performed on Billy's stag night — the groom doesn't get to the ceremony on time. Their third attempt in September is arranged as a surprise by Peggy Mitchell (Barbara Windsor). Honey is heavily pregnant and goes into labour, during the ceremony. As Billy leans in for a kiss after they are pronounced husband and wife, Honey reveals that her waters have broken. Honey gives birth to a girl, Janet (named after Honey's mother), but her happiness is short-lived when she discovers that Janet has Down syndrome. Devastated, Honey rejects her baby, changing her name to Petal, as she does not have the \"perfect\" Janet she had wanted. Honey and Billy go to a support group for parents of children with Down syndrome, but this depresses Honey further. She breaks down and destroys Petal's nursery, admitting to Billy that she wants to put Petal up for adoption. Billy is against this and their relationship suffers as a result. Honey tries, but cannot accept her baby and at her lowest ebb, considers smothering Petal with a pillow, but cannot do it. Petal is fostered by Tony (Enzo Squillino, Jr.) and Kim Smith (Lorraine Arnold) in December 2006, but the next day, Dr. May Wright (Amanda Drew) tells Billy that Petal needs a heart operation. Billy arranges for Petal to be baptised in case she does not survive, and after reading a heartfelt letter from Billy to Petal, Honey decides to keep her daughter after all. She attends the baptism and informs the vicar that the baby's name is Janet. Janet's operation is a success, and Honey begins to bond with her.\n\nParagraph 13: When St. Ansgar, the Apostle of the North, went to Sweden in 829, the Swedes were still heathen and the country contained many sacrificial groves and temples for the worship of Germanic pagan idols.

This reputation has been contributed by media appearances after his first victory at the 2004 European Championships and silver medal at the World Championships and short relationship with former Miss France, Lætitia Bléger. He later brought a lawsuit against Bléger for 40,000 Euros for insinuating that he was homosexual and that their relationship was arranged to hide this. Bléger and two magazines that published her allegations were ordered by a French court to pay a total of 17,000 Euros, and to publish the court ruling in one of the two magazines. Joubert was later involved with Italian figure skater Valentina Marchei but the relationship ended by 2009.\n\nParagraph 3: A constitutional amendment creating an initiative system was passed by the state legislature and approved by voters in 1914, and was inserted into the constitution in 1916, as the legislature was required to wait until its next regular session to insert ratified constitutional amendments. The state Supreme Court upheld the referendum system in 1917, but overturned it in 1922, making it the first time the court ruled a constitutional amendment unconstitutional. Justice George H. Ethridge, whose vote change in the rulings swung the results, stated in 1925 that \"This system upsets our carefully worked out scheme for white control of the Legislature and the state officers\". In 1988, a group of state legislators made up of Oliver E. Diaz Jr., Isiah Fredericks, Stephen Hale, Ayres Haxton, Diane Peranich, John Reeves, Thomas Reynolds II, Ed Ryan, Margaret Tate, Dewayne Thomas, Rey Vecchio, and Bill Wheeler planned on bringing a test case to restore the referendum process. Their petition was for a referendum to hold a constitution convention to rewrite the state's constitution, but they failed to receive the required 7,500 signatures. The group submitted another petition with 8,100 signatures in 1990, to remove the constitution's ban on state lottery system and it was rejected by Secretary of State Dick Molpus. Attorney General Mike Moore filed a lawsuit against Molpus in Hinds County Circuit Court on March 28, to allow the referendum to appear on the ballot. Molpus supported the creation of a referendum system, but opposed the petition stating that the signature requirement was too low, as 7,500 signatures accounted for less than 1% of the voters, and instead supported having the signature requirement be 8% of registered voters. The circuit court ruled against Moore on June 29, and the Mississippi Supreme Court ruled unanimously to uphold its decision on April 3, 1991. State Senator Rick Lambert sponsored legislation supported by Molpus to create a referendum system that required signatures from equaled to 10% of the votes in the most recent gubernatorial election.\n\nParagraph 4: The religion arrived in the area during the end of the era of the Bechuanaland Protectorate, the predecessor colonial country, under the Union of South Africa.  In 1953 Shoghi Effendi, head of the religion after the death of ʻAbdu'l-Bahá, planned an international teaching plan termed the Ten Year Crusade.  During the plan pioneers moved to many countries including Botswana from places. This was during a period of wide scale growth in the religion across Sub-Saharan Africa near the end of the period of Colonisation of Africa. The goal of establishing a Baháʼí presence in Bechuanaland was assigned to the National Assembly of Iran then still in operation. However, by November 1953 recent arrivals the Johnsons from America then in South Africa saw the arrival of John and Audrey Robarts and son Patrick and daughter Nina from Canada who were assisted in reaching Mafeking (then in Bechuanaland) as Baháʼí pioneers where they arrived by October 1954 and were recognized as the first Baháʼís to the country earning the title Knight of Baháʼu'lláh from the then head of the Faith, Shoghi Effendi. By 1963 there were two assemblies; seven groups, and one isolated member. The Robarts had joined the religion in 1938 and when the first National Spiritual Assembly of Canada was formed in 1948, John was elected chairman, a post he held until 1953 when they moved. In 1954 Hand of the Cause, Musa Banani appointed John as an Auxiliary Board Member and the family went on Baháʼí pilgrimage. In 2005 Lally Warren recalled that as a young child in Mafikeng it had been unusual to meet white people who were pleasant to her so she believed that all white people were bad. That changed when she met the Robarts family. \"The Robarts didn't treat me like a black child, they treated me as a child,\" she said. She recalled when she was 10 and the Robarts family came to her house for meetings with her parents, James and Stella Moncho, the first local couple to become Baháʼís, \"They could only do this at night, and as they came towards the house they would switch their [car] lights on and off to say, 'Is it ok, is it safe, can we come?'…There was no electricity in the black area during those days so my mother would take a lantern and stick it out through the window and wave it to say, 'OK, it's safe for you to come.'\"\n\nParagraph 5: In Te Arawa traditions, Chief Uenuku of Ra'iātea Island becomes annoyed with a dog named Pōtaka Tawhiti, the pet of Houmaitawhiti, for eating the leaked matter of Uenuku's ulcer, by which it commits an act of desecration. He kills the dog, after which Toi-te-huatahi consumes it. The ancestor Tamatekapua and his brother Whakatūria, sons of Houmai, search for the dog, and hear it barking inside Toi's belly. In revenge, they created stilts for Tama (the taller of the brothers) and stole the fruit from Uenuku's poroporo tree. Whakatūria was captured and hung from the roof of Uenuku's house, where the people would dance and sing around a fire below him every single night. Reportedly, their singing was so horrendously bad that the brothers, under the cover of darkness, came up with a clever way to trick the people into releasing him; the next opportunity he had, he told the people that their dancing and singing was terrible, and indeed they challenged him to do better, and let him down. He had them pamper him by cleaning the soot off and giving him some fine ornaments to dress himself in for the dance. He then tricked them into opening the door, so that he could feel the cool air, outside of which his brother Tama had arrived with two wooden poles to lock the people inside. Whakatūria manages to sprint through the open door, and the brothers bolt up the building from the outside. Uenuku declares war, and with his friend Toi he attacks the village of Houmai, but the forces of Uenuku were ultimately defeated. Whakatūria also fell in the battle, so the Arawa canoe was set out to New Zealand with one purpose being to search for meaning behind his death. At this time, the Tainui canoe was also on its way to New Zealand at this time. In this telling, Uenuku lived four generations after Ruatapu, who was one of Houmaitawhiti's ancestors.\n\nParagraph 6: In Te Arawa traditions, Chief Uenuku of Ra'iātea Island becomes annoyed with a dog named Pōtaka Tawhiti, the pet of Houmaitawhiti, for eating the leaked matter of Uenuku's ulcer, by which it commits an act of desecration.

The lower story is stone while the upper crenellated stories are made of brick.  The facade of the palace is curved slightly inwards (concave) to reflect the outwards curve (convex) of the Piazza del Campo, Siena's central square, of which the Palace is the focal point. At the top of this facade is a huge round flat bronze plate [Christogram], the symbol used by Saint Bernardino. It was placed there by the government in 1425 in gratitude to the great preacher, a native Sienese, for his sermons aimed at quelling social and political factionalism and unrest.\n\nParagraph 9: The Toronto hospital baby deaths occurred in the Cardiac Ward of the Hospital for Sick Children between July 1980 and March 1981. The deaths started after a cardiology ward had been divided into two new adjacent wards. The deaths ended after the police had been called in, and the digitalis-type medication that had possibly been used for the alleged killings (digoxin) had begun to be kept under lock and key. Three nurses were at the centre of the investigation and an apparent attempt to poison nurses' food. One of the nurses, Susan Nelles, was charged with four murders, but the prosecution was dismissed a year later on the grounds that she could not have been responsible for a death excluded in the indictment, which the judge deemed a murder.\n\nParagraph 10: The religion arrived in the area during the end of the era of the Bechuanaland Protectorate, the predecessor colonial country, under the Union of South Africa.

Ultraseven appears to fight a new foe, Alien Magma and his two \"pets\", the Red and Black Giras. Ultimately, Ultraseven is greatly overpowered and his leg is graphically broken by Black Giras. Ultraman Leo drives off the foes, but Ultraseven is confined to his human form because of his injuries and due to the Ultra Eye being damaged when he attempted to transform. Dan then maintains his role as Captain of MAC (Monster Attack Crew). Gen is a gymnastics teacher on the side and joins MAC to defend the Earth. Gen and Dan regularly train together, allowing Ultraman Leo to learn many moves in human form. In episode 34, Dan asks Ultraman Jack to take the Ultra Eye back to M78 to be restored while he heals on Earth. However, in episode 40 MAC is destroyed by Silver Bloome, a saucer monster that belongs to Commander Black. During the attack Dan asks Leo to keep defending the Earth and disappears in the conflagration. It is later shown that he was taken back to M78 to be fully healed and restored as Ultraseven. Gen is now unemployed and spends most of his time training the kids to defend themselves as well as defending the Earth as Ultraman Leo. Commander Black and Alien Bunyo capture Gen when he cannot transform completely. Gen as Leo is then dismembered, only to be brought back to life by Ultraman King. Leo would then face Commander Black's final monster, Black End, with the kids he trained, the latter of whom kill Black, and hand the sphere used to control Black End to Leo. Finishing his mission, Gen removes his Leo Ring and sets off to tour Earth, his \"second home\".\n\nParagraph 12: When the trio arrive at the office, on Corporation Street, Birmingham, with Holmes and Watson presented as fellow job-seekers, Pinner is reading a London newspaper and is clearly in shock.

Bléger and two magazines that published her allegations were ordered by a French court to pay a total of 17,000 Euros, and to publish the court ruling in one of the two magazines.

As they leave, he attempts suicide, but Watson is able to revive him. Holmes concludes that the story of the brothers is a fabrication and that there is only one 'Pinner'; lacking enough men to make their attempt to deceive Pycroft convincing, Pinner had attempted to pose as his brother to make up the numbers in the hope that Pycroft would dismiss the similarities between them as a family resemblance. He further deduces that the whole point of the exercise was to obtain an example of Pycroft's handwriting so that a 'fake' Pycroft may be employed at Mawsons (hence why they asked him to not officially resign his post). Mawsons was keeping a vast stock of valuable securities, and 'Pycroft' was to be a safebreaker.", "answers": ["9"], "length": 3516, "dataset": "passage_count_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "558eb0f077b73689c0ebdecd6835412bea8d7c84cba3e834"}

She was a heavy favorite to win the crown from the semifinal to final. During the semifinals on August 5, 1990, she won the Miss Photogenic award. She had a semifinal score of 485, placing 3rd overall. The finals were held on August 21, 1990. She eventually beat out another big favorite, Helen Yung who was 1st runner up and the winner of 2 other awards. Yuen later represented Hong Kong at the Miss Chinese International 1991 pageant, held on February 2, 1991. She took 1st runner up for Hong Kong. She also competed at the Miss Universe 1991 pageant in Las Vegas, Nevada. She failed to make the top 10 and was placed 60th.\n\nParagraph 6: This program started in 1983 and a curriculum was developed for Class I to Class V based on inferences from social, linguistic and mathematical surveys and field tests conducted in field area. The curriculum focused on various aspects of education like child development, language learning, mathematical abilities, etc. and was phased in a sequential manner on a hierarchy derived from a Piagetian framework of development of logical and mathematical abilities. The programme also gave special emphasis on the socio-economic and cultural tradition of learner and the state of the schools. The pilot project was started in 1987 in 7 schools across Shahpura and Harda. This number further increased to 25 in 1989. The programme was formally inducted into a state programme under the District Primary Education Programme DPEP of Rajiv Gandhi Prathamik Shiksha Mission (RGPSM) of Madhya Pradesh in 1995. The learning from the trial was further used to develop RGPSM's Seekhna Sikhana curricular package for primary education. This was then followed by a single primary school curricular package for the entire state which stemmed from the Seekhna Sikhana package and this also helped in the development of a curriculum for the ‘alternative’ primary schools opened by the Madhya Pradesh government under the Education Guarantee Scheme (EGS). One can say that the ultimate objective of Prashika programme was achieved when the Seekhna Sikhana package was adopted in 2001. Thus, the Prashika was the first of Eklavya's programmes to complete the cycle from a micro-level pilot project (1986–92) to a macro-level programme implemented at a block level (1995-2001) that was eventually merged into the government school system (2000–01) at the state level. However the scope of this programme remained confined to the block as this programme was soon closed down by the state government. But that was not the end of Prashika as it laid foundation for two more similar programmes, the first was the establishment of Shiksha Protsahan Kendras (SPKs) in Shahpur block in 1999 and the second was the setting up of the Bhopal Education Resource Centre (BERC) in 2000. SPKs are centres which operate in rural areas especially in the tribal areas to improve the quality of education of first generation learners through activity based learning. This centre is being run by a community appointed facilitator and adopts the principles developed under PRASHIKA for math and language teaching. BERC is a resource centre in an urban setting for primary and pre-primary education. The main goal of BERC is to encourage primary schools to introduce various activities that would develop interest in reading, writing and expression skills in students, through the production of wall newspaper and renovation of their libraries. In the Makhan Nagar block of Narmadapuram a Basic Abilities Programme was started in some middle schools. Teachers participation was the backbone of this programme. In 2004 a new initiative was also started in Indore as part of the teacher development initiative of the Indore Teacher Resource Centre to improve the abilities of primary school teachers in language and mathematics.\n\nParagraph 7: Melton appeared three times as Harry Cooper in the 1955–56 sitcom It's Always Jan.

{"input": "", "context": "Paragraph 1: At this stage there were two platforms with a footbridge, the second being an island between the two passenger lines, and another for the branch. The two subsidiary platforms each had a waiting room, while the main platform building contained the waiting room, ticket and luggage offices.  Next to the footbridge was a separate W.H. Smith bookstall. The station master's house was separate, being beside the track to the north, and there was small luggage store just outside the gate. The Wirksworth branch having severed the main road, which had been diverted, a footbridge gave access across the line. To the north of the station, there was a wide level crossing which, besides allowing luggage trolleys to cross, gave access for the farmer who owned the adjacent land. Next to this was a footbridge from the front of the station to the field behind, and between them two signal posts with, until 1910, a Duffield Station signal box supplementing Duffield Junction. After that, the station changed little over the years until 1969 though in 1947, at the time passenger services were withdrawn on the Wirksworth branch, the signal posts were replaced with a fabricated steel gantry and upper-quadrant signals. Some time later the passenger footbridge was rebuilt in brick, using the existing walkway.\n\nParagraph 2: The tower marks the location of Edison's Menlo Park laboratory, the world's first organized research and development site. He came to Menlo Park in 1876. The area was then known as Raritan Township, and later changed (in 1954) to Edison Township. Menlo Park is known as the Birthplace of Recorded Sound (November 1877), and the site of the world's first practical incandescent lamp-light bulb (October 1879).  Edison and his staff would create 400 of his most important inventions here.  It was this site that Edison would fondly nickname his 'Invention Factory'.  Edison and his staff were working in New York City, building the world's first central distribution site for electricity, when his wife Mary Stilwell Edison died at their Menlo Park home.   He would later relocate to West Orange, New Jersey in 1884 to what is now the Thomas Edison National Historical Park.  The original Menlo Park buildings began to deteriorate, and by 1926 most of the buildings had either collapsed or burned, and the only two remaining buildings were later moved to Greenfield Village in Dearborn, Michigan. The Thomas A. Edison Memorial Tower was added to the National Register of Historic Places on November 30, 1979 as an important architectural and commemorative landmark.\n\nParagraph 3: It is also the name of a Canadian military and civilian telecommunication research campus that is located on the shore of the bay.

A collision with His Majesty's tug Dreadful at the entrance to Berehaven Harbour, Ireland, the night of 1 January 1918, damaged Patterson's bow but she resumed regular escort and patrol on 5 February. Two days later she rescued 12 survivors of steamship Mexico City, torpedoed by a German submarine. Patterson, patrolling in the Irish Sea on 17 May, dropped depth charges that drove away German . She continued patrol out of Queenstown until 4 June, then departed for the United States.\n\nParagraph 6: At this stage there were two platforms with a footbridge, the second being an island between the two passenger lines, and another for the branch. The two subsidiary platforms each had a waiting room, while the main platform building contained the waiting room, ticket and luggage offices.  Next to the footbridge was a separate W.H. Smith bookstall. The station master's house was separate, being beside the track to the north, and there was small luggage store just outside the gate. The Wirksworth branch having severed the main road, which had been diverted, a footbridge gave access across the line. To the north of the station, there was a wide level crossing which, besides allowing luggage trolleys to cross, gave access for the farmer who owned the adjacent land. Next to this was a footbridge from the front of the station to the field behind, and between them two signal posts with, until 1910, a Duffield Station signal box supplementing Duffield Junction. After that, the station changed little over the years until 1969 though in 1947, at the time passenger services were withdrawn on the Wirksworth branch, the signal posts were replaced with a fabricated steel gantry and upper-quadrant signals. Some time later the passenger footbridge was rebuilt in brick, using the existing walkway.\n\nParagraph 7: It is also the name of a Canadian military and civilian telecommunication research campus that is located on the shore of the bay. Organizations with facilities at the site include Defence Research and Development Canada, Communications Research Centre, the Canadian Space Agency's David Florida Laboratory, Royal Canadian Mounted Police Firearms Training Unit, Department of Defence firearms training area, and the Connaught National Army Cadet Summer Training Centre. In October 1952, the Canadian government set up an observatory at the site to attempt to measure magnetic or radio noise disturbances. The area includes the Innis Point Bird Observatory and the Shirley's Bay Crown Game Preserve, which is managed by the Ottawa Duck Club.\n\nParagraph 8: The tower marks the location of Edison's Menlo Park laboratory, the world's first organized research and development site. He came to Menlo Park in 1876. The area was then known as Raritan Township, and later changed (in 1954) to Edison Township. Menlo Park is known as the Birthplace of Recorded Sound (November 1877), and the site of the world's first practical incandescent lamp-light bulb (October 1879).  Edison and his staff would create 400 of his most important inventions here.  It was this site that Edison would fondly nickname his 'Invention Factory'.  Edison and his staff were working in New York City, building the world's first central distribution site for electricity, when his wife Mary Stilwell Edison died at their Menlo Park home.   He would later relocate to West Orange, New Jersey in 1884 to what is now the Thomas Edison National Historical Park.  The original Menlo Park buildings began to deteriorate, and by 1926 most of the buildings had either collapsed or burned, and the only two remaining buildings were later moved to Greenfield Village in Dearborn, Michigan. The Thomas A. Edison Memorial Tower was added to the National Register of Historic Places on November 30, 1979 as an important architectural and commemorative landmark.\n\nParagraph 9: At this stage there were two platforms with a footbridge, the second being an island between the two passenger lines, and another for the branch.

Ever since Zanjeer, Salim–Javed wrote many of their subsequent scripts with Bachchan in mind for the lead role, and insisted on him being cast for their later films, including blockbusters such as Deewaar (1975) and Sholay (1975), establishing Bachchan as a superstar. In addition to being a turning point for Bachchan's career and Hindi cinema, Zanjeer was also a turning point for South Indian cinema, with Bachchan's acting inspiring future Tamil Superstar Rajinikanth. Zanjeer remains an important film in the history of Indian cinema and is regarded as a classic today. Dilip Kumar, Dev Anand, Raaj Kumar, and Dharmendra were offered the lead role, but they did not accept the role. It is a matter of common knowledge that it was the romantic era of Rajesh Khanna. Romance was on the rise and Zanjeer did not have a single romance scene between the lead pair Amitabh and Jaya. All actors who refused the film had a serious concern about a dent in their image if they did this film. Bachchan, on the other hand, had little to lose; he chose the film and started his way to superstardom.\n\nParagraph 11: Nicole gives Chase a makeover so that he fits in better with her friend group and takes him to events where he becomes friends with the popular kids, all while insisting to his old friends, Dave and Ray, that the whole thing is just a scam and that he hasn't really changed, though it's clear to them that he has.  While Chase does all the activities Nicole asks him to with little resistance, he eventually points out that everything they've done is for her benefit.  Nicole agrees to do whatever he wants and they go to a club he used to frequent with Dulcie, where Nicole has a good time and begins bonding with his friends. Chase has a run in with Dulcie and her new boyfriend, Nicole comes to his aid and kisses him, which makes Dulcie jealous. Nicole and Chase begin to fall in love but don't admit their feelings, to each other or themselves, and continue their ruse.  Nicole's vindictive best friend, Alicia, seduces Chase at a party, making sure Nicole would see them together, leaving Nicole heartbroken. Chase calls Dave to pick him up, since he is too drunk to drive, and angers Dave when he says that \"everyone\" was at the party, which Dave says is not true because he and Ray were not there, reminding him they used to be his friends. Meanwhile, Brad and his girlfriend break up and Dulcie also ends things with her new boyfriend. Chase attempts to talk to Nicole about what happened with Alicia but she rebuffs him, reminding him of the easy out clause, she also ignores his calls. Chase eventually makes up with his friends and gets back together with Dulcie. Brad finally asks Nicole to the dance. Despite getting what they both wanted from the beginning, Chase is unhappy with Dulcie and Nicole rejects Brad.", "answers": ["10"], "length": 2028, "dataset": "passage_count_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "b840b98f785681073e1294d070f22aef0fbffd88593251b7"}
{"input": "", "context": "Paragraph 1: Under Napoleonic rule (1806 to 1813), Frankenberg was home to the seat of a canton in the department of Werra in the Kingdom of Westphalia. In 1821, Frankenberg became district seat (Kreisstadt) of the newly formed district of Frankenberg, consisting of the former Ämter of Frankenberg, Hessenstein, Rosenthal and Haina, along with the court district of Viermünden. The district council – after 1834 provincial council – had its seat in the St. Georgenberg Monastery. Frankenberg had sunk down from a key town to an unnotable, mean little town. Its economic underpinnings, as had already been so in the Middle Ages, were the clothiers and the tanners. Whereas by the late 18th century the woolmen's and clothiers' guild had 106 members and the tanners' guild 46, by the middle of the 19th century, membership in the woolmen's and clothiers' guild rose to 140, and red and white tanning blossomed once again. Alongside other guilds, there was also at that time a stocking weavers' and glovers' guild. In the second half of the century, a noticeable downswing set in, which could even be seen in population figures (2,611 in 1787, 3,163 in 1867 and 2,787 in 1894). From 1590 to 1818, copper and silver ore was mined and smelted near Frankenberg. During the 19th century, various attempts were undertaken to get the mining industry running again, but in 1875, it was abandoned for good. Sights between Frankenberg and Geismar still bear witness today to the mining in days of yore, as do some placenames such as \"Alte Hütte\" (\"Old Ironworks\"), \"Neue Hütte\" (\"New Ironworks\") and \"Zechenhaus\" (\"Colliery House\"). Only when the railway reached Frankenberg did a new economic upswing, albeit a modest one, come to the town. In 1890, the Marburg-Frankenberg line was opened, and the Brothers Thonet from Vienna furthermore set up a chair-making factory near the railway station making use of the wealth of wood in the area. Ten years later, the line was extended through Korbach to Warburg, making connections to Westphalia. In 1908, the stretch of line to Bestwig was completed, and in 1910, so was the one to Berleburg.\n\nParagraph 2: Newlands is best known for his work interpreting the love of God, particularly a Christology of divine love. In Hilary of Poitiers: a Study in Theological Method (1978), Newlands argues for concepts of love as the key to exegesis in theology. In Theology of the Love of God (1980), Newlands takes concepts of the love of God to be the basic structuring element of Christian theology. Newlands engages interpretations of love in the Christian tradition and contemporary uses of concepts of faith, hope, and history, and proposes that the nature of God as love shapes every aspect of theology. In God in Christian Perspective (1994), Newlands's argument is developed further. An understanding of God as a multi-faceted model draws on Christology and Trinity, and faith and practice in community. God is personal, self-differentiated being, transcendent, yet also immanent in the created order as hidden divine presence. The core elements of theology (faith and revelation, divine action and Christology) are reappraised in the light of current theological proposals. Doctrines, Newlands argues, interact in a web of connection to shape Christian practice. A Christian understanding, however, must retain a basic core of unconditional love, Christologically characterised. A contemporary concept of God draws upon these core elements, and upon a retrieval of the historical traditions from which they arise. It can be articulated in language intelligible to contemporary citizens, and its consequences spelled out within the complexity of contemporary cultures. Generosity and the Christian Future (1997) carries this thesis to a further stage through engagement with emancipatory theologies, postmodernity, and political theory. John and Donald Baillie: Transatlantic Theology (2002),  built on first access to the Baillie Papers, lies at the heart of Newlands's constructive proposal. Newlands takes the work of John Baillie and Donald Ballie as seminal to the understanding, justification and revisioning of a progressive Christian theology. This tradition is a trajectory against the stream of contemporary theology. In  The Transformative Imagination: Rethinking Intercultural Theology (2004), Newlands offers a comparative study of connections between theology and culture, through the arts, the sciences, political and human rights issues, and shapes reflection on the mystery of God in a postfoundational frame.\n\nParagraph 3: From 1990 until 1992, Estrada served as Assistant U.S. Attorney and Deputy Chief of the Appellate Section, U.S. Attorney's Office, Southern District of New York.

{"input": "", "context": "Paragraph 1: The Daughters of Israel - Home for the Incurables was the organization from which the original opening hospital derived its name from. In May 1926 it was announced by Max Blumberg, the President of the organization, the hospital was to be named The Jewish Sanitarium for Incurables. The original name of the hospital represented the very nature of the patients the organization and its founder were seeking to admit. During the period of 1926 to 1936 the media outlet occasionally referred to the hospital as the Jewish Home for Incurables, and the Jewish Sanitarium for Chronics and Incurables. By the mid-1930s the hospital recognized there was no longer the need to emphasize the position as only harboring terminal and incurable patients and therefore decided to officially change its name. on May 17, 1936, the hospital changed its name to the Jewish Hospital and Sanitarium for Chronic Diseases. The announcement came from Bernard Lebovitz, the Vice President at the time, during the dedication ceremonies of a new 40-bed ward. In a speech addressing the name change Mr. Lebovitz stated \" Only a Few years ago, hospitals and doctors were in the habit of giving up many patients and deciding that medial science could do nothing more for them, but no cases are given up as hopeless nowadays\". He went on to say \" Patients in the Sanitarium suffer from severe cancer, paralysis, heart disease, and 45 other diseases from which patients rarely recover all live in the hope that medical science will one day discover a cure for their ailment\". On July 8, 1954, Isaac Albert announced that The Jewish Hospital and Sanitarium for Chronic Diseases had changed its name to Jewish Chronic Disease Hospital. \"This change is in keeping with the services which the institution renders. The term 'Sanitarium' connotes a rest or convalescent home or institution.\". By the mid-1950s the Jewish Chronic Disease hospital was an 810-bed institution dedicated to the treatment and rehabilitation patients with chronic diseases such as cancer, arthritis, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophy, cerebral palsy, polio, and heart conditions. It became the nation's largest voluntary, non-sectarian hospital for chronically sick and had patients ranging in age from infants to aged men and women. It had facilities for occupational therapy, physiotherapy, hydrotherapy, inpatient and outpatient cerebral palsy clinics, a rheumatic fever division, cardiology division, medical research laboratories, tumor detection clinic, and other departments for the treatment and study of long-term ailments. For many years, while the institution was known as the 'Home for Incurables.\" Mr. Albert pointed out. \"Today, however, the hospital is endeavoring to be an interim point between physical rehabilitation and discharge, now 'A Haven of Hope'.\" On May 21, 1968, the hospital was renamed yet again to the current name Kingsbrook Jewish Medical Center at the annual anniversary dinner for the hospital. In 2010 the hospital attained corporate status effectively becoming a separate entity from the David Minkin Rehabilitation Institute/ Rutland Nursing Home. The Corporation of Kingsbrook Medical Center system to govern these bodies. This change caused Kingsbrook Jewish Medical Center to go from an 864-bed facility to 326 beds splitting the remaining 538 beds to the David Minkin Rehabilitation Institute/ Rutland Nursing Home. It is of note that even though these two facilities are by definition separate they still share many services and protocols.\n\nParagraph 2: Brian Goodwin was born in Montreal, Quebec, Canada in 1931. He studied biology at McGill University and then emigrated to the UK, under a Rhodes Scholarship for studying mathematics at Oxford. He got his PhD at the University of Edinburgh presenting the thesis \"Studies in the general theory of development and evolution\" under the supervision of Conrad Hal Waddington. He then moved to Sussex University until 1983 when he became a full professor at the Open University in Milton Keynes until retirement in 1992. He became a major figure in the early development of mathematical biology, along with other researchers. He was one of the attendants to the famous meetings that took place between 1965 and 1968 in Villa Serbelloni, hosted by the Rockefeller Foundation, under the topic \"Towards a theoretical Biology\". The workshop involved, among other key scientists, Conrad Waddington, Jack Cowan, Michael Conrad, Jim Burns, Christopher Zeeman, Richard Lewontin, Robert Rosen, Stuart Kauffman, John Maynard Smith, René Thom and Lewis Wolpert. As a result of the conference talks and discussions, a four-volume proceedings of the event came out, becoming at the time a major reference in the area.\n\nParagraph 3: Several thousand years before Snowbird's birth, the immensely powerful and malevolent Arctic spirit Tundra sealed the Northern gods — including the Inuit goddess Nelvanna — within a mystical barrier in another dimension, rendering them incapable of defending the mortal realm of Earth. Through clever persuasion and trickery, Nelvanna bargained with Tundra to strip her of her godly powers so that she could pass through the barrier to find and mate with a male human of Earth. Nelvanna appeared before a man named Richard Easton, insisting upon mating with him to produce a child who would grow to battle the evil, mystical \"Great Beasts\" of Canada. Easton reluctantly agreed, and the two conceived Snowbird some time in the early 20th century, near Resolute Bay, Northwest Territories, Canada. Years later, after having been driven mad by his experiences in the spirit realm, Easton worked a spell to summon and control Tundra and was horribly burned up by the completion of the summoning. He only controlled Tundra for a brief period, and Tundra's manifestation was destroyed by Marrina.\n\nParagraph 4: Several thousand years before Snowbird's birth, the immensely powerful and malevolent Arctic spirit Tundra sealed the Northern gods — including the Inuit goddess Nelvanna — within a mystical barrier in another dimension, rendering them incapable of defending the mortal realm of Earth.

He only controlled Tundra for a brief period, and Tundra's manifestation was destroyed by Marrina.\n\nParagraph 5: Several thousand years before Snowbird's birth, the immensely powerful and malevolent Arctic spirit Tundra sealed the Northern gods — including the Inuit goddess Nelvanna — within a mystical barrier in another dimension, rendering them incapable of defending the mortal realm of Earth. Through clever persuasion and trickery, Nelvanna bargained with Tundra to strip her of her godly powers so that she could pass through the barrier to find and mate with a male human of Earth. Nelvanna appeared before a man named Richard Easton, insisting upon mating with him to produce a child who would grow to battle the evil, mystical \"Great Beasts\" of Canada.

In May 1926 it was announced by Max Blumberg, the President of the organization, the hospital was to be named The Jewish Sanitarium for Incurables. The original name of the hospital represented the very nature of the patients the organization and its founder were seeking to admit. During the period of 1926 to 1936 the media outlet occasionally referred to the hospital as the Jewish Home for Incurables, and the Jewish Sanitarium for Chronics and Incurables. By the mid-1930s the hospital recognized there was no longer the need to emphasize the position as only harboring terminal and incurable patients and therefore decided to officially change its name. on May 17, 1936, the hospital changed its name to the Jewish Hospital and Sanitarium for Chronic Diseases. The announcement came from Bernard Lebovitz, the Vice President at the time, during the dedication ceremonies of a new 40-bed ward. In a speech addressing the name change Mr. Lebovitz stated \" Only a Few years ago, hospitals and doctors were in the habit of giving up many patients and deciding that medial science could do nothing more for them, but no cases are given up as hopeless nowadays\". He went on to say \" Patients in the Sanitarium suffer from severe cancer, paralysis, heart disease, and 45 other diseases from which patients rarely recover all live in the hope that medical science will one day discover a cure for their ailment\". On July 8, 1954, Isaac Albert announced that The Jewish Hospital and Sanitarium for Chronic Diseases had changed its name to Jewish Chronic Disease Hospital. \"This change is in keeping with the services which the institution renders. The term 'Sanitarium' connotes a rest or convalescent home or institution.\". By the mid-1950s the Jewish Chronic Disease hospital was an 810-bed institution dedicated to the treatment and rehabilitation patients with chronic diseases such as cancer, arthritis, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophy, cerebral palsy, polio, and heart conditions. It became the nation's largest voluntary, non-sectarian hospital for chronically sick and had patients ranging in age from infants to aged men and women. It had facilities for occupational therapy, physiotherapy, hydrotherapy, inpatient and outpatient cerebral palsy clinics, a rheumatic fever division, cardiology division, medical research laboratories, tumor detection clinic, and other departments for the treatment and study of long-term ailments. For many years, while the institution was known as the 'Home for Incurables.\" Mr. Albert pointed out. \"Today, however, the hospital is endeavoring to be an interim point between physical rehabilitation and discharge, now 'A Haven of Hope'.\" On May 21, 1968, the hospital was renamed yet again to the current name Kingsbrook Jewish Medical Center at the annual anniversary dinner for the hospital. In 2010 the hospital attained corporate status effectively becoming a separate entity from the David Minkin Rehabilitation Institute/ Rutland Nursing Home. The Corporation of Kingsbrook Medical Center system to govern these bodies. This change caused Kingsbrook Jewish Medical Center to go from an 864-bed facility to 326 beds splitting the remaining 538 beds to the David Minkin Rehabilitation Institute/ Rutland Nursing Home. It is of note that even though these two facilities are by definition separate they still share many services and protocols.\n\nParagraph 7: In 1968, Chilean artist Eduardo Armstrong introduced the children's magazine Mampato, a bi-weekly publication containing educational articles as well as prose stories and a number of Chilean and foreign comic strips, which was published by Editorial Lord Cochrane. The first episode of the titular Mampato comic series was initially written by Armstrong and illustrated by Óscar Vega, a renowned Chilean comics artist. It tells the story of a young Chilean boy who obtains a \"space-time belt\" and uses it to travel through time, seeking to experience history's greatest adventures. The character of Mampato was partly inspired by both Dennis the Menace by Hank Ketcham, and Goscinny and Uderzo's Astérix. Vega had just read an Astérix book, at the time little known in Latin America, and was very impressed with the work; he attempted to merge Dennis the Menace's physical appearance and Astérix' art style into Mampato. Themo Lobos was then very busy with his work for El Peneca, yet Armstrong offered him the chance to illustrate Mampato. At first, Lobos declined the offer, but after a while he accepted – quickly becoming close friends with Armstrong. Lobos began drawing the series from the third chapter of Mampato's first adventure. While doing the illustrations, he mentioned to Armstrong that he was uncomfortable working with a script he had not written. Armstrong then decided to give Lobos free reins for the creation of stories and characters in all subsequent Mampato comics. For the remainder of the first storyline and, in full instalments since the second Mampato adventure (\"Kilikilis and Golagolas\"), the series was entirely written and illustrated by Lobos (save for a few storylines by Vega) and the magazine went on to become highly popular and successful with Chilean youth, at its peak selling roughly 100,000 copies per issue and changed its schedule to weekly in April 1971.\n\nParagraph 8: Juan Carlos Caballero Mistral (Jaime Camil) is a busy  man working in Grupo Imperio. He is a womanizer who can never get enough. Juan feels he just enjoys the company of women. Everyone in the industry feels he is just a man who plays with women's feelings. But when Helena Moreno Romero (Lucero), a single mother of one son and an ex-employee of Grupo Imperio, enters Juan Carlos' life, he begins to have feelings for Helena, something he has never felt before. Helena regains her position at Grupo Imperio and starts a huge project. They fall helplessly in love with each other and plan to marry and start a family with Helena's son Eduardo (Lalito). Although, given his background, Helena hates Juan Carlos Caballero and Juan Carlos pretends he is Juan Perón, son of an Argentinian ambassador. Helena finds this out and is heartbroken. She feels Juan tricked her and was looking for another \"adventure,\"and also feels he tried to steal the project she had been working hard on.  Later Plutarco Ramos Arrieta (Marcelo Cordoba) frames him for embezzlement. While in his car, Juan Carlos hears the police sirens.  He is chased by the police until he falls of a cliff and his car explodes. Thinking he is dead, the authorities publicize the message that Juan Carlos is dead. Helena is mourning and feels she will never forget her great love for him. Meanwhile, Juan Carlos is still alive but in hiding. He meets Mimi de La Rosa (Patricia Navidad) and they become extraordinary friends. He tells her his whole story and how he must clear his name. Mimi helps him transform from Juan Carlos Caballero to Eva Maria Leon Jaramillo viuda de Zuloaga. He watches out for Helena and her son while trying to find evidence to clear his name. Although it becomes a very different and difficult life being a lady, Juan Carlos starts to realize his mistake and the consequences of being a womanizer. Eva/Juan applies for a job as Helena's assistant. She/he gets the job and at first, does not get along well with Helena. But soon they become the best of friends. Plutarco falls in love with Helena and becomes Juan's (biggest) enemy. Plutarco proposes to Helena, and Helena accepts. Although Plutarco had a wife, Antonia Reyes de Ramos (Christina Pastor) who died of a heart attack, he also has an ex-lover, Rebeca Oropeza (Mariana Seoane). Rebeca becomes his worst enemy; she is determined to ruin their relationship. But Juan is crushed and gives Helena every reason to hate Plutarco. As Eva, Juan will regain Helena's love, clear his name and realize his dream of being married and having a family with her.\n\nParagraph 9: Brian Goodwin was born in Montreal, Quebec, Canada in 1931. He studied biology at McGill University and then emigrated to the UK, under a Rhodes Scholarship for studying mathematics at Oxford. He got his PhD at the University of Edinburgh presenting the thesis \"Studies in the general theory of development and evolution\" under the supervision of Conrad Hal Waddington. He then moved to Sussex University until 1983 when he became a full professor at the Open University in Milton Keynes until retirement in 1992. He became a major figure in the early development of mathematical biology, along with other researchers. He was one of the attendants to the famous meetings that took place between 1965 and 1968 in Villa Serbelloni, hosted by the Rockefeller Foundation, under the topic \"Towards a theoretical Biology\". The workshop involved, among other key scientists, Conrad Waddington, Jack Cowan, Michael Conrad, Jim Burns, Christopher Zeeman, Richard Lewontin, Robert Rosen, Stuart Kauffman, John Maynard Smith, René Thom and Lewis Wolpert. As a result of the conference talks and discussions, a four-volume proceedings of the event came out, becoming at the time a major reference in the area.\n\nParagraph 10: Brian Goodwin was born in Montreal, Quebec, Canada in 1931.

{"input": "", "context": "Paragraph 1: Corrour station was built by the West Highland Railway between 1893 and 1894 on its line linking Glasgow with Fort William, and was operated from its opening on 7 August 1894 by the North British Railway. It has a passing loop around an island platform with a siding on the east side. In common with the line's two other remote passing places, Gorton and Glen Douglas, it was built with a tall signalbox and an adjacent low building in which the signalman lived. The adjacent low building (in Corrour's case) was also used as a sub post office from 15 December 1896 and a Post Office telegraph office from 16 August 1898; Corrour even qualified as a post town. Later, the railway constructed a station house for the signalman on the east side of the tracks, and the original building became purely office accommodation for the railway and the post office.\n\nParagraph 2: Harvey Swick is an 11-year-old boy bored with school, teachers, homework, and his day-to-day life. A man named Rictus visits Harvey and tells him about a kids’ paradise called the Holiday House. At the Holiday House, there are all the sweets a person could ask for; four seasons in a day; Halloween every evening; Christmas, with whatever gifts you could wish for every night; and everything else you could dream of. Harvey hesitantly visits the house and becomes friends with two other children staying alongside him, Wendell and Lulu. There is also an elderly woman, Mrs. Griffin, who cooks all the meals and cares for the children; though she seems kind, she appears to be keeping a secret about the house and its creator, Mr. Hood. Mrs Griffin also keeps three cats: Stew Cat, Blue Cat and Clue Cat. Clue Cat is accidentally killed by being burned alive from the lunch Mrs Griffin had been cooking, which distresses her. Harvey thinks his parents will be worried about him, so is allowed to speak to them on the phone. Harvey’s parents tell him they thought it would be a good idea for him to take a break from school to cheer him up. Though Harvey thinks the voices of his parents are a bit strange, he brushes it off and starts to relax. \n\nParagraph 3: Bumblebee's next adventure would occur when he accompanied Spike and Sparkplug with Jazz to test out his new speakers but decided to head to headquarters so they wouldn't have to deal with his loud music. When Bumblebee returned to the headquarters, he saw nobody but Bluestreak there and that Teletraan One was damaged. He then was dragged to the recharging chamber by Bluestreak, due to Megatron putting a personality destabilizer in their recharging chamber to turn all the Autobots evil. However, Bumblebee was saved when Jazz, Spike and Sparkplug arrived back just in time as Jazz knocked Bluestreak out for a while. After Sparkplug fixed Teletraan One, he, Bumblebee, Jazz and Spike learn about what happened. With Bumblebee and Jazz being the only ones who were not affected from the personality destabilizer, Bumblebee decided to stop his comrades when he hears about Optimus Prime, Brawn and Prowl attacking an Air Force jet base with Spike accompanying him. Once they arrived, Bumblebee tried a few times to get through to Optimus but to no success. Bumblebee was relieved that his friends were free from the Decepticons' control, after Sparkplug invented Attitude exchanger to counteract the personality destabilizer effects, except for Prime. Bumblebee took the last one, as there was no other ones left, as he wanted to make one final attempted to get Optimus back to his senses. Bumblebee tells Prime that he is not evil, and he believes in him, then encourages him to fight off Megatron's control also to not give in. Bumblebee quickly put the Attitude exchanger on Optimus, who heard his voice, which freed him from Decepticon control. Bumblebee was given a hug by Prime for not giving up on him and for saving him. After stopping the Decepticons, Bumblebee was thanked again by Optimus Prime, who also thanked everyone for their help, for what he did for him. Bumblebee with Spike gave Ratchet and Sparkplug tools as they needed to fix the Air Force jets the Autobots destroyed while under Megatron's control.\n\nParagraph 4: Larry Flick from Billboard wrote, \"First offering from rapper's major-label debut, Mack Daddy, cheekily rhapsodizes about the joys of women with prominent backsides.

In Old English, inflections increased the length of most content words in any case.  Through to the seventeenth century, before English spelling was firmly settled, short forms for some content words did occur, such as eg (egg), ey (eye), lo (low), etc.  Conversely, poets alternated between short and long forms for function words, depending on whether they occurred on or off the meter. Some commentators have ascribed such a convention to John Milton, although others suggest that it was unevenly implemented and clouded by intervention from the printer.\n\nParagraph 7: The first season of Australia's Brainiest Kid was produced in May 2004, airing on the Seven Network on Sundays, starting 28 November 2004.

In the most recent version of Grove's Dictionary,  states that: \"Although these pieces have been severely criticized by modern writers as primitive, the appearance of a second part suggests they were popular in their time.\" The musicologist Peter Williams has compared settings of Vetter's with Bach's short chorale preludes from Orgelbüchlein, which date from exactly the same period: according to Williams, Vetter's treatments were \"competent but jejune\". As a specific comparison, Williams has taken the first chorale Nun komm der Heiden Heiland: for him Vetter's clavichord or spinet setting as a French prélude is less convincing then Bach's setting BWV 599; \"the opening chorale’s expressive tmesis or semiquaver break in the melody of bar 1, imitated in the following alto and tenor, was the result of second thoughts—a tiny but clear example of creative thinking, and typical of the album.\" Writing from the perspective of Bach's biography, Williams suggests that \"J. S. Bach wished to surpass Vetter in his own work.\"  also compares the two treatments of Nun komm der Heiden Heiland by Vetter and Bach. He states that whereas \"Bach makes the chord-breaking into a contrapuntal figure that pushes the texture forward and creates constant variety\", Vetter's uniform and automatic resort to broken-chord figures is \"astounding\". As Rose comments, this predictability led Gotthold Frotscher in the 1930s to accuse Vetter of \"lacking creative power\" in these works. Rose and  have examined the anthology in the context of late seventeenth– and early eighteenth–century music-making and domestic worship in Germany: the chorales were aimed at the pious merchant class in Leipzig, with simple four-point settings for organ coupled with clavichord or spinet broken-chord settings in the fashionable luthé or brisé style. The preface to Vetter's second volume states that no great degree of proficiency was required for performers of his chorales; nevertheless, even the highly accomplished keyboard player Anna Amalia, the sister of Frederick the Great, had a copy of Vetter's chorales in her personal library.  outlines the relevance of Vetter's 1713 second preface in the role of Lutheran worship, where Vetter explains \"the spiritual benefits of music, especially the practice of singing hymns after meals, and does so by reference to Luther.\" Leaver infers that Bach's use of Vetter's final chorale Liebster Gott for the 1724 cantata BWV 8, \"implies that he had probably read Vetter’s preface referring to Luther.\"\n\nParagraph 13: The son of a butcher from County Durham, Reed began performing at the end of World War II, joining the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company in 1951.

In 2009, a large stone temple uncovered by a joint Chinese-Korean-Japanese archaeological expedition, is found to facilitate time travel, and through its exploitation by the Japanese right-wing nationalist group Uyoku dantai, a man named Inoue travels back in time exactly 100 years and prevents the assassination of Resident-General Itō Hirobumi on October 26, 1909. Itō's survival and Inoue's knowledge of future events allows for Japan, instead of being defeated with the other Axis Powers in World War II, to instead ally with the United States against Nazi Germany; The war ends in 1945, following the atomic bombing of Berlin (instead of Hiroshima and Nagasaki). As one of the victorious powers, Japan becomes a military and economic superpower with a permanent seat on the U.N. Security Council, with its colonial empire intact. Inoue goes on to become the second Governor-General of Korea and his descendants found the Inoue Foundation, which keeps knowledge of the altered timeline limited to only the highest levels of Japan's government. However, a Korean researcher who followed Inoue and attempted to stop him becomes the founder of Hureisenjin and passes along the story of the truth of the altered timeline, with the hope that the original timeline can somehow be restored.\n\nParagraph 2: Shadows Fall has released seven studio albums, two compilation albums, and two DVDs.

He had originally intended to attend Michigan State to play hockey, but attendance at a revival changed his mind and he entered Wheaton College in 1954. That year, he saw soccer played for the first time. Intrigued, he tried out for the team his sophomore year. Despite his late introduction to the game, he quickly rose to the top of the collegiate ranks when he was named an Honorable Mention (third team) All American in 1957.  He graduated in the spring of 1958 and remained at Wheaton that fall to coach the team.  McCrath was inducted into the Wheaton College Athletic Hall of Fame in 1979.  In 1960, Gordon College in Wenham, Massachusetts hired McCrath.  Over seven seasons, he took the NAIA Fighting Scots to a 52–26–2 record, four post season tournaments and the 1966 NAIA semifinals.  That year, he graduated with an M.Div. from the Gordon Divinity School. In 1967, he moved to Spring Arbor College where he inherited a mediocre team. In his first season, he went 4–4–0, but quickly improved as the Cougars went to the NAIA post season in 1968 and 1969. In 1969, he again took his team to the semifinals. This brought him to the attention of David McKenna, president of Seattle Pacific University, a sister school to Spring Arbor. McKenna was looking to upgrade the SPU soccer program and consequently hired McCrath. McCrath’s team again had a poor first season, going 0–7–3. However, the next year, he took the Falcons to a 7–3–4 record and the regional post-season tournament. He improved in 1972 as the Falcons made it into the NCAA post-season tournament. At the time, an investment group began laying the foundation for the establishment of a North American Soccer League franchise in Seattle, eventually to be known as the Seattle Sounders. They approached McCrath about coaching the team, but he declined. Instead, he worked with the team ownership to hire John Best as the team’s first coach. McCrath then did much of the early work scouting players and assembling a roster. Once the team began playing in 1974, he worked as a color commentator for local broadcasts of Sounders’ games. He did not slight his collegiate coaching duties and took Seattle Pacific to the NCAA Division II championship game in 1974, 1975 and 1977. Each time, the team finished as runner-up. In 1978, the Falcons finally took the title and McCrath was named the National Coach of the Year. The Falcons won the championship again in 1983, 1985, 1986 and 1993 and finished as runner-up in 1984 and 1990. In 2007, the Falcons finished 7–6–7. This disappointing result led to his dismissal as coach at the end of the season.\n\nParagraph 5: A wounded Sakamoto stumbles into the Hureisenjin's hideout and Saigo is visited by the head of the Inoue Foundation, with both learning the truth: that they are living in an alternate timeline. In 2009, a large stone temple uncovered by a joint Chinese-Korean-Japanese archaeological expedition, is found to facilitate time travel, and through its exploitation by the Japanese right-wing nationalist group Uyoku dantai, a man named Inoue travels back in time exactly 100 years and prevents the assassination of Resident-General Itō Hirobumi on October 26, 1909. Itō's survival and Inoue's knowledge of future events allows for Japan, instead of being defeated with the other Axis Powers in World War II, to instead ally with the United States against Nazi Germany; The war ends in 1945, following the atomic bombing of Berlin (instead of Hiroshima and Nagasaki). As one of the victorious powers, Japan becomes a military and economic superpower with a permanent seat on the U.N. Security Council, with its colonial empire intact. Inoue goes on to become the second Governor-General of Korea and his descendants found the Inoue Foundation, which keeps knowledge of the altered timeline limited to only the highest levels of Japan's government. However, a Korean researcher who followed Inoue and attempted to stop him becomes the founder of Hureisenjin and passes along the story of the truth of the altered timeline, with the hope that the original timeline can somehow be restored.\n\nParagraph 6: Hunting is a primary way in which Efé men contribute to the food supply of the tribe, which they were observed doing 21.1% of the time during 12-hour observation days. They hunt either alone or in groups, using either spears or bows and arrows (the arrows may be iron-tipped or poison-tipped, depending on the type of prey). Monkeys are hunted alone using poison-tipped arrows, which is done by solitary hunters who locate groups of monkeys feeding in trees and stand where they think the monkeys will move. Once they are within , an Efé archer fires several arrows and, if he hits one of the monkeys, he will either try to follow it up to  through the forest (waiting for the poison to set in), or he will return later (the same day or the next morning) in order to bring it back to camp. Poison-tipped arrows are labour-intensive to make (the poisonous roots and vines have to be gathered and then crushed up to turn them into a juice that can be used to coat the arrow tip), and are made in batches of about 75, with about 5.9 minutes spent on each arrow. Duikers (a type of antelope) are hunted either in groups or ambushed alone from trees with iron-tipped arrows. The ambush hunts are called ebaka, and they are performed by building perches in fruit trees from which the duikers eat dropped fruits and waiting there during feeding hours, which are early morning and late afternoon. If the hunter hits a duiker, he will jump out of the 2.5- to 3-metre perch and chase it, and call the dogs to join him. Sometimes, though, the animal gets away, since they can run the distance of several football fields away in the dense forest, even wounded. Group hunts, which are called mota, take place with between 4 and 30 men who use either spears for large animals (like forest buffalo and elephants) or iron-tipped arrows for duikers, other species of antelope, and water chevrotain. They also use their dogs to drive game out of their hiding and/or sleeping places and to chase down wounded animals.\n\nParagraph 7: His parents, Franciszek Trabalski and Maria Trąbalski, born Mackowiack, had immigrated from Poland in 1888. His father was active already active in Poland as a socialist. In 1901 he moved with his parents returned to Poland Katowice. From 1902 Stanislav visited the middle and high school. Even at that young age he realized how detrimental can be a household name because he was labeled due to the political activities of his father as a \"stranger, and Red.\" His teachers, the Catholic priest and former sergeant, he held bad memories. Since his father since 28 December 1902 the newspaper \"Gazzetta Robotnica\" had brought out, and Stanislaw, like all other family members also help in producing the newspaper. As early as age nine, he was sometimes used to quite delicate tasks. So he did, for example, a call to the crouching soldiers not to participate in the battles of the Revolution, smuggled into the barracks. The growing to-do Cossacks did not suspect that a child would be used for such tasks. In 1912 the family returned to Leipzig. Since his parents not afford the school fees for another visit to the school where he was forced to look for an apprenticeship. The dues to be paid monthly by Stanislaw 300 marks had to be on the weekends through temporary jobs earn as a projectionist in some movie theaters in Leipzig. On 15 December 1915 he received the draft for military service. He had a short basic training in the 7th Telegraph Battalion in Dresden, to the Western Front. Here he was commanded to a technical unit. Amid hail of grenade he had to telephone lines that were shot repeatedly repaired. When he was witness to an inhuman endurance command, he was able to thwart its implementation by means of capping a telephone line. On 6 June 1916 in the \"Hell of Verdun,\" he was wounded by a grenade in the leg. A planned amputation, he was able to withdraw and came to a Kriegslazaret to Weimar. On 30 June 1917 he was discharged as unfit for service. Then he worked as an auditor for counter Thuringia. When he interfered with officers staff the food profiteering, he was released. Finally he found a job at Carl Zeiss in Jena. In 1919, after a brief stay in Leipzig, the revolutionary turned Trabalski Center, Berlin. There, he volunteered on behalf of his Leipzig colleagues at the former People's Representatives Emil Barth where he could live for some time. The demilitarization Ordinance from the government forced him back to Leipzig, where he was obliged to resume the labour  in which he was engaged on the day war broke out. In 1921 he married Margaret Lipinski, the daughter of Richard Lipinski. 1923, his son Charles Trabalski was born, who was later to become member of the parliament for the SPD in North Rhine-Westphalia. Trabalski was the father of seven children. Stanislav's grave is located on the southern cemetery Leipzig.\n\nParagraph 8: Interpersonal communication and conflict management and resolution. Active, frequent and honest communication is the most important factor in increasing the likelihood of project success and mitigating problematic projects. The development team should seek end-user involvement and encourage user input in the development process. Not having users involved can lead to misinterpretation of requirements, insensitivity to changing customer needs, and unrealistic expectations on the part of the client. Software developers, users, project managers, customers and project sponsors need to communicate regularly and  frequently. The information gained from these discussions allows the project team to analyze the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT) and to act on that information to benefit from opportunities and to minimize threats. Even bad news may be good if it is communicated relatively early, because problems can be mitigated if they are not discovered too late. For example, casual conversation with users, team members, and other stakeholders may often surface potential problems sooner than formal meetings. All communications need to be intellectually honest and authentic, and regular, frequent, high quality criticism of development work is necessary, as long as it is provided in a calm, respectful, constructive, non-accusatory, non-angry fashion. Frequent casual communications between developers and end-users, and between project managers and clients, are necessary to keep the project relevant, useful and effective for the end-users, and within the bounds of what can be completed. Effective interpersonal communication and conflict management and resolution are the key to software project management. No methodology or process improvement strategy can overcome serious problems in communication or mismanagement of interpersonal conflict. Moreover, outcomes associated with such methodologies and process improvement strategies are enhanced with better communication. The communication must focus on whether the team understands the project charter and whether the team is making progress towards that goal. End-users, software developers and project managers must frequently ask the elementary, simple questions that help identify problems before they fester into near-disasters. While end-user participation, effective communication and teamwork are not sufficient, they are necessary to ensure a good outcome, and their absence will almost surely lead to a bad outcome.\n\nParagraph 9: His parents, Franciszek Trabalski and Maria Trąbalski, born Mackowiack, had immigrated from Poland in 1888.

One of the expressed idea is the promotion of the language as an ASEAN language. In 2022, Ismail Sabri Yaakob, the Prime Minister of Malaysia, proposed the use of Bahasa Melayu (the Malay language) as ASEAN’s second language. Ismail Sabri Yaakob said Malaysia and Indonesia will continue to make efforts to uplift the status of Bahasa Melayu, which may become an ASEAN language one day. The Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka (DBP) Board of Governors chairman Dr Awang Sariyan said that [the] agreement reached by Malaysia and Indonesia to continue to work together to uplift the status of Bahasa Melayu will increase the chance of making it as the ASEAN and international language, because Bahasa Melayu which has about 300 million speakers, was also used in Indonesia, Brunei, Singapore, Thailand, the Philippines, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, Myanmar and Timor Leste, [while] efforts to make Bahasa Melayu as the official language of ASEAN required strong support from all Malay-speaking countries. Nadiem Anwar Makarim, the Minister of Education, Culture, Research, and Technology of Indonesia, remarked that he rejected the suggestion to strengthen Malay language as the ASEAN official language and intermediary language, [and suggested] the aspiration should be reviewed and discussed further at the regional level. Kornelius Purba, the editor of The Jakarta Post, commented that the Malaysian leader wanted to leave a quick legacy, the Minister Nadiem Makarim was blunter in rejecting idea, and could spark unnecessary suspicion from predominantly Buddhist nations such as Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, and Myanmar, or from the predominantly Catholic Philippines. Joanne Lin, a researcher in ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute, commented that this idea the will likely be viewed this as another nationalistic endeavour by Kuala Lumpur or even Ismail Sabri himself to score points on the domestic front, but possibly erode efforts to preserve regional stability and order, and might open the way for a proliferation of similar requests to pour through the floodgates. Rohiman Haroon commented that the use of Malay language in archipelago will continue to grow and, whether the Indonesians like it or not, the language is a deeply rooted Bahasa Melayu. The case against the proposal are Malay is not widely spoken as claimed as Bahasa Indonesia (Indonesian) is the 10th most spoken language in the world, not Bahasa Melayu [which] it could be a case of cultural appropriation,  states might interpret the move as a form of political and cultural dominance, Mandarin is more widely spoken and recognised at the global stage, it is a divisive agenda, member states will question why their respective language can not be the second language, and concerns over additional operational cost to be incurred such as for translators and interpreters.\n\nParagraph 3: Many words common to Boston are also common throughout New England dialects: grinder for \"submarine sandwich\" (also, spuckie or spuky in East Boston), packie (or package store) for \"liquor store\", rotary for \"traffic circle\" (these full-speed circular intersections being common in Greater Boston), and yous as the working-class plural form of \"you\" (a word found throughout the urban Northeast with many spelling variants).

The increased inquiry into the marketing industry has occurred because of the increased commercialism towards kids and marketing in schools. These are just a few of the ideas that have become more saturated in mainstream society. Recently in youth marketing there has been much information and misinformation on this topic despite the issue of youth marketing. In regards to the public opinion of youth marketing, one side that has not been represented is that of the youth marketing industry. This point of view is crucial to understanding the basics to making positive progress on issues related to youth marketing. John C. Geraci, who wrote the article “What do youth marketers think of selling to kids?”, gives an insight as to the mindset of those working in this industry by conducting an online polling. This polling consisted of 878 interviews each around 30 minutes. The interview covered topics such as educational background to ethics in youth marketing.  According to the polling, those that work in youth-oriented careers are 92% more likely to have a four-year degree and less likely to have academic skills specifically for dealing with children.  Most of these people also feel that the ethical standards are on par with other industries. But at the same time they feel that ethics can be a matter of intentions and not results. Usually companies will invest time in producing ad campaigns and products to make sure they are suitable for a youth-oriented market, which means that these ideas can easily be turned over because they are deemed not suitable. In addition, they usually spend large sums of money on market research to ensure products have some educational value for youth and are acceptable to those buying the products. Most ethical procedures in the youth marketing industry occur behind office walls and are usually not seen by the public, media, or politicians, which means that problems that arise with youth marketing don't originate from the people creating the ads but are the result of multiple causes. For example, childhood obesity has not been caused by one ad or product brought out by a marketing company. But it is a health concern that has developed due to multiple factors, that influence how the public reacts to certain ads and products brought out by these companies.\n\nParagraph 8: Many words common to Boston are also common throughout New England dialects: grinder for \"submarine sandwich\" (also, spuckie or spuky in East Boston), packie (or package store) for \"liquor store\", rotary for \"traffic circle\" (these full-speed circular intersections being common in Greater Boston), and yous as the working-class plural form of \"you\" (a word found throughout the urban Northeast with many spelling variants).

The vertebrae were massively shaped, both at the vertebral bodies and at the lateral transverse processes. However, the vertebral bodies were compressed in length, so that the tail appeared rather short overall and generally did not exceed the length of the lower limb sections. The humerus represented a long tube with a bulky lower joint end. The total length was about . Distinctive, ridge-like muscle attachments on the middle shaft were typical. The forearm bones had much shorter lengths, with the spoke measuring about 67 cm, and the ulna  in length. Massive was the femur, which had the broad build characteristic of megatherians and was narrowed in front and behind. It had an average length of 74 cm, the largest bone found so far was  long and  wide. The third trochanter, a prominent muscle attachment point on the shaft, typical of xenarthrans, was absent in Eremotherium as in all other megatherians. The shinbone and fibula were only fused together at the upper end and not also at the lower end as in Megatherium. In this case, the tibia became about 60 cm long. The forelegs ended in hands with three fingers (III to V). The two inner phalanges (I and II) were fused together with some elements of the carpus, such as the great polygonal leg, to form a unit, the metacarpal-carpal complex (MCC). Thus, Eremotherium clearly deviates from Megatherium and other closely related forms, which possessed four-fingered hands. In Eremotherium, the metacarpal of the third digit was the shortest, measuring 19 cm in length, while those of the fourth and fifth were almost the same length,  and  respectively. The phalanx (the third phalanx) of the third and fourth fingers had a long and pointedly curved shape, which suggests correspondingly long claws. The fifth finger had only two phalanges and consequently no claw was formed there. (An exception is the older form E. eomigrans, whose hands, in contrast to other megateria, were still five-fingered, with claws on digits I to IV.) The foot, as in all megatheriids, was also three-fingered (digits III to V). It resembled the hand with an extremely short metatarsal of the third finger. That of the fourth finger reached , that of the fifth  in length. Deviating from the hand, only the middle digit (III) had three phalanges with a terminal phalanx bearing a long claw. The two outer digit had only two phalanges. This structure of the foot is typical for evolved megatherians.\n\nParagraph 4: The uphill journey takes around 290 minutes (4.8 hours), and the downhill journey takes 215 minutes (3.6 hours).

He played in 43 scholastic games for the Bulldogs (42 starts) over four seasons, earning a record of 33–10. His Wilson football teams won two Lancaster-Lebanon League Section 1 titles, the first his freshman year (2000) and the second his junior season (2002). Henne's third scholastic year was his most successful, both individually and as a team. His 2002 Wilson Bulldogs squad finished their regular season undefeated with a record of 10–0 and were the 2002 PIAA District 3 AAAA runner-up, falling to Central Dauphin in a thrilling championship game. He amassed 7,071 passing yards in his high school career, which was fourth-most all-time in PIAA history (and first in PIAA District 3) at the conclusion of the Henne's senior season in the fall of 2003, behind John Veach (Mount Carmel Area), Evan Kraky (Lakeland), and Ron Powlus (Berwick). Henne owns three significant Wilson football program records (as of February 2020): career passing yardage (7,071); career passing touchdowns (74), and most touchdown passes in a game (5; tied). He was named to the Pennsylvania All-State Football Team as a senior in 2003, selected to participate in the 47th Annual Big 33 Football Classic in July 2004, was named the Pennsylvania Football Gatorade Player of the Year for 2003–2004, and earned national recognition as a member of the 2003–2004 Parade High School All-American Football Team. In October 2014, Henne was inducted into the Wilson High School Athletic Hall of Fame. In addition to his football accomplishments, Henne was also a member of the Wilson varsity basketball team for three years as well as an outstanding athlete for the Bulldogs track and field team, finishing as the PIAA runner-up in the javelin as a senior after finishing first at the District 3 meet two weeks earlier. Henne aspires to become a coach at his alma mater following his lengthy NFL career.\n\nParagraph 7: After he was discharged from the Army in 1958, Jarman attended Wilson Junior College, where he met bassist Malachi Favors Maghostut and saxophonists Roscoe Mitchell, Henry Threadgill, and Anthony Braxton. These men would often perform long jam sessions at the suggestion of their professor, Richard Wang (now with Illinois University). Mitchell introduced Jarman to pianist Muhal Richard Abrams, and Jarman, Mitchell, and Maghostut joined Abrams' Experimental Band, a private, non-performing ensemble, when that group was founded in 1961. The same group of musicians continued to play together in a variety of configurations, and went on to found the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians (AACM) in 1965, along with Fred Anderson and Phil Cohran.\n\nParagraph 8: Almost all of the poscranial skeleton is known.

The band made their network television premiere on April 14, 2006, performing \"Hate Me\", the first single from Foiled, on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. They appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live! on June 28, 2006. Blue October was also on Late Night with Conan O'Brien in 2006. On November 14, 2006 Blue October opened for the Rolling Stones in Boise, Idaho. \"Hate Me\" was released to Modern Rock radio stations and quickly climbed to number two on Billboards Modern Rock Tracks chart. \"Hate Me\" remained in the top five of the Modern Rock chart for 20 straight weeks. While in the number two chart position \"Hate Me\" was jumped over twice by both Pearl Jam and the Red Hot Chili Peppers.  \"Hate Me\" would never reach number one. The music video for \"Hate Me\" debuted on VH1, later making a splash at No. 13 on VH1's user-controlled video countdown show VH1 Top 20 Video Countdown. It eventually peaked at No. 2 for the week ending on May 5, 2006.  \"Into the Ocean\", the second single from the album, was released on July 17, 2006. The music video for the song debuted at number three on VH1's The 20 during the show's final week of 2006, and reached the number one spot in mid-February 2007. \"Into the Ocean\" hit number 20 on the Modern Rock Tracks.

{"input": "", "context": "Paragraph 1: The economics of education literature and the economic education literature is especially critical.  For example, Weinberg et al. (2009) finds SET scores in first-year economics courses at Ohio State University are positively related to the grades instructors assign but are unrelated to learning outcomes once grades are controlled for. Others have also found a positive relationship between grades and SET scores but unlike Weinberg et al. (2009) do not directly address the relationship between SET scores and learning outcomes.  A paper by Krautmann and Sander (1999) find that the grades students expect to receive in a course are positively related to SET scores. Isely and Singh (2005) find it is the difference between the grades students expect to receive and their cumulative GPA that is the relevant variable for obtaining favourable course evaluations.  Another paper by Carrell and West (2010) use a data set from the U.S. Air Force Academy where students are randomly assigned to course sections (reducing selection problems).  It found that calculus students got higher marks on common course examinations when they had instructors with high SET scores but did worse when they took later courses requiring calculus.   The authors discuss a number of possible explanations for this finding, including that instructors with higher SET scores may have concentrated their teaching on the common examinations in the course rather than giving students a deeper understanding for later courses.  Hamermesh and West (2005) find that students at the University of Texas at Austin gave attractive instructors higher SET scores than less attractive instructors. However, the authors conclude that it may not be possible to determine if attractiveness increases the effectiveness of an instructor, possibly resulting in better learning outcomes.  It may be the case that students pay more attention to attractive instructors. Meanwhile, a 2017 lawsuit was filed on grounds of xenophobic discrimination in course evaluations at the University of Kansas, with Peter F. Lake, the director of Stetson University's Center for Excellence in Higher Education Law and Policy, suggesting this is no isolated incident.\n\nParagraph 2: On November 10 in Korakuen Hall, Nakamura was renamed to Ben-K, based on the legend of 12th century warrior monk Saitō Musashibō Benkei. In his first match as Ben-K, he and Shun Watanabe (now known as Shun Skywalker) lost to Jimmy Susumu and Jimmy Kagetora. On December 25 at Final Gate 2016, he got his first title shot in Dragon Gate, pairing up with Kotoka and Masato Yoshino to challenge for the Open the Triangle Gate Championship in a three-way match won by the Jimmyz (Jimmy Kanda, Jimmy Susumu and Ryo \"Jimmy\" Saito). In early 2017, Naruki Doi and Big R Shimizu made a call to the entire roster, looking for a third man to help them challenge for the Triangle Gate belts. Ben accepted, and on March 20, they defeated VerserK (Shingo Takagi, T-Hawk and \"brother\" Yasshi) to win the vacant titles. On May 4, Doi and Yoshino announced the formation of their new stable, known as \"MaxiMuM\", with Kotoka, Big R Shimizu and Ben-K announced as the members, along with themselves. During May, Ben-K took part in his first King of Gate tournament, but struggled greatly, earning just one win over Yosuke♥Santa Maria. On July 1, MaxiMuM dropped the Triangle Gate titles to VerserK (Shingo Takagi, El Lindaman and Takashi Yoshida). On November 3 at the Gate of Destiny, Ben-K and Big R Shimizu, who called themselves \"Big Ben\", unsuccessfully challenged Cima and Dragon Kid for the Open the Twin Gate Championship. On February 11, 2018, he received a non-title singles match against then Open the Dream Gate Champion Masaaki Mochizuki, in which he dominated and beat the champion in just over two minutes. After the match, he challenged Mochizuki to a match for the Dream Gate title, which was accepted and set up for March 4 at Champion Gate in Osaka. After 23 minutes, Ben-K lost a hard-fought bout by referee's decision and failed to capture the title. On May 6 at Dead or Alive, Big Ben won the Twin Gate championships, defeating Antias (Eita and T-Hawk). Ben-K once again entered the King of Gate tournament in 2018 and fared much better than the previous year. He earned 5 points, however, a loss to Yamato eliminated him. On July 22 at Kobe World Pro Wrestling Festival, Big Ben lost the Twin Gate titles to Tribe Vanguard (BxB Hulk and Yamato) and not long after Big R Shimizu turned his back on MaxiMuM and joined heel unit Antias, effectively breaking up Big Ben. However, the break-up would not last long, as on September 6 in Korakuen, Ben-K himself turned heel for the first time in his career, betraying MaxiMuM to join Antias with Big R.\n\nParagraph 3: On November 10 in Korakuen Hall, Nakamura was renamed to Ben-K, based on the legend of 12th century warrior monk Saitō Musashibō Benkei.

Catching \"berried\" crabs (females carrying eggs) is illegal, but since ovigerous females remain in pits dug in the sediment and do not feed, fishing pressure does not affect the supply of larvae. Minimum landing sizes (MLSs) for C. pagurus are set by both the European Union technical regulations and by the UK government. Different minimum sizes are employed in different geographical areas, to reflect differences in the crab's growth rate across its range. In particular, the \"Cromer crab\" fishery along the coasts of Suffolk, Norfolk and Lincolnshire is subject to an MLS of , rather than the  MLS in most of the species' range. An intermediate value of  is used in the rest of the North Sea between the 56°N and the Essex–Kent border, and in the Irish Sea south of 55°N. Around Devon, Cornwall, and the Isles of Scilly, the MLS for males is different  () from females (). The Norwegian catch is 8,500 tons annually, compared to 20,000 tons in the United Kingdom, 13,000 tons in Ireland, 8,500 tons in France, and a total 45,000 tons globally. Recent studies have shown that edible crabs are negatively affected by electromagnetic fields  emitted from sub-sea power cables around offshore wind farms.\n\nParagraph 5: A number of legal restrictions apply to the catching of C. pagurus.

The police selected an area and conversed with men to see if they would be solicited for sex under the 1974 statute defining fourth degree sodomy as actual or solicitation of consensual sodomy.  As Wasson left The Bar Complex, a Lexington gay bar, to walk to his car, an undercover officer engaged Wasson in the parking lot and taped approximately 20 minutes of a conversation with Wasson. Near the end of the conversation Wasson invited the officer to come home with him. When prodded for details, Wasson suggested sexual activities that violated the Kentucky statute prohibiting homosexual activity. Wasson was one of 29 men arrested during this police sting, along with notable later gay rights activists like Brandon DeSiata.  Rather than paying the fine, he sought legal representation to contest the law.   In its recitation of the facts, the Kentucky Supreme Court noted that there \"was no suggestion that sexual activity would occur anyplace other than in the privacy of Wasson's home. The sexual activity was intended to have been between consenting adults. No money was offered or solicited.\"\n\nParagraph 7: \"Violently Happy\" received generally positive reviews from music critics. It was defined \"bittersweet\" by Heather Phares of AllMusic, and \"insanely addictive\" by Sean McCarthy of The Daily Vault, which also deemed its title as \"one of the best song titles of all time\". The Daily Telegraph'''s journalist Emily Bearn noticed that \"Violently Happy\" finds her making guttural noises at the sea: \"I tip-toe down to the shore/Stand by the ocean/Make it roar at me/And I roar back\". Brantley Bardin of Details commented that \"songs like “Violently Happy” summed up a worldview that put all its faith in emotional abandon instead of logic. “Too much cleverness,” says Björk, “is the worst disease in the world. It ruins everything. Give us a laugh—make us happy\". Brad Beatnik from Music Weeks RM Dance Update wrote, \"A typical fourth single, this might not be quite as immediate as her previous hits but it still has some damn fine moments.\" In particular, Simon Reynolds of The New York Times praised the song generally, \"The title of 'Violently Happy' captures the Björk effect perfectly: a gush and rush of euphoria, a tidal wave of oceanic feeling. Over the song's brisk house beats, Björk stammers as she struggles to express feelings of excitement so intense she seems on the brink of leaping out of her skin: 'I'm driving my car too fast with ecstatic music on/I'm daring people to jump off roofs with me.' In the end, she and Mr. Hooper resort to studio wizardry to gesture at inexpressible feelings, sampling one syllable and turning it into a stuttering vocal tic\". Johnny Dee from NME commented, \"More fun, madness and surprise follows\", noting its \"pulsating grind\". Sylvia Patterson from Smash Hits gave it four out of five, writing, \"Not quite the jovial rejoicings of \"Big Time Sensuality\" but a giant of space-dance majesty, nonetheless.\" Troy J. Augusto from Variety described it as \"a smoothly twisted tune\". David Petrilla from The Weekender stated that the singer \"is aiming directly at the dance floor\" with the song.\n\nParagraph 8: The economics of education literature and the economic education literature is especially critical.

In succeeding years the company built automobiles, including the American Mors, the Skelton, and the Standard Six. The St. Louis Aircraft Corporation division of the company partnered with the Huttig Sash and Door company in 1917 to produce aircraft. During the two world wars, the company manufactured gliders, trainers, alligators, flying boats, and dirigible gondolas.  Among their most successful products were the Birney Safety Car and the PCC streetcar, a design that was very popular at the time.\n\nParagraph 10: Jeffrey Wasson, a 23-year-old nursing student, was arrested in 1986 and charged with solicitation of same-sex sodomy as the result of an undercover sting operation conducted by the Lexington police.

Located approximately  northeast of Colombo, adjacent to the Bandaranaike International Airport, the Katunayake KTZ  covers  and is the largest of the country's eight FTZs. It is governed by the Sri Lankan Board of Investment. In order to attract foreign investment the government provides a number of incentives, including duty-free import and exports, preferential tax, double taxation relief and up to 100% foreign ownership. The Katunayake FTZ houses over one hundred multinational industries, predominantly in the garment and clothing industry. From its inception the FTZ the workforce was predominantly young female migrants from rural villages, mainly from economically and socially marginalised groups.\n\nParagraph 3: The Isuzu VehiCROSS (UGS250) is a compact SUV from Isuzu. Produced from 1997 through 2001 (Japanese market 1997–1999; US market 1999–2001), it shares many of its components with the Trooper, including both its 3.2 L and 3.5 L V6 engine that produces  at 5400 rpm and  of torque at 3000 rpm. The vehicle also features the Torque on Demand (TOD) 4-wheel-drive system produced by BorgWarner. It is a small, sporty 2-door crossover vehicle with aggressive external styling, including short overhangs, an aggressive forward stance, titanium \"teeth\" in the grille, a black hood-insert, and black plastic cladding over the entire lower half of the vehicle. The US VehiCROSS came equipped with 16\" polished wheels in 1999 and 18\" chrome wheels during the remainder of production. The Japanese version came equipped with 16\" alloys with chrome center caps.\n\nParagraph 4: After he graduated at the Belgrade Music Academy, Simjanović turned towards music for film, theatre and television. He debuted in this field in 1973, with music for children's television series Slike bez rama – iz dečijih knjiga (Frameless Pictures – From Children's Books). Another significant contribution as a composer in the field of television was the theme for the newscast Dnevnik in 1979, recorded with the participation of members from Korni Grupa. In 1975, he wrote music for Srđan Karanović's TV series The Unpicked Strawberries, and in 1977 he wrote music for his first feature film, Goran Marković's Special Education. His cooperation with Karanović and Marković would continue during the following decades. The most notable films for which he wrote music were Special Education (1977), Fragrance of Wild Flowers (1977), National Class Category Up to 785 ccm (1979), Petria's Wreath (1980), All That Jack's (1980), Do You Remember Dolly Bell? (1981), The Marathon Family (1982), Variola Vera (1982), Something in Between (1983), Balkan Express (1983), Taiwan Canasta (1985), Hard to Swallow (1985), When Father Was Away on Business (1985), Hey Babu Riba (1986), The Beauty of Vice (1986), Reflections (1987), Guardian Angel (1987), A Film with No Name (1988), Cognac (1988), Balkan Express 2 (1988), Time of Miracles (1989), The Meeting Point (1989), Virgina (1991), Tango Argentino (1992), Tito and Me (1992), Say Why Have You Left Me (1993), The Tragic Burlesque (1995), Cabaret Balkan (1998), Serbia, Year Zero (2001), Loving Glances (2003), Midwinter Night's Dream (2004), The Tour (2008), Solemn Promise (2009), Falsifier (2013). Until his death in 2021, he has written music scores for 65 feature films. At the Pula Film Festival he was awarded the Golden Arena for Best Film Music twice, for The Fragrance of Wild Flowers in 1978 and for Balkan Express in 1983. In 1983, he shared the Special Award of the City of Valencia with Yves Montand. For that occasion he wrote music for the opening of that year's Festival in Valencia.

The Danish specialist Kim Ryholt has suggested that Yaqub-Har was a king of the late 14th Dynasty and the last one of this dynasty to be known from contemporary attestations. Ryholt points to a scarab seal of Yaqub-Har which was discovered during excavations in Tel Shikmona in modern-day Israel. The archaeological context of the seal was dated to the MB IIB period (Middle Bronze Age 1750 BC-1650 BC), which means that Yaqub-Har predated the 15th Dynasty. Since the name \"Yaqub-Har\" may have a West Semitic origin, meaning \"Protected by Har\", Yaqub-Har would then be a 14th Dynasty ruler. Ryholt's argument is based on the observation that while early Hyksos kings of the 15th Dynasty, such as Sakir-Har, used the title Heka-Khawaset, later Hyksos rulers adopted the traditional Egyptian royal titulary. This change happened under Khyan, who ruled as the Heka-Khawaset early in his reign, but later adopted the Egyptian prenomen Seuserenre. Later Hyksos kings, such as Apophis, abandoned the Heka-Khawaset title and retained instead the customary Egyptian prenomen, just like the kings of the 14th Dynasty. Ryholt then notes that Yaqub-Har himself always used a prenomen, Meruserre, which suggests that he either ruled at the end of the 15th Dynasty or was a member of the Asiatic 14th Dynasty. Since the end of the 15th Dynasty is known not to have included a ruler by the name of Meruserre, Ryholt concludes that Yaqub-Har was a 14th Dynasty ruler.\n\nParagraph 7: In 1977 the country's United National Party government introduced an open-economy policy, which led to the creation in 1978 of the country's first Free-trade zone (FTZ), currently known as an Export Processing Zone, in Katunayake.

From its inception the FTZ the workforce was predominantly young female migrants from rural villages, mainly from economically and socially marginalised groups.\n\nParagraph 8: Holocaust began having difficulties with his armor and was forced to seek out assistance from the Dark Beast, another survivor from the Age of Apocalypse. While conducting experiments on Holocaust's exoskeleton, the villains were assaulted by Shi'ar shock troopers, who took them into custody. Along with Nate Grey and the Sugar Man, they learned that their bodies carried a \"shimmering\" of energy from the M'Kraan Crystal after passing through it, drawing some of the crystal's infinite power away. The Shi'ar considered this blasphemous and a desecration of their sacred crystal. Holocaust's crime was considered the most heinous, as he still hosted an actual fragment of the crystal from another dimension inside his armor. Holocaust and the Dark Beast were forced into an unlikely alliance with their rivals, Nate Grey and Sugar Man. As they tried to escape the Shi'ar starcraft, Holocaust couldn't resist turning on Grey and trying to kill him during their melee with the Shi'ar guards. Grey struck back by telekinetically ripping the crystal shard out of Holocaust's chest, tearing him up from the inside. As Grey pulverized the crystal, the implosion of M'Kraan energies sucked out the residual shimmering from the Age of Apocalypse refugees, cleansing them of their connection to the crystal. A surprising consequence was that Holocaust reverted into his original human appearance as Nemesis, before flipping to become Holocaust again. McCoy explained that shape-changing was always a potential feature of Holocaust's armor, but he hid the exoskeleton's true potential from the Horseman because they were rivals back in the day. Holocaust and McCoy teleported away, as the Dark Beast promised to show Nemesis all that he was capable of.\n\nParagraph 9: Anime Evolution was originally known as Anime Showcase, and was held in 1998 by the SFU ARC club. It was a two-day showing of anime that was supposed to be held annually, with the help of the Vancouver Japanese Animation Society, the University of British Columbia Anime Club, and V-SWAT. In 2001 it was renamed Anime Evolution and in 2003 became a full anime convention. It has grown each year since 1999, and had attendance of over 4,200 people in 2007. In 2008, due to booking issues, it was held at the University of British Columbia (UBC), Vancouver, B.C., rather than its past location at Simon Fraser University (SFU), Burnaby, B.C. In 2010, AE Convention Corp faced a lawsuit enforced by the Canadian Tax Revenue Agency after fraudulent financial statements arose about the convention. Causing the convention to be momentarily defunct. After the lawsuit ended in 2011, Anime Evolution 2011 was cancelled, and future AE Convention Corp sponsored conventions were put on hiatus. Anime Evolution returned in 2012 under the same team but was renamed as the Vancouver Anime Convention Society and ran as a shortened, 2-day version of the convention in November, dubbed Anime Evolution: Akimatsuri.  In 2013, Anime Evolution returned to the 3-day summer event format, celebrating its 10th anniversary. In 2014, Anime Evolution teamed up with Cos & Effect and Vancouver Gaming Expo to create Northwest Fan Fest. In 2015, Anime Evolution split from Northwest Fan Fest to once again function as a stand-alone 3-day convention, in addition to their spring event Harumatsuri (previous JFest), and their fall/winter event Akimatsuri. In 2017, Anime Evolution announced that their summer event would only be a 1-day event. On June 26, 2018, they announced on their Facebook Page that the summer convention would not be occurring that year. Since 2017, Anime Evolution has yet to re-run their main summer event.\n\nParagraph 10: Holocaust began having difficulties with his armor and was forced to seek out assistance from the Dark Beast, another survivor from the Age of Apocalypse.

The greatest of these is the Cosmic Cube, a device capable of altering reality. However, A.I.M. does not realize that the cube is merely a containment device, in which the real power is an entity accidentally drawn into their dimension. The Cosmic Cube eventually evolves into Kubik. Their second achievement is the Super-Adaptoid, an android capable of mimicking the appearance and superpowers of other beings, which is made possible by incorporating a sliver of the Cosmic Cube into its form. When Kubik repossesses the sliver after defeating the Adaptoid, the android is rendered inanimate. A.I.M.'s third and final major achievement is the creation of MODOK (Mental Organism Designed Only for Killing), an artificially mutated human with an enormous head accompanied by a massive computational brain and psionic abilities. MODOK is originally an A.I.M. scientist named George Tarleton, who was selected by A.I.M.'s leader at the time, the Scientist Supreme, to be the subject of the bionic and genetic experiments that turned him into MODOK. After his transformation, MODOK kills the Scientist Supreme and takes control of A.I.M., and later takes advantage of the chaos in HYDRA's organization following HYDRA Island's destruction and the deaths of Baron Strucker and most of HYDRA's leading members to sever all of A.I.M.'s ties with HYDRA. A.I.M. has remained independent ever since.\n\nParagraph 12: The protagonist, Bruce Delamitiri, is an artist who works in the motion picture industry. Many people in the US think that, by making these movies, Bruce makes killing cool. Numerous characters throughout the book imply that he encourages everyone who's watching these movies to kill for fun. Bruce, on the other hand, defends himself by telling everyone that he doesn't think he encourages anyone to do anything. He says that there has always been violence but humans are not like robots; seeing something on the screen does not necessarily make us want to do it ourselves (p. 13 \"people get up from the movie theatre or the TV and do what they just saw\"). He also claims that he is just showing existing violence. Unfortunately for Bruce, Wayne and Scout (a pair of psychopaths known in the media as the \"Mall Murderers\") have formulated a plan to hold him hostage and have him publicly announce that his movies are responsible for their crimes so they can avoid the death penalty (Wayne has a lengthy speech giving examples of how in America it is possible to be guilty and innocent at the same time.) As the novel progresses, Bruce and a critically injured Brooke Daniels are joined inside his house by his wife and daughter and a TV camera crew. The siege reaches its climax as Wayne holds a ratings monitor and announces on live TV that he will spare the hostages if everyone stops watching the siege in the next few minutes - however, this does not happen and he begins firing as the LAPD begin a frantic attempt to subdue him. Many of the characters die in the ensuing violence and the epilogue of the story reveals grim details as to how all the survivors have found a way of escaping responsibility for the tragedy using varying routes from lawsuits and finding religion to making documentaries which explicitly blame everyone else. The book ends with the line \"No one has taken responsibility\" — echoing an earlier rant by Bruce that we have created a blame free society in which any problem or shortcoming can be blamed on others rather than accepting responsibility for our own actions.\n\nParagraph 13: The Isuzu VehiCROSS (UGS250) is a compact SUV from Isuzu. Produced from 1997 through 2001 (Japanese market 1997–1999; US market 1999–2001), it shares many of its components with the Trooper, including both its 3.2 L and 3.5 L V6 engine that produces  at 5400 rpm and  of torque at 3000 rpm. The vehicle also features the Torque on Demand (TOD) 4-wheel-drive system produced by BorgWarner. It is a small, sporty 2-door crossover vehicle with aggressive external styling, including short overhangs, an aggressive forward stance, titanium \"teeth\" in the grille, a black hood-insert, and black plastic cladding over the entire lower half of the vehicle. The US VehiCROSS came equipped with 16\" polished wheels in 1999 and 18\" chrome wheels during the remainder of production. The Japanese version came equipped with 16\" alloys with chrome center caps.\n\nParagraph 14: The Isuzu VehiCROSS (UGS250) is a compact SUV from Isuzu.

The Danish specialist Kim Ryholt has suggested that Yaqub-Har was a king of the late 14th Dynasty and the last one of this dynasty to be known from contemporary attestations. Ryholt points to a scarab seal of Yaqub-Har which was discovered during excavations in Tel Shikmona in modern-day Israel. The archaeological context of the seal was dated to the MB IIB period (Middle Bronze Age 1750 BC-1650 BC), which means that Yaqub-Har predated the 15th Dynasty. Since the name \"Yaqub-Har\" may have a West Semitic origin, meaning \"Protected by Har\", Yaqub-Har would then be a 14th Dynasty ruler. Ryholt's argument is based on the observation that while early Hyksos kings of the 15th Dynasty, such as Sakir-Har, used the title Heka-Khawaset, later Hyksos rulers adopted the traditional Egyptian royal titulary. This change happened under Khyan, who ruled as the Heka-Khawaset early in his reign, but later adopted the Egyptian prenomen Seuserenre. Later Hyksos kings, such as Apophis, abandoned the Heka-Khawaset title and retained instead the customary Egyptian prenomen, just like the kings of the 14th Dynasty. Ryholt then notes that Yaqub-Har himself always used a prenomen, Meruserre, which suggests that he either ruled at the end of the 15th Dynasty or was a member of the Asiatic 14th Dynasty. Since the end of the 15th Dynasty is known not to have included a ruler by the name of Meruserre, Ryholt concludes that Yaqub-Har was a 14th Dynasty ruler.\n\nParagraph 16: Holocaust began having difficulties with his armor and was forced to seek out assistance from the Dark Beast, another survivor from the Age of Apocalypse.

He was investigated on more than one occasion but nothing was ever proved. His detractors claim he was a looter; his supporters say that these accusations came from those who disliked his manner and his military success. William's brother, the Rev. G.

This statement is incompatible with Sir Henry Daly's. Sir Henry Norman stated that to his personal knowledge Hodson remitted several thousand pounds to Calcutta which could only have been obtained by looting. On the other hand, again, Hodson died a poor man; his effects, which included a ring, watch, Bible and Prayer book, and a miniature, were sold for only £170. General remarked \"there was nothing in his boxes but what an officer might legitimately and honourably have in his possession.\" His widow did not have money enough to pay for her passage home and she had to apply to the Compassionate Fund for assistance, which was granted.

Following the match, Cross was approached by Austin Aries, who asked Cross to team with him later night against the No Remorse Corps (NRC) to which Cross agreed. The pair were then attacked by NRC members Roderick Strong and Davey Richards. Cross and Aries won the tag team encounter, but during the match Cross performed a springboard plancha outside the ring, landing on the guardrail and sustaining several cuts. The team of Aries and Cross were later joined by Erick Stevens, with the three being named The Resilience. At This Means War II in April, The Resilience lost a six-man elimination match to the NRC (Strong, Richards, and Rocky Romero). At Reborn Again in May, Cross and Stevens teamed with Bryan Danielson in a loss to the NRC in a six-man tag team match.

At Motor City Madness 2007 on September 14, Cross and Aries unsuccessfully challenged the Briscoe Brothers (Jay and Mark) for the ROH World Tag Team Championship. At the Man Up pay-per-view taping the following night, Cross lost to NRC member Romero in a singles match. The next month, at the taping of Undeniable, Cross and Stevens lost a tag team match to Romero and Richards. The match carried the stipulation that whoever was pinned would be suspended, and because Cross was pinned, he was suspended from ROH for two months.\n\nParagraph 3: In 1997, First Media merged with the Meredith Corporation, which already owned Fox affiliate WOFL (channel 35). At the time, duopolies were not allowed, and Meredith decided to keep WOFL (which was sold to Fox Television Stations in 2002), along with First Media's two other stations WHNS in Asheville, North Carolina and KPDX in Portland, Oregon.  In June 1997, Meredith swapped WCPX to what was then known as Post-Newsweek Stations in exchange for Hartford, Connecticut's WFSB (which at the time was Post-Newsweek's flagship station).  The trade reunited WCPX with KSAT-TV in San Antonio, which Outlet, in 1986, sold to H&C Communications (former owner of WESH and of another Post-Newsweek sister station, KPRC-TV in Houston) and then sold by H&C to Post-Newsweek in 1994. On January 30, 1998, the station changed its callsign to WKMG in honor of longtime Washington Post publisher, Katharine M. Graham, with the WCPX call letters going to Chicago's Pax TV (now Ion Television) station in August of that same year. As of recently, WKMG is the last \"Big Six\" affiliate in Orlando that is not part of any television duopoly (Fox's WOFL and WRBW, Cox Media Group's WFTV and WRDQ, and Hearst Television's WESH and WKCF). Post-Newsweek Stations became Graham Media Group on July 28, 2014.\n\nParagraph 4: McCaughey formed the band in 1993 as a side project with Buck, Jon Auer and Ken Stringfellow of The Posies.  Buck had moved to the Seattle area in 1992; the other principals were longtime fixtures of the Seattle music scene.  The four musicians had numerous personal and professional connections: both the Posies and McCaughey's The Young Fresh Fellows had recorded at Conrad Uno's Egg Studios and released albums on Uno's PopLlama Records label.  The Young Fresh Fellows and The Posies were fixtures of Seattle's Crocodile Cafe, owned and managed by Buck's then-girlfriend (later wife) Stephanie Dorgan.  The Young Fresh Fellows were the opening band at a Kevn Kinney gig at the Croc On July 4, 1992; Buck backed Kinney along with R.E.M.'s Mike Mills and Bill Berry.\n\nParagraph 5: The following night at Fifth Year Festival: Chicago however, Cross won his first match in ROH when he was victorious in a four-corner survival match, defeating Shingo, CJ Otis, and Trik Davis. Following the match, Cross was approached by Austin Aries, who asked Cross to team with him later night against the No Remorse Corps (NRC) to which Cross agreed. The pair were then attacked by NRC members Roderick Strong and Davey Richards. Cross and Aries won the tag team encounter, but during the match Cross performed a springboard plancha outside the ring, landing on the guardrail and sustaining several cuts. The team of Aries and Cross were later joined by Erick Stevens, with the three being named The Resilience. At This Means War II in April, The Resilience lost a six-man elimination match to the NRC (Strong, Richards, and Rocky Romero). At Reborn Again in May, Cross and Stevens teamed with Bryan Danielson in a loss to the NRC in a six-man tag team match. In June, Cross, Stevens, and Delirious defeated the NRC in a six-man tag team match, before Cross lost the Richards in a singles match the following night at Domination. Cross appeared at the Driven pay-per-view on June 22, when he, Stevens, and Delirious lost to the NRC. At Death Before Dishonor V: Night 2 in August, The Resilience and Delirious lost a Philadelphia Street Fight to the NRC and Matt Sydal. The Resilience went on to defeat Richards, Jason Blade, and Eddie Edwards, before Cross and Stevens defeated Mike Quackenbush and Jigsaw at Manhattan Mayhem II.

The lake is 1.6 km wide, 29 km long, and up to 152 m deep. In prehistoric time, the lake was much longer, perhaps 20x,  with adjacent silt cliffs defining ancient lake bottoms 100 meters higher than present water levels.   At the outlet near Savona, a large tumbled rock, gravel moraine indicates the toe of a glacier once melted away here.  The community of Savona is located at the west end of the lake, near the Thompson River outlet. The city of Kamloops is located a few miles east of the head of the lake, at the confluence of the North and South Thompson Rivers.  The name, Kamloops, derives from a local Indigenous word, Tk’emlúps, meaning a meeting of waters. \n\nParagraph 7: McCaughey formed the band in 1993 as a side project with Buck, Jon Auer and Ken Stringfellow of The Posies.

During this era, the most intense period of volcanism — including frequent large and moderate eruptions — occurred around 6500–6400 BC, 2250–2000 BC, and AD 50–650. This coincides with the peak of activity in other Kamchatka volcanoes. The current active period started around 900 BC. Since then, the large and moderate eruptions have been following each other at 50 to 400 year-long intervals. Catastrophic eruptions took place in 1854 and 1957, when a large part of the lava dome collapsed and created a devastating debris avalanche.\n\nParagraph 5: An oil bath air cleaner consists of a sump containing a pool of oil, and an insert which is filled with fiber, mesh, foam, or another coarse filter media. The cleaner removes particles by adhering them to the oil-soaked filter media rather than traditional filtration, the openings in the filter media are much larger than the particles that are to be filtered. When the cleaner is assembled, the media-containing body of the insert sits a short distance above the surface of the oil pool. The rim of the insert overlaps the rim of the sump. This arrangement forms a labyrinthine path through which the air must travel in a series of U-turns: up through the gap between the rims of the insert and the sump, down through the gap between the outer wall of the insert and the inner wall of the sump, and up through the filter media in the body of the insert. This U-turn takes the air at high velocity across the surface of the oil pool. Larger and heavier dust and dirt particles in the air cannot make the turn due to their inertia, so they fall into the oil and settle to the bottom of the base bowl. Lighter and smaller particles stick to the filtration media in the insert, which is wetted by oil droplets aspirated there into by normal airflow. The constant aspiration of oil onto the filter media slowly carries most of the finer trapped particles downward and the oil drips back into the reservoir where the particles accumulate.\n\nParagraph 6: The McQueen family is a fictional family in the Channel 4 soap opera Hollyoaks.

As with most 20th-century second-term midterms, the party not holding the presidency made significant gains. The Republican opposition made a net gain of five seats, taking advantage of the Democratic administration's declining popularity during the Cold War and the aftermath of the Recession of 1949.

{"input": "", "context": "Paragraph 1: Cash, Kavenagh and Jones spent the remainder of May and the first few weeks of June 1843 at Mount Dromadery or with the Blackburns at nearby Cobb Hill.  On the evening of Wednesday, June 21, they bailed up the Half-way House, an inn kept by Edward Greenbank on the road between Oatlands and Ross at a rural locality called Antill Ponds in the Salt Pan Plains district.  After the outlaws departed Greenbank instructed his ticket-of-leave servant to ride to Oatlands to report the robbery.  The bushrangers went directly from the Half-way House to William Kimberley’s homestead, two miles to the east.  After shooting the lock and entering, they saw a constable, who had been sent to guard the house, in the process of exiting through a window.  Fearful of a possible ambush the outlaws left soon afterwards and cautiously made their way through the night to a nearby hut belonging to Samuel Smith, one of Cash’s old acquaintances.  Leaving their knapsacks by the door they entered the hut and greeted the occupants.  Just as they began to share a bottle of liquor with Smith and his two companions, they heard a voice from outside: “Surround the hut; we have them, here’s their swag”.  A party of seven soldiers and three constables sent from Oatlands had caught up with them at the hut.  In Cash’s description, in reply he grabbed his gun, opened the door and “discharged both barrels to the right and left”.  Kavenagh and Jones gathered their arms, extinguished the light and the three left the hut, firing as they went.  In the darkness the only light was the flash of gunfire as the parties returned fire.  In Cash’s words: “This was merely random firing, the darkness of the night preventing us from seeing each other, neither had either side the wish to get into close quarters”.  More than a hundred shots were fired in the exchange between the parties, resulting in one of the soldiers receiving a slight wound.  After the firing had finished the three outlaws laid low in the darkness, hiding themselves behind logs and trees while the soldiers and constables “were beating the bush for them”.  The equipment they lost as a result of the skirmish at Antill Ponds included their telescope and bullet mould. \n\nParagraph 2: Edward Joseph Pipkin Jr. (born November 1, 1956) is an American activist, politician, and Republican former member of the Maryland State Senate, had represented Maryland's 36th Senate district, and was first elected in 2002 and served until 2013.  Prior to his election to the state senate, he worked in the field of business finance, trading bonds in New York City.  He also founded an environmental group known as \"Citizens Against Bay Dumping,\" during which he was successful in lobbying for legislation that banned irresponsible disposal of dredge spoils in the Chesapeake Bay.  Pipkin currently lives in Dallas. In 2004, he unsuccessfully ran for the U.S. Senate against Barbara Mikulski.  Then, in 2008, he unsuccessfully ran for Congress in Maryland's 1st congressional district, against incumbent Wayne Gilchrest and State Senator Andy Harris, losing the primary to Andy Harris. On August 5, 2013, Pipkin announced he would retire from the State Senate to attend graduate school.\n\nParagraph 3: The original SMA correlator was designed to correlate 2 GHz of IF bandwidth per sideband from each of two active receivers in eight antennas, producing spectral data for 28 baselines.    Because the analog-to-digital converters sampled at 208 MHz, the IF was downconverted into 24 partially overlapping \"chunks\", each 104 MHz wide, before sampling.  After sampling, the data were sent to 90 large PC boards, each of which held 32 ASIC correlator chips.   The correlator was an XF design; in the default configuration 6144 lags were calculated for each of two receivers on 28 baselines, before an FFT was applied to convert the lag data to spectra.   In the default configuration the spectral resolution was 812.5 kHz per channel, but the correlator could be reconfigured to increase the spectral resolution on certain chunks, at the expense of lower resolution elsewhere in the spectrum.  The correlator chips were designed at MIT Haystack, and funded by five institutions: SMA, USNO, NASA, NRFA and JIVE.    The correlator could also be configured to correlate all 45 baselines produced by adding the CSO and JCMT to the array, but only for a single receiver per antenna.\n\nParagraph 4: The original SMA correlator was designed to correlate 2 GHz of IF bandwidth per sideband from each of two active receivers in eight antennas, producing spectral data for 28 baselines.

This allegiance began threatening his career as early as 2005, only two years into his term, when reports emerged that the hard-right was engaging in branch stacking in Hawkesbury as a prelude to a possible preselection challenge. Several months later, in the wake of the resignation of moderate Opposition Leader John Brogden (politician), Pringle was one of a number of MPs who reportedly had their preselection threatened if they did not vote for the hard-right's preferred candidate, Peter Debnam, as Brogden's replacement, a campaign which ultimately sparked the withdrawal of Debnam's only opponent Barry O'Farrel from the race. A State Electorate boundary redistribution altered the balance between moderate and right branches.   The tensions from the previous year were confirmed when, on 2 September 2006, Australian politician Ray Williams, a Baulkham Hills Shire Councillor backed by the hard-right faction, challenged Pringle. This came in the wake of reports that numbers in one branch in Pringle's electorate had swelled from 17 to 500 (with none actually living in the suburb) due to an influx of Lebanese Australian members, and public allegations by Howard Crawford, party president for the nearby electoral district of Londonderry that a campaign of \"branch-stacking, malpractice and political promises\" was being used to undermine Pringle. Reports also emerged during the campaign that Williams had claimed that he could secure a $100,000 donation to the party from a property development company if he were elected, which later sparked controversy and an enforced veto of the move from party leader Peter Debnam. Pringle was endorsed by Debnam to remain as a member of parliament. Although Debnam's intervention had saved numerous sitting members under attack over the previous year, it was not enough to save Pringle, who was defeated by Williams on 15 October. It was subsequently reported that Pringle had obtained approximately 50% of the local branch vote in spite of the branch stacking, but had been soundly defeated by the votes of the hard right-dominated state council and state executive. Pringle responded to news of his preselection defeat by declaring \"betrayal and disgust\" at what had occurred, labeling Debnam either \"lying or impotent\". He resigned from the Liberal Party during Question Time in Parliament on 17 October, announcing his intention to serve out his term as an independent, and recontest his seat as an independent. The government used its numbers to suspend standing orders so Pringle could speak at a time of maximum coverage, and in an explosive attack  Pringle criticized Clarke, Debnam and the Liberal Party, claiming that the party was being controlled by \"an exclusive sect\" – referring to Clarke's membership of Opus Dei – labelling Clarke \"the Godfather\", and calling the preselection \"an absolute rort\". He further accused the party of being preoccupied with issues such as homosexuality and drug injecting rooms, instead of the real issues of health, transport, education and the environment and claimed that it \"does not deserve to govern\".\n\nParagraph 6: Though he held Christian beliefs, and attended the same parliamentary prayer group as hard-right factional power-broker David Clarke, he was always aligned with the party's moderate faction.

He further accused the party of being preoccupied with issues such as homosexuality and drug injecting rooms, instead of the real issues of health, transport, education and the environment and claimed that it \"does not deserve to govern\".\n\nParagraph 7: Cash, Kavenagh and Jones spent the remainder of May and the first few weeks of June 1843 at Mount Dromadery or with the Blackburns at nearby Cobb Hill.  On the evening of Wednesday, June 21, they bailed up the Half-way House, an inn kept by Edward Greenbank on the road between Oatlands and Ross at a rural locality called Antill Ponds in the Salt Pan Plains district.  After the outlaws departed Greenbank instructed his ticket-of-leave servant to ride to Oatlands to report the robbery.  The bushrangers went directly from the Half-way House to William Kimberley’s homestead, two miles to the east.  After shooting the lock and entering, they saw a constable, who had been sent to guard the house, in the process of exiting through a window.  Fearful of a possible ambush the outlaws left soon afterwards and cautiously made their way through the night to a nearby hut belonging to Samuel Smith, one of Cash’s old acquaintances.  Leaving their knapsacks by the door they entered the hut and greeted the occupants.  Just as they began to share a bottle of liquor with Smith and his two companions, they heard a voice from outside: “Surround the hut; we have them, here’s their swag”.  A party of seven soldiers and three constables sent from Oatlands had caught up with them at the hut.  In Cash’s description, in reply he grabbed his gun, opened the door and “discharged both barrels to the right and left”.  Kavenagh and Jones gathered their arms, extinguished the light and the three left the hut, firing as they went.  In the darkness the only light was the flash of gunfire as the parties returned fire.  In Cash’s words: “This was merely random firing, the darkness of the night preventing us from seeing each other, neither had either side the wish to get into close quarters”.  More than a hundred shots were fired in the exchange between the parties, resulting in one of the soldiers receiving a slight wound.  After the firing had finished the three outlaws laid low in the darkness, hiding themselves behind logs and trees while the soldiers and constables “were beating the bush for them”.  The equipment they lost as a result of the skirmish at Antill Ponds included their telescope and bullet mould. \n\nParagraph 8: Though he held Christian beliefs, and attended the same parliamentary prayer group as hard-right factional power-broker David Clarke, he was always aligned with the party's moderate faction. This allegiance began threatening his career as early as 2005, only two years into his term, when reports emerged that the hard-right was engaging in branch stacking in Hawkesbury as a prelude to a possible preselection challenge. Several months later, in the wake of the resignation of moderate Opposition Leader John Brogden (politician), Pringle was one of a number of MPs who reportedly had their preselection threatened if they did not vote for the hard-right's preferred candidate, Peter Debnam, as Brogden's replacement, a campaign which ultimately sparked the withdrawal of Debnam's only opponent Barry O'Farrel from the race. A State Electorate boundary redistribution altered the balance between moderate and right branches.   The tensions from the previous year were confirmed when, on 2 September 2006, Australian politician Ray Williams, a Baulkham Hills Shire Councillor backed by the hard-right faction, challenged Pringle. This came in the wake of reports that numbers in one branch in Pringle's electorate had swelled from 17 to 500 (with none actually living in the suburb) due to an influx of Lebanese Australian members, and public allegations by Howard Crawford, party president for the nearby electoral district of Londonderry that a campaign of \"branch-stacking, malpractice and political promises\" was being used to undermine Pringle. Reports also emerged during the campaign that Williams had claimed that he could secure a $100,000 donation to the party from a property development company if he were elected, which later sparked controversy and an enforced veto of the move from party leader Peter Debnam. Pringle was endorsed by Debnam to remain as a member of parliament. Although Debnam's intervention had saved numerous sitting members under attack over the previous year, it was not enough to save Pringle, who was defeated by Williams on 15 October. It was subsequently reported that Pringle had obtained approximately 50% of the local branch vote in spite of the branch stacking, but had been soundly defeated by the votes of the hard right-dominated state council and state executive. Pringle responded to news of his preselection defeat by declaring \"betrayal and disgust\" at what had occurred, labeling Debnam either \"lying or impotent\". He resigned from the Liberal Party during Question Time in Parliament on 17 October, announcing his intention to serve out his term as an independent, and recontest his seat as an independent. The government used its numbers to suspend standing orders so Pringle could speak at a time of maximum coverage, and in an explosive attack  Pringle criticized Clarke, Debnam and the Liberal Party, claiming that the party was being controlled by \"an exclusive sect\" – referring to Clarke's membership of Opus Dei – labelling Clarke \"the Godfather\", and calling the preselection \"an absolute rort\".

Because the analog-to-digital converters sampled at 208 MHz, the IF was downconverted into 24 partially overlapping \"chunks\", each 104 MHz wide, before sampling.  After sampling, the data were sent to 90 large PC boards, each of which held 32 ASIC correlator chips.   The correlator was an XF design; in the default configuration 6144 lags were calculated for each of two receivers on 28 baselines, before an FFT was applied to convert the lag data to spectra.   In the default configuration the spectral resolution was 812.5 kHz per channel, but the correlator could be reconfigured to increase the spectral resolution on certain chunks, at the expense of lower resolution elsewhere in the spectrum.  The correlator chips were designed at MIT Haystack, and funded by five institutions: SMA, USNO, NASA, NRFA and JIVE.    The correlator could also be configured to correlate all 45 baselines produced by adding the CSO and JCMT to the array, but only for a single receiver per antenna.\n\nParagraph 10: Juno and the Paycock takes place in the tenements of Dublin in 1922, just after the outbreak of the Irish Civil War, and revolves around the misfortunes of the dysfunctional Boyle family. The father, \"Captain\" Jack (so called because of his propensity for telling greatly exaggerated stories of his short career as a merchant seaman), is a loafer who claims to be unable to work because of pains in his legs, which mysteriously appear whenever someone mentions work. Despite his family's poverty, Jack spends  all his time and money at the pub with Joxer Daly, his ne'er-do-well \"butty,\" instead of looking for a job. The mother, Juno (so called because all of the important events in her life took place in June), is the only member of the family currently working, as daughter Mary is on strike and son Johnny is disabled, having lost his arm in the War of Independence. Mary feels guilty about dumping her boyfriend and fellow striker, Jerry Devine, who feels more strongly for her than she does for him. Meanwhile, Johnny agonises over his betrayal of his friend Robbie Tancred, a neighbour and former comrade in the IRA, who was subsequently murdered by Free State supporters; Johnny is terrified that the IRA will execute him as punishment for being an informant. Near the end of the act, one of Jack's relatives dies, and a schoolteacher, Charles Bentham, brings news that the Boyles have come into a large inheritance; Bentham notes aloud that the will names \"John Boyle, [my] first cousin, of Dublin\" as one of the beneficiaries. Overjoyed with the news, Jack vows to Juno to end his friendship with Joxer and change his ways.", "answers": ["9"], "length": 3324, "dataset": "passage_count_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "93ef798766f5c0b64ef9f76af5df9443006d742ffddaca69"}

It further added that Dimond had been sent as a boarder to Richmond Grammar School where he received the rudiments of a classical education and where he remained until the age of 15 when it was claimed a commission was purchased for him in the British Army. The Monthly Mirror stated that his mother not wishing him to go with his regiment to the West Indies she persuaded him to resign his commission. Dimond was then apprenticed as a chaser, the artist William Hogarth having served a similar apprenticeship about 50 years before. But where Hogarth was content to paint actors Dimond was determined to be one. According to the actor-manager Tate Wilkinson, Dimond's good manners and easy-going personality gave him the attitude of a gentleman and he resolved for a career on the stage.  His first known theatrical appearance was made anonymously as a 'Young Gentleman, first appearance on any stage' when claiming to be aged 19 he played Romeo in Romeo and Juliet opposite Miss Mansell as Juliet at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane on 1 October 1772. He again appeared anonymously as 'A Young Gentleman who played Romeo' when he appeared as Dorilas in Mérope in January 1973. When he and Miss Mansell shared a benefit performance in May 1773 he played Moneses in Tamerlane. In his diary the theatre's prompter William Hopkins wrote of Dimond 'He is very young a Smart Figure good Voice and made a very tolerable first appearance he met with great applause'. While remaining at Drury Lane for the rest of the season he only appeared on stage for five more nights. While in Canterbury in the summer of 1773 Dimond took on a managerial role at the \"Theatre over the butter market\" before returning to Drury Lane to appear in minor roles in Garrick's company during the 1773–4 season, his most successful roles being Rovewell in Shadwell's The Fair Quaker, Radwell in A Christmas Tale, Lorenzo in The Heroine of the Cave and The Dauphin in King John. For his benefit in May 1774 Dimond played Florizel in Florizel and Perdita adapted by Garrick from Shakespeare's  The Winter's Tale. In August 1774 Dimond was acting in Birmingham while in July 1775 he was at the Haymarket Theatre in London appearing in Eldred, a new play.\n\nParagraph 3: On the death of Seoán Ó Raghillaigh II, the Bishop of Kilmore, in 1476, Cormac Mác Shamhradháin was appointed as the new bishop on 4 November 1476 by Pope Sixtus IV.On the same date the Pope gave him a dispensation for his illegitimacy. Due to the small revenues of the diocese, Cormac was also allowed to retain his office of Prior of Drumlane. On 6 November 1476 Cormac was licensed to be consecrated as bishop by whichever bishops he chose. However immediate objections were raised to his appointment (perhaps because he was illegitimate), which resulted in a schism which would disrupt the Diocese of Kilmore for the next 35 years. When the Archbishop of Armagh Ottaviano Spinelli de Palatio held his first Provincial Council at Drogheda in July 1480, neither Cormac nor his rival and successor Tomás Mac Brádaigh was present at the council. As a result of the objections, Cormac's appointment as Bishop of Kilmore was revoked on 20 October 1480 and Tomás Mac Brádaigh, the Archdeacon of Kilmore, was appointed as the new bishop by Pope Sixtus IV. The Pope of course had already given Cormac dispensation for his illegitimacy when appointed bishop so the decision may best be viewed as a political struggle between the Lords of West Kilmore, the O’Rourkes, who backed the candidacy of their client sept of the McGoverns against the Lords of East Kilmore, the O’Reillys, who backed their client sept of the Bradys for the bishopric. Cormac however did not accept the decision and appealed the matter on several occasions and still asserted himself as Bishop of Kilmore at his death in December 1511. On 25 November 1482 Primate Octavian arranged a meeting between the two rivals at Inismor in Lough Gowna in order to come to a settlement. At the meeting, in return for certain payments from Tomás Mac Brádaigh, Cormac undertook to renounce all his emoluments from the two rural deaneries of Drumlane and Rossinver Dartry and also to refrain from seeking any further apostolic letters against the new bishop and to abide by the pledges given on his behalf by any nobles or poets. In the document Cormac is referred to as Prior of Drumlane. On 21 November 1483 the Consistorial Archives refer to Cormac as Electus Kilmorensis which probably meant Cormac was regarded as the Deputy Bishop of Kilmore with some rights, perhaps being in charge of the Breifne O’Rourke part of the Diocese from Drumlane westwards. The confusion about who was bishop was still ongoing in 1487 where the preface to the Thebaid of Statius stated- \"This book was written a.d. 1487… and at the same period there were two bishops in the bishopric of Kilmore, to wit, Cormac, son of the bishop Magauran, and Thomas son of Andrew MacBrady, each one of them alleging that he himself is bishop there.\"\n\nParagraph 4: Edwin Neal (born July 12, 1945) is an American actor and voice actor, perhaps best known for his role as the hitchhiker in The Texas Chain Saw Massacre.

The oldest find witnessed to date has been a bronze disk neckring. The still unknown recovery site is presumably a worn-down barrow from the 4th century BC. The find may well point to a Celtic estate, perhaps a \"knightly estate\", in the Ohmbach valley. Somewhat more than 200 years less old is a find consisting of a Celtic coin, which came from an unknown spot within municipal limits. It could bear witness, as a buried artifact from a settlement in the \"later, pre-Christian Bronze Age\" of the 1st or 2nd century BC, to a source in the floor of the dale or on the Ohmbach valley's slopes. It could somehow be linked to an ancient road that ran through the dale. Eventually, the digs at the Roman-era villa rustica on Seitersstraße in 1961 led to the unearthing of ceramics from a settlement of the \"later, pre-Christian Iron Age\" right near the Roman site. This points to a yet-to-be-unearthed Celtic estate at this spot dating from the 1st century BC, a forerunner to the already known Roman estate, which was built of stone. A Celtic settlement in the Ohmbach valley around today's Herschweiler-Pettersheim from the 3rd or 4th century BC melding into Roman times in the Palatinate is the picture that emerges from this. Even the name \"Hühnerkopf\", borne by the peak that looms over the village to the east, can be traced to the description Hünenkopf (or in Middle High German, Hunnenkopf – that is, \"Hun's Head\", whereas the modern form means \"Chicken's Head\") and is therefore a linguistic clue as to an ancient population and its particular connection with the mountain. The building of the villa rustica from Roman times after the beginning of the Christian Era on a graded layer of débris, unearthed in the years 1959-1961, in which building remnants and potsherds were found, proves that in the 2nd century AD, a great wooden building with clay-filled timber framing once stood at the spot, but later burnt down before being replaced by the Roman complex. The ceramics unearthed 30 m behind the villa rustica show that there was a Celtic settlement tradition from the \"later, pre-Christian Iron Age\" into what was locally Roman times, lasting into the latter half of the 3rd century AD. After the Germanic invasions and the villa's destruction in the late 3rd century, it is believed that the local area was not settled, and that virgin forest once again sprouted up on the site.\n\nParagraph 6: To be eligible to earn the SCWS insignia, personnel must first be assigned to a qualifying unit of the Naval Construction Force (Seabees) such as Naval Construction Groups (NCG), Naval Construction Regiments (NCR), Naval Mobile Construction Battalions (NMCB), Underwater Construction Teams (UCT), and Construction Battalion Maintenance Units (CBMU), as well as personnel assigned to Amphibious Construction Battalions (ACB).  As such, qualification is primarily earned by enlisted members of the Seabee Occupational Field ratings and members of the Civil Engineer Corps, however the insignia may be earned by any officer or enlisted member assigned to a qualifying unit having completed the prescribed requirements.\n\nParagraph 7: In September, Jim is told that the Major League club has called him up, and that they will be playing in Texas against the Rangers. Jim calls his family, who in turn informs the town. Advising his wife of the dress code in the majors, Jim finds his sports coat, a necktie, and his St. Rita necklace hanging in his locker (St. Rita is the saint of impossible dreams). His family, high school players, and many townspeople go to the game. Jim impresses many of the coaches in warm-ups with his fastball, and late in the game, with Tampa Bay losing badly, Jim is called into the game to pitch to Royce Clayton and end the inning. Jim gets a strikeout against Clayton on three straight fastballs. After the game, Jim gets interviewed by the press; during this interview, Jim notices his father had also come to the game. Jim's father admits how special it is to be able to see his son play in the majors, and apologizes for not supporting Jim before. Jim thanks him and gives him the ball with which he had gotten the strikeout, and the two repair their relationship. Jim then meets with his family and all the townspeople who had come to the game, applauding Jim on his amazing success story.\n\nParagraph 8: Seth Brundle mastered molecular physics at the age of 20, and devoted his life to developing a teleportation system, due to his severe motion sickness, to allow himself to travel places without getting sick. Brundle dedicated his life to his invention, and adopted personality traits similar to Albert Einstein, such as owning 5 pairs of the exact same set of clothing to save mental energy deciding what to wear. Brundle attended a convention hosted by Anton Bartok (who would eventually become the main antagonist in the sequel), where he met Particle Magazine journalist, Veronica Quaife. Brundle convinced Veronica to allow him to demonstrate his newly created \"telepods\" to her, gaining her intrigue when he stated that it would \"change the world\". Brundle was able to convince Veronica not to send her story on him to her boss, Stathis Borans, as he wasn't ready for the world to hear about it yet, in exchange for allowing Veronica to help on his projects. After the two share an intimate encounter, Brundle has an epiphany that the telepods were reinterpreting flesh instead of reproducing it, leading to Brundle reprogramming the system to allow the successful teleportation of a baboon. Veronica abruptly left to confront Stathis after learning he was planning to unveil Brundle's telepods prematurely, which Brundle interpreted as Veronica still being in love with Stathis. The drunken and depressed Brundle performs the telepod's human testing on himself to deprive Veronica witnessing his miracle of science. Unbeknownst to him, a common housefly had entered the telepod at the same time as him, leading to the computer merging the two together. Brundle sees the test as a success and reconciles with Veronica. When Brundle awakens in the morning, he finds that his reflexes and senses have enhanced. Brundle theorises that the telepods had somehow purified and improved his physicality. However, Veronica discovers coarse and unusual hairs growing out of Brundle's back, leading to a heated exchange where Brundle claims Veronica is simply jealous of him. Brundle attempted to force Veronica to use the telepods, but she refused and Brundle stormed off, abandoning her. Brundle entered a bar and entered an arm-wrestling competition with a man in exchange for his girlfriend, Tawny. Brundle uses his newfound superhuman strength to snap the man's arm and spends the rest of the night engaging in sexual escapades with Tawny. Brundle attempted to force Tawny to use the telepods, only for Veronica to intervene and Tawny and Veronica being kicked out of the laboratory. Brundle then enters his bathroom and notices his fingernails are beginning to fall off.\n\nParagraph 9: Seth Brundle mastered molecular physics at the age of 20, and devoted his life to developing a teleportation system, due to his severe motion sickness, to allow himself to travel places without getting sick.

{"input": "", "context": "Paragraph 1: The American Land Rights Association has also done coverage on the issue between the Hammond family and the Bureau of Land Management in Oregon.  The ALRA believe that the Bureau of Land Management and the National Park Service are presenting an \"abuse of power\" towards the Hammond family being sentenced to five years.  The ALRA also believe that \"peaceful protest is always the way to go\" and that sending the Hammond family for an additional time in jail is a \"great injustice.\" The ALRA redistributed this news of what was happening to the Hammond family, and making a request of unification from western communities, through use of the Land Rights Network.   The ALRA had reported that the Hammond family set a \"minor fire that cost less than $100\" and burned \"127 acres of land.\"  The ALRA had also reported what prosecutors stated on the arson charges with \"the fires were set to reduce the growth of juniper trees and sagebrush\" and to \"accelerate the growth of rangeland grasses for the Hammond's' cattle.\"  The United States Department of Justice however, have documented the burning of land by the Hammond family as affecting \"139 acres of public land\" to \"destroy all evidence of game violations.\"  The United States Department of Justice had also documented that \"Witnesses at trial, including a relative of the Hammonds, testified the arson occurred shortly after Steven Hammond and his hunting party illegally slaughtered several deer on BLM property.\"  The ALRA believe that the Bureau of Land Management and the Fish and Wildlife Service had sentenced the Hammond family to \"gain ownership of the Hammond ranch which is intermingled with Federal ground in the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge\" and to \"inflict as much pain as possible on the Hammonds to reduce the chances other ranchers will stand up for their rights.\"  The ALRA had also reported on the interference of Ammon Bundy during the Hammond family incident with the Bureau of Land Management.  The Occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge, led by Ammon Bundy, was commented on by Len Vohs, the mayor of Burns from 2008 to 2010, stating \"many locals and himself, share the frustration with the federal government that drove Bundy and others to occupy the wildlife refuge\" and continued on saying \"few support their tactics, and wish they would just go home.\"  Len Vohs had also stated \"the occupiers, few if any of whom are from the Burns, do not speak for the town\" in regards to Ammon Bundy's group, who had also attended the rally for the Hammonds.\n\nParagraph 2: Krawcheck appeared in the top ten Forbes list of The World's 100 Most Powerful Women in 2005 and 2006.

Rabbi Eliezer taught that wherever an offerer (because of poverty) substituted for an animal sin-offering the offering of two birds (one of which was for a sin-offering and the other for a burnt-offering), the priest sacrificed the bird sin-offering before the bird burnt-offering (as  instructs). But in the case of a woman after childbirth discussed in  (where a poor new mother could substitute for an animal burnt-offering two birds, one for a sin-offering and the other for a burnt-offering), the bird burnt-offering took precedence over the bird sin-offering. Wherever the offering came on account of sin, the sin-offering took precedence. But here (in the case of a woman after childbirth, where the sin-offering was not on account of sin) the burnt-offering took precedence. And wherever both birds came instead of one animal sin-offering, the sin-offering took precedence. But here (in the case of a woman after childbirth) they did not both come on account of a sin-offering (for in poverty she substituted a bird burnt-offering for an animal burnt-offering, as  required her to bring a bird sin-offering in any case), the burnt-offering took precedence. (The Gemara asked whether this contradicted the Mishnah, which taught that a bird sin-offering took precedence over an animal burnt-offering, whereas here she brought the animal burnt-offering before the bird sin-offering.) Rava taught that  merely accorded the bird burnt-offering precedence in the mentioning. (Thus, some read Rava to teach that  lets the reader read first about the burnt-offering, but in fact the priest sacrificed the sin-offering first. Others read Rava to teach that one first dedicated the animal or bird for the burnt-offering and then dedicated the bird for the sin-offering, but in fact the priest sacrificed the sin-offering first.)\n\nParagraph 4: To expand the reach of the scheme, Hood hired network marketers to both sell his product and recruit additional sellers.  Consequently, the details of the scheme expanded beyond Hood's original plan.  One Omega solicitor, Michael Kodosky, continued to sell units after the August 1994 deadline, claiming that \"refund units\" had become available, and inflating the 50-to-1 payout to whatever amount potential customers wanted to hear.  Whereas Hood avoided selling units to his local community in Mattoon, marketer Arlene Diamond had no such compunction.  Diamond also recommended that clients send payments in cash wrapped in aluminum foil, to avoid scrutiny from postal inspectors. \n\nParagraph 5: In 1991 Berrocal received a commission to produce three monumental works for the Spanish celebrations of 1992.

As a result, he produced Doña Elvira, a  sculpture intended for the Auditorium on the Isla de la Cartuja in Seville; Manolona, a  sculpture erected in the Parque Juan Carlos I in Madrid; and Citius, Altius, Fortius, a torso 4 metres high, presented at the Exposición Universal in Seville, before being moved to its final site at the entrance to the Olympic Museum in Lausanne in 1993. He was nominated as a Goodwill Ambassador for UNESCO. In response to  technical difficulties encountered when making his monumental sculptures, Berrocal carried out research into new materials and techniques, not hesitating to turn to the most highly specialised industrial sectors in order to learn avant-garde technologies. For example, the three monumental works produced in this period were made using Kevlar and carbon fibre. The application of technologies never before used for artistic purposes like sculpture, is significant in terms of the profound symbiosis between art, science and technology that had always accompanied Berrocal’s sculptural research.\n\nParagraph 6: Krawcheck appeared in the top ten Forbes list of The World's 100 Most Powerful Women in 2005 and 2006. (2005 List) In 2008, she was named to Investment Advisor'' magazine's IA 25, the list of the 25 most influential people in and around the investment advisory business. She was recognized by the World Economic Forum as one of its Young Global Leaders.  In 2012, she was credited by The Daily Beast as remaining one of the \"rare honest voices on Wall Street.\" In December 2017, she was listed in a TechCrunch feature on 42 women succeeding in tech that year.\n\nParagraph 7: This title deviates from prior entries in the series by offering a more streamlined interface and approach to gameplay. Diplomacy plays virtually no role in the game, and micromanagement of units is greatly reduced. Unlike most contemporary games, Warlords IV featured only two resources, gold and mana. Perhaps the most notable streamlining is of the combat system. Rather than having multiple units battling at once, combat is one-on-one, similar to a collectible card game. A player will choose which unit to send into battle, and so will the computer (or the opposing player). The units will then battle to the death, with no retreating. Once a unit is killed, the player or computer sends in another, and so on, until one side is victorious. Surrender is not an option during or between battles. Spells can be cast before or between battles that will help to increase the chance of success. Groups or \"stacks\" of units can number up to eight for traveling parties or up to sixteen units for cities.\n\nParagraph 8: James Fraser Mustard  (October 16, 1927 – November 16, 2011) was a Canadian doctor and renowned researcher in early childhood development. Born, raised and educated in Toronto, Ontario, Mustard began his career as a research fellow at the University of Toronto where he studied the effects of blood lipids, their relation to heart disease and how Aspirin could mitigate those effects. He published the first clinical trial showing that aspirin could prevent heart attacks and strokes. In 1966, he was one of the founding faculty members at McMaster University's newly established medical school. He was the Dean of the Faculty of Health Sciences and the medical school at McMaster University from 1972–1982.  In 1982, he helped found the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research and served as its founding president, serving until 1996.  He wrote several papers and studies on early childhood development, including a report used by the Ontario Government that helped create a province-wide full-day kindergarten program. He won many awards including being made a companion of the Order of Canada – the order's highest level – and was inducted into the Canadian Medical Hall of Fame. He died November 16, 2011.\n\nParagraph 9: This title deviates from prior entries in the series by offering a more streamlined interface and approach to gameplay.

Stunned, bewildered, and bemused, they tell Akio's mother what they have seen, but she dismisses their story as childish nonsense. The next day, the two boys — with Akio's younger sister, Tomoko, in tow — cycle to the site to investigate. Enthralled, Akio and Tom manage to steal into the spaceship. But then, without warning, the ship takes off, leaving Tomoko behind. It soars into outer space toward a field of asteroids, which sends the boys into a panic. However, Gamera (obviously aware of the boys' plight) appears and clears a path for the ship through the asteroids. The spaceship, flying near the speed of light, leaves Gamera behind and transports the boys to an unknown planet, where it lands on the outskirts of an alien city. Suddenly, a silver \"Space\" Gyaos appears, menacing the ship and the two young boys. Just before the creature attacks, a second, bizarre monster — whose head resembles a Bowie knife — emerges from an underground lair and attacks the Space Gyaos. The Space Gyaos emits a beam that reflects off the new creature's blade-shaped head and cuts off its own right leg. After the Space Gyaos attempts to retreat, the knife-headed creature lunges and chops off the Space Gyaos' left wing, before cutting off its right wing. The creature then cuts the helpless Space Gyaos' head off and brutally cuts the body into smaller pieces before retreating back to its lair.\n\nParagraph 11: In 1991 Berrocal received a commission to produce three monumental works for the Spanish celebrations of 1992.

{"input": "", "context": "Paragraph 1: From the late 18th century onwards, the city's Roman Catholic population gradually increased, although the city was still dominated by its mostly Ulster Protestant majority. The council was dominated by unionists from its inception until 1997, when they lost overall control for the first time in its history, with the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland gaining the balance of power between Irish nationalists and unionists. This position was confirmed in the three subsequent council elections, with mayors from the Irish nationalist Sinn Féin and Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP), and the cross-community Alliance Party regularly elected since 1997. The election in 2011 saw Irish nationalist councillors outnumber unionist councillors for the first time, 24–21, with Sinn Féin becoming the largest party, and the Alliance Party maintaining the balance of power with six members. The 2011 census findings confirmed this significant change in demographics. In the Belfast City Council area, the proportion of people who were Catholic or brought up Catholic (48.58%) is larger than those who were Protestant or brought up Protestant (42.30%) for the first time. In terms of national identity 43.16% of the population considered themselves to be British, 34.77% considered themselves to be Irish, and 26.82% considered themselves to be of Northern Irish nationality.\n\nParagraph 2: The first member of the class, no. 3292, was completed in December 1897 with a domed parallel boiler, a raised Belpaire firebox and an extended, built-up smokebox similar to that used on the Duke Class. The outside frames were curved over each driving wheel axle. It was named Badminton in April 1898. A batch of eleven locomotives, nos. 3293 to 3303, were completed between April and July 1898, with a further batch of eight, nos. 3304 to 3311, between September 1898 and January 1899. The class were the first locomotives on the GWR to be fitted with copper Belpaire fireboxes. The penultimate example, no. 3310 Waterford, was fitted with a domeless parallel boiler, a steel Belpaire firebox, and an enlarged cab.\n\nParagraph 3: While Michigan Central was an independent subsidiary of the New York Central System, passenger trains were staged from Illinois Central's Central Station (in Chicago) as a tenant. When MC operations were completely integrated into NYC in the 1950s, trains were re-deployed to NYC's LaSalle Street Station home, where other NYC trains such as the 20th Century Limited were staged. IC sued for breach of contract and won because the MC had a lease that ran for a few more years. The MC route from Chicago to Porter, Indiana, is mostly intact. The Kensington Interchange, shared with the South Shore Line, was cut out. These tracks now belong to Indiana Harbor Belt Railroad, and are overgrown stub tracks ending short of the interchange. Some trackage around the Indiana Harbor Belt's Gibson Yard has also been removed. The MC's South Water Street freight trackage in downtown Chicago is also gone. Amtrak trains serving the Michigan Central Detroit line now use the former NYC to Porter, where they turn north on Michigan Central. Passenger equipment was mostly similar to that of parent New York Central System. Typically this meant an EMD E-series locomotive and Pullman-Standard lightweight rolling stock. Because General Motors (Electro-Motive Division) was a large customer of Michigan Central, use of Alco or General Electric locomotives was less common.\n\nParagraph 4: In 2007 the Australian Universities Quality Agency (AUQA) audited UniSC as part of their assessment of all Australian universities. AUQA is a national agency that operates independently of governments and the higher education sector. The report commended UniSC for \"its significant achievements since inception\" and awarded UniSC commendations for the quality of the university's learning and teaching, student support services, workplace integrated learning program and degree approval process. The Headstart Program – a program allowing Year 11 and 12 school students to study one or more courses at the university, while still completing secondary school – and Global Opportunities Program – the university's study abroad were also acknowledged in the assessment.\n\nParagraph 5: Schwarzerden's name is interpreted by placename researchers as meaning a settlement area with dark-coloured, humus-rich soil, and indeed the words for “black earth” are still quite obvious in the village's name to a modern German speaker. In 1325, Schwarzerden had its first documentary mention when Prince-Archbishop-Elector of Trier Baldwin of Luxembourg acquired rights and landholds at the village from the knight Sir Friedrich of Steinkallenfels. Mentioned in 1334 was a forest with the name Schwartzerdyn that was “propre castrum Coppenstein” (near Castle Koppenstein, now a ruin outside neighbouring Henau) that the Prince-Archbishop-Elector also chose to buy. In 1355, the knight Sir Tilmann vom Stein (Wartenstein) was enfeoffed with this landhold. The Trier landholds were in the time that followed granted to families of the lower nobility as mesne fiefs. Named as feudal lords were the Family von Rüdesheim (1439) and the Family von der Leyen (1543). Furthermore, the Knights of Schmidtburg (1517) and the Vögte of Hunolstein (1555) were furnished with rights and landholds in Schwarzerden. During the Middle Ages, the village belonged to the High Court of Kellenbach, which also comprised the villages of Kellenbach, Henau and Königsau. The Lords of Steinkallenfels and their coheirs might originally have been the only court lords in this judicial zone. Through division of inheritance, sale and enfeoffments, though, the court lordship was later shared by several local lords, making the High Court of Kellenbach a condominium under joint high-court jurisdiction. In 1601, there were 14 hearths (for which read “households”) in Schwarzerden, which would have made the number of inhabitants roughly 60 or 70. By 1579, the Schwarzerden villagers were still having to pay two Simmer in “toll oats” (Zollhafer) to the Lords of Steinkallenfels for using the market at Kirn. Clear from this on the one hand is an older dependence on the Steinkallenfelses, and on the other hand a certain economic tendency on the villagers’ part towards Kirn. In 1702, there were eleven families living in Schwarzerden who were subjects of the Counts of Sponheim. In 1766, there were all together 44 households who were all subject to the sovereignty of the Margrave of Baden, who was now the rightful heir to the Sponheim comital family's territory. In the course of French Revolutionary administrative restructuring about 1800, the village was assigned to the then newly founded Mairie (“Mayoralty”) of Monzingen in the Canton of Sobernheim and the Arrondissement of Simmern. After French rule ended in the German lands on the Rhine’s left bank, Schwarzerden passed in 1816 to the Bürgermeisterei (“Mayoralty”) of Gemünden in the Prussian district of Simmern, where it remained until the latest administrative restructuring in Rhineland-Palatinate. Since 8 November 1970, Schwarzerden has been part of the Verbandsgemeinde of Kirn-Land.\n\nParagraph 6: In a short time, the towns of Portsmouth and Newport united, and Coddington was made the governor of the island towns from 1640 to 1647. During this period, Roger Williams had gone to England to obtain a patent to bring under one government the four Narragansett towns of Providence, Warwick, Portsmouth, and Newport. This was done without the consent of the island towns and these two towns resisted joining the mainland towns until 1647. Coddington was elected president of the united colony in 1648, but he would not accept the position, and complaints against him prompted the presidency to go to Jeremy Clarke. Coddington was very unhappy with Williams' patent; he returned to England, where he was eventually able to obtain a commission separating the island from the mainland towns, and making him governor of the island for an indefinite period. He was initially welcomed as governor, but complaints from both the mainland towns and members of the island towns prompted Roger Williams, John Clarke, and William Dyer to go to England to have Coddington's commission revoked. They were successful, and Dyer returned with the news in 1653. However, disagreements kept the four towns from re-uniting until the following year.\n\nParagraph 7: The object was finished in 1924, but due to high construction expenses, SRA failed to move into its new building; instead of that, the entire object was rented. Believing that the design of the SRA building was supposed to transfer the advanced ideas, architects Stevanović and Đorđević created the design which did not rely on the previous designs in terms of its spatial and functional composition. Large sized building, which takes over the entire plot, was designed with the apartments and stores for rent and with richly оrnamented Art Nouveau decorated passages. In dealing with the facades, the authors did not completely abandoned the academic models of designing; they modernized one symmetrical, three-part division of facade canvas by introducing rounded corners, additionally emphasized with semi-circular bay windows. By introducing Art Nouveau elements in the form of three-part windows, of the аrabesque secondary plastic, modern designed details on the shop windows on the ground floor and the mezzanine, with the elements of French decorations, the authors achieved the luxurious facade program. The architectural plastic in the shape of floral arabesques, garlands and Art Nouveau masks, got a new dimension in the attic in the form of full sculpture of the symbolic meaning. The central motif of the main facade is the sculpture composition The Goddess Nika joining the trade and industry, whereas almost identical sculptural compositions The woman with the children were placed on the corners of the central protruding bay. One of those female sculptures is holding a torch in her hand, and the other one a pigeon. The identical compositions of children sculptures were placed in the attics above the corners of the building and along the side facades, creating one of the richest sculptural programs of Belgrade architecture before the First World War. SRA was in the rented building in Brankova Street when the Second World War ended.\n\nParagraph 8: A proclamation: In the markets of the city the profits from commerce are monopolized by itinerant loiterers, while the little people from the rural villages are not allowed to sell their wares. There is not a single necessity of our clothing or food that is not the product of the fields of these old rustics. The men plow and the women weave. Their toil is extremely wearisome, yet what they gain from it is negligible, while manifold interest returns to these lazy idlers. This sort, in tens and hundreds, come together to form gangs. When the villagers come to sell things in the market place, before the goods have even left their hands, this crowd of idlers arrives and attacks them, assaulting them as a group. These idlers call this \"the boxing of the community family.\" They are not at all afraid to act outrageously. I have myself seen that it is like this. Have they not given thought to the foodstuffs they require and the clothing they wear? Is it produced by these people of the marketplaces? Or is it produced by the rural farmers? When they recognize that these goods are produced by the farming people or the rural villages, how can they look at them in anger? How can they bully and insult them? Now, Pan Fifty-two and Li Seven are both fishmongers, but Pan lives in the city and fishmongering is his source of livelihood. Li Seven is a farmer, who does fishmongering between busy times. Pan Fifty-two at the end of the year has his profit, without having had the labor of raising the fish, but simply earning it from the selling of the fish. He hated Li and fought with him at the fish market. His lack of humanity is extreme! Li Seven is a village rustic. How could he fight with the itinerant armed loiterers who hang around the marketplace? Although no injuries resulted from the fight, we still must mete out some slight punishments. Pan Fifty-two is to be beaten fifteen blows with the heavy rod. In addition, Li Seven, although he is a village farmer, was still verbally abusive while the two men were stubbornly arguing. He clearly is not a man of simple and pure character. He must have done something to provoke this dispute. Li Seven is to be given a suspended sentence of a beating of ten blows, to be carried out if hereafter there are further violations.\n\nParagraph 9: A proclamation: In the markets of the city the profits from commerce are monopolized by itinerant loiterers, while the little people from the rural villages are not allowed to sell their wares.

News photographer Tetsuya Wakatsuki comes face-to-face with the craft's occupant Kahm, crown princess of the technologically advanced, interstellar Santovasku Empire. She charges him, he manages to fend her off, and she retreats without her sword. Kahm's father, Emperor Quevas, is informed that the Santovaskuan \"sacred planet\" is infested with humans while the JSDF supreme commander Togo prepares for an impending war with the alien invaders. Battia Bureitin Rou, a Santovasku fleet commander and Kahm's best friend, is sent to retrieve the princess when she returns to the city in search of her sword. During a skirmish with the humans, Battia's ship takes heavy damage, which triggers the Biomech's self-destruct mechanism. Having found her sword and Tetsuya in his apartment, Kahm receives a warning from Battia and evacuates with Tetsuya as the entire Japanese archipelago is vaporized. Meanwhile, Tetsuya's boss, Aki Okazawa, is taken to Siberia by the JSDF. There she meets Neo, Togo's superior and the leader of the secret world political organization known as the Shadow Cabinet. He exposits that millions of years earlier Earth was the seat of the Ra Empire, torn apart in a civil war between two belligerants: the Yoma Clan and the progenitors of the current Santovasku Empire. Neo, himself a surviving Yoma from this conflict, tells Aki that her body houses the spirit of the Yoma witch Jilehr Maruda and that he wishes to utilize her immense power to exact revenge on the Santovasku. Shortly thereafter, Quevas gives the order for all human life to be exterminated, resulting in large portions Europe being bombarded by the empire. Neo awakens Jilehr within Aki and the assaulting platoon is instantly obliterated by her magic.\n\nParagraph 12: The object was finished in 1924, but due to high construction expenses, SRA failed to move into its new building; instead of that, the entire object was rented.

The predominant religion in Myanmar is Buddhism, however, the Chin people are largely Christian due to American missionary work in the 19th and 20th century. This has led to continuous attempts at forced assimilation. There have been recorded numerous crimes against humanity in Myanmar's western Chin state, committed mainly by the Tatmadaw (members of the Burmese Army) and police; however, other agents of the military government and the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC) are also involved. Despite continued persecution, little has been done on the part of the Chin people to speak out due to fear of reprisal, restrictions on travel, and the press imposed by the Burmese military regime. In their oppression of the Chin people, the Tatmadaw consistently violate the rule of law. The Chin people have been subject to forced labor, torture, arbitrary arrests, unlawful detention, and extrajudicial killings.  Such treatment has incited a mass exodus of refugees who have left to neighboring nations such as India, Thailand, and Malaysia, even though doing so will risk further torture, detention, or even death.  India is the most common destination for Chin refugees, given its close proximity, yet Mizoram (the state in India with the largest Chin population) does not give them full refugee protection and they have no legal status there.\n\nParagraph 5: In the mid-to-late 1800s, Italian economic thinkers began to gravitate towards the theories of Fredrich List. Led by Italian economists like Alessandro Rossi, policies favoring protectionism gained momentum. The Italian government had previously been ignoring Italian industry in favor of trade with France. The Italian government seemed content to watch other European powers modernize and gain influence through their colonies. Various groups began to put pressure on the Italian government, from textile to ceramic manufacturers, and although the Italian government imposed tariffs the industrialists felt that it was not enough.

It changed its own name from \"Irish Olympic Council\" to \"Olympic Council of Ireland\" in 1952 to reinforce this point. (The change from \"Council\" to \"Federation\" was a 2018 rebranding after the 2016 ticketing controversy.) At the time, Lord Killanin had become OCI President and delegate to the IOC, and was trying to reverse the IOC's policy of referring to the OCI's team by using an appellation of the state rather than the island.  While the name \"Ireland\" had been unproblematic at the 1924 and 1928 Games, after 1930, the IOC sometimes used \"Irish Free State\". IOC President Henri de Baillet-Latour supported the principle of delimitation by political borders. At the 1932 Games, Eoin O'Duffy persuaded the Organisers to switch from \"Irish Free State\" to \"Ireland\" shortly before the Opening Ceremony. After the 1937 Constitution took effect, the IOC switched to \"Eire\"; this conformed to British practice, although within the state's name in English was \"Ireland\".  At the opening ceremony of the 1948 Summer Olympics, teams marched in alphabetical order of their country's name in English; the OCI team was told to move from the I's to the E's. After the Republic of Ireland Act came into effect in 1949, British policy was to use \"Republic of Ireland\" rather than \"Eire\". In 1951, the IOC made the same switch at its Vienna conference, after IOC member Lord Burghley had consulted the British Foreign Office. An OCI request to change this to \"Ireland\" was rejected in 1952, In late 1955 Brundage ruled that \"Ireland\" would be the official IOC name, and  Lewis Luxton of the Organising Committee for the 1956 Melbourne Games said that \"Ireland\" would be used on scoreboards and programmes. The OCI had argued that this was the name in the state's own Constitution, and that all the OCI's affiliated sports except the Football Association of Ireland were all-island bodies.  However, in the buildup to the Games, Lord Burghley (now Marquess of Exeter) protested at the IOC decision and insisted that the athletics events would use the IAAF name of \"Eire\". On the first day of athletics, \"Ireland\" (code \"IRE\") was used, but from the second day it changed to \"Eire\"/\"EIR\".\n\nParagraph 7: The hamlet of Port Republic, Virginia, lies on a neck of land between the North and South Rivers, which conjoin to form the South Fork Shenandoah River. On June 6–7, 1862, Jackson's army, numbering about 16,000, bivouacked north of Port Republic, Maj. Gen. Richard S. Ewell's division along the banks of Mill Creek near Goods Mill, and Brig. Gen. Charles S. Winder's division on the north bank of North River near the bridge. The 15th Alabama Infantry regiment was left to block the roads at Union Church. Jackson's headquarters were in Madison Hall at Port Republic. The army trains were parked nearby.\n\nParagraph 8: It was only in 1855 that the idea was raised of founding a school specifically for the education of sons of ministers like the Methodist Church in England had at Kingswood School in Bath. Funds were raised with significant amounts coming from the United States and England. The original site for the school was to be in Portadown but the location was changed, first of all to Dublin. Land was acquired in Dublin but proceedings stalled. Several prominent Belfast Methodists began a campaign to have the school built in Belfast. The Methodist Conference allotted the remaining £2000 left from the purchase of the Dublin site to Belfast so long as they could raise £8000 extra with the added proviso that no building could take place until they had raised £10,000. A last attempt was made 1863 for the building to take place in Portadown but this failed. The necessary money had been raised by 1864 to satisfy the Conference's stipulations but it was held that £10,000 would not be sufficient. Further fundraising missions were made to the United States and England in 1866. These were led by Robinson Scott, Robert Wallace and William McArthur. Wallace would die on this mission in Cincinnati from cholera. However an additional £10,000 was raised. Several subsequent missions took place to fund building work.\n\nParagraph 9: In the mid-to-late 1800s, Italian economic thinkers began to gravitate towards the theories of Fredrich List.

The predominant religion in Myanmar is Buddhism, however, the Chin people are largely Christian due to American missionary work in the 19th and 20th century. This has led to continuous attempts at forced assimilation. There have been recorded numerous crimes against humanity in Myanmar's western Chin state, committed mainly by the Tatmadaw (members of the Burmese Army) and police; however, other agents of the military government and the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC) are also involved. Despite continued persecution, little has been done on the part of the Chin people to speak out due to fear of reprisal, restrictions on travel, and the press imposed by the Burmese military regime. In their oppression of the Chin people, the Tatmadaw consistently violate the rule of law. The Chin people have been subject to forced labor, torture, arbitrary arrests, unlawful detention, and extrajudicial killings.  Such treatment has incited a mass exodus of refugees who have left to neighboring nations such as India, Thailand, and Malaysia, even though doing so will risk further torture, detention, or even death.  India is the most common destination for Chin refugees, given its close proximity, yet Mizoram (the state in India with the largest Chin population) does not give them full refugee protection and they have no legal status there.\n\nParagraph 12: In the mid-to-late 1800s, Italian economic thinkers began to gravitate towards the theories of Fredrich List.

These shapes were seen at varying frequencies across astronauts. On the Moon flights, astronauts reported seeing the \"spots\" and \"stars\" 66% of the time, \"streaks\" 25% of the time, and \"clouds\" 8% of the time. Astronauts who went on other missions reported mainly \"elongated shapes\". About 40% of those surveyed reported a \"stripe\" or \"stripes\" and about 20% reported a \"comet\" or \"comets\". 17% of the reports mentioned a \"single dot\" and only a handful mentioned \"several dots\", \"blobs\" and a \"supernova\".\n\nParagraph 15: The OFI sees itself as representing the island rather than the state, and hence uses the name \"Ireland\".

The Arena was renamed in 1982 when Northeastern alumnus George J. Matthews helped fund its refurbishment. The arena was briefly known as Northeastern Arena as well. A 1995 renovation expanded the ice surface from . Another round of renovations took place in the summer of 2009. The centerpiece of the renovations were all-new seating and a brand new center ice jumbotron. In 2018, a new jumbotron was installed, currently one of the largest videoboards in the Northeastern US. The lobby was also reworked, with additional concessions and an elevator for ADA compliance. A new weight room and expanded locker rooms were provided for the athletes. The total cost of the renovations was estimated at $12 million. It still shares a feature with both the 1998-demolished Boston Garden pro sports facility and Harvard's existing Bright-Landry Hockey Center where ice hockey is concerned; with non-standard team bench locations, one on either side of the rink, much as the departed Garden possessed. This feature was for years not uncommon on rinks throughout the East, as the Montreal Forum and Le Colisée de Québec both had split benches for much of their histories. The reason behind this arrangement was so teams could have their benches adjacent to their dressing rooms, which were across the ice from each other for security reasons. Most modern facilities solved this dilemma not by placing dressing rooms on opposite sides of the ice, as those arenas did, but rather on opposite ends on the same side of the rink. However this arrangement still exists in American collegiate hockey, as even some newer venues such as Conte Forum at Boston College or Compton Family Ice Arena at Notre Dame have split benches.\n\nParagraph 5: Friedrich Nietzsche (1844–1900) in Thus Spoke Zarathustra said that a table of values hangs above every great people. Nietzsche argues that what is common among different peoples is the act of esteeming, of creating values, even if the values are different from one people to the next. Nietzsche asserts that what made people great was not the content of their beliefs, but the act of valuing. Thus the values a community strives to articulate are not as important as the collective will to act on those values. The willing is more essential than the intrinsic worth of the goal itself, according to Nietzsche. \"A thousand goals have there been so far,\" says Zarathustra, \"for there are a thousand peoples. Only the yoke for the thousand necks is still lacking: the one goal is lacking. Humanity still has no goal.\" Hence, the title of the aphorism, \"On The Thousand And One Goals.\" The idea that one value-system is no more worthy than the next, although it may not be directly ascribed to Nietzsche, has become a common premise in modern social science.

Her first four fights all ended in first-round knockout wins for Ward. On April 27, 2000, she met Genevia Buckwalter in New York. Buckwalter became the first fighter to make it out of the first round against Ward, but Ward still won on a second-round knockout. Ward's next five rivals did not make it past the second round, with two first-round knockouts and three second round wins.

Thompson's tactics were called into question as he crouched and bobbed his way around the ring, making it harder for Caunt to hit him. Hardly a round went by without a foul being claimed in a notoriously dirty grudge match. The atmosphere was all the more intense because of the fierce rivalry between the two sets of supporters, who had come to finish what they had started six years earlier. The fight lasted a lengthy 93 rounds, with Thompson tactically and methodically breaking his man down until, exhausted after two hours ten minutes, Caunt sat down with his back turned on his \"nether end\" without getting hit, losing on a foul. Thompson was criticised for putting his knee to the mat to end the round after receiving only a light blow, or possibly no blow, but the referee did not call him for a foul.  Thompson would be declared the winner on a foul despite Caunt's advantage in height, weight, and youth.  The fight was described by a contemporary writer as \"one of the most scandalous brawls in boxing history. Both men used every foul under the sun and invented a good many others ... Thompson was tossed from the ring ... Caunt trying to crash him on the ring stakes to break his back. Thompson's [followers] attempted to bludgeon Caunt whenever within striking distance ... on one occasion missing by a hairs breadth, the blow landing on Caunt's brawny shoulder ...\"  Bells Life wrote that Thompson's methods were opposed to the principles of a fair, stand-up fight, and were the actions of a coward.\n\nParagraph 12: Ward's boxing debut occurred on January 15, 2000, when she knocked out Faye Steffen in round one at LaPorte, Indiana. Her first four fights all ended in first-round knockout wins for Ward. On April 27, 2000, she met Genevia Buckwalter in New York. Buckwalter became the first fighter to make it out of the first round against Ward, but Ward still won on a second-round knockout. Ward's next five rivals did not make it past the second round, with two first-round knockouts and three second round wins. At this point of her career, she had a streak of twelve knockout wins in a row.\n\nParagraph 13: Spottiswoode had originally become prominent as an ardent supporter of the strict Presbyterian party, but gradually came to see the inconveniences of \"parity of ministers\", attributed little importance to the existing matters of dispute, and thought that the interests of both church and state were best secured by keeping on good terms with the king. He was therefore ready to co-operate with James in curtailing the powers of the Kirk which encroached on the royal authority, and in assimilating the Church of Scotland to that of England. On 30 May 1605 he became a member of the Scottish Privy Council. In 1608 he worked closely with George Home, Earl of Dunbar in appointing suitable ministers to vacant parishes in the Borders as part of James' programme for bringing peace to the region. In 1610 he presided as moderator over the assembly in which the supremacy of presbytery was abolished. That same year he was consecrated bishop on 21 October by the bishops of London, Ely, Rochester, and Worcester. In 1614, he was instrumental in the arrest and subsequent trial and condemnation to death of John Ogilvie. In 1615 he was made Archbishop of St Andrews and primate of Scotland, and in 1618 procured the sanction of the privy council to the Five Articles of Perth with their ratification by parliament in 1621.\n\nParagraph 14: On 9 September 1845 at Lillington Level, Suffield Green, Oxford, an unruly and partly drunken crowd of 11,000 came to see the third and final fight between Thompson and Caunt who would settle the score for 200 a side.   Thompson's tactics were called into question as he crouched and bobbed his way around the ring, making it harder for Caunt to hit him. Hardly a round went by without a foul being claimed in a notoriously dirty grudge match. The atmosphere was all the more intense because of the fierce rivalry between the two sets of supporters, who had come to finish what they had started six years earlier. The fight lasted a lengthy 93 rounds, with Thompson tactically and methodically breaking his man down until, exhausted after two hours ten minutes, Caunt sat down with his back turned on his \"nether end\" without getting hit, losing on a foul. Thompson was criticised for putting his knee to the mat to end the round after receiving only a light blow, or possibly no blow, but the referee did not call him for a foul.  Thompson would be declared the winner on a foul despite Caunt's advantage in height, weight, and youth.  The fight was described by a contemporary writer as \"one of the most scandalous brawls in boxing history. Both men used every foul under the sun and invented a good many others ...

In the fourth episode of the second season, titled \"Red\", Clark buys a high school ring that contains a red kryptonite gem. The effects of the kryptonite were meant to act as a metaphor for drugs. Loeb was given the task of writing \"Red\" by Gough and Millar, and one of the things he decided on was that the ultimate pay off with the kryptonite would be Clark finally kissing Lana. As Tom Welling describes it, \"With 'Red Clark' he's completely aware of the consequences of his actions at the time, but he doesn't care! He doesn't care what happens to you, and he certainly doesn't care what happens to himself, because he probably realizes that nothing can happen to him. It's always fun to be that way, even in real life, because we're not allowed to be that way all too often.\" One of the concerns for the episode was whether the audience would embrace the idea of a \"bad Clark\", as Ken Biller knew that Clark would have to be \"the villain of the story\". Fortunately, audiences did embrace the idea and after the good ratings \"Red\" received, the WB requested more episodes with red kryptonite. Unfortunately, Gough and the crew did not like using it because of the idea of \"Clark [turning] bad\", but the team asked themselves, \"what if a friend slips something in your drink and you don’t know it?\" This became the basis in \"Rush\", where Pete slips a shard of red kryptonite into Clark's pocket; it also gave the network what they wanted, but in the form of a single act instead of the entire episode. This element would show up again in the season finale, when Clark slips on another red kryptonite ring before riding out of Smallville on a motorcycle. According to Ken Biller, the moment Clark goes searching for the kryptonite is the payoff they had wanted with that piece of Superman mythology. The show had established that red kryptonite removes Clark's inhibitions, and in the season finale, Clark is to the point that he is willing to \"go 'on drugs' to solve his own pain and [...] guilt about what he's done\".\n\nParagraph 4: Josh realizes the potential scandal if the White House Chief of Staff were to testify in a case concerning a company where he used to be a senior executive (easily susceptible to accusations of a conflict of interest). Josh tries to explain this, but Leo (in a rather knee-jerk manner) immediately dismisses him without hesitation, saying, \"Thanks. I'll take it from here.\" Unnerved, Josh goes to Toby, and they both come to the conclusion that since Leo cannot be convinced by logic to come around to their position (as Josh says to Toby, \"Leo knows he can't testify on behalf of a major defense contractor. What's he thinking?\", to which Toby responds, \"He's not thinking\"), they bypass him and go straight to the Oval Office. The president immediately goes next door to see Leo, upholding his deputy's judgment, and reiterating Josh's reasoning why Leo cannot voluntarily testify, but Leo refuses to back down. At this point Senator Hunt personally shows up at Josh's office unannounced to get Josh to prevent Leo from taking the stand, revealing that O'Neal circumvented a compulsory AoA (Analysis of Alternatives) and hired the Defense Department procurement officer who was overseeing the bidding process at nearly four times his government salary as incentive to secure the contract for Mueller Wright. Josh tries to contact Leo, but Leo has already gone to meet with Ken privately. Ken now comes clean on his transgressions, and says he will take the Fifth Amendment. Leo, devastated, returns to the White House, where he expresses to the president his terrible disappointment with the man he looked up to, and to whom he owes his life. Leo says that many men died saving their lives in Vietnam and they owed it to them to live good and decent lives. Bartlet commiserates, adding that the corruption of the best is always the hardest to take, and that Leo's own life honors the men who died saving him many times over.\n\nParagraph 5: In 1900, Ban Johnson's minor Western League, based in the Midwest, declared its equality with the National League, then the only major league in baseball. Johnson changed the name of his league to the American League. Competing in the streets, the upstart placed franchises in two of the largest and most important NL cities, Philadelphia and Boston. Despite the National League club having been previously well established in the city, beginning play in 1871, the new American League club managed to immediately surpass their in-city rivals in popularity. Factors contributing to this include the signing away of many of the star players from the \"Nationals\" to the \"Americans\" to more lucrative contracts, a more accessible location of their home park, animosity between Boston baseball fans and \"Nationals\" owner Arthur Soden, and more efforts made by the \"Americans\" to attract the growing Irish-American population to their games, as opposed to the \"Nationals\" preferring to market themselves more to Anglo-Saxons. Playing their home games at Huntington Avenue Grounds, the Boston franchise (often called the Americans during this time) finished second and third place in their first two seasons before capturing their first pennant in 1903 and repeating the feat in 1904. These early Boston teams were led by manager and star third baseman Jimmy Collins and by pitcher Cy Young, both signings away from the NL club, whose 1901 to 1904 seasons both rank among the best four-year runs ever. In addition, the Americans received significant contributions from outfielders Chick Stahl, Buck Freeman and Patsy Dougherty. In 1903, the Americans participated in the first modern World Series, beating the favored Pittsburgh Pirates and winning the best-of-nine series five games to three. The Americans were aided both by chants of \"Tessie\" from their Royal Rooters fan club and by their stronger pitching staff.\n\nParagraph 6: Josh realizes the potential scandal if the White House Chief of Staff were to testify in a case concerning a company where he used to be a senior executive (easily susceptible to accusations of a conflict of interest).

Once the 10th Mountain Division rotated home the mission was assumed by units of the Army National Guard and other members of the coalition. Phoenix II built up the first Afghan Corps – the Central Corps, now 201st Corps (Afghanistan) - in Kabul, Afghanistan. Phoenix II was provided by the 45th Infantry Brigade-Oklahoma Army National Guard. Task Force Phoenix II's base support battalion served as the logistics command for the Afghan National Army, providing all logistics support for an army conducting country-wide combat operations. During this rotation, the brigade grew the size of the Afghan National Army to over 14,000 as well as fielding a corps-sized force ahead of schedule. In August 2004, the brigade was replaced in this mission by the 76th Infantry Brigade-Indiana Army National Guard, and subsequently returned home to the United States. Phoenix III took on the daunting task of splitting that Corps into five separate Corps and locating them throughout the country at five strategic centers. Phoenix IV (53rd Infantry Brigade Combat Team (United States) Florida Army National Guard) worked to build up those Corps to full strength. TF Phoenix IV's Training Assistance Group (209th Regiment-Nebraska Army National Guard and 211th Regiment-Florida Army National Guard) stationed at Camp Alamo (inside the Kabul Military Training Center) implemented  major improvements to both Basic and Advanced Individual Training programs. Task Force Phoenix V ( 41st Infantry Brigade-Oregon Army National Guard) was the fifth ANA training rotation. The mission continued to expand with TF Phoenix V taking on additional responsibilities associated with training and supporting the Afghan National Police (ANP), as well as continuing to train and mentor the growing ANA. TF Phoenix V was composed primarily of soldiers from the U.S. Army National Guard, with members representing 49 of the 50 states. In addition, they had elements from the regular and reserve components personnel from the Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps attached. Later, the responsibility for the Phoenix missions were assigned to the 27th Brigade Combat Team of the New York Army National Guard took command of Task Force Phoenix on 19 April 2008 from the 218th BCT, South Carolina Army National Guard. They were relieved on 19 December 2008 by the 33rd Brigade Combat Team Illinois Army National Guard.  In 2009, the 48th Infantry Brigade Combat Team Georgia National Guard assumed command of Task Force Phoenix IX.\n\nParagraph 10: This season also saw the introduction of red kryptonite. In the fourth episode of the second season, titled \"Red\", Clark buys a high school ring that contains a red kryptonite gem. The effects of the kryptonite were meant to act as a metaphor for drugs. Loeb was given the task of writing \"Red\" by Gough and Millar, and one of the things he decided on was that the ultimate pay off with the kryptonite would be Clark finally kissing Lana. As Tom Welling describes it, \"With 'Red Clark' he's completely aware of the consequences of his actions at the time, but he doesn't care! He doesn't care what happens to you, and he certainly doesn't care what happens to himself, because he probably realizes that nothing can happen to him. It's always fun to be that way, even in real life, because we're not allowed to be that way all too often.\" One of the concerns for the episode was whether the audience would embrace the idea of a \"bad Clark\", as Ken Biller knew that Clark would have to be \"the villain of the story\". Fortunately, audiences did embrace the idea and after the good ratings \"Red\" received, the WB requested more episodes with red kryptonite. Unfortunately, Gough and the crew did not like using it because of the idea of \"Clark [turning] bad\", but the team asked themselves, \"what if a friend slips something in your drink and you don’t know it?\" This became the basis in \"Rush\", where Pete slips a shard of red kryptonite into Clark's pocket; it also gave the network what they wanted, but in the form of a single act instead of the entire episode. This element would show up again in the season finale, when Clark slips on another red kryptonite ring before riding out of Smallville on a motorcycle. According to Ken Biller, the moment Clark goes searching for the kryptonite is the payoff they had wanted with that piece of Superman mythology. The show had established that red kryptonite removes Clark's inhibitions, and in the season finale, Clark is to the point that he is willing to \"go 'on drugs' to solve his own pain and [...] guilt about what he's done\".\n\nParagraph 11: The pass was surveyed by J. W. Edgar in 1873, who described the pass as being used for trade by Tibetans. Francis Younghusband used the pass in 1903-1904, a diplomatic British delegation to Lhasa in 1936-37, and Ernst Schäfer in 1938–1939. In the 1950s, trade in the Kingdom of Sikkim utilized this pass. Diplomatically sealed by China and India after the 1962 Sino-Indian War, the pass saw skirmishes between the two countries in coming years, including the clashes in 1967 which resulted in fatalities on both sides. Nathu La has often been compared to Jelep La, a mountain pass situated at a distance of 3 miles (4.8 km).\n\nParagraph 12: Although the pathogenic role of ANCA is still controversial, in vitro and animal models support the idea that the antibodies have a direct pathological role in the formation of small vessel vasculitides. MPO and PR3 specific ANCA can activate neutrophils and monocytes through their Fc and Fab'2 receptors, which can be enhanced by cytokines which cause neutrophils to display MPO and PR3 on their surface. Aberrant glycosylation of the MPO and PR3 specific ANCA enhances their ability to interact with activating Fc receptors on neutrophils.  The activated neutrophils can then adhere to endothelial cells where degranulation occurs. This releases free oxygen radicals and lytic enzymes, resulting in damage to the endothelium via the induction of necrosis and apoptosis. Furthermore, neutrophils release chemoattractive signalling molecules that recruit more neutrophils to the endothelium, acting as a positive feedback loop. Animal models have shown that MPO antibodies can induce necrotizing crescentic glomerulonephritis and systemic small vessel vasculitis. In these animal models the formation of glomerulonephritis and vasculitis can occur in the absence of T-cells, however neutrophils must be present. Although ANCA titres have been noted to have limited correlation with disease activity, except for kidney disease, and with risk of relapse, this is explained by differences in the epitopes and affinity of ANCAs. ANCAs induce excess activation of neutrophils, resulting in the production of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), which cause damage to small blood vessels. In addition, in patients with active disease, treated with Rituximab, an anti-CD20 antibody which remove circulating B-cells, clinical remission  correlates more to the decreasing number of circulating B-cells than decrease in ANCA titre, which in some patient does not change during treatment. The same study found that clinical relapse in some patients were in association with the return of circulating B-cells. Based on the above observations and that ANCA reactive B-cells can be found in circulation in patients with AAV, an alternative hypothesis have been proposed assigning  a direct pathogenic role of these cells, whereby activated neutrophils and ANCA-reactive B-cells engage in intercellular cross-talk, which leads not only to neutrophil degranulation and inflammation but also to the proliferation and differentiation of ANCA-reactive B-cells. However, this hypothesis remains to be tested.", "answers": ["9"], "length": 3911, "dataset": "passage_count_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "3efa1632c6c972106fdbc825cb4f48bb326dea5b7cceacc7"}
{"input": "", "context": "Paragraph 1: Jóhann had scored a number of works concurrent with his solo career through the 2000s including the Icelandic comedy Dis in 2004, TV series Svartir englar in 2007, and In the Arms of My Enemy in 2007. However it is his work with Denis Villeneuve for which he is best known. His first collaboration with Villeneuve was Prisoners in 2013. He subsequently worked on Villeneuve's films Sicario (2015), which was nominated for Academy Award for Best Original Score, and Arrival (2016). Jóhann joined Villeneuve once again to work on Blade Runner 2049, but at some point during production Villeneuve decided that the music needed a change in direction. In describing the artistic process for Blade Runner 2049, Villeneuve stated that \"the movie needed something different, and I needed to go back to something closer to Vangelis. Jóhann and I decided that I will need to go in another direction.\"  Villeneuve brought in Hans Zimmer and Benjamin Wallfisch to complete the project. Jóhann's work on James Marsh's The Theory of Everything won the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score in 2015. His final works were for the films Mandy, The Mercy, and Mary Magdalene.  In an interview following the release of Arrival, Jóhann commented on his process stating that \"it's about putting yourself in a receptive state of mind where you react to inputs, and it can be from anywhere.  It doesn't really matter if you're writing for film or if you're doing your own piece; you always have to put yourself into that space.\" He went on to say, \"there are practical parameters, of course, involved in writing film music rather than doing your own album, but I view them very much as the same body of work. And, for me, there are very clear lines for me between Englabörn to Arrival.\"\n\nParagraph 2: Many years after the events of God of War III, Kratos, having survived his apparent death from releasing the power of Hope in Greece, ended up in ancient Scandinavia in the Norse realm of Midgard and fathered a young son named Atreus, who is unaware of his true nature. Kratos has abandoned his double-chained blades as a symbolism of abandoning his old persona; instead, he uses a battle axe called the Leviathan Axe that originally belonged to his second wife and Atreus' mother Laufey (called Faye by Kratos), who recently passed. Her last wish was for her ashes to be spread at the highest peak of the nine realms. At Midgard's peak, they learn from Mímir that the highest peak is actually in Jötunheim. Along their journey, they are confronted by the Æsir god Baldur, the brother of Thor whose sons Modi and Magni assist their uncle, but are killed by Kratos and Atreus. Around this time, Atreus falls ill. To cure him, Kratos must recover his old weapons, the Blades of Chaos, in order to battle the beings of Helheim as the Leviathan Axe is useless there as it inflicts frost damage. While retrieving the blades, Athena appears and goads him about his past. Kratos journeys to Hel and retrieves the cure by killing the troll that guards the realm. After curing him, Kratos reveals to Atreus that he is a god. The pair also receive assistance from a witch, later revealed to be the Vanir goddess Freya, the mother of Baldur who had cast a spell of immortality on Baldur which protects him, but also causes him to no longer feel anything physically, which he resented her for. Kratos and Baldur eventually battle, during which, Baldur's spell is broken. Kratos decides to let Baldur go, but Baldur attempts to kill Freya, forcing Kratos to kill him. Freya swears revenge against Kratos for killing her son and taunts Kratos for not revealing his troubled past to Atreus. Kratos decides to tell Atreus that he had killed his fellow Greek gods, including his father Zeus (whose illusion he saw in Helheim), but he and Atreus should learn from these experiences and not repeat past mistakes. The two then make their way to Jötunheim, where it is learned that Faye was actually a giant, also making Atreus part-giant. It is also revealed that Faye originally wanted to name their son Loki, but Kratos preferred Atreus, which was the name of an honorable Spartan comrade. The giants also referred to Kratos as Fárbauti. In Midgard, Fimbulwinter began, and after sleeping in the family home, Atreus has a vision that Thor will come for them at the end of Fimbulwinter.\n\nParagraph 3: Bethany offers students opportunities for a degree in ministry in the form of Master of Divinity and one in research through the Master of Arts degree.  Students can further refine their field of study through a degree emphasis in Peace Studies or Ministry With Youth and Young Adults. Peace-related courses cover topics ranging from non-violence and the biblical story, to peace witness in the Anabaptist/Pietist tradition, to mediating conflict in families and churches, to peacemaking in national and international arenas. Master of Divinity students pursuing a degree emphasis in Ministry With Youth and Young Adults complete a practicum experience, and Master of Arts students focus their thesis on youth and young adult ministry.\n\nParagraph 4: In her newfound position of authority, Nutting saw an opportunity to make changes to the program at Johns Hopkins University and breakthroughs in the development of nursing curricula throughout the country. As one account says of her succession to superintendent: \"Thus began her lifelong crusade to bring education of nurses within universities.\" One of the major flaws of the training school at Hopkins was that while the school allowed lower-class individuals to attend, a much heavier emphasis was placed on the time spent served laboring in the hospital than on the educational aspects. This posed a twofold problem; first, it was unfair to students who were seeking a serious academic program, and instead were being supplanted as cheap additional staff to the hospital; second, these students were thrown into action without any real preliminary training, which could lead to inadequate service. They were serving on average 60–105 hours a week, which left practically no time to focus on their school work. While at the time conditions at the nursing school were less than ideal, the late 19th century marked the first significant advancement in medical studies. In 1893, The Johns Hopkins Medical School was founded, and this drew a sharper focus to the need to reform preexisting practices. To address the obstacles within her own program, Nutting met with the trustees in 1895 to convey the \"exploitative\" nature of the current system. Incorporating detailed statistical analysis and data, Nutting's work, The Statistical Report of Work Hours in Training School, highlighted the drawbacks of using students as hospital staff. Considered the \"Magna Carta\" of nurse teaching, her presentation convinced Hopkins leadership to make drastic reforms. Work stipends were replaced with scholarships, and the training school was expanded to a three-year program with fewer work hours. Further, Nutting instituted a watershed preparatory program that served the purpose of easing nurses in the hospital environment, including classes in anatomy, physiology, materia medica, and hygiene. This was one of the first of its kind. Nutting also made early breakthroughs in the field of public health, instituting nursing programs that provided at home care for people in poorer communities, especially for sick mothers. Finally, Nutting was instrumental in the creation of the Johns Hopkins' Nursing Library, and the materials collected within its shelves would later be important to her book, History of Nursing. This work, a four-volume series, written from 1907 to 1912 and co-authored by Lavinia Dock, provided a comprehensive account of nursing practice up to that point.\n\nParagraph 5: After Owerri was captured by two battalions of Nigerian soldiers, Kalu was made commander of the Biafran 14th Division and given strict orders in a letter written to him by President Ojukwu. In the letter Ojukwu states \"Your role in the Port Harcourt disaster is still fresh in the minds of people. You must clear the enemy from Obinze in 24 hours or submit your resignation from the army.\" Only a few hours later Lt. Col. Kalu ordered a Biafran counter-attack and with the assistance of the Ogbunigwe mine the Nigerian advance was halted and Obinze was captured. On December 3, 1968, the 14th Division under Kalu and the 63rd Brigade under Col. Lambert Ihenacho made their way towards Owerri, capturing the villages of Eziama and Elelem. Kalu's 14th Division was ordered to halt and dig in around Owerri while the Biafran 60th Brigade under Col. Azum Asoya carried out the main assault against the Nigerian 16th Division under Col. E.A. Etuk. Over 50,000 rounds of ammunition, 300 mortars, 200 howitzer shells, and 20 anti-tank weapons were fired by the Biafrans during a two-day bombardment of Nigerian defensive positions in and around Owerri, but, the Nigerians were dug-in and remained in their original positions after suffering heavy casualties. After nearly 4 months of heavy fighting the Nigerian 16th Division remained in Owerri, though now drastically reduced in number and short of food. On March 31, 1969, the Biafran 14th Division under Lt. Col. Kalu attacked Owerri and managed to secure control over 70% of the city. Biafran soldiers began intercepting radio waves that revealed the 16th Brigade was going to execute all Biafran POWs due to a lack of food. The Swedish pilot Carl Gustaf von Rosen and his \"Biafra Babies\" fighter squadron, consisting of six MFI-9 Junior fighters, constantly hounded Nigerian air drops, making Nigerian food supplies scarce. On April 24 the 300 Nigerian soldiers still under Col. Etuk's command began staging a breakout of Owerri and managed to escape to Nigerian-held territory after a day of heavy fighting against the Biafran troops surrounding the city. After the liberation of Owerri by the Biafran 14th Division Col. Kalu was promoted to the rank of Brigadier. Kalu remained stationed in Owerri until the end of the war when, on January 12, Kalu accompanied the new President of Biafra, Philip Effiong, along with Maj. Achuzie, and many other Biafran officers to Amichi, and later Owerri, to broadcast their final surrender to Gen. Obasanjo. Kalu was held in prison for 3 days until he was granted amnesty by Nigerian President Yakubu Gowon along with his fellow Biafran officers.\n\nParagraph 6: As a track cyclist and Australian Institute of Sport scholarship holder he met success in individual and team events.

In 2004, she played Diana Gordon, daughter of Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes) and Alison Gordon (Monica Potter) in the horror film Saw. Her next movie was Sin City, in which she played young Nancy Callahan, alongside Bruce Willis. Vega then appeared in Just My Luck as Katy, starring Lindsay Lohan and Chris Pine, and also in the summer blockbuster X-Men: The Last Stand as the Prison Truck Little Girl, which was one of the forms that the shapeshifter Mystique took in the film.\n\nParagraph 3: Davis returned to the lineup on December 18 against the Los Angeles Clippers with 24 points, 12 rebounds and 3 steals. He returned to the starting lineup in the next game with 21 points, 9 rebounds, 2 blocks and a steal against Portland on December 21. He missed 7 games due to the injury. In his seventh consecutive 20-point game (all losses), Davis posted 31 points and 17 rebounds against Golden State. In the subsequent game on January 20, he helped the Pelicans snap an 8-game losing streak with 27 points, 10 rebounds, 4 assists and 4 blocks against Memphis. On January 26, Davis established a new career high with 19 rebounds, in addition to posting 22 points and 7 blocks, in a 100–92 victory over the Orlando Magic. On January 27, Davis was a finalist for Western Conference Player of the Week but lost out to Kevin Durant. The January 28 contest against the Cleveland Cavaliers featuring the last three first overall NBA draft picks (Anthony Bennett, Davis, and Kyrie Irving), Davis posted 30 points, 8 blocks, 7 rebounds and 3 assists. However, he dislocated his left index finger causing him to miss the next game the following night. On January 29, he was named a Rising Stars Challenge participant as part of the 2014 NBA All-Star Game weekend. On February 7, he was selected to replace Kobe Bryant in the 2014 NBA All-Star Game. On February 26, Davis sprained his left shoulder late in the first half against the Dallas Mavericks. He did not play in the rest of the game, and his subsequent availability was listed as day-to-day. Despite his shoulder sprain, Davis matched his career high with 32 points on February 28 against the Phoenix Suns. He was one of six Western Conference Player of the Week nominees on March 10. On March 14, Davis established a career high with 36 points against Portland. On March 16, 2014, (the very next game) Davis scored a career-high 40 points along with a career-high 21 rebounds in a 121–120 overtime win against the Boston Celtics. The performance was the first 40-point, 20-rebound effort of the 2013–14 NBA season. Davis was the fourth-youngest player (21 years and 5 days) to achieve 40/20 in a game and the youngest since Shaquille O'Neal in 1993. In addition to his career game, Davis set a New Orleans' franchise record with six straight games of at least 28 points. Glen Rice set the previous best stretch with five straight in the 1990s. It was also the first 40-point performance by a Pelican/Hornet since David West on February 26, 2010. Davis was again a finalist for NBA Player of the Week on March 17 and 24.\n\nParagraph 4: Robbie Davis-Floyd is a fellow recipient of the Society for Applied Anthropology at the University of Texas, Austin. She was a fellow of the National Endowment for the Humanities in 1980. Davis-Floyd was awarded a faculty development grant from Trinity University around 1988 and 1989. She was recognized as a research fellow from the University of Texas in 1994. In the same year, Robbie Davis-Floyd was an Academy of Consciousness Studies fellow at Princeton University.

Robbie Davis-Floyd was recognized by the NARM board for her 15 years of service to the North American Registry of Midwives and was honored with an award from MANA for her years of service to American midwifery in 2012. She was also awarded with an \"Homenagem\" from ReHuNa, a birth activist organization in Brazil that was presented to her by the Brazilian Minister of Health in 2010 for defining \"the technocratic, humanistic, and holistic paradigms of birth and health care\"—theoretical concepts she created to help practitioners and mothers understand the implications of their ideological choices for the management and outcomes of their births.\n\nParagraph 5: Centers was born in Tyler, Texas and grew up in  Longview. He began playing little league football for the Bramlette Bears as a running back and quarterback during his elementary school years and went on to play in middle school for the Forest Park Eagles and high school for the Longview Lobos until his junior year. He played on both sides of the ball as a defensive back and runnningback and wide receiver. Centers did not play football at all his junior year of high school. After his family moved to nearby Tatum, where his mother was an administrator in education, Centers decided to play football again after being urged to do so by his elder brother. After a solid season in Tatum, he earned a scholarship to nearby Stephen F. Austin State University. He was also recruited by Baylor, Texas Tech, and several junior colleges. His brother, Donnie, played for the University of Arkansas and coach Lou Holtz as a wide receiver.\n\nParagraph 6: The uncut film also contains comic live action sequences, in black and white blended with occasional color animations, that parody the Deems Taylor introductions from Fantasia.   \"The Presenter\" (Maurizio Micheli) starts off with an exaggerated version of Taylor's opening introduction in Fantasia ( \"A new and original film\" .. \"you will see the music and hear the drawings\" .. \"a fantasia\") only to be interrupted by a phone call from California informing him that the film had already been done.  He angrily objects, dismissing the caller as an ill-mannered liar, explaining to the audience that the caller claims that someone (\"Prisney\", \"Grisney\", \"some American\") had done this years before, then telling the caller to at least watch the film, and hangs up.  Next the Presenter introduces \"The Orchestra Master\" (Néstor Garay) and an orchestra made up of little old ladies as the Orchestra Master roughly rounds them up from a cattle pen into a large trailer for transport to the theater. As the trailer heads out to the theater the Presenter exults, \"Pisney has already done this?\".  Lastly before the first animated music segment (Prélude à l'après-midi d'un faune), the Presenter introduces \"The Animator\" (Maurizio Nichetti). as the Orchestra Master retrieves him from a dungeon-like cell in which the Animator (\"a free artist\") has been chained to a wall (as the Presenter puts it: \"a binding contract based on trust and mutual respect\"). A pretty young cleaning woman (Marialuisa Giovannini) also appears in each segment, although she's barely acknowledged by any of the characters except the Animator (who seems to take an increasing fancy to her as the movie progresses). Each sequence portrays action (like the tossing of a Coca-Cola bottle) that leads directly into the next animated portion of the film and occasionally includes references to a previous segment (such as a chamber pot appearing on the Orchestra Master's head or the female bee and the serpent from their respective segments appearing briefly in the subsequent live-action sequences). After the \"Bolero\" segment, a gorilla (inspired by the animated character in the Boléro) also appears a few times, first chasing then dancing with The Animator, then later beating up the Orchestra Master who has attacked the Animator.  After the Firebird sequence, the Animator transforms the cleaning woman into a cartoon fairy tale princess and himself into a prince (apparently resembling the titular character and her Prince from Walt Disney's 1937 film, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs) before both float away leaving the Presenter and Orchestra Master without a finale leading into the epilogue sequence.\n\nParagraph 7: In 1999, the Honorary Mayor of Little Armenia, Garbis Keurjikian, also known as Garo, had a vision to establish an area in East Hollywood representing the Armenians who migrated to America. He worked with Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg to bring his vision to life. After working on the establishment of Little Armenia for a year, the ceremony opening took place on October 6, 2000, outside of Saint Garabed Armenian Apostolic Church. The name comes from the large number of Armenian-Americans who live in the area, and also  from the large number of Armenian stores and businesses that had already opened in the neighborhood by the early 1970s.\n\nParagraph 8: In 1999, the Honorary Mayor of Little Armenia, Garbis Keurjikian, also known as Garo, had a vision to establish an area in East Hollywood representing the Armenians who migrated to America.

In response to her challenge that vampires are known killers, Angel tells her he was cursed, then evades her skeptical theory that he's been \"cursed to help people,\" focusing the inquiry on her situation instead. The exotically beautiful demon accepts Angel's invitation to tell her story and introduces herself as Jhiera, a princess from the Oden Tal dimension, dedicated to helping other female refugees escape her home world to the relative safety of L.A. Jhiera tells Angel that for the women of Oden Tal, the personality is located in an area of the body called the \"ko,\" the source of their desires and passions. At this, Jhiera turns her back to Angel and shows him the raised ridges running for several inches along her spine. Angel, who found Jhiera attractive at first sight, is now deeply aroused by her nearness and bends his head closer to her vulnerable neck. Resisting his own desires, he listens as Jhiera tells him that the men of her dimension control the women by cutting out the ko, thus removing their \"physical and sexual power,\" their volition. \"We leave behind dreaming,\" she tells him bleakly. Feeling herself at the center of his intense predator's focus, Jhiera begins to circle Angel as she explains that young women of Oden Tal must learn to control the raw power of their maturing ko, to which men of this world respond involuntarily. She tells him of her own struggle, with the help of the frozen water, to contain the \"heat under her skin.\" Jhiera proceeds to demonstrate her power to arouse them both, as well as her iron control of that power. Angel, fighting on several levels for self-control, moves a few steps away and asks pointedly about the incinerated corpse at the ice factory, and about the other four men crisped to death over the past year. Jhiera grows defensive of her manifesto and starts to storm off, but Angel blocks her path. Her power flashes to the surface and they are almost irresistibly drawn to each other - a connection lethal to Angel - until Jhiera damps the intensity of her radiant heat. Telling him again to stay out of her way, she escapes, leaving him wrung out, barely able to stand.\n\nParagraph 10: The idea of the learning organization developed from a body of work called systems thinking. This is a conceptual framework that allows people to study businesses as bounded objects. Learning organizations use this method of thinking when assessing their company and have information systems that measure the performance of the organization as a whole and of its various components. Systems thinking states that all the characteristics of a learning organization must be apparent at once in an organization for it to be a learning organization. If some of these characteristics are missing then the organization will fall short of its goal. However, O'Keeffe believes that the characteristics of a learning organization are factors that are gradually acquired, rather than developed simultaneously.\n\nParagraph 11: Centers was born in Tyler, Texas and grew up in  Longview. He began playing little league football for the Bramlette Bears as a running back and quarterback during his elementary school years and went on to play in middle school for the Forest Park Eagles and high school for the Longview Lobos until his junior year.

These shapes are named after their prototypical example, the Reuleaux triangle, which in turn, is named after 19th-century German engineer Franz Reuleaux. The Reuleaux triangle can be constructed from an equilateral triangle by connecting each two vertices by a circular arc centered on the third vertex, and Reuleaux polygons can be formed by a similar construction from any regular polygon with an odd number of sides, or from certain irregular polygons. Every curve of constant width can be accurately approximated by Reuleaux polygons. They have been applied in coinage shapes.\n\nParagraph 13: At the age of five, Vega played one of the children of Teddie Cochran (Geena Davis) in The Geena Davis Show. In 2000, she was cast as Annie, the Campbells' precocious daughter in The Family Man. The following year, Vega was seen again playing Chloe in Made which starred Vince Vaughn, Jon Favreau and Famke Janssen.

Whilst these practices had not been completely unknown in the Church of England since its break with the Roman Catholic Church, most of them had not been in general use for hundreds of years as the Church of England had become increasingly influenced by Protestantism in its liturgical practice during and after the reigns of Edward VI and Elizabeth I. SSC priests considered these practices an outward and necessary and physical expression of belief and doctrine and not merely as aesthetic adornments to worship. The society was primarily concerned with improving the spiritual life of priests and people. For example, the now common practice of retreats was introduced to the Church of England in those given by SSC priests, beginning in 1856.\n\nParagraph 15: In 1999, the Honorary Mayor of Little Armenia, Garbis Keurjikian, also known as Garo, had a vision to establish an area in East Hollywood representing the Armenians who migrated to America.

While Chase does all the activities Nicole asks him to with little resistance, he eventually points out that everything they've done is for her benefit.  Nicole agrees to do whatever he wants and they go to a club he used to frequent with Dulcie, where Nicole has a good time and begins bonding with his friends. Chase has a run in with Dulcie and her new boyfriend, Nicole comes to his aid and kisses him, which makes Dulcie jealous. Nicole and Chase begin to fall in love but don't admit their feelings, to each other or themselves, and continue their ruse.  Nicole's vindictive best friend, Alicia, seduces Chase at a party, making sure Nicole would see them together, leaving Nicole heartbroken. Chase calls Dave to pick him up, since he is too drunk to drive, and angers Dave when he says that \"everyone\" was at the party, which Dave says is not true because he and Ray were not there, reminding him they used to be his friends. Meanwhile, Brad and his girlfriend break up and Dulcie also ends things with her new boyfriend. Chase attempts to talk to Nicole about what happened with Alicia but she rebuffs him, reminding him of the easy out clause, she also ignores his calls. Chase eventually makes up with his friends and gets back together with Dulcie. Brad finally asks Nicole to the dance.

{"input": "", "context": "Paragraph 1: Webster was born in 1960 in Doncaster, England.  He was raised in Brierley.  His first instrument was piano which he started playing at the age of 6.  Four years later he began playing his current instrument the cornet.  The piano was gradually pushed aside as he progressed with the cornet at Grimethorpe Colliery Junior Band.  Before becoming a professional musician, he worked down the coal mines and prior to that as a laboratory technician. However, it wasn't until 1988 that he began to turn his hobby into his profession.  In this year he was invited to join Black Dyke, one of the world's greatest brass bands, as principal cornet.  He stayed here for 5 years before deciding to pursue a solo career.  He did however contest during his solo period with CWS (Glasgow) Band, arguably the top band in Scotland.  Webster continued to play on occasions with the BBC Philharmonic Orchestra.  In 2000 he was once again invited to join Black Dyke Band, and accepted saying it felt as though he had \"seven years off for personal development\". It was during this time that he received a master's degree in music at the University of Leeds, and went on to complete his PhD in psychology The stay once again lasted five years with him leaving in December 2005.  Within days he joined Grimethorpe Colliery Band after the band manager, invited him to join, as the principal cornet had left only as few days previously.  In his first contest for Grimethorpe they came first beating his former band by one point whilst also picking up the best soloist award Roger left Grimethorpe in December 2008 along with several colleagues and is currently busy performing as a soloist and orchestral trumpeter (receiving great critical acclaim for his flugal playing in Mahler 3 and trumpet work in Gregson's Dream Song.). Webster worked for Besson whilst they were situated near London, and continues to work for them following their take-over by Buffet Crampon. Roger rejoined Grimethorpe in 2015 on principal cornet in a bid to help Grimethorpe become as successful as their recent history, when Webster was last in the band Roger has recently been awarded a professorship at the RNCM.  In 2012 Webster released his first solo CD in eight years, however, this CD was for the charity Help For Heroes, and he was accompanied by The Guards' Brass Band .\n\nParagraph 2: While the German intention was to \"pinch off\" the Red Army's offensive thrust at the base of the penetration between Borisovka and Grayvoron south of Vorskla river, the rapid tempo of the Steppe and Voronezh Fronts offensive meant that by the time the counter-attacks were executed the city had been evacuated on 6 August, and German forces were now defending Kharkov. The Wehrmacht's Mobile Forces were heading into an encounter with the main thrust of the Soviet Front tank armies. The German counter-attacks were carried out by the III Panzercorps of the Armeeabteilung \"Kempf\" in the Olshany area, and the XLVIII Panzercorps of the 4th Panzerarmee in the two-pincer manoeuvre of the Krasnokutsk and Akhtyrka areas. In the fighting that took place on both sides of the Merla & Merchik rivers, the superiority of the German Panzer Divisions was clearly evident, in spite of being involved in combat operations continuously since the 5th of July. Whilst 5th SS Panzer Division 'Wiking' & 3rd Panzer Division conducted primarily defensive operations, 2nd SS Panzer Division 'Das Reich', 3rd SS Panzer Division 'Totenkopf' repeatedly blunted attacks of Soviet elements south of the rivers and Bogodukhov. As at Prokhorovka, the Russians enjoyed tremendous numerical superiority in tanks. Both 1st Tank Army & 5th Guards Tank Army began the operations with over 500 tanks each, while the SS Divisions never had more than about 30-50 tanks each at any time during August. In spite of this, all Soviet attempts to penetrate to the railroad line were repulsed with bloody losses in men and tremendous loss in tanks. Katukov's 1st Tank Army thrusts south of the Merchik were repeatedly cut off & destroyed by III Panzercorps. The attempts by Rotmistrov's 5th Guards Tank Army Army to penetrate to the rail line from east of Bogodukhov were frustrated by 3rd Panzer Division & 'Wiking', with key defensive fighting by elements of 'Das Reich'. 'Totenkopf' executed a masterful attack that cut off elements of infantry and armour from the 27th Army & 6th Guards Army south of Krasnokutsk and then rolled down the line of supply toward Kolomak, south of Konstantinovka. Subsequent attacks encircled disorganized elements of several Russian Divisions and destroyed major portions of them after brief fighting. Subsequently, 'Totenkopf' drove to the Merla & forced a crossing of that river and linked up with 4th Panzerarmee spearheads at Parchomovka. However Großdeutschland was forced to withdraw from that town by Soviet pressure on its Northern flank, & this success could not be followed up.\n\nParagraph 3: His breakthrough came when Universal Studios green-lit him for the lead in yet another Apatow production: Knocked Up (2007), a romantic comedy that follows the repercussions of a drunken one-night stand between his slacker character and Katherine Heigl's just-promoted media personality that results in an unintended pregnancy. Upon completing The 40-Year-Old Virgin, Apatow had approached Rogen about potential starring roles, but the actor suggested many high-concept science fiction ideas. After Apatow insisted that he would work better in real-life situations, the two agreed on the accidental pregnancy concept of this production. Rogen called shooting sex scenes with Heigl \"nerve-racking\" and found comfort with the supporting cast since, even though he played a lead, the focus was not all on him. Made on a $30 million budget and released on June 1, Knocked Up was a critical and commercial hit, garnering an approval rating of 90% on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes and grossing $219 million. Rogen also received favourable reviews. Later that year, he played a supporting part as an irresponsible police officer in Superbad, which he had written with his writing partner, Evan Goldberg, and was co-produced by Apatow. Michael Cera and Jonah Hill originate the main roles, two teenage best friends whose party plans go wrong, based on them. The film and its writing was praised, with critics finding it to be very authentic. It topped the U.S. box office for two weeks in a row. He made a vocal cameo appearance in the animated film Shrek the Third, also released in 2007. Rogen hosted Saturday Night Live in October 2007.\n\nParagraph 4: While the German intention was to \"pinch off\" the Red Army's offensive thrust at the base of the penetration between Borisovka and Grayvoron south of Vorskla river, the rapid tempo of the Steppe and Voronezh Fronts offensive meant that by the time the counter-attacks were executed the city had been evacuated on 6 August, and German forces were now defending Kharkov.

Historical episodes indicate, however, that markets can become far less liquid due to increases in investor risk aversion and uncertainty. While policymakers and market participants know with certainty that these episodes will occur, they must be humble in their ability to predict the timing, scope, and duration of these periods of financial distress. . . . If moored from fundamentals, confidence can give way to complacency, complacency can undermine market discipline and liquidity can falter unexpectedly. . . . [L]iquidity is significantly higher than it would otherwise be due to the proliferation of financial products and innovation by financial providers. This extraordinary growth itself is made possible by remarkable improvements in risk-management techniques. Hewing to my proposed definition, we could equally state that financial innovation has been made possible by high levels of confidence in the strength and integrity of our financial infrastructure, markets and laws. Moreover, remarkable competition among commercial banks, securities firms and other credit intermediaries have helped expand access to—and lower the all-in-cost of—credit. Interest rate risk and credit risk exposures are now more diversified. Look no further than dramatic growth of the derivatives markets. In just the past four years, notional amounts outstanding of interest rate swaps and options tripled, and outstanding credit default swaps surged more than ten-fold. These products allow investors to hedge and unwind positions easily without having to transact in cash markets, expanding the participant pool. Syndication and securitization also lead to greater risk distribution. Commercial and industrial (C&I) lending potential has expanded with the adoption of syndication practices, allowing credit risks to be spread across a greater number of participating banks and non-bank lenders. Perhaps an even more significant support for the expansion of C&I loans is the rapid growth of collateralized loan obligations (CLOs)-special purpose entities that buy C&I loans with funds raised from investors seeking different risk exposures. CLOs allow loans to be financed primarily with high-rated debt securities issued to institutions like mutual funds, pension funds, and insurance companies. Indeed, in recent years, the share of syndicated C&I term loans funded by institutional investors is estimated to have exceed that funded by commercial banks. . . . Of course, investor confidence and liquidity can shift. In the aftermath of a financial shock, if buyers and sellers can no longer agree on the distribution of possible outcomes, their ability to price transactions will be severely limited.\n\nParagraph 6: The Captain was retrieved by Merlyn and revived in the alien magician's home dimension, Otherworld. The Fury detected that its prey again lived, and began to adapt itself to interdimensional travel in order to hunt him down. Meanwhile, the temporal overseer Mandragon destroyed Earth-238 in order to kill Jaspers; the Fury barely escaped to Captain Britain's native world, Earth-616.  There, the Fury killed several more of Captain Britain's allies, growing ever more powerful as it did so.  Tracking Captain Britain and disabling him, it finally confronted Earth-616's counterpart of Mad Jim Jaspers, who was beginning to organize a program against his own world's superhumans. The Fury determined that this Jaspers was not its creator and therefore was not exempt from its directive to kill superhumans. The two fought on equal footing, but the Fury won when it transported the pair to the empty void that had been Earth-238. Jaspers was unable to use his powers of reality manipulation in a universe where reality had been destroyed, and the Fury swiftly incinerated his brain. The weakened Fury returned to Earth-616, where it was ambushed and destroyed by Captain Britain and Captain UK, sustaining more damage in the process than it could regenerate.\n\nParagraph 7: Webster was born in 1960 in Doncaster, England.

It was during this time that he received a master's degree in music at the University of Leeds, and went on to complete his PhD in psychology The stay once again lasted five years with him leaving in December 2005.  Within days he joined Grimethorpe Colliery Band after the band manager, invited him to join, as the principal cornet had left only as few days previously.  In his first contest for Grimethorpe they came first beating his former band by one point whilst also picking up the best soloist award Roger left Grimethorpe in December 2008 along with several colleagues and is currently busy performing as a soloist and orchestral trumpeter (receiving great critical acclaim for his flugal playing in Mahler 3 and trumpet work in Gregson's Dream Song.). Webster worked for Besson whilst they were situated near London, and continues to work for them following their take-over by Buffet Crampon. Roger rejoined Grimethorpe in 2015 on principal cornet in a bid to help Grimethorpe become as successful as their recent history, when Webster was last in the band Roger has recently been awarded a professorship at the RNCM.  In 2012 Webster released his first solo CD in eight years, however, this CD was for the charity Help For Heroes, and he was accompanied by The Guards' Brass Band .\n\nParagraph 8: The benefits of greater liquidity are substantial, through higher asset prices and more efficient transfer of funds from savers to borrowers. Historical episodes indicate, however, that markets can become far less liquid due to increases in investor risk aversion and uncertainty. While policymakers and market participants know with certainty that these episodes will occur, they must be humble in their ability to predict the timing, scope, and duration of these periods of financial distress. . . . If moored from fundamentals, confidence can give way to complacency, complacency can undermine market discipline and liquidity can falter unexpectedly. . . . [L]iquidity is significantly higher than it would otherwise be due to the proliferation of financial products and innovation by financial providers. This extraordinary growth itself is made possible by remarkable improvements in risk-management techniques. Hewing to my proposed definition, we could equally state that financial innovation has been made possible by high levels of confidence in the strength and integrity of our financial infrastructure, markets and laws. Moreover, remarkable competition among commercial banks, securities firms and other credit intermediaries have helped expand access to—and lower the all-in-cost of—credit. Interest rate risk and credit risk exposures are now more diversified. Look no further than dramatic growth of the derivatives markets. In just the past four years, notional amounts outstanding of interest rate swaps and options tripled, and outstanding credit default swaps surged more than ten-fold. These products allow investors to hedge and unwind positions easily without having to transact in cash markets, expanding the participant pool. Syndication and securitization also lead to greater risk distribution. Commercial and industrial (C&I) lending potential has expanded with the adoption of syndication practices, allowing credit risks to be spread across a greater number of participating banks and non-bank lenders. Perhaps an even more significant support for the expansion of C&I loans is the rapid growth of collateralized loan obligations (CLOs)-special purpose entities that buy C&I loans with funds raised from investors seeking different risk exposures. CLOs allow loans to be financed primarily with high-rated debt securities issued to institutions like mutual funds, pension funds, and insurance companies. Indeed, in recent years, the share of syndicated C&I term loans funded by institutional investors is estimated to have exceed that funded by commercial banks. . . . Of course, investor confidence and liquidity can shift. In the aftermath of a financial shock, if buyers and sellers can no longer agree on the distribution of possible outcomes, their ability to price transactions will be severely limited.\n\nParagraph 9: His breakthrough came when Universal Studios green-lit him for the lead in yet another Apatow production: Knocked Up (2007), a romantic comedy that follows the repercussions of a drunken one-night stand between his slacker character and Katherine Heigl's just-promoted media personality that results in an unintended pregnancy. Upon completing The 40-Year-Old Virgin, Apatow had approached Rogen about potential starring roles, but the actor suggested many high-concept science fiction ideas. After Apatow insisted that he would work better in real-life situations, the two agreed on the accidental pregnancy concept of this production. Rogen called shooting sex scenes with Heigl \"nerve-racking\" and found comfort with the supporting cast since, even though he played a lead, the focus was not all on him. Made on a $30 million budget and released on June 1, Knocked Up was a critical and commercial hit, garnering an approval rating of 90% on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes and grossing $219 million. Rogen also received favourable reviews. Later that year, he played a supporting part as an irresponsible police officer in Superbad, which he had written with his writing partner, Evan Goldberg, and was co-produced by Apatow. Michael Cera and Jonah Hill originate the main roles, two teenage best friends whose party plans go wrong, based on them. The film and its writing was praised, with critics finding it to be very authentic. It topped the U.S. box office for two weeks in a row. He made a vocal cameo appearance in the animated film Shrek the Third, also released in 2007. Rogen hosted Saturday Night Live in October 2007.\n\nParagraph 10: The Captain was retrieved by Merlyn and revived in the alien magician's home dimension, Otherworld. The Fury detected that its prey again lived, and began to adapt itself to interdimensional travel in order to hunt him down. Meanwhile, the temporal overseer Mandragon destroyed Earth-238 in order to kill Jaspers; the Fury barely escaped to Captain Britain's native world, Earth-616.  There, the Fury killed several more of Captain Britain's allies, growing ever more powerful as it did so.  Tracking Captain Britain and disabling him, it finally confronted Earth-616's counterpart of Mad Jim Jaspers, who was beginning to organize a program against his own world's superhumans. The Fury determined that this Jaspers was not its creator and therefore was not exempt from its directive to kill superhumans. The two fought on equal footing, but the Fury won when it transported the pair to the empty void that had been Earth-238. Jaspers was unable to use his powers of reality manipulation in a universe where reality had been destroyed, and the Fury swiftly incinerated his brain. The weakened Fury returned to Earth-616, where it was ambushed and destroyed by Captain Britain and Captain UK, sustaining more damage in the process than it could regenerate.", "answers": ["7"], "length": 3413, "dataset": "passage_count_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "4f33f4d1d7d8ae1101daea37320fc52e5df9fec8d8d544bf"}

This new collaboration would result in the release of two new studio albums, one in Italian and one in German; Tra due sogni and Geheimnisse. The studio album Tra due sogni was released on the Metronome label in Germany, Greece, Spain, Japan and Argentina. In Italy, it was released on the Dischi Ricordi label, while in France it was released on the Polydor label. It was released in Argentina as Tra Due Sogni – Entre Dos Sueños on the Polydor label in 1987. The album spawned three singles; the Maxi single Canto a Lloret, released in Italy, the 7\" single Canto a Lloret/Blue Notte, released in France on the Barclay label, as well as the 7\" single Canto a Lloret/Spring, Summer, Winter and Fall, which was released by the Polydor label in Spain. The album was released on the Seven Seas label in Japan in 1987, and was reissued in 1992. Shortly after the release of Tra due sogni, Milva recorded a German version of the album, entitled Geheimnisse, which was released on the Metronome label. The album contained German versions of the songs presented on Tra due sogni, plus one song, Venedig im Winter, which was omitted from the Italian version. The Italian version, Tra due sogni, contained an Italian language version of the song Da oben ist sein Zimmer, In sogno, which had appeared on her 1981 album Ich hab' keine Angst. Geheimnisse produced two 7\" singles; Du gibst mir mehr/Etwas mehr and Deine Frau/Arie, both released in West Germany on the Metronome label in 1986. Vangelis was credited with composing all songs on both Tra due sogni and Geheimnisse and was credited as the arranger on the songs \"Canto a Lloret\" (Du gibst mir mehr), \"Cuori di passagio\" (Wunche) and \"L'Ultima Carmen\" (Die letzte Carmen). Milva covered Spring, Summer, Winter and Fall, originally by Aphrodite's Child, in English, a track which appeared on both Italian and German versions of the album. She also covered Bizet's Habanera.\n\nParagraph 3: The Western Australian Men’s cricket team, formerly nicknamed the Western Warriors, represent the Australian state of Western Australia in Australian domestic cricket.

Yet for these new sounds  was still used before the letters  and .  The letter thus represented two distinct values. Subsequently, the Latin phoneme  (spelled ) de-labialized to  meaning that the various Romance languages had  before front vowels.  In addition, Norman used the letter  so that the sound  could be represented by either  or , the latter of which could represent either  or  depending on whether it preceded a front vowel letter or not. The convention of using both  and  was applied to the writing of English after the Norman Conquest, causing a considerable re-spelling of the Old English words.

This new collaboration would result in the release of two new studio albums, one in Italian and one in German; Tra due sogni and Geheimnisse. The studio album Tra due sogni was released on the Metronome label in Germany, Greece, Spain, Japan and Argentina. In Italy, it was released on the Dischi Ricordi label, while in France it was released on the Polydor label. It was released in Argentina as Tra Due Sogni – Entre Dos Sueños on the Polydor label in 1987. The album spawned three singles; the Maxi single Canto a Lloret, released in Italy, the 7\" single Canto a Lloret/Blue Notte, released in France on the Barclay label, as well as the 7\" single Canto a Lloret/Spring, Summer, Winter and Fall, which was released by the Polydor label in Spain. The album was released on the Seven Seas label in Japan in 1987, and was reissued in 1992. Shortly after the release of Tra due sogni, Milva recorded a German version of the album, entitled Geheimnisse, which was released on the Metronome label. The album contained German versions of the songs presented on Tra due sogni, plus one song, Venedig im Winter, which was omitted from the Italian version. The Italian version, Tra due sogni, contained an Italian language version of the song Da oben ist sein Zimmer, In sogno, which had appeared on her 1981 album Ich hab' keine Angst. Geheimnisse produced two 7\" singles; Du gibst mir mehr/Etwas mehr and Deine Frau/Arie, both released in West Germany on the Metronome label in 1986. Vangelis was credited with composing all songs on both Tra due sogni and Geheimnisse and was credited as the arranger on the songs \"Canto a Lloret\" (Du gibst mir mehr), \"Cuori di passagio\" (Wunche) and \"L'Ultima Carmen\" (Die letzte Carmen). Milva covered Spring, Summer, Winter and Fall, originally by Aphrodite's Child, in English, a track which appeared on both Italian and German versions of the album. She also covered Bizet's Habanera.\n\nParagraph 6: The Western Australian Men’s cricket team, formerly nicknamed the Western Warriors, represent the Australian state of Western Australia in Australian domestic cricket. The team is selected and supported by the Western Australian Cricket Association (WACA), and plays its home games at the WACA Ground and Perth Stadium in Perth. The team mainly plays matches against other Australian states in the first-class Sheffield Shield competition and the limited-overs JLT One-Day Cup, but occasionally plays matches against touring international sides. Western Australia previously also fielded sides at Twenty20 level, but was replaced by the Perth Scorchers for the inaugural 2011–12 season of the Big Bash League.

His fleet of 17 sailing ships, 2 galleasses and 8 galleys was not large enough or adequately prepared. Murad, the Kapudan Pasha (admiral) left Istanbul with 30 sailing ships, 6 galleasses (known in Turkey as mahons), and 40 galleys on 10 May and reached the Narrows, just above the mouth of the Dardanelles, on 15 May. His fleet was formed into 3 lines: sailing ships first, then galleasses, then galleys. The next day Delfino attacked. His plan was for his ships to remain at anchor until the Turks passed and then to attack the rear. However most Venetian ships sailed too soon, leaving Delfinos ship, San Giorgio grande, that of his second, Daniele Morosini, Aquila d'Oro, along with Orsola Bonaventura (Sebastiano Molino), Margarita, 2 galleasses and 2 galleys without support. Aquila d'Oro was attacked first, by a large Ottoman ship which she managed to capture, before 5 Turkish vessels came to its rescue. The Ottoman vessel ended up being burnt, leading to the burning of Aquila d'Oro too. Morosini was taken prisoner as he tried to flee in a boat. The action became more general, and when it was over the Venetians had lost 2 ships and 1 galley burnt, 1 galley captured, as well as the leader of the galleys, Francesco Morosini, killed, and Daniele Morosini captured. Total casualties were 30 killed and about 40 wounded, although one account had higher figures. Ottoman losses were 2 sailing ships burnt, and perhaps 1 galleass and 1 galley lost.\n\nParagraph 2: 1963 Zero in amore / Come un tramonto1963 Tu dirai/Sei ore1964 Come ti vorrei/La nostra spiaggia1964 Credi/Resta sola come sei1964 Come ti vorrei / Chi potrà amarti1965 I tuoi anni più belli / Un altro giorno verrà 1965 Accarezzami amore / Mi cercherai1965 Caro mio / Non tornar mai1966 La notte dell'addio / Caldo è l'amore1966 Fra noi / Gold Snake1966 Ma pecché / Tu saje a verità1966 Monete d’oro / Ci amiamo troppo1967 Non pensare a me / Vita1967 Quel momento / Dove è lui1967 Le montagne (ci amiamo troppo) / Vivere non-vivere1967 Dolcemente / Come stai bene e tu?1968 Per vivere / Non accetterò1968 Amore amor / Sleeping1968 La felicità / Anche così1968 La felicità / Ci vuole così poco1968 Senza catene / Diverso dagli altri1969 Zingara / Io sogno1969 Due grosse lacrime bianche / Tienimi con te1969 Un bacio sulla fronte / Accanto a te1969 Che vuoi che sia / Perché mai1969 Vivrò / Estasi d'amore1970 L'arca di Noé / Aria di settembre1970 Un uomo senza tempo / Un attimo1970 Un fiume amaro / Il sogno é fumo1970 Un fiume amaro / Tienimi con te1970 Una storia di mezzanotte / Il bimbo e la gazzella1971 La riva bianca e la riva nera / Tu non-sei più innamorato di me1971 Coraggio e paura / Sciogli i cavalli al vento1972 Ma che amore / Il mio bambino1972 Nonostante lei / Non scordarti di me1972 Alla mia gente / Dall'amore in poi1972 La mia sera / Il sole splende ancora1972 Mi ha stregato il viso tuo / A te1973 I mulini della mente / Basterà1973 Le giornate dell'amore / Chi mi manca é lui1973 Fred Bongusto:White Christmas/ Natale dura un giorno1974 L'indifferenza / Sarà domani1974 Ciao cara come stai? / Vendetta1974 Testarda io / Sei tornato a casa tua1975 Testarda io / E la notte é qui1975 Io sarò la tua idea / Jesus1976 Mamma tutto / Dormi,amore dormi1976 I discorsi tuoi / Confessioni1977 Arrivederci padre / Che uomo sei1977 Munasterio 'e Santa Chiara / 'O destino1977 Mal d'amore / Selvaggio1978 Con la voglia di te / Sei contento1979 Per te / Pronto 1131979 La valigia / Ditemi1979 A parte il fatto / Capirai1981 Ardente / E tu mai1983 Aria di luna / Amico1984 Chi (mi darà) / Comandante1984 Quando arriverà / Sera di vento1985 Da domani senza te / Aria di luna1987 Volo / Uomini e no2001 Ho bisogno di te 2009 Ti voglio senza amoreSanremo Music Festival\n\nParagraph 3: In the 1980s, Rosalino \"Chalino\" Sánchez contributed to narcocorridos.

India's defensive approach was based on playing the waiting game on slow turners, expecting the inexperienced Pakistani batting line-up (with just Imran and Miandad having played more than 30 tests) to crumble at some point . For four tests, they waited until at Bangalore, Kapil Dev, having led India to two 2–0 wins (against England (away) and against Sri Lanka (at home), came under immense pressure to get a result. Both captains misread the wicket: Pakistanis played the left-arm fast-bowler Saleem Jaffer who would not bowl a ball in the match. Imran won the toss and batted and Tauseef's glorious run began; he scored a crucial unbeaten 15 in the first innings enabling Pakistanis to cross 100 and then sparked the fightback by bowling Krish Srikkanth and Sunil Gavaskar through the gate that very day. Pakistanis, after getting bowled out for just 116, in spun India out for just 145 with both Tauseef and Iqbal Qasim getting five wickets each. In the second innings, Tauseef's all-round skills reached a peak when he was part of the only 50-run partnership of the match, his own share being just 10, as Pakistanis set India a target of 221 to win. That day would end with Tauseef firing out Dilip Vengsarkar and Kiran More. The next day, Pakistanis, hunting for the remaining six wickets, got four through Iqbal Qasim, including that of the threatening Sunil Gavaskar, before Tauseef's sharp-spinning off break went through Shivlal Yadav's defences. Roger Binny hit back with a massive six of Tauseef who was surprised when Imran handed the ball to him to have another go. He did and so did Binny and could only manage an inside edge to Saleem Yousuf who gobbled it up to give Pakistanis their first-ever test series win in India.

Deforestation is the permanent destruction of forests and woodlands. Deforestation is brought about by commercial logging, conversion of woodlands to agricultural land, and the felling of trees for firewood and building material. Commercial logging is that harvest of timber products for the profit that is gained from selling the product. Illegal logging is a threat to forests. Illegal logging is the harvest of timber for economic gain without permission. This method is a threat because it impedes plans and upkeep of a forest. Forests are lost to urban development and building projects. When forest are cleared for these reasons, it creates problems that foresters are concerned with. When heavy machinery is used to clear forests or develop land, the soil becomes compacted. When the soil is compacted, the soil particles are packed tightly together. Soil compaction results in water supply not being absorbed by tree roots and can be deadly to the growth of trees. Soil compaction also can create flooding. Compacted soil can not filter the groundwater into the soil, therefore water can build up on the surface creating flooding as a result. Species extinction is another threat to our forests. With the removal of forests, animal and plant species suffer. Animal species can not survive without the adequate needs of their lifestyle. Animals need cover, food, and safe areas for the reproduction process. Altering their environment disrupts the life cycle of animal species and they are oftentimes not able to adapt. Food sources are lost to deforestation. Animal species tend to consume plant life to maintain themselves. With the removal of forests this can result in animals not being able to find food in order to survive. Unmanaged recreational use is also a threat to forests. Unmanaged recreational use is the use of the forested lands by the public at an uncontrolled rate. As recreational use as increased among forests, foresters have noticed an increase in land management that is needed. Invasive species threaten forests ecosystems. Invasive species are any species that is not native to that ecosystem and economic harm along with harm to the environment. Invasive species cause disruptions in the function of the ecosystem. These species not only affect the plants within a forest, but they can affect the animals within an ecosystem as well. The financial impact cause by invasive species is 138 billion dollars per year with economic loss and control costs.\n\nParagraph 4: Before fall 2006, Lamar maintained a dress code allowing for students to wear most types of clothing.

However, the vast majority of buildings and archaeological sites are located within the zone of most intensive quarantine activity, which is more or less contiguous with the current NPWS managed area of the Quarantine Station. The NPWS has carried out a number of historical archaeological surveys of areas of the Quarantine Station itself, though there has as yet been no systematic survey of the entire study area. These surveys have identified a large number of former building sites and other features, and has indicated where as yet unlocated building sites might be located. The site numbers beginning with \"P\" relate to \"Potential Sites\". Forty-eight such sites had been identified by 1992. Because the Quarantine Station has experienced over 150 years of quarantine activity, there is a layering of evidence on and in the ground that reflects the slow growth of the Station, the major development and redevelopment programs, and the subsequent removals and constructions. This evidence exists as independent evidence, though it is also complementary to the documentary evidence, and in large part cannot be interpreted without reference to the latter. Because the land-use over this period has been solely devoted to quarantine, the evidence is, on the whole, only impacted by later quarantine activity, so the understanding of both the creation and the destruction of the former buildings and landscape elements contributes to the story of quarantine. Because in many cases current building a relocated on the same sites as earlier building, and as many of the surviving buildings have a long history of their own, all sub-floor deposits are considered to have archaeological potential. The changes over time reflected by the surviving buildings and features and the archaeological sites reflect various aspects of the history of quarantine, public health and society as a whole. The stories able to be illuminated by the physical evidence include, among many others: the Aboriginal occupation of North Head; the changing attitudes to quarantine and its administration; the developing medical and epidemiological knowledge; the development of Australia's immigration policies, and the experience of individuals and groups within that history; the changing attitudes to class and race; the iconography used by inmates to memorialise their experience, in the 1,000 plus inscriptions, memorials and gravestones, and Australia's experience of war, both in the diseases contracted by the military personnel buried in the Quarantine Station cemeteries, and in the direct defence of Sydney. An unusual aspect of the collection of historical archaeological evidence at the Quarantine Station is that it all contributes to the understanding of this one theme of quarantine as well as to associated broader themes, and a large amount of evidence appears to have survived. This vests the archaeological sites with a very high research potential for ongoing study of this important aspect of Australian history. In addition to the archaeological potential of buildings which have been demolished, the Quarantine Station buildings also offer the opportunity to research the archaeology of standing structures. As a tightly dated and well-documented group of buildings they have potential to provide information on changes in domestic living arrangements over the past 150 years.\n\nParagraph 7: The filming of The Godfather faced strong opposition from the Italian-American Civil Rights League, with disputes headed by Joe Colombo and Frank Sinatra threatening its whole production. Producer Al Ruddy eventually made a deal with the league and Joe Colombo to cut the word Mafia (which was only used once in the script) and the League would back the production of the film. This meant mobsters would be present on the set of The Godfather. In 1971, when Montana was acting as a bodyguard for a senior Colombo family member, he met Francis Ford Coppola and Al Ruddy. After being introduced to the 6'6\" 320-pound Montana, they quickly cast him for the role of Luca Brasi. When Bettye McCartt, Al Ruddy's assistant, broke her watch, Montana offered to get her a new one. A week later, Montana returned with a \"gift from the boys\" – an antique diamond watch. He was picked for the part after the original actor playing the character died of a stroke. This was his first credited film appearance. Montana was very nervous about appearing opposite Brando. Director Coppola incorporated this real-life tension into several scenes, showing Brasi repeatedly practicing (and later fumbling) his congratulations to Corleone. Montana had little screen time in the film (although his final scene is one of the most suspenseful in the film), but his notable height and physique caught the eye of producers, and he appeared in several movies and television programs after appearing in The Godfather.\n\nParagraph 8: A study of 11 porocarcinomas detected a YAP-NUTM1 fusion gene in the tumor cells in 6 cases while a sampling of 104 promos found this fusion gene in 21 cases; the YAP-NUTM1 fusion gene was not detected in a wide range of other skin tumor types. Other studies have found indirect evidence that this fusion gene was expressed in the PCA tissue cells of 5 of 12 and 8 of 40 PCA cases. A fusion gene is an abnormal gene consisting of parts from two different genes that are merged as a result of a large scale gene mutation such as a chromosomal translocation, interstitial deletion, or inversion. The YAP1-NUTM1 fusion gene is a translocation that merges part of the protein coding region of the NUTM1 gene located in band 14 on the long (or \"q\") arm of chromosome 15 with a part of the YAP1 gene located in band 22.1 on the long (i.e. \"q\") arm of chromosome 11 Studies on cultured immortalized human dermal keratinocyte (i.e. HDK) cells and mouse embryonic fibroblast NIH-3T3 cells found that YAP1-NUTM1 fusion genes stimulated the anchorage-independent growth of NIH-3T3 cells and activated a transcriptional enhancer factor family member (i.e. TEAD family member) reporter gene. TEAD family transcription factors (also known as transcriptional enhancer factors (TEFs) in humans include four members, TEAD1, TEAD2, TEAD3, and TEAD4 that are transcription factors, i.e. proteins that regulate the expression of various genes. TEAD transcription factors interact with transcription coregulators, including in particular the YAK1 protein, to activate various cell signaling pathways including the Hippo pathway and to regulate cellular maturation, cellular proliferation, and the development of various tissues, organs, and cancers. Cancers associated with the overexpression or overactivation of the TEAD transcription factors include those of the breasts, kidneys, stomach, liver, colon, rectum, prostate, brain (i.e. medulloblastomas), and the head and neck area (i.e. squamous cell carcinomas). It is suggested that the YAP1-NUTM1 fusion gene and the Hippo pathway which it activates may contribute to the development and progression of PCA and serve as therapeutic targets to treat YAP1-NUTM1 fusion gene bearing-PCA tumors. However, further studies are needed to confirm these suggestions. The tumor tissues of CPA have also been reported to express the YAP1-MAML2 fusion gene (1 of 11 cases), the EMC7-NUTM1 (EMC7 is the ER membrane protein complex subunit 7 gene, see endoplasmic reticulum membrane protein complex) fusion gene in a single case, and, in individual cases, mutations in the TP53, RB1, CDKN2A and HRAS    tumor suppressor genes. Further studies are needed to determine if the latter fusion or mutated genes can be used as diagnostic markers or therapeutic targets for treating PCA tumors.\n\nParagraph 9: Bull's-Eye Ball (called Hot Shot in Germany) is a skee ball game developed by Hasbro (through its subsidiary Tiger Electronics). Small steel balls must be bounced via an elastic diaphragm into a narrow inlet in order to win points. The entire device is approximately the size of four soda cans. It consists of 3 different games: 30 Second Blitz, where the goal is to get as many points as possible within 30 seconds; 25 Point Rush, where the player must get 25 points as fast as possible; and Bull's-Eye Ace, where the player tries to get a large percentage of bull's-eyes.\n\nParagraph 10: All of these sites and structures are related to the history of the Quarantine Station, and are significant physical evidence of the development and contraction of quarantine functions over time.

{"input": "", "context": "Paragraph 1: In the 3-D Tetris mode, a layer disappears when it's filled with blocks, scoring players points which are displayed in the HUD. If blocks stack over the top of the well, the number of layers will go down by one. The game is over when the final layer is lost. One game mode is based on accumulating points, while the other mode requires players to complete multiple levels by clearing all five layers in each. In the Center-Fill mode, players place blocks in symmetrical patterns around center blocks placed in each well's layers. If a block is placed in a layer's center block, it disappears, and any other blocks in the layer will also disappear, if they have been successfully placed in a symmetrical pattern. Points are gained based on the number of blocks in, the complexity of, and the height of the symmetrical layer. A symmetrical pattern is indicated by a symbol shown in the HUD's radar, as well as the player's score. Like the 3-D Tetris mode, layers will be lost if the blocks go over the top of the well, and the game ends when all layers are lost. One variant requires players to complete as many layers as possible, while the other is the same except with obstacles added. The variant Clear It! requires players to clear ten symmetrical layers on each stage to progress to the next stage. In the Puzzle mode, a shape is displayed in the well at the beginning of each stage. Players are tasked with getting to the highest stage possible by placing blocks in the displayed shape to progress to the next stage. At the end of each stage, a stage-ending animation is displayed. If an incorrect shape is placed, the game ends. 3D Tetris includes an option to save high scores and names entered from the 3-D Tetris and Center-Fill modes, along with progress in the Puzzle mode, to a battery backup.\n\nParagraph 2: \"The first discovery of the Principia is due to Miss Greenall, who about 1905 was building a house close to the school and took care that certain remains found by her builders should be duly noted: excavations in 1906-07, however, left the size and extent of these remains somewhat uncertain and resulted in what we now know to be an incorrect plan. The work done last spring (1913) makes it plain (see illustration) that the Principia fronted — in normal fashion — the main street of the fort (gravel laid on cobbles) running from the north to the south gate. But, abnormally, the frontage was formed by a verandah or colonnade: the only parallel which I can quote is from Caersws, where excavations in 1909 revealed a similar verandah in front of the Principia. Next to the verandah stood the usual Outer Court with a colonnade round it and two wells in it (one is the usual provision): the colonnade seemed to have been twice rebuilt. Beyond that are fainter traces of the Inner Court which, however, lies mostly underneath a churchyard: the only fairly clear feature is a room (A on plan) which seems to have stood on the right side of the Inner Court, as at Chesters and Ambleside. Behind this, probably, stood the usual five office rooms. If we carry the Principia about twenty feet further back, which would be a full allowance for these rooms with their walling, the end of the whole structure will line with the ends of the granaries found some years ago. This, or something very like it, is what we should naturally expect. We then obtain a structure measuring 81 × , the latter dimension including a verandah  wide. This again seems a reasonable result. Ribchester was a large fort, about , garrisoned by cavalry; in a similar fort at Chesters, on Hadrian's Wall, the Principia measured 85 × : in the 'North Camp' at Camelon, another fort of much the same size (nearly 6 acres), they measured 92 × .\"\n\nParagraph 3: Victoria Libertas (also known as \"VL\" or in Italian Vuelle), full name Unione Sportiva Victoria Libertas Pallacanestro, is a professional basketball team that is based in Pesaro, Italy. The club competes in the top level Italian professional basketball league, the Lega Basket Serie A (LBA). It was commonly known across Europe as Scavolini Pesaro, from the name of its historical main sponsor Scavolini (from 1975 to 2014), an Italian kitchen and bathroom products designer and manufacturer, whose co-founder Valter Scavolini was formerly club president. Now, it is known as Carpegna Prosciutto Basket Pesaro after its title sponsor. For past club sponsorship names, see the list below.\n\nParagraph 4: By definition, each value contained within the B+ tree is a key contained in exactly one leaf node. Each key is required to be directly comparable with every other key, which forms a total order. This enables each leaf node to keep all of its keys sorted at all times, which then enables each internal node to construct an ordered collection of intervals representing the contiguous extent of values contained in a given leaf. Internal nodes higher in the tree can then construct their own intervals, which recursively aggregate the intervals contained in their own child internal nodes. Eventually, the root of a B+ Tree represents the whole range of values in the tree, where every internal node represents a subinterval.\n\nParagraph 5: In Volume 2 of the TMNT comics, April was attacked by a huge robot controlled by the brain of her former boss, Baxter Stockman, and injected with nanobots. With the help of the Utroms, the Turtles injected April with turtle versions of nanobots to stop Baxter's plan. The intervention saved April before Baxter's nanobots could reach her brain stem and kill her. The attack rendered April sterile. To deal with the emotional strain she became a female version of \"Nobody\", a vigilante crime fighter, until her identity was discovered by Casey Jones. With the help of Renet, a time-traveler who took April back through time, it was revealed that April was really a living drawing brought to life with the help of Kirby's crystal. She was drawn by her father before his own biological daughter Robyn O'Neil was born. Although anything that Kirby drew with pencil would vanish after a while, April's father used a pen, which might explain why April lived past thirty without vanishing. Questions of realness and morality were too much for April; she bid farewell to Shadow and Casey and travelled to Alaska to be alone with her thoughts. Although the trip helped April cope with her demons and led to her eventual return to New York, her family history remained unexplored.\n\nParagraph 6: Business Careers High School has been known for exemplary students.  Grades at this magnet school are typically higher than traditional high schools and as such, is said to be competitive.  To remain at BC, students are expected to maintain a \"C\" average or higher.  Holmes and Business Careers keep their graduating class sizes separate from each other to recognize each school's individual potentials, i.e. recognizing officially separate Valedictorians and Salutatorians.  Recognizing a Valedictorian/Salutatorian from each school helps to distinguish between those that work hard at BC and those at Holmes.  Holmes senior class sizes tend to vary between 240 students to as many as 600 depending on the year of enrollment, while Business Careers senior class sizes tend to vary with as many as over 200 to as low as 70.  The lower the class size, the more competitive the atmosphere tends to be since a class of 70 would make quartiles shorter and top ten percent 7 students.  Still, the school recognizes top ten students at graduation with just as much emphasis as a traditional high school.  A separate \"combined\" ranking is given to students at Business Careers their senior year to recognize higher potential students since low-class sizes can make some students look worse than others even though this is not an official class rank, it is just used for informational purposes only.  What makes the school competitive is its honors program which it shares with Holmes High School.  Advanced Placement (AP) subjects offered include Mathematics, English, Social studies, Science, Fine arts, International Language, and Computer Sciences.  Honors classes include the same.  Such courses give weighted points as deemed necessary for students' GPA (grade point average).  Honors courses are denoted 5 extra points and AP courses are denoted 8 extra points though these grades are not shown on a student's transcript, but are only reflected on a student's GPA.\n\nParagraph 7: Victoria Libertas (also known as \"VL\" or in Italian Vuelle), full name Unione Sportiva Victoria Libertas Pallacanestro, is a professional basketball team that is based in Pesaro, Italy.

By adopting a parasitic mode of life with use of nutrients from their hosts, many Mollicutes were able to reduce their genetic material considerably. On the other hand, they lost the genes for many assimilative processes. Thus, Mycoplasma possibly became the smallest self-replicating organism in nature. Mycoplasma genitalium, with 580,000 base pairs, has an especially small genome size. Some phytoplasmas also have a very small genome size. The genera with the smallest genome are considered to be phylogenetically the most \"recent\" mollicutes.\n\nParagraph 10: Victoria Libertas (also known as \"VL\" or in Italian Vuelle), full name Unione Sportiva Victoria Libertas Pallacanestro, is a professional basketball team that is based in Pesaro, Italy.

It is expressly declared in the Act that nothing in it shall affect the provisions of the Coal Mines Acts with reference to payment by weight, or legalize any deductions, from payments made, in pursuance of those provisions. The powers and duties of inspectors are extended to cover the case of a laundry, and of any place where work is given out by the occupier of a factory or workshop or by a contractor or subcontractor. Power is reserved for the secretary of state to exempt by order specified trades or branches of them in specified areas from the provisions of the Act of 1896, if he is satisfied that they are unnecessary for the protection of the workmen. This power has been exercised only in respect of one highly organised industry, the Lancashire cotton industry. The effect of the exemption is not to prevent fines and deductions from being made, but the desire for it demonstrated that there are cases where leaders among workers have felt competent to make their own terms on their own lines without the specific conditions laid down in this Act. The reports of the inspectors of factories have demonstrated that in other industries much work has had to be done under this act, and knowledge of a highly technical character to be gradually acquired, before opinions could be formed as to the reasonableness and fairness, or the contrary, of many forms of deduction. Owing partly to difficulties of legal interpretation involving the necessity of taking test cases into court, partly to the margin for differences of opinion as to what constitutes \"reasonableness\" in a deduction, the average number of convictions obtained on prosecutions is not so high as under the Factory Acts, though the average penalty imposed is higher. In 1904, 61 cases were taken into court resulting in 34 convictions with an average penalty of £1, 10s. In 1905, 38 cases resulting in 34 convictions were taken with an average penalty of £1, 3s. In 1906, 37 cases resulting in 25 convictions were taken with an average penalty of £1, 10s.\n\nParagraph 13: The Bain Capital team was initially reluctant to invest its capital. By 1985, things were going poorly enough that Romney considered closing the operation, returning investors' money to them, and having the partners go back to their old positions. The partners saw weak spots in so many potential deals that by 1986, very few had been done. At first, Bain Capital focused on venture capital opportunities. One of Bain's earliest and most notable venture investments was in Staples, Inc., the office supply retailer. In 1986, Bain provided $4.5 million to two supermarket executives, Leo Kahn and Thomas G. Stemberg, to open an office supply supermarket in Brighton, Massachusetts. The fast-growing retail chain went public in 1989; by 1996, the company had grown to over 1,100 stores, and as of fiscal year-end January 2012, Staples reached over $20 billion in sales, nearly $1.0B in net income, 87,000 employees, and 2,295 stores. Bain Capital eventually reaped a nearly sevenfold return on its investment, and Romney sat on the Staples board of directors for over a decade. Another very successful investment occurred in 1986 when $1 million was invested in medical equipment maker Calumet Coach, which eventually returned $34 million. A few years later, Bain Capital made an investment in the technology research outfit the Gartner Group, which ended up returning a 16-fold gain.\n\nParagraph 14: Any workman or shop assistant may recover any sum deducted by or paid to his employer contrary to the Act of 1896, provided that proceedings are commenced within six months, and that where he has acquiesced in the deduction or payment he shall only recover the excess over the amount which the court may find to have been fair and reasonable in all the circumstances of the case.

It had its first serious peak in the late 1950s, when Croatian film were possibly the most mature in then-young Yugoslav film industry.  The most important author of that era was Branko Bauer, a Dubrovnik-born director whose most famous film is the urban war thriller Don't Turn Around Son (Ne okreći se, sine, 1956). Loosely based on Carol Reed's film Odd Man Out, it describes a destiny of a fugitive from an Ustasha camp who comes to Zagreb to find his son, then realizing that the kid is at the Ustaše boarding school, and completely brainwashed. The hero struggles to leave Zagreb with his son, while deluding the son all the way about the goal of their trip. Among other important Bauer films is Tri Ane (Three Annas, 1959), produced in Macedonia, about a father who finds out that his daughter, whom he presumed to have been killed in the war, could be alive and adult person. Bauer's film Licem u lice (Face To Face, 1962) tells the story about a corrupt director of a construction company who confronts a rebel worker during a communist party cell meeting. It is considered the first overtly political film in Yugoslavia. Another notable 1950s' figure is Nikola Tanhofer, former cinematographer and specialist for various action genres. His most famous film is H8 (1958), a reconstruction of a real traffic accident in which several passengers on an intercity bus between Zagreb and Belgrade were killed, and in which the driver of the car who caused the accident escaped. Following in parallel three vehicles and dozens of picturesque scenes, H8 offers a mosaic-like picture of late 1950s society, and its dramaturgy resembles a - then nonexistent - disaster movie genre. In that period, two Croatian films were Academy Award nominees for foreign language film. Both of them were directed by guests from abroad: an Italian Giuseppe De Santis (Cesta duga godina dana - A Road One Year Long, 1958), and a Slovenian France Štiglic (Deveti krug - Ninth Circle, 1960).\n\nParagraph 3: Croatian feature films from the 1950s were not easily distinguishable from those made in the rest of Yugoslavia; this was mainly owing to the free flow of resources, information and talent among the various parts of the country.

Bauer's film Licem u lice (Face To Face, 1962) tells the story about a corrupt director of a construction company who confronts a rebel worker during a communist party cell meeting. It is considered the first overtly political film in Yugoslavia. Another notable 1950s' figure is Nikola Tanhofer, former cinematographer and specialist for various action genres. His most famous film is H8 (1958), a reconstruction of a real traffic accident in which several passengers on an intercity bus between Zagreb and Belgrade were killed, and in which the driver of the car who caused the accident escaped. Following in parallel three vehicles and dozens of picturesque scenes, H8 offers a mosaic-like picture of late 1950s society, and its dramaturgy resembles a - then nonexistent - disaster movie genre. In that period, two Croatian films were Academy Award nominees for foreign language film. Both of them were directed by guests from abroad: an Italian Giuseppe De Santis (Cesta duga godina dana - A Road One Year Long, 1958), and a Slovenian France Štiglic (Deveti krug - Ninth Circle, 1960).\n\nParagraph 4: Croatian feature films from the 1950s were not easily distinguishable from those made in the rest of Yugoslavia; this was mainly owing to the free flow of resources, information and talent among the various parts of the country.  It had its first serious peak in the late 1950s, when Croatian film were possibly the most mature in then-young Yugoslav film industry.  The most important author of that era was Branko Bauer, a Dubrovnik-born director whose most famous film is the urban war thriller Don't Turn Around Son (Ne okreći se, sine, 1956). Loosely based on Carol Reed's film Odd Man Out, it describes a destiny of a fugitive from an Ustasha camp who comes to Zagreb to find his son, then realizing that the kid is at the Ustaše boarding school, and completely brainwashed.

Players have the opportunity to civilize adjacent barbarian provinces, eventually reaching the entire Roman Empire at its height. When a province is civilized it unlocks the surrounding provinces. A computerized rival also completes missions both preventing the player from civilizing that province and allowing them to civilize the provinces adjacent to it (the computer has been known to civilize a province it could not have selected when it successfully civilized the last, meaning it is a randomized event, rather than AI). Unlike Caesar III, or Pharaoh, the province and city are separate spheres, as is the military. The player builds primary sector facilities (such as mines or farms), trade facilities (such as roads or docks), and military facilities (such as forts and walls) on one map and builds their city houses, secondary sector facilities (such as wineries or potters), and tertiary sector facilities (such as fire stations, police stations, bath houses) on another (represented as four squares in the center of the provincial map). Also unlike later games walkers are not required to bring services to people, which is instead determined by one buildings distance from another. Invading Armies differ from later games as well, in that Barbarian towns exist within many provinces from which Barbarian armies can emanate. These are converted to Roman towns through invading them and defeating the inhabitants. Most missions require the player to pacify a province and raise the citizens standard of living to a certain level, while neither suffering a military loss, nor losing the emperor's favour, often within a certain time frame. Major factors in city and province-building are housing values and types of housing, unemployment/labour shortages, taxes, wages, deficits, food shortages, military readiness and morale, and imperial demands. The game is won when the player has conquered sufficient provinces to attain the rank of Caesar. The game is lost if the player's computerized rival becomes Caesar, if Caesar removes the player from their post for running too large a deficit, for going beyond the time frame, for failing to follow Imperial demands, or having the city conquered.\n\nParagraph 6: Díaz made his major league debut with the Mets on September 11, 2004. He was impressive during his September tryout, hitting a three-run home run with two outs in the bottom of the ninth inning to win a pivotal game against the playoff-contending Chicago Cubs, essentially knocking them out of the playoffs on September 25, 2004. After the 2004 season, the Mets included Dìaz on their 2005  Opening Day roster, and he played his first and only full Major League season, as in 89 games he hit .257 with 12 home runs and 38 R.B.I.s. On August 22, 2006, Diaz was designated for assignment by the Mets. On August 30, 2006, Diaz was dealt to the Texas Rangers for Mike Nickeas. After the 2006 season, Diaz headed to the Instructional League to work with hitting coach Brook Jacoby on his swing, then he played in the Dominican Winter League. Diaz competed for a spot on the Rangers 25-man roster, but did not make the cut and started the season with Triple-A Oklahoma. Diaz was eventually called up to the Rangers and hit 9 home runs in only 104 at-bats and only 25 hits. He only appeared in 37 games for the Rangers in  and became a free agent after the season.\n\nParagraph 7: When the game begins the Roman empire extends no further than Italy.

The poems reveal a quest for transcendence with a strong theological impulse, though without appeal to dogma.  The judge of the award, Ellen Bryant Voigt, called the book “a musical Bildungroman… a first book of remarkable authority.” Edward Hirsch praised the book as a “work profoundly alert to spiritual matters” composed of ‘finely wrought poems… in search of the sacred,” and Eleanor Wilner viewed the poems as “darkly devotional… unsparing, unsparing at times harrowing in their awareness.” Double Life followed Where the World is Made, a book that gained particular praise for its polyphonic sequence on the life of the Spanish plantation master turned friar, Bartolome de las Casas, and its “Homage to Bosh,” a long ekphrastic poem based on the paintings of Hieronymous Bosh. Eamonn Wall described The Narrows, Tobin's third book which he describes as a “mural in verse” as “a prodigious feat of raw physical, moral, psychic and literary energy.”  Of the book B.H Fairchild wrote: “All stories of arrival and survival in America are the American story, but rarely are they told as compellingly as this one… a poem of narrative power and astonishing lyric depth and grace.” A review of Second Things, his fourth book, marked Tobin as fast becoming “one of the best poets of his generation.” Belated Heavens, in turn, won the Massachusetts Book Award. Of The Net, Tobin's sixth book of poems, David Ferry remarked: These are very beautiful poems, and The Net is a very beautiful book” that displays “an extraordinary capacity for using his resources as a poet through his command of diction and idiom, and through his versification.” “The whole book is a master class in craft,” remarked Jill Alexander Essbaum. The book-length poem From Nothing, on the life of Jesuit priest and physicist, George LeMaitre, won the Julia Ward Howe Award and is part of a proposed three book trilogy.  On From Nothing, Emily Grosholz reflects, “the poet draws the weft of scientific vocabulary through the warp of everyday speech.”  “In From Nothing,” Alan Shapiro declared, “Tobin brings his learning and astounding imaginative powers to bear on such central questions as the origin and end of the universe… a memorable, powerful and moving book that should be read by everyone who wonders how we got here and what our being here can mean.”  Stepehn Schneider called The Stone in the Air, Tobin's suite of translations from the German of Paul Celan, “compelling and haunting, a testimony to the power of language and poetry to confront the unspeakable.”  The New York Times named Blood Labors one of the Best Poetry Books of the Year.  “Blood Labors is an ebullient and ecclesiastical wonder, capturing more of creation, the uncreated, and the recreated than any dozen books on a poetry bookshelf,” Barbara Ras commented, “[it] dazzles with its brilliance.”\n\nParagraph 8: Flanagan returned to the Fire for the 2008/2009 season and continued to be on the roster into the 2014/15 season. During this time, McCully became all-time games record holder for the club with 228. She surpassed former teammate Tania Baxter, who previously held the record with 131. After guiding the Fire to their inaugural championship in 2014/15, McCully became the first player club history to have her number (5) retired. In 2006/2007, she played in 21 games and earned 62 assists. In 2008/2009, she averaged 6.5 points per game for a total of 157 points scored in the season.  She also had 113 assists, leading her team in this area. She was with the team in 2009/2010. That season, she was fourth in the league for steals with an average of 1.7 per game, seventh in the league for four shot percentage at 78.6% and seventh in the league for assists with an average of 4.1 per game. That season, she also averaged 13 points a game, and 3.4 rebounds a game. In the post season, she played in two games where she had an average of 2 assists, 3 steals, 3 rebounds ad 14.5 points per game. In 2009/2010, she was one of the two most players with WNBL experience on the Fire. In an October 2009 game against Canberra, she was fouled with 1.9 left in the game, had two free throws which she made and gave her team the win to the game. In an October 2009 game against the AIS, she scored 19 points in a game her team won 97–62. In the 2010/2011 season, she played in all regular season games, 22 total.  For the season, she had an average of 14.3 points and 4.9 assists per game, which was her best performance to date in the league. She was named the Fire's MVP in 2009/2010, and was named the team's Players' Player and Fans' Player of the Year honours. She was one of the stars on Townsville team. She earned the WNBL's Robyn Maher Defensive Player of Year for the 2009/2010 and 2010/2011 seasons. She was the team captain in 2010/2011. In November 2010, she played in a game against the Australian Institute of Sport that her team won 95–55.  Before a crowd of 478, she scored 24 points, had 5 rebounds and 3 assists. She played for the Townsville Fire in 2011/2012. At the end of the season, she assisted the head coach in player recruitment. She re-signed with the team for another season on 22 March 2012. She was the team's captain. In the 2011/2012 season, she played her 150th game in the league. At the end season, for Townsville, she was the all-time assists leader with 572 and steals with 172. Her 2011/2012 style of play was described by the Townsville Bulletin as gutsy. In a February 2011 game victory for the Dandenong Rangers over Townsville Fire with a score of 70–54, she scored 18 points while forcing 8 turnovers.\n\nParagraph 9: In September 2007 the airport management announced that the second runway might be sold for industrial and residential development. However, this runway cannot be used by commercial airlines. This prompted a response from the city assets manager which indicated a review of the demand for and extent of local interest in a Plymouth City Airport. The end of flights to France together with the added security delays associated with internal air travel when compared with moderately fast road and rail links make Plymouth Airport less attractive than before. Efforts to reinvigorate the support of the local business community met with polite well disposed indifference. Diversion to Newquay is not convenient. The travel on time from London Gatwick to London Victoria adds considerably to total travel time.\n\nParagraph 10: In September 2007 the airport management announced that the second runway might be sold for industrial and residential development.

{"input": "", "context": "Paragraph 1: Nathaniel Black (loosely based on Joseph Louis Cook) is the half-Iroquois son of the late John Black from Act 2 in the previous game, raised by his mother Nonahkee and his uncle Kanyenke (Ká:nien in Definitive Edition). The campaign opens as Nathaniel and Kanyenke are trying to discourage the Mohawk and the Seneca from fighting in the American Revolutionary War. However, they are ambushed by a group of Mohawks and head to an Oneida village nearby. From there they counter-attack and destroy an enemy Town Center, thus causing their enemies to flee. When Nathaniel and Kanyenke return to their village, they find that the Mohawk and a group of Hessian mercenaries led by Colonel Sven Kuechler, have raided the village and captured Nonahkee. They rescue Nonahkee, but Kuechler and his main army escape, leaving the Iroquois Confederacy to dissolve. Nathaniel's village supports the colonists, and Nathaniel heads to Boston where his men help defend a redoubt on Breed's Hill from the British. After George Washington takes command, a series of defeats drives the colonials back across the Delaware, where they are joined by Nathaniel. Here, Washington leads a small force, including Nathaniel, across the Delaware where they attack a Hessian encampment at Trenton and defeat the rearguard of the army at Princeton. This is followed by another victory at the Battles of Saratoga. However, the army is once again defeated at Brandywine and Germantown and is forced to camp for the winter at Valley Forge, where they suffer greatly from the cold. This leads Nathaniel to use most of his family's fortune to supply the army throughout the winter. The next scenario is the fictional battle of Morristown, where Nathaniel has his chance for revenge on Kuechler, who leads an attempt to destroy the capitol building of Morristown. Using artillery shipments he receives from Washington, Nathaniel sneaks around the Hessian flank and relieves Morristown. Refusing to accept defeat, Kuechler joins the fight with Nathaniel and is killed. After Kuechler's death, Nathaniel is said to have fought at Charleston, Camden, and King's Mountain. As the tide begins to turn, the French join the war and help the revolutionaries gain a victory at Yorktown, where Nathaniel is instrumental in capturing several redoubts. With the Revolution won, Nathaniel returns home a poor man having spent his family fortune on outfitting his volunteers and supplying the troops at Valley Forge. During the epilogue video of the campaign (where Nathaniel is at Yorktown), the \"Old Coot\" (secretly Morgan Black) from Acts 1 and 3 in the previous game can be seen watching his great-grandson's victory.\n\nParagraph 2: For the following season, he remained in the same series, joining Penistone Racing, partnering Julian Bailey in their Reynard SF84. Brabham regularly outpaced his team-mate, and despite team orders not to outperform his team-mate, he still was not disgraced taking sixth overall in the final championship positions. During 1984, he tried his hand at other categories, including racing sport cars in the Thundersports Series, taking his maiden victory at Snetterton, sharing a Tiga-Ford TS84 with Tim Lee-Davey.  With no top single-seater drives available for him in 1985, Brabham had a slight reprieve through the Thundersports series, where he raced for the TechSpeed Racing team in a Shrike-Ford P15 alongside Divina Galica, recording five second places.\n\nParagraph 3: Phraates V was the son of the Phraates IV () and his Roman wife Musa, who was originally an Italian slave-girl given to him by the Roman emperor Augustus () after a treaty in 20 BC in which the Romans returned Phraates IV his kidnapped son in return for the lost legionary standards taken at Carrhae in 53 BC, as well as any surviving prisoners of war. The Parthians viewed this exchange as a small price to pay to regain the prince. Musa quickly became queen and a favourite of Phraates IV, giving birth to Phraataces (Phraates V) in . It was reportedly under her influence, that Phraates IV in 10/9 BC sent his four first-born sons to Rome in order to prevent conflict over his succession. In 2 BC, Musa had Phraates IV poisoned and made herself, along with Phraates V, the co-rulers of the Parthian empire. According to the 1st-century Roman historian Josephus, he heard a rumour that Musa enjoyed sexual relations with her son. This and the coinage of Musa with Phraates V, led to some scholars believe that the two had married. However, there is no evidence that supports this claim; neither under the Parthians, nor their Persian predecessors—the Achaemenids—is there reliable evidence that marriage was practised between parents and their children.\n\nParagraph 4: Phraates V was the son of the Phraates IV () and his Roman wife Musa, who was originally an Italian slave-girl given to him by the Roman emperor Augustus () after a treaty in 20 BC in which the Romans returned Phraates IV his kidnapped son in return for the lost legionary standards taken at Carrhae in 53 BC, as well as any surviving prisoners of war.

In an era when ship hulls were uniformly painted black (to conceal inevitable dirt when loading the ship with coal) and superstructures were white (to control the temperature in the passenger accommodation in hot summers) the funnel was one of the few parts of the ship that a company could use to clearly differentiate its ships from those of its competitors.  Each company would have their own \"house colours\", which were often used in publicity material as well as for recognition, making funnel colours an early form of trademark. Some companies became so closely associated with their funnel colours that their nickname became a de facto company name. For example, the shipping line actually registered as 'Alfred Holt & Company' was more widely known as the Blue Funnel Line. The Southampton, Isle of Wight and South of England Royal Mail Steam Packet Company has traded under the name Red Funnel for most of its 150+ year history. Other colours such as the red with black stripes of the Cunard Line and the all buff colour of P&O remain icons of their respective lines and have remained in use for over a century through many changes of corporate ownership. \n\nParagraph 6: For the following season, he remained in the same series, joining Penistone Racing, partnering Julian Bailey in their Reynard SF84.

The Bible has a precedent for a pattern of morning and evening worship that has given rise to Sunday morning and Sunday evening services of worship held in the churches of many Christian denominations today, a \"structure to help families sanctify the Lord’s Day.\" In  and , \"God commanded the daily offerings in the tabernacle to be made once in the morning and then again at twilight\". In Psalm 92, which is a prayer concerning the observance of the Sabbath, the prophet David writes \"It is good to give thanks to the Lord, to sing praises to your name, O Most High; to declare your steadfast love in the morning, and your faithfulness by night\" (cf.  ). Church father Eusebius of Caesarea thus declared: \"For it is surely no small sign of God’s power that throughout the whole world in the churches of God at the morning rising of the sun and at the evening hours, hymns, praises, and truly divine delights are offered to God. God’s delights are indeed the hymns sent up everywhere on earth in his Church at the times of morning and evening.\"\n\nParagraph 9: By this time the Berlin Wall had fallen, something that could not have been predicted when construction started. It became desirable to re-establish the U-Bahn line that had previously been severed, requiring the removal of the M-Bahn from its right of way. The principal need for the M-Bahn had also been removed, as the area served by it was again easily accessible from the Potsdamer Platz station. Dismantling of the M-Bahn started only two months after its official opening, and was completed during February 1992. The U-Bahn connection between Gleisdreieck and Potsdamer Platz Stations was reinstated, becoming part of line U2.\n\nParagraph 10: When the old, legendary video game Prime Empire resurfaces, players begin to disappear into the game, including Jay (who loves playing video games). The ninja discover that the game's creator, Milton Dyer, has also disappeared and nobody has seen him for years. With the suspicion that Dyer is a villain named Unagami, Lloyd, Cole, Kai and Nya enter the virtual world of Prime Empire to stop Dyer's avatar, while Zane and P.I.X.A.L. remain outside to find Dyer in the real world. They meet \"The League of Jay\", a group of Jay fans who lead them to a player named Scott. He explains that players only get four lives in the game and after losing their last life, they are turned into digital cubes and disappear. Inside one of the game zones, a Samurai named Okino faces a crisis of faith when he repeatedly fails to lead a series of Masters to victory, causing him to lose all hope - until some familiar ninja arrive. In order to stop Unagami, the ninja must obtain three Key-tanas, the first of which is hidden in the game zone Terra Karana - one of Prime Empire's most dangerous game environments.  While being chased by Unagami's dreaded Red Visors the ninja must climb the 'Cliffs of Hysteria', however, they make a startling discovery: Unagami is converting players into energy cubes in order to build a portal into the real world!  Once reunited with Jay, the ninja travel across three game zones to obtain three Key-Tanas, which unlock the final challenge at the Temple of Madness. On the journey, they are hunted by Unagami's digital troops, the Red Visors. In the first game zone, Terra Karana, the ninja meet a non-player character (NPC) called Okino, who helps them through many deadly challenges. In the boss battle, the ninja win the fight against the Red Dragon to obtain the purple Key-Tana. The ninja learn that the only way to acquire the 2nd Key-tana is by winning a race in Terra Technica and have to find racing cars in unexpected ways.  The yellow Key-Tana is obtained by winning the Speedway Five-Billion, a dangerous race in the second game zone, Terra Technica. Lloyd recruits Racer Seven, another NPC, but she is followed by the Red Visors. Scott sacrifices himself to help the ninja escape and is transformed into a digital cube. The ninja manage to win the Speedway Five-Billion, but Kai and Cole are both cubed during the race. Lloyd, Jay and Nya continue their journey to obtain the final Key-tana in the third game zone, Terra Domina. There Lloyd is forced to battle an avatar of Harumi. He defeats her and obtains the orange Key-Tana, but is cubed in the process.\n\nParagraph 11: Merchant shipping companies (and particularly liner companies such as Cunard Line and ferries such as Red Funnel) were quick to recognise the publicity value of distinctive funnels, both in terms of shape, number of funnels, and the colours they were painted.

{"input": "", "context": "Paragraph 1: The term \"adaptive\" was first used by Robert Good in reference to antibody responses in frogs as a synonym for \"acquired immune response\" in 1964. Good acknowledged he used the terms as synonyms but explained only that he preferred to use the term \"adaptive\".  He might have been thinking of the then not implausible theory of antibody formation in which antibodies were plastic and could adapt themselves to the molecular shape of antigens, and/or to the concept of \"adaptive enzymes\" as described by Monod in bacteria, that is, enzymes whose expression could be induced by their substrates.  The phrase was used almost exclusively by Good and his students and a few other immunologists working with marginal organisms until the 1990s when it became widely used in tandem with the term \"innate immunity\" which became a popular subject after the discovery of the Toll receptor system in Drosophila, a previously marginal organism for the study of immunology.  The term \"adaptive\" as used in immunology is problematic as acquired immune responses can be both adaptive and maladaptive in the physiological sense. Indeed, both acquired and innate immune responses can be both adaptive and maladaptive in the evolutionary sense.  Most textbooks today, following the early use by Janeway, use \"adaptive\" almost exclusively and noting in glossaries that the term is synonymous with \"acquired\".\n\nParagraph 2: The suburb was known as \"Flogstoghum\" in the Early Middle Ages and was a part of the Church parish of Uppsala. However, it was generally thought to be uninhabited until the late 16th century, when it became part of a 'Kronopark' or \"Crown Lands\", a semi-forested area owned directly by the Government and used for Government purposes. Until the 1840s, Flogsta was a small village and was not included within the City Limits of Uppsala. Indeed, until 1869, the city boundary of Uppsala to the West ended at Krongatan, a couple of miles to the west of the Castle, to Ekeby in 1898 and to Flogsta in 1912. Large scale habitation and concrete building started only in the 1910s as accommodation for workers in various industries in Central Uppsala, and until the 1920s there were no municipal services in Flogsta. In the 1920s, the first suburban houses came up in Flogsta as residences of white collar workers who worked in the City but wished to live close to the countryside. In the 1950s much of the suburb was earmarked for the Million Programme as student housing, and hence the suburb got its present characteristic as a densely populated \"concrete block\" student suburb only by the end of the 1960s.\n\nParagraph 3: Peter Travers in Rolling Stone wrote: \"there hasn't been a sharper, sassier, more touching romantic comedy this year... there's no denying Marshall's expert timing. This is the director's best work yet... In its celebration of cautious optimism, Frankie and Johnny becomes the perfect love story for these troubled times.\" Janet Maslin in The New York Times wrote: \"in the skillfully manipulative hands of Garry Marshall, who has directed from a screenplay by Mr. McNally that amounts to a complete revision, Frankie and Johnny has been reshaped into foolproof schmaltz. 'Foolproof' is the operative word... But somehow Mr. Marshall, Mr. McNally and their superb leading actors are able to retain the intimacy of their material. They also retain the story's fundamental wariness about romance, even when everything about Ms. Pfeiffer and Mr. Pacino has the audience wondering why they don't simply fall into each other's arms.\" Rita Kempley in The Washington Post wrote: \"In its odyssey from stage to screen, Frankie & Johnny has undergone a sunny metamorphosis from ugly ducklings' romance to candy-coated, blue-collar valentine.\" Time Out summed it up thus: \"Pacino wears a vest and bandanna and moons through the part. Pfeiffer plays dowdy. Marshall directs as if Marty had never happened.\"\n\nParagraph 4: On November 18, 2006, Ohio State and Michigan met for their annual showdown, each carrying an 11–0 record. For the first time in the history of the rivalry, the two rivals faced off while holding the top two spots in the Bowl Championship Series rankings. Ohio State won the game by a score of 42–39 and became the outright Big Ten champion, earning the right to play for a national championship at the BCS National Championship Game in Glendale, Arizona. Michigan struck first with a touchdown run by junior running back Mike Hart, but the Buckeyes then scored 21 unanswered points, and at halftime, they were up 28–14. Thanks to an interception and a fumble recovery by junior defensive tackle Alan Branch, Michigan made it 35–31 Ohio State with 14 minutes to go in the fourth quarter. But after appearing to have forced Ohio State into a fourth-down situation with six minutes to go, junior outside linebacker Shawn Crable was called for roughing the passer, giving the Buckeyes a fresh set of downs. Ohio State quarterback Troy Smith then passed to Brian Robiskie for a touchdown, increasing the Buckeyes' lead to 42–31 with five minutes remaining in the game. After Ohio State was called for pass interference on a failed fourth-down attempt, giving Michigan an automatic first down, junior quarterback Chad Henne found senior tight end Tyler Ecker for a 16-yard touchdown with two minutes to go to cut the OSU lead to 42–37. Senior wide receiver Steve Breaston caught the two-point conversion to bring the Wolverines within a field goal. Michigan needed to recover the ensuing onside kick, but they failed to do so. The Buckeyes ran out the clock for the victory, and a trip to the BCS national championship game. Troy Smith completed 71% of his passes for 316 yards and four touchdowns, essentially clinching the Heisman trophy. Ginn caught eight passes for 104 yards and a touchdown. Ohio State running back Antonio Pittman ran for 139 yards on 18 carries for a 7.7 yards-per-carry average. Michigan running back Mike Hart carried the ball 23 times for 142 yards and three touchdowns against a stout Buckeye defense. Chad Henne had 267 yards, two touchdowns, and no turnovers on a 60% completion percentage. Neither performance was, however, sufficient to turn the tide in favor of the Wolverines. The game was highly touted by ESPN/ABC (there was a game countdown clock for a week before kickoff) and was viewed by the largest television audience for a regular-season college football game since 1993, averaging 21.8 million viewers. The victory marked the first time in 43 years that the Buckeyes had won three consecutive games in the series. The game gained even more significance when, on the eve of the meeting, Michigan head coach and former Ohio State assistant coach Bo Schembechler died. Schembechler was honored with a video tribute at Ohio Stadium as well as a moment of silence before kickoff.\n\nParagraph 5: Peter Travers in Rolling Stone wrote: \"there hasn't been a sharper, sassier, more touching romantic comedy this year... there's no denying Marshall's expert timing. This is the director's best work yet... In its celebration of cautious optimism, Frankie and Johnny becomes the perfect love story for these troubled times.\" Janet Maslin in The New York Times wrote: \"in the skillfully manipulative hands of Garry Marshall, who has directed from a screenplay by Mr. McNally that amounts to a complete revision, Frankie and Johnny has been reshaped into foolproof schmaltz. 'Foolproof' is the operative word... But somehow Mr. Marshall, Mr. McNally and their superb leading actors are able to retain the intimacy of their material. They also retain the story's fundamental wariness about romance, even when everything about Ms. Pfeiffer and Mr. Pacino has the audience wondering why they don't simply fall into each other's arms.\" Rita Kempley in The Washington Post wrote: \"In its odyssey from stage to screen, Frankie & Johnny has undergone a sunny metamorphosis from ugly ducklings' romance to candy-coated, blue-collar valentine.\" Time Out summed it up thus: \"Pacino wears a vest and bandanna and moons through the part. Pfeiffer plays dowdy. Marshall directs as if Marty had never happened.\"\n\nParagraph 6: The term \"adaptive\" was first used by Robert Good in reference to antibody responses in frogs as a synonym for \"acquired immune response\" in 1964. Good acknowledged he used the terms as synonyms but explained only that he preferred to use the term \"adaptive\".  He might have been thinking of the then not implausible theory of antibody formation in which antibodies were plastic and could adapt themselves to the molecular shape of antigens, and/or to the concept of \"adaptive enzymes\" as described by Monod in bacteria, that is, enzymes whose expression could be induced by their substrates.  The phrase was used almost exclusively by Good and his students and a few other immunologists working with marginal organisms until the 1990s when it became widely used in tandem with the term \"innate immunity\" which became a popular subject after the discovery of the Toll receptor system in Drosophila, a previously marginal organism for the study of immunology.  The term \"adaptive\" as used in immunology is problematic as acquired immune responses can be both adaptive and maladaptive in the physiological sense. Indeed, both acquired and innate immune responses can be both adaptive and maladaptive in the evolutionary sense.  Most textbooks today, following the early use by Janeway, use \"adaptive\" almost exclusively and noting in glossaries that the term is synonymous with \"acquired\".\n\nParagraph 7: Lotso, Big Baby, and Chuckles once belonged to a little girl named Daisy, whom Lotso adored. When Daisy fell asleep and accidentally left them at a rest stop, Lotso led the toys on a long journey home, only to find that Daisy's parents had replaced him with a duplicate. Embittered beyond the point of sanity, Lotso lied to Big Baby that Daisy had replaced all of them, intimidated Chuckles (who knew the truth) into silence, and forced them both to come with him to Sunnyside. There, he established a totalitarian rule, forbidding any toys from leaving or escaping back to their owners and ensuring that the only way out is through the trash, which he believes is where all toys are destined. When Woody reveals Lotso's true character, all of Lotso's henchmen turn on him and Big Baby throws Lotso in the dumpster. Lotso, seeking revenge, pulls Woody into the dumpster, resulting in Andy's toys jumping in to save him just as the garbage truck arrives. All of them end up at the dump on a conveyor belt leading to an incinerator. Lotso, getting free with Woody and Buzz's help, reaches an emergency stop button, but decides at the last minute to abandon the others to be burned so that they can't return to Andy, as his beliefs remain unchanged. Unbeknownst to Lotso; however, his efforts are in vain as Andy's toys are saved by the Aliens using a giant claw. Hamm and Slinky wish to avenge themselves on Lotso for his betrayal, but Woody convinces them he isn't worth it, knowing that the dump is where he belongs. Lotso, meanwhile, attempts to escape the dump, but a garbage man (who had owned a Lots-O'-Huggin' Bear during his childhood) finds Lotso and straps him to the grill of his truck as a decoration.\n\nParagraph 8: University architect John Galen Howard designed the building with the assistance of the Dean of the College of Mines, Professor Samuel B. Christy and Berkeley-educated architect Julia Morgan. The architects set out to create a building that harmonized classical elements with architectural innovation, building off prior examples of European and American mining building architecture, and staying true to the Beaux-Arts style that defined Howard's vision for the Hearst campus plan. In order to help them realize this vision, Hearst funded a trip for Howard and Christy to visit mining schools throughout the United States and Europe so that they could study standardized architectural forms for mining schools, as libraries and hospitals had realized in their own architectural evolution. Howard and Christy did not find many examples of mining colleges—the majority of the buildings they visited were originally built for other purposes. Howard feared that the scant number examples to study would make his design prone to the mistakes of an architectural form early in its evolution. This problem is what inspired Howard to create an \"elastic\" design—the building's exterior shell would be built separate from the interior, so that the interior could be modified in the future without having to scrap the shell or compromise the building's strength. Vents and chimneys were also built independent of the shell, as these architectural features were expected to have shorter lifespans than the exterior structure. California Hall, another Howard-designed building on the Berkeley campus was also constructed with an \"elastic\" interior form.\n\nParagraph 9: The illumination consists of miniatures introducing each of the books of the Bible and set into one or two of the text columns.  The miniature for the Book of Genesis which may have been the most sumptuous miniature is missing. Although most of the miniatures are full length author portraits,  some depict scenes from the following book. For example, the miniature before the Book of Job depicts Job on the dung heap.  This miniature combine several scenes from the Book of Job.  Job is pictured lying naked on the dung heap, covered with sores.  Below him his wife is talking to him.  To the left are his three friends.  One of them is seen rending his garments, while the other two are seated, and talking to him.  The Book of Exodus also has a narrative miniature before it.  It depicts Moses and Aaron requesting permission to depart from Pharaoh.  It is hard to understand why this scene, rather than one of the many more popular scenes was chosen to be the sole illustration for Exodus. Other miniatures are allegorical groups. The miniature before the Book of Proverbs shows the Virgin and Child,  flanked by Solomon, representing the wisdom of the Old Testament, and Ecclesia, a personification of the Christian Church. Only one New Testament miniature survives, that of James the Apostle. The miniatures show mixture of Hellenistic heritage and a native Syriac tradition.  Some of the miniatures, especially the miniature before Exodus, show stylistic similarities to the miniatures in the Rabula Gospels. Based on this it is unlikely that this manuscript was made much later than were the Rabula Gospels of 586.\n\nParagraph 10: Peter Travers in Rolling Stone wrote: \"there hasn't been a sharper, sassier, more touching romantic comedy this year... there's no denying Marshall's expert timing.

{"input": "", "context": "Paragraph 1: The Il-38 is an adaptation of the four-engined turboprop Ilyushin Il-18 for use as a maritime patrol aircraft for the Soviet Navy. It met a requirement to counter American ballistic missile submarines. The Communist Party Central Committee and the Council of Ministers issued a joint directive on 18 June 1960, calling for a prototype to be ready for trials by the second quarter of 1962. The fuselage, wing, tail unit and engine nacelles were the same as the Il-18 and it had the same powerplant and flight deck. An aerodynamic prototype of the Il-38 first flew on 28 September 1961, with the first production aircraft following in September 1967. Production continued until 1972, when the longer-range and more versatile Tupolev Tu-142 derivative of the Tupolev Tu-95 strategic bomber had entered service.\n\nParagraph 2: The election coincided with the presidential campaign of George Wallace of the American Independent Party, who unsuccessfully attempted to deny a majority in the Electoral College to any of his opponents.  Had Wallace succeeded he would have given the House the choice of president from among the three, for the first time since 1825. As a result of this election, Democrats formed a majority of 26 state House delegations, with Republicans forming a majority in 19 and the other five delegations being evenly split (each state's House delegation receives one vote in such an election).  However, the Democrats' nominal majority of state delegations includes those of the Southern states who were more inclined to support Wallace as opposed to Democratic candidate Hubert Humphrey.

They also advanced through the second and third round, winning 4–1 on aggregate over Belarusian club Dynamo Brest and Belgian club Gent, respectively. In the play-off round, they narrowly failed to beat Israeli club Maccabi Tel Aviv with an overall score of 3–2. The 2017–18 season got off to a moderate start under new coach Klaus Schmidt. After a total of 31 total competitive matches in the autumn, they finished 2017 in seventh place. They eventually finished the season in eighth place, and Schmidt was dismissed at the end of the season. His successor for the 2018–19 season was Werner Grabherr, who had already managed the club twice as a caretaker. He struggled as full-time coach, however, and in March 2019 he was fired with the club bottom of the league table. After two weeks with Wolfgang Luisser as interim coach, former Rheindorf Altach player Alex Pastoor took over at the end of the month. Under the Dutchman, the Vorarlberg side stabilised again and finally managed to stay in the league at the end of the season, eight points ahead of relegated Wacker Innsbruck. In the 2019–20 season, they were in mid-table for the entire season and finished the season in eighth place, which meant they were eligible to play-offs for European football, although they were eliminated in the first round by Austria Wien. In the 2020–21 season, they were again in a relegation battle throughout the season, and in February 2021, Pastoor was released with Altach bottom of the league table. Altach coaching legend Damir Canadi took over the club for a second time. Under his guidance, the team managed to stay in the league, ten points ahead of relegated SKN St. Pölten. At the beginning of the 2021–22 season, however, Altach would also struggle under Canadi, and during the winter break he was released from his position. Altach's failure this time was mainly due to a poor goal tally. At the winter break, they had only scored ten goals and thus had the worst performing attack in the league, while Admira had the second-worst offence with 21 goals. In addition it came forward in December 2021 that key players Atdhe Nuhiu and Jan Zwischenbrugger had rallied against manager Canadi, initially without his knowledge, and had tried to change the team tactics internally. Former Switzerland international Ludovic Magnin was appointed new head coach on 30 December 2021.\n\nParagraph 5: The title of the largest member of this order, the most numerous order of all vertebrates, is a matter of some debate.

However Cerezo finished at the bottom place in 2001 season and was relegated to J2 League. In 2002 season, he scored 18 goals which was the second top scorer and Cerezo reached the second place and was returned to J1 in a year. From 2003, he scored more than 15 goals in J1. He was also selected Asian Young Footballer of the Year award in 2003.\n\nParagraph 7: Less than a year later, the center of the project had shifted to the Los Alamos National Laboratory. Manley received a personal call from Leo Szilard to move from the Metallurgical Laboratory to Los Alamos and on April 4, 1943, Manley arrived at the laboratory. Manley spent his first days in Los Alamos working with other newcomers on the construction of laboratory buildings. He also installed a Cockcroft–Walton generator, which he had brought with him from Urbana. Throughout the war Manley served as one of Oppenheimer's principal aides, with particular responsibility for laboratory management. His wife Kay moved to Los Alamos in June 1943, following the birth of their second daughter. She was hired as a human computer in the T (Theoretical) Division but then quit after six months to focus on raising their children.\n\nParagraph 8: The election coincided with the presidential campaign of George Wallace of the American Independent Party, who unsuccessfully attempted to deny a majority in the Electoral College to any of his opponents.

Samantha next featured in S. S. Rajamouli's live action Telugu-Tamil bilingual project Eega (2012) alongside Nani and Sudeep, portraying a micro artist who runs a NGO and takes revenge for the murder of her lover. As the film featured a CGI-created housefly as the main character, Samantha noted that she had to use her imagination and act accordingly. She also revealed that many heavy lights were used for the shoot of the film and she subsequently suffered skin burns, calling the process \"very stressful\" but \"satisfying\". Titled Naan Ee (2012) in Tamil, the film opened to highly positive reviews and Samantha also won high critical acclaim for her performance. A critic from The Hindu noted \"Samantha blooms in the role given to her,\" while Jeevi of Idlebrain.com wrote her \"successful run continues as she protrays the role a bereaved lover with perfection\".

The post-disco \"I Don't Need a Man\" sharing the same \"quasi-feminism\" themes with \"Beep\", sees the group expressing disinterest in co-dependency towards a male partner. \"How Many Times, How Many Lies\" is a downtempo ballad which sees Scherzinger lamenting. The seventh track, \"Hot Stuff (I Want You Back)\", contains elements of \"Hot Stuff\" performed by Donna Summer. The song is a \"throwback mock disco\" with elements of electropop. \"Bite the Dust\" uses \"dramatic strings\" and was compared to the works of Destiny’s Child. \"Right Now\", a big band song gives the impression of Broadway musical to the listener. The track incorporates accentuated horns and congas that pay homage to Shirley Bassey. Similarly like  British duo Soft Cell, the group recorded a mashup between Gloria Jones' \"Tainted Love\" (1965) and The Supremes' \"Where Did Our Love Go\" (1964).

Donald is seen climbing up a vertical side of the mountain with plungers on his feet, yodeling as he goes. He sees the nest, and quickly reaches the top, ready to take an egg from a condor. One condor hatchling has already hatched and starts squawking at Donald’s arrival, but Donald just tells the hatchling to shut up and shoves him back into his egg shell. When he spots Mother Condor flying overhead, Donald hides the other egg and hides in the other hatching’s shell, kicking the baby condor out. The mother lands and decides to sit on the egg in which Donald is hiding. The warmth she provides is almost too much for Donald, and he sweats profusely. The egg suddenly starts to crack, and he is nearly crushed by the condor. Thinking quickly, Donald decides to pretend he’s a condor. The mother is convinced, and gives Donald a hug, much to the surprise of the other hatchling. Mother Condor then sends her hatchlings off to learn how to fly. The hatchling pushes Donald off the tree branch, but he manages to hold on when his clothes catch a branch nearby, although he is not so lucky when a passing storm cloud starts to shower all over him. Mother Condor tries to teach Donald to fly, but Donald looks down and gets dizzy. He tries to slip away, but is spotted and brought back. Donald manages to convince her that he has a bum wing, and she starts cradling him. The hatchling gets jealous, and starts squawking for attention. Having had enough, he sends Donald flying into the air and he lands on a branch nearby. Trying to get out of his situation once and for all, Donald rigs up a decoy using branches and leaves, and sends it hurtling to the river below. Although Mother Condor tries to save her “hatchling,” she believes it to be too late when it falls into the river, and she starts sobbing on the nearby bank. Donald then takes the other condor egg, thinking himself victorious, but the other hatchling steals it from him. Donald takes it back, but falls down into the river, holding the egg protectively. Relieved to see him still alive, Mother Condor gathers Donald and the egg into her arms and coddles them. That night, egg, Donald, hatchling, and Mother Condor are nestled together, while Donald mutters angrily under his breath.\n\nParagraph 6: Despite having previously shown little inclination toward politics, Brown surprised political observers by declaring his candidacy for governor in the 1979 election.

{"input": "", "context": "Paragraph 1: Springsteen's recordings have tended to alternate between commercially accessible rock albums and somber folk-oriented works.  His most commercially successful period occurred between 1975's Born to Run and 1987's Tunnel of Love. 1984's Born in the U.S.A. launched Springsteen into superstardom and the album went on to become one of the biggest selling albums of all time. It produced seven top-10 hit singles, tied for the most ever with Michael Jackson's Thriller and Janet Jackson's Rhythm Nation 1814. Springsteen has steadily maintained a loyal audience since his 80s success and experienced a renewed commercial strength since 2002's The Rising, the first in a string of consecutive successful albums following a 1999 reunion with the E Street Band with whom he parted ways in 1989. 2014's High Hopes was Springsteen's eleventh No. 1 album placing him at third all-time for most No. 1 albums ever trailing only Jay-Z (13) and the Beatles (19). He achieved his eleventh No. 1 album in the UK with his next release, 2019's Western Stars, which saw him join Elvis Presley and Robbie Williams on eleven UK No. 1s, trailing only Madonna (12) and the Beatles (15). In October 2019, Springsteen released a theatrical film for Western Stars which marked his directorial debut. The film was accompanied by the Western Stars – Songs from the Film soundtrack. Springsteen's twenty-first and latest album, Only the Strong Survive, was released in 2022. \n\nParagraph 2: Anil Anto and his wife Amala shift from Kottarakara and settle down with the help of his friends in Kochi. They rent a small apartment and slowly settle down to their lives. Anil works for a cable TV company as a technician. \"Gorilla\" Darwin is a well known gangster, who, along with his brothers, rules the Kochi underworld. Meanwhile, Amala is pregnant, and she and her husband are very happy. During a drive by, Darvin's brother steals Amala's chain and pushes her down, causing a miscarriage. Their lives turn due to this incident. They complain to the police, but to no avail. During an installation, Anil sees the person who caused this problem. He chases them and gets into a fight. He brutally beats him up and takes him to the police. The police inspector is a cousin of Darvin and abuses Anil for beating up a culprit. He then calls up Darvin to come to pick up his brother. Darvin picks his brother from the police station and insults Anil by giving some money for Anil to get his wife a new chain. Anil slaps Darvin, which causes a scene. Darvin retreats back. Anil then faces Darvin's wrath. Darvin and the gang slowly steal every belonging from Anil and leave them with just an empty apartment. Anil loses all his possessions. A friendly policeman then explains that this is Darvin's style of reacting and he cannot do anything about it. After all this, Anil takes help from a small-time gangster to try to kidnap Darvin's child and fails spectacularly in a comedic fashion. They decide to kidnap Darvin's younger brother Gilli, who is a film buff. They make a ransom call to Darvin, only to be rebutted. While browsing through the photos on Gilli's phone, Anil finds the photo of a golden statue belonging to the church in their area. He realises that Darvin in the pretext of repairing the church has switched the golden one for a duplicate statue and holds the golden one in his chicken farm. Anil then steals this statue from the farm and starts negotiating with Darvin, knowing that Darvin has a deal fixed to sell this statue to a foreign customer. He asks Darvin to give him his stuff, not new but the exact items were stolen from him. Beginning a cat-and-mouse game, pushing Darvin's patience. The final item is Anil's bike, which was stolen from him and sold to Darvin's rival. Darvin fights with his rival Solomon to get the bike back. However, as Solomon tries to kill Darvin, Anil intervenes and helps Darvin out. Darvin initially plans to finish Anil for good once he tells him the location of the golden statue; however, he has a change of heart after Anil helps him out.\n\nParagraph 3: The sons of famed Israeli filmmaker Jonathan Paz, Doron and Yoav grew up with hearing the stories of the golem: \"The Golem stories are well known in Israel and we think every kid knows about it in some way or another... We didn’t grow up in an orthodox house, but this story, about a giant monster who saves the Jews from their enemies – it blew our minds.\" After the success of their 2013 film JeruZalem, the Paz Brothers wanted their next project to be based on Jewish culture and legends, \"we thought there’s an appetite for more, so we said we’re Jews in Israel with so much culture and so much mythology around us. Nobody had handled it yet, so we thought this is the path we should go by\". After looking into the various Jewish myths and legends, the brothers decided upon adapting the Jewish legend of the Golem. The Paz Brothers felt that the legend, which they referred to as \"the Jewish Frankenstein\", had never been properly developed into a film since the silent 1920 version The Golem: How He Came into the World. In an interview with PopHorror, the brothers also stated that they were drawn to the elements of Cohen's script which they felt was a very dark, and emotional drama. Originally it was intended to retain the original appearance of the title character for the film, \"In the beginning, when we just started on the idea for the movie, we tried to tell the story as it is. That is with the real giant creature made of mud and clay,\". The idea was soon abandoned, however, after realizing that it would not fit with the story they wanted to convey, deciding instead to reimagine the classic tale for a more contemporary audience while staying true to its original themes. The brothers later explained, \"We like character-driven horror so dealing with just a giant monster wasn’t that appealing for us. That’s how we came up with the idea of dealing with a golem KID.\" Unlike their previous effort JeruZalem, which they felt relied too much on jump scares, the Paz Brothers stated that they wanted the film to be \"a slow burn\", focusing more on building atmosphere, and tension as well as the development of the lead character Hanna. \"[W]e wanted people to be inside Hanna, to show what she’s going through and tell her story – and not to give thrills every few minutes. The film's bigger budget also allowed the filmmakers to focus more on creating the proper tone and scope for the film. As Doron Paz stated in an interview, \"Having a much bigger budget this time allowed us to create the scope needed to re-tell the legend of the Golem.\" With Yoav Paz further adding that the film's producer Shalom Eisenbach and Epic Pictures \"believe in our vision and excited to get it in front [of an] audience\".\n\nParagraph 4: Springsteen's recordings have tended to alternate between commercially accessible rock albums and somber folk-oriented works.

Saul took him that day and did not let him return to his father's house. Then Jonathan made a covenant with David because he loved him as himself. Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was on him and gave it to David, with his armor, including his sword and his bow and his belt. So David went out wherever Saul sent him, and prospered; and Saul set him over the men of war.

Sterling, partner in the New York law firm Shearman & Sterling and an 1864 graduate of Yale College. In addition to financing the university’s largest construction projects throughout the 1920s, including the Sterling Memorial Library and flagship facilities for many of its professional schools, Sterling stipulated the bequest would allow ”to some extent, the foundation of Scholarships, Fellowships or Lectureships, the endowment of new professorships and the establishment of special funds for prizes.” Sterling’s trustees eventually left the university more than $5 million for this purpose—about $225,000 per chair.\n\nParagraph 8: Now it came about when he had finished speaking to Saul, that the soul of Jonathan was knit to the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as himself. Saul took him that day and did not let him return to his father's house. Then Jonathan made a covenant with David because he loved him as himself. Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was on him and gave it to David, with his armor, including his sword and his bow and his belt. So David went out wherever Saul sent him, and prospered; and Saul set him over the men of war.

His most commercially successful period occurred between 1975's Born to Run and 1987's Tunnel of Love. 1984's Born in the U.S.A. launched Springsteen into superstardom and the album went on to become one of the biggest selling albums of all time. It produced seven top-10 hit singles, tied for the most ever with Michael Jackson's Thriller and Janet Jackson's Rhythm Nation 1814. Springsteen has steadily maintained a loyal audience since his 80s success and experienced a renewed commercial strength since 2002's The Rising, the first in a string of consecutive successful albums following a 1999 reunion with the E Street Band with whom he parted ways in 1989. 2014's High Hopes was Springsteen's eleventh No. 1 album placing him at third all-time for most No. 1 albums ever trailing only Jay-Z (13) and the Beatles (19). He achieved his eleventh No. 1 album in the UK with his next release, 2019's Western Stars, which saw him join Elvis Presley and Robbie Williams on eleven UK No. 1s, trailing only Madonna (12) and the Beatles (15). In October 2019, Springsteen released a theatrical film for Western Stars which marked his directorial debut. The film was accompanied by the Western Stars – Songs from the Film soundtrack. Springsteen's twenty-first and latest album, Only the Strong Survive, was released in 2022. \n\nParagraph 11: The sons of famed Israeli filmmaker Jonathan Paz, Doron and Yoav grew up with hearing the stories of the golem: \"The Golem stories are well known in Israel and we think every kid knows about it in some way or another... We didn’t grow up in an orthodox house, but this story, about a giant monster who saves the Jews from their enemies – it blew our minds.\" After the success of their 2013 film JeruZalem, the Paz Brothers wanted their next project to be based on Jewish culture and legends, \"we thought there’s an appetite for more, so we said we’re Jews in Israel with so much culture and so much mythology around us. Nobody had handled it yet, so we thought this is the path we should go by\". After looking into the various Jewish myths and legends, the brothers decided upon adapting the Jewish legend of the Golem. The Paz Brothers felt that the legend, which they referred to as \"the Jewish Frankenstein\", had never been properly developed into a film since the silent 1920 version The Golem: How He Came into the World. In an interview with PopHorror, the brothers also stated that they were drawn to the elements of Cohen's script which they felt was a very dark, and emotional drama. Originally it was intended to retain the original appearance of the title character for the film, \"In the beginning, when we just started on the idea for the movie, we tried to tell the story as it is. That is with the real giant creature made of mud and clay,\". The idea was soon abandoned, however, after realizing that it would not fit with the story they wanted to convey, deciding instead to reimagine the classic tale for a more contemporary audience while staying true to its original themes. The brothers later explained, \"We like character-driven horror so dealing with just a giant monster wasn’t that appealing for us. That’s how we came up with the idea of dealing with a golem KID.\" Unlike their previous effort JeruZalem, which they felt relied too much on jump scares, the Paz Brothers stated that they wanted the film to be \"a slow burn\", focusing more on building atmosphere, and tension as well as the development of the lead character Hanna. \"[W]e wanted people to be inside Hanna, to show what she’s going through and tell her story – and not to give thrills every few minutes. The film's bigger budget also allowed the filmmakers to focus more on creating the proper tone and scope for the film. As Doron Paz stated in an interview, \"Having a much bigger budget this time allowed us to create the scope needed to re-tell the legend of the Golem.\" With Yoav Paz further adding that the film's producer Shalom Eisenbach and Epic Pictures \"believe in our vision and excited to get it in front [of an] audience\".\n\nParagraph 12: The professorships are named for and funded by a $15-million bequest left by John W.

The action takes place mostly in the village called Pripas, but also in the little town going by the name of Armadia. Ion Pop al Glanetașului, industrious son of poor parents, is consumed by his life-long passion for land owning. Despite being in love with Florica, the beautiful girl of a poor widow, he sets his eyes on Ana, the plain looking daughter of rich land owner - Vasile Baciu. The rich man, however, does not want him as his son-in-law, realising that he does not, in fact, love his only daughter, but only aims to take the easy path and marry into wealth. One night, while Vasile is drunk and asleep, Ion pays Ana a secret visit and sleeps with her in spite of her pleading with him not to, therefore dishonoring her. His plan is to thus force her father to give him both the daughter and the fortune. Unaware of this and overwhelmed with the affection Ion showers her with, Ana truly falls in love with the young man, especially after realising she is pregnant with Ion's child. After more conflicts between the two stubborn men, Vasile decides to give Ion the hand of his daughter in marriage and part of the lands he owns. Ion finally appears to be satisfied. He kisses and hugs the gained land, feeling as if this is his one true love, but meanwhile grows tired of Ana whom, despite by now being heavily pregnant, he beats up and scolds every day. After the birth of the child - a sickly baby boy - the young girl becomes even more depressed. Ion, now having achieved all that he has ever wished for, realizes he is still in love with Florica. Despite also being married, Florica answers to Ion's wild passion and advances and Ana finally comprehends the cruel reality. Feeling unloved and hopeless, she hangs herself. Soon after, their feeble child dies as well. Thus the quarrel between Ion and his father-in-law begins once again. Ion is unable to hide his happiness at being one of the wealthiest peasants in Pripas and, yet, no longer trapped in a loveless marriage. Thinking that now he can have beautiful Florica to himself, he pays her a visit one night when her husband is not home. The man however returns without the two lovers knowing and, catching them in the act, he kills Ion with three hoe blows to the head. Ion's last thoughts are \"I'm dying like a dog\".\n\nParagraph 6: The son of Daniel and Hannah (née Wynne; daughter of Dr. Thomas Wynne) Humphreys, he served as a delegate for Pennsylvania to the Continental Congress from 1774 to 1776.

Lonely, Gail agrees to go for a drink with truck driver, Les Charlton, (Graham Fellows) but Nicky goes missing and is eventually found in the newly rebuilt number seven. A distressed Gail thinks about giving up her job and loses interest in Les. But Les's last visit coincides with Brian's return and he makes it very clear to Les that he is not welcome. Brian decides not to return to Qatar and admits having \"had a drink\" with a nurse and Gail realizes that his friendship with her was a lot closer than he is admitting. In August 1982, using the money he made in Qatar, Brian opens a garage in partnership with Ron Sykes and for a while, the Tilsleys are happy. In March 1983, things seem to be going so well that Brian takes out a bank loan and buys Ron Sykes's share of the garage. However, there is a change in fortunes – Brian's father, Bert (Peter Dudley), is seriously injured while overinflating a tyre at the garage and dies soon afterwards, and the business starts losing money – forcing Brian to put it up for sale. He is talked out of selling by Gail and Mike Baldwin, deciding to sell the house in Buxton Close instead, and move back in with Ivy. The Tilsleys' marriage now begins to crumble as living under the same roof irritates Ivy and Gail and when in August 1984, Gail is offered the job of manager at Jim's Cafe, she takes it – annoying Brian and Ivy. A couple of months later, there is more friction when Brian finds that Audrey's latest boyfriend, George Hepworth (Richard Moore), made a pass at Gail. By April 1985, Gail has had enough and leaves Brian, moving her and Nicky into a bedsit. This finally makes Brian get a council house so Gail and Nicky move in there with him.\n\nParagraph 9: , is a fictional monster, or kaiju, in Toho Co., Ltd.'s Godzilla media franchise.

This return does not necessarily mean a woman has begun to ovulate again. The first postpartum ovulatory cycle might occur before the first menses following childbirth or during subsequent cycles. A strong relationship has been observed between the amount of suckling and the contraceptive effect, such that the combination of feeding on demand rather than on a schedule and feeding only breast milk rather than supplementing the diet with other foods will greatly extend the period of effective contraception. In fact, it was found that among the Hutterites, more frequent bouts of nursing, in addition to maintenance of feeding in the night hours, led to longer lactational amenorrhea. An additional study that references this phenomenon cross-culturally was completed in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and has similar findings. Mothers who breastfed exclusively longer showed a longer span of lactational amenorrhea, ranging from an average of 5.3 months in mothers who breastfed exclusively for only two months to an average of 9.6 months in mothers who did so for six months. Another factor shown to affect the length of amenorrhea was the mother's age. The older a woman was, the longer period of lactational amenorrhea she demonstrated. The same increase in length was found in multiparous women as opposed to primiparous. With regard to the use of breastfeeding as a form of contraception, most women who do not breastfeed will resume regular menstrual cycling within 1.5 to 2 months following parturition. Furthermore, the closer a woman's behavior is to the Seven Standards (see below) of ecological breastfeeding, the later (on average) her cycles will return. Overall, there are many factors including frequency of nursing, mother's age, parity, and introduction of supplemental foods into the infant's diet among others which can influence return of fecundity following pregnancy and childbirth and thus the contraceptive benefits of lactational amenorrhea are not always reliable but are evident and variable among women. Couples who desire spacing of 18 to 30 months between children can often achieve this through breastfeeding alone, though this is not a foolproof method as return of menses is unpredictable and conception can occur in the weeks preceding the first menses.

It is therefore possible to trace the details of the designer of a given design (by which is meant both original designs in the collections, and actual examples of wallpapers or textiles existing in the wider world) and to establish to which manufacturer it was sold, when and for how much.  The completeness and coherence of this archive material existing alongside the designs, wallpapers and textiles themselves, makes the Silver Studio collection entirely unique.

Mrs d'Herbemont had the idea of putting the color white or white-painted sticks visually impaired and blind transporters in order to draw attention to themselves.\n\nParagraph 10: In 1962, the Kingdom of Burundi regained its independence as a constitutional monarchy in which the mwami held executive power and legislative power was given to the parliament. By late 1963, the Burundian government allowed Congolese revolutionary Gaston Soumialot to recruit thousands of fighters along the Burundian-Congolese border. Soumialot and his troops consequently participated in the Simba rebellion. Ethnic violence between the Hutu majority and the Tutsi minority rose between 1963 and 1965. This culminated in the murder of Prime Minister Pierre Ngendandumwe, a Hutu, in January 1965. The following legislative elections resulted in a Hutu majority in the National Assembly, but mwami Mwambutsa IV decided to appoint Léopold Biha, one of his confidants and a Ganwa, as the Prime Minister, hoping to maintain the monarchy's power. In response, a failed coup d'état was launched against the monarchy by Hutu officers in October 1965; Mwambutsa IV fled the country and refused to return, even as he claimed to still hold supreme power. The failed coup strengthened radical Tutsis. Mwambutsa's son, Ntare V, attempted to solve the crisis by deposing his father in the July 1966 coup d'état, but was himself ousted from power in a November 1966 coup d'état by his Prime Minister, Michel Micombero, who abolished the monarchy.\n\nParagraph 11: Maude was elected Conservative Party Member of Parliament for Ealing South at the 1950 general election. He continued to work in journalism, and was Director of the Conservative Political Centre from 1951 to 1955. In 1958, he resigned his seat to become editor of The Sydney Morning Herald, a post which he held until 1961. He attempted to return to Parliament, at first being beaten by the Labour Party's Guy Barnett by 704 votes in a 1962 by-election at South Dorset, where the Conservative vote was split. He was then elected to represent the constituency of Stratford-on-Avon in a a by-election in 1963, where he remained until retiring in 1983.\n\nParagraph 12: Greek Macedonia incorporates most of the territories of ancient Macedon, a Greek kingdom ruled by the Argeads, whose most celebrated members were Alexander the Great and his father Philip II. Before the expansion of Macedonia under Philip in the 4th centuryBC, the kingdom of the Macedonians covered an area corresponding roughly to the administrative regions of Western and Central Macedonia in modern Greece. The name Macedonia was later applied to a number of widely-differing administrative areas in the Roman and Byzantine empires. With the gradual conquest of south-eastern Europe by the Ottomans in the late 14th century, the name of Macedonia disappeared as an administrative designation for several centuries and was rarely displayed on maps. With the rise of nationalism in the Ottoman Empire, the name Macedonia was revived in the nineteenth century as a geographical term, and for educated Greeks it corresponded to the ancient historical land. The economic ascent of Thessaloniki and of the other urban centres of Macedonia coincided with the cultural and political renaissance of the Greeks. The leader and coordinator of the Greek Revolution in Macedonia was Emmanouel Pappas from Dovista (in Serres), and the revolt spread from Central to Western Macedonia. Letters from the period show Pappas either being addressed or signing himself as \"Leader and Defender of Macedonia\" and is today considered a Greek hero along with the unnamed Macedonians that fought with him. The fall and massacre of Naoussa marked the end of the Greek Revolution in Macedonia, and the region remained in the Ottoman empire. In the early 20th century the region was already a national cause, contested among the states of Greece, Bulgaria and Serbia. After the Macedonian Struggle and the Balkan Wars (in 1912 and 1913), the modern Greek region of Macedonia became part of the modern Greek state in 1912–13, in the aftermath of the Balkan Wars and the Treaty of Bucharest (1913). It continued as an administrative division of Greece until the reform of 1987, when it was split into the second-level administrative divisions of Western Macedonia and Central Macedonia; while the eastern part, into the Drama-Kavala-Xanthi Super-prefecture until 2010, and part of the Eastern Macedonia and Thrace division after 2010. The region is further divided between the third-level administrative divisions of the Decentralized Administration of Macedonia and Thrace, and the Decentralized Administration of Epirus and Western Macedonia. It also includes the autonomous monastic community of Mount Athos, which is under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (through the civil administrator of Mount Athos) in its political aspect, and of the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople in its religious aspect.\n\nParagraph 13: As American forces continued to approach Luzon, the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters ordered that all able-bodied POWs be transported to Japan. From the Cabanatuan camp, over 1,600 soldiers were removed in October 1944, leaving over 500 sick, weak, or disabled POWs. On January 6, 1945, all of the guards withdrew from the Cabanatuan camp, leaving the POWs alone. The guards had previously told prisoner leaders that they should not attempt to escape, or else they would be killed. When the guards left, the prisoners heeded the threat, fearing that the Japanese were waiting near the camp and would use the attempted escape as an excuse to execute them all. Instead, the prisoners went to the guards' side of the camp and ransacked the Japanese buildings for supplies and large amounts of food. Prisoners were alone for a couple of weeks, except when retreating Japanese forces would periodically stay in the camp. The soldiers mainly ignored the POWs, except to ask for food. Although aware of the potential consequences, the prisoners sent a small group outside the prison's gates to bring in two carabaos to slaughter. The meat from the animals, along with the food secured from the Japanese side of the camp, helped many of the POWs to regain their strength, weight, and stamina. In mid-January, a large group of Japanese troops entered the camp and returned the prisoners to their side of the camp. The prisoners, fueled by rumors, speculated that they would soon be executed by the Japanese.\n\nParagraph 14: Greek Macedonia incorporates most of the territories of ancient Macedon, a Greek kingdom ruled by the Argeads, whose most celebrated members were Alexander the Great and his father Philip II.

Guilly was the daughter of a Belgian and a Frenchman. She was born in Brussels as a child, she lived alternately in Brussels and Paris. she later moved to Paris as a musician and writer. It occurred to her that blind people on the streets of Paris were increasingly endangered by the motorization of transport. The police in France used white signal sticks to regulate traffic and stop cars. Mrs d'Herbemont had the idea of putting the color white or white-painted sticks visually impaired and blind transporters in order to draw attention to themselves.\n\nParagraph 16: US 202 splits into a one-way pair utilizing two-way roads, with the northbound direction turning east to follow four-lane divided East Dekalb Pike while southbound US 202 follows the four-lane divided Bridgeport Bypass; this intersection has a jughandle from southbound US 202 to northbound US 202. Northbound US 202 heads northeast into the borough of Bridgeport and becomes two-lane undivided Dekalb Street, passing over SEPTA's Norristown High Speed Line north of the DeKalb Street station before heading past residences and a few businesses. The northbound direction crosses an abandoned railroad line before it intersects PA 23 and widens to four lanes, coming to a bridge over Norfolk Southern's Harrisburg Line and running past more development to the Schuylkill River. Southbound US 202 heads south along the four-lane divided highway from the Schuylkill River into Upper Merion Township through wooded areas with nearby commercial development, passing over the Harrisburg Line before coming to a southbound exit to PA 23 and a northbound entrance from Ross Road, with this interchange utilizing a portion of the incomplete Schuylkill Parkway freeway stub. At the PA 23 interchange, the road crosses into Bridgeport. Past this, southbound US 202 crosses over the under-construction Chester Valley Trail and re-enters Upper Merion Township as it passes under Boro Line Road. Both directions of US 202 cross the Schuylkill River into the borough of Norristown. Northbound US 202 crosses the river on the Dekalb Veterans Memorial Bridge before it passes under SEPTA's Manayunk/Norristown Line and the Schuylkill River Trail east of SEPTA's Norristown Transportation Center serving the Manayunk/Norristown Line and the terminus of the Norristown High Speed Line. Southbound US 202 crosses under the Schuylkill River Trail before it heads onto the William F. Dannehower Memorial Bridge. The route passes over Washington Street and the Manayunk/Norristown Line before heading over the Schuylkill River. The route enters West Norriton Township and passes over Norfolk Southern's Norristown Line and wooded Barbadoes Island before heading over more of the river and into Upper Merion Township. From here, northbound US 202 crosses Lafayette Street and becomes one-way with two lanes of traffic on Dekalb Street, passing businesses in the downtown area of Norristown, where it crosses Main Street and Airy Street. Southbound US 202 heads southwest into commercial areas in downtown Norristown along Markley Street, a three-lane road with a center-left turn lane, running to the east of the terminus of the Manayunk/Norristown Line at the Elm Street station at Elm Street. At this point, the road begins to parallel the Manayunk/Norristown Line, widening to a four-lane divided highway between Elm and Marshall streets. Southbound US 202 crosses under Airy Street and passes to the east of the Main Street station along the Manayunk/Norristown Line at Main Street. Past downtown Norristown, US 202 continues northeast through urban residential areas with some businesses, following Dekalb Street northbound, which is one-way with two lanes of traffic, and Markley Street southbound, which is three lanes wide with a center turn lane. At the northern border of Norristown, southbound US 202 rejoins northbound US 202 at Dekalb Street; southbound US 202 splits from Dekalb Street by following Johnson Highway, a three-lane road with a center left-turn lane, northwest between Dekalb Street and Markley Street along the border between Norristown to the southwest and East Norriton Township to the northeast.\n\nParagraph 17: Born as the first daughter into a family of three boys, Sophia Smith soon became the caretaker for the following three children (all girls). A resident of Hatfield, Massachusetts, the 1800 census states that the town had 153 homes, 11 of which were owned by her relatives both on her father's (Smith) side and her mother's (White) side. After the death of her mother, the care of the household became the sole responsibility of her sister Harriet. After Harriet's death, she relied on her eldest brother Austin who managed to acquire a sizable fortune; following his death in 1861 the fortune that would soon found Smith College accrued to Sophia Smith.\n\nParagraph 18: The archive material consists of business records, wage books, photograph albums, correspondence, letters, diaries, visual reference material, trade cards, and other printed ephemera.  The Silver Studio was pioneering in that it employed the services of a photographer to record every design.  Designs were numbered and cross referenced to photograph albums and day books, the majority of which survive.  It is therefore possible to trace the details of the designer of a given design (by which is meant both original designs in the collections, and actual examples of wallpapers or textiles existing in the wider world) and to establish to which manufacturer it was sold, when and for how much.  The completeness and coherence of this archive material existing alongside the designs, wallpapers and textiles themselves, makes the Silver Studio collection entirely unique.  Rarely do other collections document the whole process of creating and selling a design, as is possible here.", "answers": ["15"], "length": 3977, "dataset": "passage_count_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "4a4f5b1c8cb47aa585ea5335ded68388760a56212e31b943"}
{"input": "", "context": "Paragraph 1: On 27 February Alviano reached Belluno, where he consulted with Corner and together they decided to launch an offensive aimed at recovering Cadore. The invasion of that province represented a great threat to the Serenissima, as if the Germans had attacked in Friuli, the Venetians would have been forced to move part of the troops stationed in the Vicenza and Treviso areas, further weakening the defenses and risking the loss of the Belluno and Feltre areas and eventually the invasion of the Treviso plain, which would have resulted in the encirclement of Friuli. From Belluno Alviano set out with an army of about 3,000 men towards the castle of Gardona and on the following day reached the crossroads of Muda. At this point there were two ways to reach Pieve di Cadore. The first, shorter and easier, continued along the Piave Valley along the river as far as Perarolo, where a bridge made it possible to cross the confluence of the Boite. At that point it would be possible to choose whether to take the path that led directly to Pieve, less steep but narrow and exposed to being spotted and ambushed by the enemy, or the one that led to Valle, steeper but less exposed. The second option was to detour to the Muda crossing the Val di Zoldo and then descend into Cadore; this road was difficult because it was long, steep and led to high altitudes, where the snow was even more abundant, yet it made it possible to avoid being sighted by the enemy. Alviano chose the latter and sent envoys to Savorgnan, informing him of the details of the offensive, which would be launched on the morning of March 2. His troops, once they reached Forno di Zoldo, would have marched along the Cibiana Pass descending to Venas and then moving towards Pieve, and at the same time Savorgnan's men would have had to go from Forni di Sopra to the Mauria Pass and then descend to Lorenzago, capture Treponti and go up the Val d'Ansiei up to Passo Tre Croci and Misurina Pass. Once the Val d'Ansiei was secured, the men of Savorgnan would have had to descend to Domegge, besieging Pieve from the east. In this way the Venetians would have cut off all supply and escape routes for the Germans, forcing the latter to fight them or starve.  On the same day part of the Germans went up towards Domegge but were intercepted by Beraldo's stradioti and forced to fall back to Pieve, where they entrenched themselves with palisades and wooden shelters.\n\nParagraph 2: On 27 February Alviano reached Belluno, where he consulted with Corner and together they decided to launch an offensive aimed at recovering Cadore.

He cried as he reacted on a live Cable TV programme. \"It is the darkest day in the road for democracy,\" he said. \"I am disheartened ... I don't see a future for moderates in Hong Kong politics.\" A moderate reform plan he drew up – under which the public would not be allowed to nominate chief executive candidates – received a cool response from his allies. The barrister said he would think carefully about the next step in his political career after a decision from Beijing that was \"more undemocratic than I could imagine\". \"I thought there would be [some] chance for future dialogue,\" he said, referring to when pan-democrats were invited for talks with Beijing officials the previous month. \"But now, I don't see any chance.\" He eventually voted against the unmodified proposal with other pan-democrat legislators. On 8 June 2015, before the vote, he set up a think tank Path of Democracy, composed of moderate democrats.\n\nParagraph 4: The first permanent mission station and church-house of the Torres Islands was originally established by Durrad on the south coast of Tegua, but was eventually moved to Vipaka, on the south west side of Lo, following an apparent rumour of incestuous behaviour by the high chief of Tegua, whose sin was judged to be too abhorrent for the sensitivity of the Mission's leadership. More importantly, during this time - between the second half of the nineteenth century and the first half of the twentieth - the population of the Torres Islands suffered catastrophic decline as a combined result of the various epidemic diseases that were introduced by Europeans and the accelerated out-migration provoked by Blackbirding. According to vaguely worded Mission records located at the Diocese of Banks and Torres headquarters on Sola (Vanua Lava), at some time in the early 1930s the total population of the Torres group numbered no more than 56 persons. Hence, the subsequent recovery of the indigenous population of these islands, along with the continuity of linguistic and cultural values that they still exhibit, can be described as nothing less than remarkable. Despite the fact that they belonged to a broader regional complex of human and material exchanges that extended well into present-day Temotu province (in the Solomons), the Torres Islands eventually became part of the Anglo-French Condominium of the New Hebrides in 1906, and were subsequently incorporated into the Republic of Vanuatu in 1980.\n\nParagraph 5: Limb and girdle elements from the left and right sides of the body closely match each other in size and are the appropriate size to belong to the same individual as the vertebrae and ribs. The disposition of bones in the quarry is approximately as expected if the animal were lying on its left side in an opisthotonic pose, but nearly all bones show some disorientation and disarticulation: the cervical vertebrae are arranged along a curved line, and extending along this tight curve (approximately) sit two of the dorsal vertebrae followed by the sacrum and caudal vertebrae. The sacrum and first three caudal vertebrae were found in articulation and in line with the remaining articulated caudal vertebrae; others are present after a gap of about . Twenty-seven caudal vertebrae are shown on the quarry map, but 30 were found in the collection, and pre-restoration photos indicate that 32 were originally present. Many of the chevrons were found articulated with their respective caudal vertebrae. The left and right scapulae were recovered on the left and right sides of the body, respectively. The left radius was found about midway between the pectoral girdle elements. Left and right femora, pubes, and ilia were located close to one another and all of these were found near the sacrum. The sacrum is depicted with its left side facing upwards on the quarry map, but this might have been an error because the left side of the sacrum is damaged and the left ilium is missing. The elements of the left and right crura were found in close association. Dorsal rib fragments were scattered across the quarry area. In sum, some degree of dispositioning occurred to HBV-20001 before or during burial, resulting in loss and disarticulation of some elements, but the disposition, overall agreement in size, and lack of duplication of bones suggests the presence of a single sauropod individual at this locality.\n\nParagraph 6: Limb and girdle elements from the left and right sides of the body closely match each other in size and are the appropriate size to belong to the same individual as the vertebrae and ribs.

Fazal, the nation's leading bowler, succeeded him in the role. In his first Test as captain he won the toss and decided to field, opening the bowling he took the wicket of Conrad Hunte in the first over for the second successive Test. Fazal finished the innings with figures of 4/32 which also included dismissing Gary Sobers for a duck. Fazal took three further wickets in the second innings including both Hunte and Sobers, the latter's wicket was Fazal's 100th in Test cricket, the first Pakistani to reach the landmark. Pakistan completed a ten wicket victory to give their new captain a winning start. Pakistan also won the next Test at Dhaka and therefore completed a series win in the three match rubber. In a low scoring match Fazal played an instrumental role, taking ten wickets in a match for the fourth time in Tests. Put in to bat, Pakistan recovered from 22/5 to make 145. West Indies fared worse, being dismissed for 76 following a collapse of six wickets for 11 runs. Fazal bowled throughout the innings, taking 6/34. West Indies, set 214 in their fourth innings, fell 41 runs short. Fazal taking six of the first seven wickets, the other dismissal that of Sobers by Mahmood Hussain involved Fazal as the catcher. Mahmood finished off the tail to claim four wickets while Fazal ended with figures of 6/66 and a match analysis of 12/100. The latter were the best figures by a bowler whilst captain until 1993, when bettered by Waqar Younis. The third Test, a dead rubber, was won by the West Indies. Fazal dismissed both openers but these were his only wickets in 40 overs. He was the leading wicket-taker in the series with 21 at 15.85.\n\nParagraph 10: On 27 February Alviano reached Belluno, where he consulted with Corner and together they decided to launch an offensive aimed at recovering Cadore.

{"input": "", "context": "Paragraph 1: After Hübener finished middle school in 1941, he began an apprenticeship in administration at the Hamburg Social Authority (Sozialbehörde). He met other apprentices there, one of whom, Gerhard Düwer, he would later recruit into his resistance movement. At a bathhouse, he met new friends, one of whom had a communist family background and, as a result, he began listening to enemy radio broadcasts. Listening to foreign media was at the time strictly forbidden in Nazi Germany, being considered a form of treason. In the summer of that same year, Hübener discovered his older half-brother Gerhard's shortwave radio in a hallway closet. It had been given to Gerhard earlier that year by a soldier returning from service in France. Helmuth began listening to the BBC on his own, and he used what he heard to compose various anti-National Socialist texts and anti-war leaflets, of which he also made many copies. The leaflets were designed to bring to people's attention how skewed the official reports about World War II from Berlin were, as well as to point out Adolf Hitler's, Joseph Goebbels', and other leading Nazis' criminal behaviour. Other themes covered by Hübener's writings were the war's futility and Germany's looming defeat. He also mentioned the mistreatment sometimes meted out in the Hitler Youth.\n\nParagraph 2: After an extended knee-injury layoff, Appiah came off the bench for Fenerbahçe in the Turkish Super League on 6 October 2007. However, the injury recurred after his last game on 1 December, and Appiah went to Italy for rehabilitation on 20 December 2007. The long-term injury forced him to miss the 2008 African Cup of Nations as a player, instead, he became a special adviser of the team. Fenerbahçe also wanted to de-register Appiah as he occupied a foreigner quota, but he refused as he was unclear with the matter. Appiah also refused to take rehabilitation in Turkey. The club also thought that Appiah was actually AWOL and Appiah thought the club exposed his medical history to the press and mistreatment to his injury, although the club defended that it had made an appointment for Appiah to visit Mayo Clinic, United States, but Appiah did not attend. On 1 February 2008, Appiah formally submitted a claim of mistreatment by asking to leave as free agent on 1 July 2008 and received the pre-agreed 2008–09 season salary of €2 million. In response, Fenerbahçe notified FIFA. In April 2008 the case went to FIFA Dispute Resolution Chamber (DRC), and both parties sued each other. He unilaterally terminated the contract at the end of season, as he thought the club had breached the contract by not fulfilling its duties. He also discussed with West Ham United in summer 2008 for a possible contract. DRC ordered Appiah to pay Fenerbahçe €2,281,915 as he breached the contract without just cause on 9 January 2009. He immediately appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport in May after received the decision on 5 May 2009 and the club also submitted its appeal. On 7 June 2010 CAS ruled that Appiah did not need to pay Fenerbahçe, as Fenerbahçe saved more in wages (€2,633,020.65) than losses  (€2,496,278.85).\n\nParagraph 3: Separation of compounds is based on the competition of the solute and the mobile phase for binding sites on the stationary phase. For instance, if normal-phase silica gel is used as the stationary phase, it can be considered polar. Given two compounds that differ in polarity, the more polar compound has a stronger interaction with the silica and is, therefore, better able to displace the mobile phase from the available binding sites. As a consequence, the less polar compound moves higher up the plate (resulting in a higher Rf value). If the mobile phase is changed to a more polar solvent or mixture of solvents, it becomes better at binding to the polar plate and therefore displacing solutes from it, so all compounds on the TLC plate will move higher up the plate. It is commonly said that \"strong\" solvents (eluents) push the analyzed compounds up the plate, whereas \"weak\" eluents barely move them. The order of strength/weakness depends on the coating (stationary phase) of the TLC plate. For silica gel-coated TLC plates, the eluent strength increases in the following order: perfluoroalkane (weakest), hexane, pentane, carbon tetrachloride, benzene/toluene, dichloromethane, diethyl ether, ethyl acetate, acetonitrile, acetone, 2-propanol/n-butanol, water, methanol, triethylamine, acetic acid, formic acid (strongest). For C18-coated plates the order is reverse. In other words, when the stationary phase is polar and the mobile phase is nonpolar, the method is normal-phase as opposed to reverse-phase. This means that if a mixture of ethyl acetate and hexane as the mobile phase is used, adding more ethyl acetate results in higher Rf values for all compounds on the TLC plate. Changing the polarity of the mobile phase will normally not result in reversed order of running of the compounds on the TLC plate. An eluotropic series can be used as a guide in selecting a mobile phase. If a reversed order of running of the compounds is desired, an apolar stationary phase should be used, such as C18-functionalized silica.\n\nParagraph 4: After an extended knee-injury layoff, Appiah came off the bench for Fenerbahçe in the Turkish Super League on 6 October 2007.

During that period, Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra had announced several reforms of the Monastic Act, aiming for a Sangha that is more independent of the government. Luang Por Thongdi expressed his disagreement with the proposed reforms by publishing a book about them. He stated the Sangha Council was rash in its decisions, and doubted whether the monastic establishment was ready to be self-reliant. A network run by scholars and devotees stated the book was inappropriate and they pleaded with the Sangha Council to act. As soon as Luang Por Thongdi was removed from the office, practitioners of Wat Phra Dhammakaya and students of Wat Rajaoros' school protested against the decision, but Luang Por Thongdi asked them to stop in order not to express contempt of the Supreme Patriarch. Meanwhile, PM Thaksin admitted he was \"shocked\" by the Supreme Patriarch's decision. Whereas the network of critics stated Luang por Thongdi \"always had opposing views\" and caused division, the head of the Religious Affairs Department responded \"monks should have the right to air their views\". When Luang Por Thongdi himself was asked how he felt about the decision, he replied \"We are born in this world without anything [without position or possessions]. Having been a member of the Sangha Council, I have served Buddhism, which is the highest good in life. ... The right thing to do [now] is to accept the decision made [by the Supreme Patriarch]\". Luang Por Thongdi also clarified that he was not opposed to reform and more independence from the government, but the Sangha should still have an important role in moral education, which he felt was overlooked in the reforms.\n\nParagraph 6: Bartels filled in at Lotus for Johnny Herbert, who had commitments in Japanese Formula 3000, at four Grands Prix during the  Formula One season, but failed to qualify at all four races. Bartels continued in F3000, finishing 4th in 1992, before switching to the DTM in 1994, where he continued to race until the series ended at the end of 1996. Bartels raced in the Super Tourenwagen Cup for the next three years, before the DTM was resurrected in 2000. He won the 24 Hours Nürburgring in 2000 (in a works Porsche 911 GT3) and 2001 (in a Chrysler Viper GTS-R).\n\nParagraph 7: After an extended knee-injury layoff, Appiah came off the bench for Fenerbahçe in the Turkish Super League on 6 October 2007.

When Bullseye attacks his fortress, Daredevil ends up killing him in the same manner as Bullseye did to Elektra. Most of the street-based superheroes (consisting of Spider-Man, Iron Fist, Luke Cage, Misty Knight, Moon Knight, Shang-Chi, and Colleen Wing) try to reason with Daredevil only for Kingpin and Lady Bullseye to unleash Ghost Rider upon Shadowland. Daredevil blames them for the diversion and has the Hand attack them. Following a fight with the street-based superheroes who escaped with Punisher's help, Daredevil states that he will plan to resurrect Bullseye to serve him. He is then approached by Elektra, who apparently swears her allegiance to him. The street-based heroes are visited by Master Izo, who states that the Snakeroot Clan plan to make Daredevil a vessel for the Beast of the Hand (who desires nothing but darkness and destruction). Later Colleen Wing learns from Daredevil that her mother had led a female faction of the Hand called the \"Nail\". Colleen eventually accepts Daredevil's offer to join the Nail. It is shown that the Hand also has a faction called the Underhand which are a group of ninjas that are already dead. This, when Luke Cage is visited by his old friend Lacy Kimbro, who tells Luke that her son Darris is among the cops that are held prisoners by the Underhand.<ref>Thunderbolts #148</ref> Realizing that Daredevil is possessed by the demonic Beast of the Hand, the heroes gather together to try to fight him themselves. Despite their efforts to interrupt Bullseye's resurrection ceremony, even a direct attack from Wolverine fails to kill the now-demonic Daredevil. Daredevil throws off Elektra and Spider-Man's attempts to reason with him, as he proclaims \"There is no Murdock! There is only the Beast!\". Although Iron Fist is able to heal Daredevil of the 'infection' by using his chi punch to cure Daredevil's soul, Kingpin and Typhoid Mary take advantage of the chaos in the aftermath of the war to take command of the Hand for themselves.\n\nParagraph 9: The Hand plays a major part in the 2010 \"Shadowland\" storyline where Daredevil uses the Hand as a force of justice.

It began in February 2005 when Cussler sued Anschutz and Crusader for $100 million for failing to consult him on the script. The author also claimed breach of contract because Crusader had failed to take up the option of a second book; Anschutz counter-sued for \"alleged blackmail and sabotage attempts against the film prior to its 2005 release.\" Cussler claimed he had been assured \"absolute control\" over the book's film adaptation, but when this did not happen, he believed this contributed to its failure at the box office. He said in a statement, \"They deceived me right from the beginning. They kept lying to me... and I just got fed up with it.\" However, Anschutz's company counter-sued, claiming it had been the behavior of Cussler that contributed to the film's problems. They claimed Cussler did have certain approval rights regarding the script and selection of actors and directors, but he had been an obstructive presence, rejecting many screenplay revisions and attacking the film in the media before it was even released. On May 15, 2007, a jury found in Anschutz's favor and awarded him $5 million in damages. On January 8, 2008, Judge John Shook decided that Crusader Entertainment was not required to pay Cussler $8.5 million for rights to the second book. On March 10, 2009, the same judge ordered Cussler to pay $13.9 million in legal fees to the production company.\n\nParagraph 11: Large volumes of Arab petrodollars were invested directly in US Treasury securities and in other financial markets of the major industrial economies, often directed discreetly by government entities now known as sovereign wealth funds. Many billions of petrodollars were also invested through the major commercial banks of the United States, European Union, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. In fact, the process contributed to the growth of the Eurodollar market as a less-regulated rival to US monetary markets. As the recessionary condition of the world economy made investment in corporations less attractive, bankers and well-financed governments lent much of the money directly to the governments of developing countries, especially in Latin America such as Brazil and Argentina as well as other major developing countries like Turkey. The 1973 oil crisis had created a vast dollar shortage in these countries; however, they still needed to finance their imports of oil and machinery. In early 1977, when Turkey stopped heating its prime minister's office, opposition leader Suleyman Demirel famously described the shortage as: \"Turkey is in need of 70 cents.\" As political journalist William Greider summarized the situation: \"Banks collected the deposits of revenue-rich OPEC governments and lent the money to developing countries so they could avoid bankruptcy.\" In subsequent decades, many of these developing states found their accumulated debts to be unpayably large, concluding that it was a form of neocolonialism from which debt relief was the only escape.\n\nParagraph 12: In 2001, Luang Por Thongdi made headlines when he was suddenly removed from the Sangha Council, because the Supreme Patriarch felt he \"acted against the decisions of the council\".

Alexander D Knysh, a professor of Islamic studies at the University of Michigan, claims the first serious attempts to address Sufism in academic discourses can be traced back to the 17th century. The discussions by scholars in the west around this time were concerned with critically analysing and translating the Sufi literature. Notably, the literary output of renowned Persian poets such as Sadi, Attar, Rumi, Jami, and Hafez. However, Knysch also points out a rather contrasting image of Sufism that appears within the personal memoirs and travelogues of western travellers in the Middle East and Central Asia in the 18th and 19th centuries. Mostly produced for the most part by western travellers, colonial administrators, and merchants, they perceived Sufi literature and the overall tradition as exotic, erratic behaviour, and strange practices by the dervishes. In such works, literary concerns were mixed with a larger goal to illustrate a systematic and accurate account of various Sufi communities, practices, and doctrines. Although such scholars were intrigued by the nature of Sufi literature and many of the individual Sufi dervishes, they were hesitant in considering the mystical elements of Sufism to be something inherent to the larger Islamic religion. This is because they did not consider Islam and Christianity in the same light and therefore considered Islam to be incapable of producing the kind of theological discussions present within Sufi literature. For instance, Joseph Garcin de Tassy (1794–1878), a French Orientalist, translated and produced a large number of works on Islamic, Persian, and Hindustani discourses. He admired the Persian language and literature yet showed a conventional anti-Islamic prejudice notable of his time. He perceived Sufi literature vis-à-vis Christian heretics but considered the former as a distorted version of the latter. He thought Islamic cultures restrict human autonomy and material pleasures. Such views on Sufi literature were commonly shared at the time by several European Orientalists who were originally trained as either philologists or Biblical studies scholars.

The defect in this thinking springs from the substituting of inference and argument for the language of the statute, and from failure to distinguish between the rights which are given to the inventor by the patent law and which he may assert against all the world through an infringement proceeding, and rights which he may create for himself by private contract, which, however, are subject to the rules of general, as distinguished from those of the patent, law. While it is true that, under the statutes as they were (and now are), a patentee might withhold his patented machine from public use, yet, if he consented to use it himself or through others, such use immediately fell within the terms of the statute, and, as we have seen, he is thereby restricted to the use of the invention as it is described in the claims of his patent, and not as it may be expanded by limitations as to materials and supplies necessary to the operation of it, imposed by mere notice to the public.\n\nParagraph 4: As word leaked to the Soviets of the developing Manhattan Project, Lona Cohen was chosen by her new control officer, Anatoli Yatskov, to work as a courier. Lona's job was to transport classified information from Theodore Hall, and a source cover named \"FOGEL\" and \"PERS\" from the American secret atomic weapons project at Los Alamos, New Mexico and carry them to the Soviet consulate in New York. There, a KGB sub-residency under a young engineer, Leonid R. Kvasnikov, coordinated operations and dispatched intelligence to Moscow.(Intelligence historian Nigel West, who identified Rudolf Peierls as the spy codenamed \"Fogel\" and later \"Pers\" in the Venona intercepts, and his wife Genia as the spy codenamed \"Tina\". However, the association of Tina with Genia did not fit with what was known about Tina, and she was conclusively revealed to be Melita Norwood in 1999. Nor did Peierls fit Pers, as the latter worked at the Clinton Engineer Works, whereas Peierls did not.There were good reasons for the postwar intelligence agencies to suspect Peierls. He not only had recruited Fuchs, and served as his \"sponsor\" on recruitment and security matters, but had pressed the authorities for Fuchs to be given a full security clearance without which he could not have assisted Peierls in his work. Fuchs lived with the Peierls family for a time. Peierls had a Russian wife, as did his brother, and he maintained close contact with colleagues in the Soviet Union before and after the Second World War.) Lona met with Hall for the first time in late August 1945, outside a church in Albuquerque, New Mexico. She had been to this church the previous four Sundays, but Hall had been confused about the date of their meet and did not show up until nearly a month after originally scheduled. Hall gave her the report that she had traveled for, and she was sent back to New York. To avoid detection she concealed the report inside a Kleenex box, a move which became known within Soviet spy circles for its cleverness. After returning to New York, it was discovered that the report she had helped deliver contained a complete diagram of the first atomic bomb.\n\nParagraph 5: On 3 November 1919, the Azerbaijani army, supplemented by auxiliary Kurdish cavalry launched a full-scale attack into the Armenian-controlled section of Zangezur, successful in briefly occupying some bordering Armenian villages before being decisively defeated and forced out by the local Armenians, led by partisan commanders Colonel Shahmazian and Garegin Nzhdeh. A notable historian on the topic, Hovannisian, describes the conflict:Preliminary skirmishes involving the Kurdo-Tatar partisans of Haji-Samlu were followed by a general Azerbaijani offensive at dawn on November 4. Under cover of a dense fog, the advancing regiments flanked the Armenian forward trenches and captured the first line of defense. By the next afternoon Bayandur, Khnadsakh, Korindzor, and Tegh had fallen, Khoznavar was in flames, and Azerbaijani artillery was bombarding the heights (Kechel-dagh) overlooking Goris. At nightfall Azerbaijani crescent-shaped fires burned on these heights. Elsewhere, Muslim bands from Sharur-Nakhichevan invested Nors-Mazra and other villages near Sisian, and two Turkish-officered platoons cut across the rugged Zangezur mountains from Ordubad into the Muslim stronghold of Okhchichai. Throughout Zangezur the imperiled Muslim population took heart in anticipation of liberation by the Azerbaijani army.Such hopes were cut short, however, by the counterattack Shahmazian mounted on November 6 after concentrating all available units on the Goris front. Artillerymen ... made direct hits on the Azerbaijani positions on Kechel-dagh, which was recaptured by Armenian companies ... The Kurdish irregulars were the first to break ranks and scatter into the mountains around Minkend, while the Azerbaijani regulars withdrew toward Tegh and the vale of Zabukh. Having gained the initiative, the Armenians charged the Azerbaijani lines, decimating Edigarov's cavalry regiment in cross fire, reportedly inflicting several hundred casualties on the infantry, capturing 100,000 rounds of ammunition and six machine guns near Khoznavar, and putting two cannons and more than twenty machine guns out of commission. By November 9 the Azerbaijani army was retreating in disarray toward Zabukh and the northern mountainous bypaths to Karabagh. Within a week after the invasion began, the Armenians of Zangezur were celebrating an impressive victory.\n\nParagraph 6: [T]he argument [is] that, since the patentee may withhold his patent altogether from public use, he must logically and necessarily be permitted to impose any conditions which he chooses upon any use which he may allow of it. The defect in this thinking springs from the substituting of inference and argument for the language of the statute, and from failure to distinguish between the rights which are given to the inventor by the patent law and which he may assert against all the world through an infringement proceeding, and rights which he may create for himself by private contract, which, however, are subject to the rules of general, as distinguished from those of the patent, law. While it is true that, under the statutes as they were (and now are), a patentee might withhold his patented machine from public use, yet, if he consented to use it himself or through others, such use immediately fell within the terms of the statute, and, as we have seen, he is thereby restricted to the use of the invention as it is described in the claims of his patent, and not as it may be expanded by limitations as to materials and supplies necessary to the operation of it, imposed by mere notice to the public.\n\nParagraph 7: [T]he argument [is] that, since the patentee may withhold his patent altogether from public use, he must logically and necessarily be permitted to impose any conditions which he chooses upon any use which he may allow of it.

{"input": "", "context": "Paragraph 1: Shashida  was born on 8 January 1863 at the village Tegharia near Barrackpore in present West Bengal. He was the youngest son of Saudamini Devi and Anandachandra, who owned some land and belonged to an old respectable family.  As a student at Sodepur high school, Shashida opened a traditional primary school of the Pathshala style, to give secular education to children of indigent families, usually looked after by zealous Christian preachers. In course of time, Shashida created also evening classes  for adults and, in addition to rudiments of Bengali, history and mathematics, he invited competent collaborators to initiate them to weaving, agriculture including growing silk-worms, and  cottage industry. In  1880, Shashida passed his Entrance examination and was admitted at the Metropolitan Institution of Kolkata, haloed by the presence of Ishwarchandra Vidyasagar as one of its directors and of Rashtraguru Surendranath Banerjea and Khudiram Bose (not the martyr) as its faculty. Rashtraguru had instructed Yogendra Vidyabhushan to popularise the lives of Mazzini and Garibaldi and had a nationwide reputation as orator. Khudiram Bose was a disciple of the famous Young Bengal leader, Reverend Kalicharan Banerjee, and knew  Keshub Chunder Sen intimately. There was an active physical education course in the college, supervised by Chandidas Ghosh. In no time Shashida caught the sparks of a nascent patriotic activism and, with Anandamohan Basu, formed the Students’ Association, which had contacts with Deshabandhu Chittaranjan Das, Pramathanath Mitra also known as Barrister P. Mitter and Brahmabandhab Upadhyay. He was a regular visitor to the gymnasium attached to the General Assembly's Institution (later Scottish Church College) and the Gohas’ club. For traditional self-defence, he met  Swami Vivekananda who practised wrestling with the Gohas. The Swami's philosophy of man-making consolidated Shashida's own plans of action. Here, probably thanks to Vivekananda, he discovered Jatindranath Mukherjee, too, the future Bagha Jatin.\n\nParagraph 2: Ismaïl \"is made up of eyes, sideburns, and a dress\", tied with rope to a badger and stumbling down Arionoaia Street. Protected from \"legal responsibility\" in the country (\"a seed-bed at the bottom of a hole in Dobruja\"), the creature raises an entire badger colony: some he eats raw, with lemon; the others, once they have turned sixteen, he rapes \"without the smallest qualm of conscience.\" The seed-bed is where Ismaïl also interviews job applicants, received on the condition that they hatch him \"four eggs each\". The process is supported by his \"chamberlain\" Turnavitu, who exchanges love letters with the applicants. Ismaïl's actual residence is kept a secret, but it is presumed that he lives, sequestered from \"the corruption of electoral mores\", in an attic above the home of his grotesquely disfigured father, only to emerge in a ball gown for the yearly celebration of plaster. He then offers his body to the workers, in hopes of thus resolving \"the labor issue\". Whereas Ismaïl has once worked as an air fan for \"dirty Greek coffee houses\" in the Lipscani quarter, Turnavitu has a past in \"politics\": he was for long the government-appointed air fan at the fire precinct kitchen. Ismaïl has spared Turnavitu a life of near constant rotation, remunerating his services: the seed-bed interviews, the ritualized apologizes to the leashed badgers, the praise of Ismaïl's fashion sense, and the swabbing of canola over Ismaïl's gowns. Their relationship breaks down as Turnavitu, returning from the Balearic Islands in the form of a jerrycan, passes the common cold to Ismaïl's badgers. Sacked from his job, he contemplates suicide (\"not before seeing to the extraction of four canines in his mouth\"), and hurls himself into a pyre made up of Ismaïl's dresses; the patron falls into depression and \"decrepitude\", retreating to his seed-bed for the rest of his own life.\n\nParagraph 3: The village was close to the wartime airfield] of RAF Hampstead Norris, an RAF Bomber Command Operational Training Unit (OTU) station.

{"input": "", "context": "Paragraph 1: The church during the 1904 Bi-centennial celebrations of Sutton's founding had Rev. Arthur Davis represent the church at all the festivities and functions. Several houses in West Sutton were used as a parsonage until, in 1915, the Church purchased a large house nearby. The one hundredth anniversary of the building of the church was celebrated, in 1929. A cellar was dug under the church, affording space for a furnace, and the two big wood stoves were removed. The interior was redecorated. Electric lights were installed in memory of Mr. C.S. Jones, who had been a member of the Men's Sunday School Class, known as the \"Knights of the Wheel.\" A Woman's Community Organization, known as \"The Hillside Club,\" was organized in 1906 to aid this church financially and to be of benefit to the community, and the members had always been ready and willing to raise extra funds when needed. In 1950, the club spent $100 beautifying the Community Hall and $400 towards the redecoration expenses. A Christian Endeavor Society was first formed in the 1890s, but later discontinued — until 1936 when it was revived. It has been a very vital and important part in the life of the church and the community, carrying on many worthwhile projects. Among the improvements made at this time were a new choir section made to the right of the stage area. New pews were bought for this project, but because they didn't match the interior of the church, this caused some issues with older families of the church. a maroon velveteen curtain was placed in the area to cover this up. They held religious services Sunday evenings as well as mornings at this time. The church lost several tiers of its steeple in the 1938 hurricane but otherwise looks much as it did in the engraving in the original town history. The horse sheds to the west of the building were torn down. The 1938 hurricane blew down the beautiful Christopher Wren-type steeple, damaging other parts of the building. In 1938, modern improvements were introduced. The men of the parish capped over the second section of the steeple and a fund has been started to build a new spire. In 1938, the Church felt the need for a larger place in which to hold activities of different kinds. The large two-story building next door was bought for a parish house and community hall for the use of the church and community. This building had been, for many years, a real \"old time\" country store and post office. It is being improved and modernized. The first well, drilled in 1949, supplied the church, parish hall and parsonage. A new organ was given to the church by the Hillside Club, in 1910, and this was electrified, in 1948, through the efforts of the Club and Choir. In 1951, The very important project of re-plastering and painting the whole interior of the Church was undertaken, in 1950. Money had been earned with auctions, suppers, movies and a Bazaar. A contractor was hired, but, in order to save money, the men and women of the Church and community cleaned and painted the pews and floor. The paint was donated by members of the Church. In removing old paint from the pews, it was found that the trim is solid mahogany. This trim restored, gives the white pews their original beauty. A beautiful maroon velveteen Choir Curtain, Dossal Curtain and draperies to match at the two south windows are now installed. In 1950, there were sixty-three members. A new hall has been added to the east side in 1959 to accommodate the growing congregation with classroom space under it with access to the 2.5 acres of land behind the structures. In the late 1990s the sanctuary was refurbished again and the balcony area was covered up as well as four pew areas reducing the capacity to about 180 to this day.\n\nParagraph 2: Pat O'Brien grew up in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. He attended Axtell Park Middle School before graduating from Washington High School in 1966. O'Brien received a degree in government from the University of South Dakota (where he was a member of the Delta Tau Delta fraternity) in 1970. He subsequently earned a master's degree in international economics from the Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University in Washington, D.C. O'Brien was a member of Sioux Falls area rock and roll band Dale Gregory and the Shouters, from 1964 to 1967 for which he was inducted into the South Dakota Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on April 25, 2010. Subsequent to the Shouters, he was the lead band personality in the local band Those of Us, a compilation of the Shouters and the X-Men.\n\nParagraph 3: Bell attended St. Pius X High School in Ottawa. Bell played in the CJHL for the Ottawa Jr. Senators. Bell then moved on to the Ontario Hockey League (OHL) with the Ottawa 67's where in four OHL seasons, he scored 32 goals and 171 points in 238 total games. In 2002–03, his final season with the 67's, he was named the team's captain. Bell was named the top defenseman in both the OHL and Canadian Hockey League that season. He also played on the silver-medal winning Canadian team in the 2003 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships, while registering one goal and two points in the tournament.\n\nParagraph 4: In contrast to the system under the Weimar Republic, the Bundestag may only dismiss the Chancellor with a constructive vote of no confidence (electing a new Chancellor at the same time) and can thereby only choose to dismiss the Chancellor with their entire cabinet and not simply individual ministers. These procedures and mechanisms were put in place by the authors of the Basic Law to both prevent another dictatorship and to ensure that there will not be a political vacuum left by the removal of Chancellor through a vote of confidence and the failure to elect a new one in their place, as had happened during the Weimar period with the Reichstag removing Chancellors but failing to agree on the election of a new one.\n\nParagraph 5: The economist, former guerrilla, and former mayor of Bogotá, Gustavo Petro, previously a candidate in the 2010 and 2018 Colombian presidential elections, maintained a lead in most opinion polls and was set during the election to become the first president of Colombia from a left-wing coalition. In September 2021, Petro promised that he would retire from politics should his campaign for the presidency be unsuccessful. Petro said he would do so as he did not want to be an \"eternal candidate\". Of his campaign, Gwynne Dyer wrote: \"Petro is a known quantity, active in politics for the past thirty years. He's not really radical, but he would be Colombia's first-ever president from the left, so for some Colombians his policies would seem extreme: things like expanding social programs, ending oil and gas exploration, and investing in agriculture.\" His political party, Humane Colombia, promoted the creation of the Historic Pact for Colombia coalition, which includes social movements, socialist, environmental, and feminist associations. The ideological diversity of the coalition was seen as a source of internal tension, and Petro tried to win over more of the middle class during his campaign, which led him to moderate his economic program and his criticism of the private sector, while trying to distance himself from Venezuela, which he previously supported; he maintained his position of re-establishing bilateral relations with the government of Nicolás Maduro. During the campaign, he was critical of the neoliberal system of the Colombian economy and its reliance on oil and gas, advocated progressive proposals on women's rights and LGBTQ issues, and supported a peace agreement between the state and the guerrillas. Proposals from Petro to change the nation's economic model by piling taxes on unproductive landowners, as well as abandoning oil and coal for clean energy, upset investors. Some feared his efforts to shift wealth from rich to poor could cause Colombia to become similar to present-day Venezuela. Critics claim his ideas are also similar to the early days of Hugo Chávez's government in Venezuela. Petro was critical of the Maduro government's commitment to oil usage whilst on the campaign trail. In an interview with Le Monde, Petro argued that \"Maduro's Venezuela and Duque's Colombia are more similar than they seem\", pointing to both governments' commitment to non-renewable energy and the \"authoritarian drift\" of the two. Regarding Chávez, Petro praised his efforts to bolster equality but said that Chávez \"made a serious mistake of linking his social program to oil revenues\". During the campaign, Petro and his running mate Francia Márquez faced numerous death threats from paramilitary groups. Petro cancelled rallies in the Colombian coffee region in early May 2022 after his security team uncovered an alleged plot by the La Cordillera gang. In response to this and other similar situations, 90 elected officials and prominent individuals from 20 countries signed an open letter expressing concern and condemnation of attempts of political violence against Márquez and Petro. The letter highlighted the assassination of over 50 social leaders, trade unionists, environmentalists, and other community representatives in 2022. Signatories of the letter included former Ecuadorian president Rafael Correa, American linguist and philosopher Noam Chomsky, and French member of the National Assembly Jean-Luc Mélenchon. Petro received the support of Luis Gilberto Murillo.\n\nParagraph 6: Bell attended St. Pius X High School in Ottawa. Bell played in the CJHL for the Ottawa Jr. Senators.

It takes a straight line and introduces a curve. This curve represents an equal degree by which the gain increases or decreases during the length of the fade. A linear fade-in curve makes it sound as though the volume increases sharply at the beginning, and more gradually towards the end. The same principle applies on a fade-out where a gradual drop in volume can be perceived in the beginning, and the fade gets more abrupt towards the end. If in your audio there is a natural ambience or reverb present that one would like to reduce, the linear shape would be ideal because of the initial drop in perceived volume. When applied it shortens the ambience. Also if the music requires an accelerating effect, this linear curve can also be applied. This type of fade is not very natural sounding. The principle of a linear crossfade is: at the beginning of the fade the perceived volume drops more quickly, one can see at the halfway point (in the middle of the crossfade) that the perceived volume drops below 50%. This is a very noticeable drop in volume. Also if the control can move from position 0 to 100, and the percentage of the signal that is allowed to pass equals the position of the control (i.e. 25% of the signal is allowed to pass when the control is 25% of the physical distance from the 0 point to the 100 point). At the midpoint of the fade the effect of a linear crossfade is that both the sounds are below half of their maximum perceived volume; and as a result the sum of the two fades will be below the maximum level of either. This is not applicable when the two sounds are on different levels and the crossfade time is long enough. In turn if the crossfade is short (for example on a single note) the dip of the volume in the middle of the crossfade can be quite noticeable.\n\nParagraph 9: In 1902, however, the colour pink (rose) was designated to represent the \"rose of England\" by the first Newfoundland-born Roman Catholic bishop and future Archbishop of St. John's  Michael Francis Howley in the poem The Flag of Newfoundland, which he is credited as having written at that time and proposing it as an alternative national anthem to Sir Charles Cavendish Boyle's Ode to Newfoundland – Boyle being Newfoundland's British colonial governor from 1901 to 1904.  Howley attempted to overcome the perception of the \"Pink, White and Green\" as a Catholic flag by incorporating Protestant representation and turning the flag into a symbol representing all Newfoundlanders.  This was a somewhat awkward assertion since the \"rose of England\"is not pink/rose. However, the national floral emblem of England is a rose, the red and white Tudor rose instituted by King Henry VII as the symbol of unified England following what became known as the War of the Roses.  Historically, the colour pink/rose has never been used to represent England, its people or any of the Protestant churches of England or Newfoundland. However, the colour pink seen as rose could be said to evoke the image of a rose which is England's floral emblem. Pink/rose is a liturgical colour of the Roman Catholic, Anglican, Methodist, Lutheran and many other Christian denominations for a joyous celebration. Pink/rose was in use by other Catholic organizations in St. John's at the time.  Furthermore, the Star of the Sea Association's original banner, predating the green-white-pink tricolour, consisted of a white star and a pink cross on a green background, as specified in their original rules and by-laws.  Incidentally, by specifying the colour green in the poem as representing \"St. Patrick's emblem\",the shamrock, Howley joined many Irish nationalists in rejecting the red saltire of Saint Patrick's Cross, which they see as a British invention and which forms the diagonal red cross of the Union Jack meant to represent Ireland.  Nevertheless, Howley was somewhat successful as many but not most Newfoundlanders accepted it as a national symbol of Newfoundland.\n\nParagraph 10: Pat O'Brien grew up in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. He attended Axtell Park Middle School before graduating from Washington High School in 1966. O'Brien received a degree in government from the University of South Dakota (where he was a member of the Delta Tau Delta fraternity) in 1970.

Arthur Davis represent the church at all the festivities and functions. Several houses in West Sutton were used as a parsonage until, in 1915, the Church purchased a large house nearby. The one hundredth anniversary of the building of the church was celebrated, in 1929. A cellar was dug under the church, affording space for a furnace, and the two big wood stoves were removed. The interior was redecorated. Electric lights were installed in memory of Mr. C.S. Jones, who had been a member of the Men's Sunday School Class, known as the \"Knights of the Wheel.\" A Woman's Community Organization, known as \"The Hillside Club,\" was organized in 1906 to aid this church financially and to be of benefit to the community, and the members had always been ready and willing to raise extra funds when needed. In 1950, the club spent $100 beautifying the Community Hall and $400 towards the redecoration expenses. A Christian Endeavor Society was first formed in the 1890s, but later discontinued — until 1936 when it was revived. It has been a very vital and important part in the life of the church and the community, carrying on many worthwhile projects. Among the improvements made at this time were a new choir section made to the right of the stage area. New pews were bought for this project, but because they didn't match the interior of the church, this caused some issues with older families of the church. a maroon velveteen curtain was placed in the area to cover this up. They held religious services Sunday evenings as well as mornings at this time. The church lost several tiers of its steeple in the 1938 hurricane but otherwise looks much as it did in the engraving in the original town history. The horse sheds to the west of the building were torn down. The 1938 hurricane blew down the beautiful Christopher Wren-type steeple, damaging other parts of the building. In 1938, modern improvements were introduced. The men of the parish capped over the second section of the steeple and a fund has been started to build a new spire. In 1938, the Church felt the need for a larger place in which to hold activities of different kinds. The large two-story building next door was bought for a parish house and community hall for the use of the church and community. This building had been, for many years, a real \"old time\" country store and post office. It is being improved and modernized. The first well, drilled in 1949, supplied the church, parish hall and parsonage. A new organ was given to the church by the Hillside Club, in 1910, and this was electrified, in 1948, through the efforts of the Club and Choir. In 1951, The very important project of re-plastering and painting the whole interior of the Church was undertaken, in 1950. Money had been earned with auctions, suppers, movies and a Bazaar. A contractor was hired, but, in order to save money, the men and women of the Church and community cleaned and painted the pews and floor. The paint was donated by members of the Church. In removing old paint from the pews, it was found that the trim is solid mahogany. This trim restored, gives the white pews their original beauty.

While Jor-El was more concerned about his son fulfilling his destiny, Lara was worried no one would love him. Clark came out of his fugue screaming her name, leaving him with the reassurance that his mother had loved him (as opposed to Jor-El's apparently heartless manipulation of him, although his intentions were later confirmed to be benevolent), Martha Kent subsequently telling him \"Lara\" was his first word, but she and Jonathan never knew what it meant. In the episode named \"Lara\" of season 7, it is revealed that Lara, now played by Helen Slater, visited the Kent farm prior to the destruction of Krypton.

Because of this, from 1743 to 1744, Prince Alexander worked as the governor of Kartli (1743–1744) and he also served as a lieutenant (janisin) of Kartli, then under the Iranian sway, all as part of his training to become King of the Kingdom of Kartli. After his father's death, he was threatened with death by the Kakhetian branch of the Bagrationi from the Kingdom of Kakheti. He was soon removed from the office by his cousin Teimuraz II, of the rival Bagrationi branch from Kakheti, who became king of Kartli in 1744. Prince Alexander Ishaq Beg joined the opposition faction led by his jealous half-brother Abdullah Beg who was also a pretender to the throne, yet despite their differences, they united their forces to try to save the kingdom together, but soon they both had to submit to the ascending power of the Kakhetian Bagrationi. The Bagrationi of Kakheti and the Bagrationi of Mukhrani waged a twenty year war over the right to rule the Kingdom of Kartli. The Bagrationi of Mukhrani, who were trying to save Prince Alexander and have him inherit his rightful place as King of the Kingdom of Kartli, took the title of regents but never took that of king in honour of his father King Jesse of Kartli, the last true King of Kartli. Ultimately, the Kakhetian branch won and overthrew both Prince Alexander and all of the members of the Royal House of Mukhrani, taking the Kingdom of Kartli and turning it into the Kingdom of Kartli-Kakheti. In 1750, Prince Ishag Beg converted to Christianity, was baptized with the name Alexander by which he will be remembered throughout the centuries, and received a fief in Kvemo Kartli. Soon, his relations with Teimuraz again went downhill even further and under constant death threats from the Kakhetian branch, Alexander was forced to escape to Russia in 1759 as a form of exile. He entered the Russian military service and first joined a garrison at Astrakhan and then, in 1761, the Georgian squadron in Kizlyar in the ranks of podpolkovnik. Prince Alexander escaped to Russia, where he spent the rest of his days. He was a grandfather of Pyotr Bagration, a Russian general of the Napoleonic Wars, and heir to the lost throne of the Kingdom of Kartli, later granted the title of Knyaz by the Imperial Royal House of Russia, and recognised by Napoleon Bonaparte as one of the best Russian generals of his time with the phrase \"Russia has no good generals. The only exception is Bagration\".\n\nParagraph 3:  Lara has appeared in one episode of Season 3 in Smallville, played by Kendall Cross.

In May 1985, it was announced that Lester would be leaving the role; he stated that it was because of a CBS film (Blade) he starred in which could have possibly become a series: \"I wanted to work something out. I've enjoyed being with the show. However, I was concerned about the possibility of Blade being picked up as a series and being tied to The Young and the Restless.\" However, he ended up staying. Brett Porter briefly portrayed the role in 1986. The writers picked up on Lester having \"played with Jack's dialogue\" according to his intuitions. In 1989, Lester quit out of anger, as he felt that Jack was being \"squeezed\" out of the storyline, and was upset that Lauralee Bell's character Christine Blair was moved to the forefront of several storylines. Lester made his last appearance on September 1, 1989. The producers immediately began exploring recast options. At the time, Bergman, who had risen to super stardom as Dr. Cliff Warner on All My Children, had recently been fired. Bergman's firing made headlines, and Melody Thomas Scott, who portrays Nikki Newman, suggested Bergman as Jack to her husband and former executive producer Edward J. Scott when she read of the news in Soap Opera Digest. Bergman revealed that the producers had contacted his agent and asked about his height; he initially thought it was a joke. They then inquired about Bergman's feelings about replacing someone, and he was hesitant to take the role. He stated in 2009: \"I was on All My Children and replacing someone was sheer death, and it never worked on All My Children.\" When the producers called him again, he decided it \"couldn't hurt\" to audition. Scott arranged for Bergman to come to California and audition with Jerry Douglas and Jess Walton, who portrayed John and Jill Abbott respectively. After a successful audition, Bergman was offered the part. Bergman reluctantly relocated to California after accepting the part. He made his debut on November 27, 1989. Other actors were considered for the role, including Jon Lindstrom, who screen tested for William J. Bell, which was later broadcast on an episode of 48 Hours.\n\nParagraph 5: For over a year after the break up of My Chemical Romance, Way remained without a band until he formed Electric Century with Sleep Station vocalist David Debiak. The duo released their first song \"I Lied\" in February 2014. The same month, Electric Century was included in Alternative Press \"100 Bands You Need To Know\" list. The magazine mentioned that \"I Lied\" \"forges an alloy of decades-proven electronic pop\" comparing it to fun. and Twenty One Pilots.  Alternative Press also said that the duo's album was finished and awaiting release later that year. The album was recorded and mixed by D. James Goodwin at The Isokon Studio in Woodstock, New York. In November, Way revealed that he had flown in February to the East Coast to complete the album but instead went to rehab. Way also said the news about Electric Century would be \"in the coming months.\" On January 13, 2015, \"Let You Get Away\" was made available for streaming. \"Let You Get Away\" was released as a single on April 3. The band announced their debut self-titled EP on March 10, and was released on Record Store Day on April 18. \"Hail the Saints\" and \"Right There\" were released as singles on May 6.\n\nParagraph 6: The album produced two singles, the first of which was \"The Disappointed\", which reached number 33 on the UK Singles Chart, and became nominated for an Ivor Novello Award in 1993.Larkin, Colin; ed.

Ultimately 1,000 CD copies were pressed and it was the band's final single before leaving Virgin. Partridge reflected: \"It was the great cot-death single – they pressed it and then changed their minds, such a shame.\" Promotional videos for all three songs were made, with the \"Peter Pumpkinhead\" video receiving much airplay on MTV that summer; the band also performed \"Books Are Burning\" live with Mattacks on The Late Show on BBC Two in April 1992. The album was promoted with music magazine advertisements that featured joke quotes such as \"George Bush doesn't get it\", \"David Duke thinks it contains communist codes\" and \"William Kennedy Smith just wants to know if it gets chicks hot.\" Other advertisements featured the tagline: \"Still Not on Tour (Cheer up, there is a new album)\".\n\nParagraph 7:  Lara has appeared in one episode of Season 3 in Smallville, played by Kendall Cross.

Five years later, she won on a Congress ticket from Gwalior. Later, she quit the Congress and won the Guna seat in 1967 on Swatantra Party's ticket. She soon joined Bharatiya Jan Sangh and resigned from Lok Sabha to take part in state politics. She won the Karera assembly seat in Madhya Pradesh as the Jan Sangh candidate in 1967 and plunged headlong into state politics. Jan Sangh defied the Indira-wave in the 1971 Lok Sabha polls to win 3 seats in Gwalior region – Vijaya Raje Scindia from Bhind, Vajpayee from Gwalior and Madhavrao Scindia from Guna, though he later left the party. Vijayaraje Scindia did not contest Lok Sabha elections in 1977 and 1984 and lost to Indira Gandhi in Rae Bareli in 1980. In 1989, she won from Guna as member of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), and retained the seat in 1991, 1996 and 1998. She did not contest the elections in 1999 due to old age. She was jailed by Indira Gandhi during the Emergency, ultimately sharing a cell with fellow Rajmata and MP, Gayatri Devi, in Tihar Jail. In the 1970s, Vijayraje and her son Madhavrao were involved in a public dispute over property. Animosities heightened due to their differing political ideologies.\n\nParagraph 10:  Prince Alexander, as the firstborn son of his father King Jesse of Kartli, was selected as crown prince and heir to the throne of the Kingdom of Kartli by his father and by the Persians.

The Bagrationi of Mukhrani, who were trying to save Prince Alexander and have him inherit his rightful place as King of the Kingdom of Kartli, took the title of regents but never took that of king in honour of his father King Jesse of Kartli, the last true King of Kartli. Ultimately, the Kakhetian branch won and overthrew both Prince Alexander and all of the members of the Royal House of Mukhrani, taking the Kingdom of Kartli and turning it into the Kingdom of Kartli-Kakheti. In 1750, Prince Ishag Beg converted to Christianity, was baptized with the name Alexander by which he will be remembered throughout the centuries, and received a fief in Kvemo Kartli. Soon, his relations with Teimuraz again went downhill even further and under constant death threats from the Kakhetian branch, Alexander was forced to escape to Russia in 1759 as a form of exile. He entered the Russian military service and first joined a garrison at Astrakhan and then, in 1761, the Georgian squadron in Kizlyar in the ranks of podpolkovnik. Prince Alexander escaped to Russia, where he spent the rest of his days. He was a grandfather of Pyotr Bagration, a Russian general of the Napoleonic Wars, and heir to the lost throne of the Kingdom of Kartli, later granted the title of Knyaz by the Imperial Royal House of Russia, and recognised by Napoleon Bonaparte as one of the best Russian generals of his time with the phrase \"Russia has no good generals. The only exception is Bagration\".", "answers": ["10"], "length": 3286, "dataset": "passage_count_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "70de565b3fe6a60eaf2569d9e7894cceebe75549b27a04cf"}

Rogers Jr. (September 16, 1934 – August 4, 2016) was a lieutenant general in the United States Air Force who served as deputy commander in chief of the U.S. Central Command at MacDill Air Force Base, Florida. The command was tasked with achieving United States national objectives in Southwest Asia, the Persian Gulf, and the Horn of Africa. Rogers was born in 1934, in Galveston, Texas. He earned a bachelor of science degree in engineering from the U.S. Military Academy in 1957 and a master's degree in business administration from The George Washington University. He completed Squadron Officer School in 1962 and the Industrial College of the Armed Forces in 1973. Upon graduation from the academy he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Air Force. After completing pilot training in September 1958 he was assigned to Tactical Air Command at Williams Air Force Base, Ariz., for gunnery training in the F-86F. With the phaseout of the F-86F, Rogers transferred in June 1959 as an instructor pilot to Air Training Command, Vance Air Force Base, Oklahoma. He completed F-101A transition training in September 1964 and then was assigned as a tactical fighter pilot with the 91st Tactical Fighter Squadron, Royal Air Force Station Bentwaters, England. In 1965 his squadron became the first unit in the United States Air Forces in Europe to transition to the F-4. Rogers assumed duties in the Standardization and Evaluation Section of the 81st Tactical Fighter Wing at Bentwaters in November 1966. In September 1967 he transferred to Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada, where he completed the F-4 Fighter Weapons School. In January 1968 he was assigned to the 557th Tactical Fighter Squadron, 12th Tactical Fighter Wing, Cam Ranh Bay Air Base, South Vietnam, as a flight commander and squadron weapons officer. He subsequently served as the wing weapons officer and assistant chief of weapons and tactics for 12th Tactical Fighter Wing. He flew 255 combat missions and 435 combat flying hours in the F-4C. He returned from Southeast Asia in February 1969 and was assigned to the Fighter and Reconnaissance Manning Section, Air Force Military Personnel Center, Randolph Air Force Base, Texas. He became chief of the section in 1971.

However, the rejection of the Mutant album left the band with no new material, and when they arrived in London they discovered that EMI were expecting the line-up that had recorded the first LP. Rudd hastily wrote a number of new songs, but to complete the LP they were forced to fall back on Rudd's back-catalogue, recording new versions of several Spectrum/Murtceps songs. The resulting album, Rock'n'Roll Scars, was mixed by the EMI recording engineer Geoff Emerick, who had worked with The Beatles.\n\nParagraph 6: Kersh was drafted into the army during the Second World War, served in the Coldstream Guards and ended up writing for the Army Film Unit. Despite apparently deserting, Kersh ended up in France during the liberation, where he discovered that many of his French relatives had ended up in Hitler's extermination camps. After the war, Kersh continued to enjoy commercial success, mainly because of his short stories, in genres such as horror, science fiction, fantasy and the detective story. From about the mid-1950s onwards, he started to suffer from poor health and financial hardship (specifically relating to his failure to pay income tax). However, Kersh continued to publish novels and stories, some of which were commercially and critically successful.  In 1958, his short story \"The Secret of the Bottle\", originally published in The Saturday Evening Post, received an Edgar Award from the Mystery Writers of America.

In general, the coracoid has a oval-shaped form with a prominent coracoid foramen through which the supracoracoid nerve passes and the glenoid is D-shaped. The bottom articulation is shortened and triangular, as well as directed to the bottom area rather than hooked from the rear to the bottom in a lateral as in many other hadrosauroids and not hadrosaurids. The scapula is very straight in a top view with its inner surface being flattened throughout most of the length. The scapular blade is not particularly elongated and is somewhat rounded at its end which seems to be a common trait in hadrosauroids except for Bactrosaurus. The proximal constriction, the area of the scapula lying between the proximal region and the distal blade, is very narrow; its breadth is about half the width of the proximal region. The putative acromion process is slightly tilted forwards. The deltoid ridge—a ridge-like structure on the humerus where the deltoid muscle is attached—is well developed and extends from the acromion process to the bottom edge of the scapular blade. The coracoid facet is concave and subrectangular shape. The glenoid is concave and more elongated than its width. The humerus is a relatively stocky and robust bone. Its main articular head is expanded from the inner side to the lateral one and proximally offset relative to its proximolateral corner. The deltopectoral crest—where the deltoid muscle was attached to the upper front of the humerus—is developed to the lower side from the upper half of the humerus, and its bottom extension has a total width diameter of the humeral shaft ratio of 1.67. The lateral border of the deltopectoral crest is very thick towards the bottom border. However, as a whole, this crest is relatively shortened in length. In cross-section, the humeral shaft is elliptical in shape and gently flattened to the lateral surface. A large tuberosity can be observed on the posterior surface of the humerus—about 1/3 the distance from the upper end. The lower end of the humerus is expanded to the lateral side forming the ulnar and radial condyles. The ulnar condyle is more wider and expanded than the radial one and these two condyles are separated by a shallow depression on the anterior and posterior surfaces of the lower end of the humerus. The radius is subcylindrical in shape with expanded upper and lower ends. The articulation surfaces of this bone with those of the ulna in AMNH FARB 30729 match perfectly, indicating that they represent the same individual. Both bottom and top surfaces in the radius are triangular and shape but the former is more flattened. The lower end is more expanded than the upper one and is also triangular in cross-section. Additionally, the articular lower surface of the radius is triangular and has striations. The ulna is shortened compared to other hadrosauroids. It is expanded at its upper and lower ends and the dorsal surface of the upper third shows a shallow depression that likely served as the attachment site for the upper end of the radius. The inner surface is very concave in shape. The middle and lower regions of the shaft change from wider to more expanded near the lower end of the ulna. The latter is nearly equal in thickness as the upper end. The lower fifth of the ulna has a flattened articular surface for the radius that faces from the inner to the top facets and shows elongated striations.\n\nParagraph 9: Kersh was drafted into the army during the Second World War, served in the Coldstream Guards and ended up writing for the Army Film Unit.

It is nonspore-forming, nonmotile, and the causative agent of tularemia, the pneumonic form of which is often lethal without treatment. It is a fastidious, facultative intracellular bacterium, which requires cysteine for growth. Due to its low infectious dose, ease of spread by aerosol, and high virulence, F. tularensis is classified as a Tier 1 Select Agent by the U.S. government, along with other potential agents of bioterrorism such as Yersinia pestis, Bacillus anthracis, and Ebola virus. When found in nature, Francisella tularensis can survive for several weeks at low temperatures in animal carcasses, soil, and water. In the laboratory, F. tularensis appears as small rods (0.2 by 0.2 µm), and is grown best at 35–37 °C.\n\nParagraph 11:  Shouta Date / Riser Glen  Shouta Date is a 2nd-year high-school student at Seitai High School. He is known to slack off from both schoolwork and kendo practice. He does not take most things as seriously as he should, and it does not really change throughout the series. Shouta, as is the first Justiriser to awaken on-screen upon facing the attack from the CyberKnights, and the first to summon GenSeiJuu Riseross. After becoming a Justiriser, he takes up the job of protecting humanity instantly, and begins to take his kendo practice more seriously… although not his schoolwork. He also happens to be a fan of boxing Champion Naoto Matsuzaka (Sazer Tawlon from the Gransazers) who helped him regain his own Justi Power and In Loader. Using Glen's In Loader, Shouta transforms into Riser Glen, the Justiriser that is formed by combination with 'Courage' in his body and uses the power of it. His red-colored suit's design is based on the Samurai from Japan's Warring States Period with his helmet having the Phoenix Motif. Glen's Justi Power specializes in close-range combat and harnesses Flame Energy in his attacks, including his punching move \"Blazing Knuckle\" and his aerial-kicking move \"Cross-Fire Kick\". Riser Glen's main weapon is the Katana Blade \"Glen Sword\", which can be unsheathed for better offensive capability and can be re-sheathed to charge up his Justi Power of Fire for his signature finisher, \"Raging Flame\", which releases a destructive wave of blazing slashes from his sword. He later picks up a more powerful finisher, \"Flash Blazer\" which is a backhand slash that releases a single wave of extremely powerful blazing slash to counter more powerful enemies. Later in the series, Shouta also becomes the vessel for the power of Shirogane with the use of Mio's Justi Spark. As Riser Shirogane, Shouta seems to be in control but does not act up like he does, even as Riser Glen. He has feelings for Yuka. He worries a lot for her safety, sacrificing his Justi Power to save Yuka's life when Zora fatally wounded her. But it took Naoto's guidance and the Justi Crystal gathering energy that resonated with Shouta's courage (the Justipower that powers Glen) to completely restore Shouta's Justiriser powers. Shouta also happens to work as a part-time Dispatch Rider like Tenma Kuudo (Sazer Tarious in Gransazers) does.", "answers": ["8"], "length": 3845, "dataset": "passage_count_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "7a8c90c196abc2d5f33e512e7308c47f229a59b8bda36158"}
{"input": "", "context": "Paragraph 1: Officers who survived a Forlorn Hope expected promotion especially if, like Gurwood, they had been mentioned in dispatches.  Gurwood was much too junior to be promoted within his own regiment and was made Captain in the Royal African Corps.  This was a decidedly inferior regiment and Gurwood tried to exchange into the 1st Regiment of Foot Guards.  This was not allowed, again because he was not senior enough, but he then obtained permission to make an exchange into the 9th Light Dragoons where he became brigade-major.  He returned to England to sort out his financial affairs now he was of age, was befriended by the Napier family, and was made ADC to Lord Charles Somerset who made him known to the Duke of York and presented him at Court.  Gurwood returned to the Peninsula in December 1812 and on 17 January 1813 acted as Esquire when Wellington knighted Sir Charles Stuart on the orders of the Prince Regent.  From this time he was frequently in Wellington's company.  He fought in the battle of Vitoria in June 1813 and was sent to keep order ih the town which was being subjected to extensive plundering and looting.  He and his brigade then took part in the long campaign up through Spain and France.\n\nParagraph 2: In fact Manilva has a very busy calendar of ferias and fiestas either religious, traditional or modern. Starting off with the Three Kings cavalcade on 5 January, then the raucous fun of Carnival around the beginning of Lent; the solemn devotion of the Semana Santa processions during Easter; the Manilva International Festival, around the end of May, during which the municipality's international community takes the opportunity to show off its varying culture, cuisine and traditions; Saint John's Eve during the Summer solstice with its pagan tradition of Bonfires of Saint John, fireworks and partying till dawn; the fishermen's celebration of their patron, the Virgen del Carmen in mid-July, and then rounding off the summer with the Vendimia, in the first weekend of September, a festival celebrating Manilva's grape harvest. Throw into that a good smattering of Saints’ days and pilgrimages and you've got a busy schedule of partying and celebrations.\n\nParagraph 3: John Row (c1525–1580), was a Scottish reformer, born around 1526 near Dunblane. He was educated at the Grammar School of Stirling and St Leonard's College, St Andrews, where he matriculated in 1544. After graduating with an M.A. he studied Canon Law and practised as an advocate in the Consistory Court of St Andrews. In 1550, he was appointed agent for the Scottish clergy at Rome, where he remained seven or eight years. He was awarded Licentiate of Laws (20 February 1556), and LL.D. Padua. The fame of his talents and learning led to his intimacy with Pope Paul IV and some of the cardinals, and would probably have led to his promotion ; but owing to ill-health he was compelled to return to Scotland, when he was appointed nuncio to investigate the causes of the Reformation and to devise means for checking its progress. He reached Eyemouth on 29 September 1558, but finding himself unable to fulfil his injunctions, returned to Rome before 11 May 1559. After a short residence there, he came back by persuasion of James, Prior of St Andrews, afterwards Earl of Moray, and having seen the falsehood and imposition of a pretended miracle at St Allaret's Chapel, Musselburgh, he joined the Reformers. He was admitted to Kennoway in April 1560, before the Reformation was fully established. John Row was one of six ministers appointed by the Lords of the Congregation for \"writing in a book their judgments touching the Reformation of religion.\" These appeared in the Confession of Faith and First Book of Discipline. He was translated to Perth (by consent of the General Congregation of Edinburgh) 17 July, and admitted before 20 December 1560. He was appointed by the General Assembly, 10 July 1568, to visit Galloway. He was styled Commissioner of Nithsdale and Galloway, March 1570 and elected Moderator of the General Assembly 21 July and 25 December 1567, 24 April 1576, and 11 June 1578. He died on 16 October 1580, at which time he held the vicarages of Twynholm and Terregles in Galloway. He was regarded as \"a cautious and prudent reformer, of moderate views, benevolent disposition, and amiable and winning manners, a wise and grave father, of good literature according to the time.\" He was skilled in the original languages of Scripture, and did much towards building up the Reformed Church in Scotland. He was married in 1560 to Margaret, second daughter of John Beaton of Balfour.\n\nParagraph 4: During the early eighteenth century, a building contractor had far more responsibilities than the title suggests today. A contractor often designed, built, and oversaw all details of construction to completion. Architects, often called surveyors, were employed only for the grandest and largest of buildings. By 1730, Brettingham is referred to as a surveyor, working on more important structures than cottages and agricultural buildings. In 1731, it is recorded that he was paid £112 (£ in ) for his work on Norwich Gaol. From then, he appears to have worked regularly as the surveyor to the Justices (the contemporary local authority) on public buildings and bridges throughout the 1740s. Projects of his dating from this time include the remodelling of the Shirehouse in Norwich, the construction of Lenwade Bridge over the river Wensum, repairs to Norwich Castle and Norwich Cathedral, as well as the rebuilding of much of St. Margaret's Church, King's Lynn, which had been severely damaged by the collapse of its spire in 1742. His work on the Shirehouse, which was in the gothic style and showed a versatility of design rare for Brettingham, was to result in a protracted court case that was to rumble on through a large part of his life, with allegations of financial discrepancies. In 1755, the case was eventually closed, and Brettingham was left several hundred pounds out of pocket—several tens of thousands, in present-day terms—and with a stain—if only a local one—on his character. Transcripts of the case suggest that it was Brettingham's brother Robert, to whom he had subcontracted and who was responsible for the flint stonework of the Shirehouse, who may have been the cause of the allegations. Brettingham's brief flirtation with the Gothic style, in the words of Robin Lucas, indicates \"the approach of an engineer rather than an antiquary\" and is \"now seen as outlandish\". The Shirehouse was demolished in 1822.\n\nParagraph 5: In fact Manilva has a very busy calendar of ferias and fiestas either religious, traditional or modern.

By the end of September Vale were performing well on the pitch, and off it had sold the main car park to The Co-operative Group for £30,000. Goals were at a premium despite a 4–3 win over York City and 4–4 draw with Aston Villa at Vale Park. Sporadic violence continued to break out at many matches, as local businesses had their windows smashed, local residents were menaced and fights broke out.

The next month Lee brought Ray Harford from Mansfield Town for a £5,000 fee, as well as Keith Lindsey from Southend United for 'a small fee'. Vale comfortable in the league, Chairman Graham Bourne resigned in January, along with colleague and fellow director George Sanders. This left the Board of Directors with just two members, one of which, previous chairman Mark Singer, was re-elected as Chairman. The Sentinel'''s Chris Harper stated that \"Vale will never make progress while they are plagued by trouble at the top\". The team continued with good home form, but invariably lost away from Vale Park. On 16 February, Sammy Morgan scored on his debut for Northern Ireland, and picked up six further caps whilst at the club. On 4 March, only 2,809 bothered to turn out for a 1–0 home win over Mansfield Town in strong wind and snow, whilst rivals Stoke City won the 1972 League Cup Final in front of a crowd of nearly 100,000 at Wembley Stadium. Vale went on to go ten games without a win, also scoring just one goal in a run of seven games, to the frustration of their supporters. Despite this, the now annual 'Meet the Manager' evening 'warmed the heart' of Lee. A 1–0 win over Barnsley at the end of April ensured the club's safety from the drop. On 8 May, Sproson made his farewell competitive appearance for the club in front of only 2,743 supporters, in a 2–1 defeat to Rotherham United. Lee angrily declared that \"the attendance was nothing short of a disgrace to mark the end of a legend\". Four days later there was an even smaller turnout for a final day 1–1 draw with Rochdale.\n\nParagraph 7: The season opened with a 1–1 draw with Brighton & Hove Albion in front of just 4,384 fans, causing Lee to warn that such low attendances would require him to sell off the club's best players.

On 11 November 2017, Alexander resigned from parliament after conceding that he was likely a dual citizen, necessitating a by-election in Bennelong. He renounced his UK citizenship and stood as the Liberal Party candidate at the by-election, held on 16 December 2017. During his campaigning, a YouTube video of Alexander in the 1990s, uploaded in 2011, was resurfaced in the media. The video displays Alexander telling racist jokes at an end of year party with film crew from the 1990s TV show Gladiators. Once the video was shared with the ABC, Alexander immediately released a written statement that described how the jokes were \"completely unacceptable\". Alexander elaborated: \"There is no place for jokes about violence against women. Again, I apologise unreservedly\". Then Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, praised Alexander's claims, saying his apology was \"a measure of the man [...] Not all disrespect of women ends up in violence against women but that's where all violence against women begins, so all of us need to reflect on that. John has done so.\" Alexander's high profile opponent in the by-election, Kristina Keneally, appeared with then opposition leader Bill Shorten in Eastwood to respond to the incident. Shorten said that \"The comments are crass, they're wrong, they're stupid, and the apology is 22 years too late\". At a press conference, Mr Shorten denied allegations that Labor had deliberately sourced the video in an attempt to bait Alexander during the campaign. Despite this setback, Alexander was safely re-elected, despite suffering a 4.84% two party preferred swing against him to Keneally and Labor. This reduced the Liberal Party's hold in Bennelong from 9.72% to 4.88%, making the seat marginal and at its most vulnerable position for the Coalition since John Howard's reliance on preference votes in 2004 to hold the seat by 4.33%.\n\nParagraph 9: Officers who survived a Forlorn Hope expected promotion especially if, like Gurwood, they had been mentioned in dispatches.  Gurwood was much too junior to be promoted within his own regiment and was made Captain in the Royal African Corps.  This was a decidedly inferior regiment and Gurwood tried to exchange into the 1st Regiment of Foot Guards.  This was not allowed, again because he was not senior enough, but he then obtained permission to make an exchange into the 9th Light Dragoons where he became brigade-major.  He returned to England to sort out his financial affairs now he was of age, was befriended by the Napier family, and was made ADC to Lord Charles Somerset who made him known to the Duke of York and presented him at Court.  Gurwood returned to the Peninsula in December 1812 and on 17 January 1813 acted as Esquire when Wellington knighted Sir Charles Stuart on the orders of the Prince Regent.  From this time he was frequently in Wellington's company.  He fought in the battle of Vitoria in June 1813 and was sent to keep order ih the town which was being subjected to extensive plundering and looting.  He and his brigade then took part in the long campaign up through Spain and France.\n\nParagraph 10: In fact Manilva has a very busy calendar of ferias and fiestas either religious, traditional or modern. Starting off with the Three Kings cavalcade on 5 January, then the raucous fun of Carnival around the beginning of Lent; the solemn devotion of the Semana Santa processions during Easter; the Manilva International Festival, around the end of May, during which the municipality's international community takes the opportunity to show off its varying culture, cuisine and traditions; Saint John's Eve during the Summer solstice with its pagan tradition of Bonfires of Saint John, fireworks and partying till dawn; the fishermen's celebration of their patron, the Virgen del Carmen in mid-July, and then rounding off the summer with the Vendimia, in the first weekend of September, a festival celebrating Manilva's grape harvest. Throw into that a good smattering of Saints’ days and pilgrimages and you've got a busy schedule of partying and celebrations.\n\nParagraph 11: The season opened with a 1–1 draw with Brighton & Hove Albion in front of just 4,384 fans, causing Lee to warn that such low attendances would require him to sell off the club's best players.

Believing that the situation called for people who were credible to both the prison population as well as to people involved with and observing the situation from outside the prison, he joined Tom Wicker and John Dunne, among others, in entering the prison to hear the inmates' demands. Eve was the first mediator to arrive at the scene of the rebellion. He was the first elected official to enter the prison yard following the riot in which 42 prisoners were taken, and he led the September 11 tour by the requested visitors to the seized Cellblock D as well as other areas of the prison. The prisoners requested direct communication with the Commissioner of Corrections, Russell G. Oswald, and that specific individuals hear their demands, naming Louis Farrakhan, Huey Newton, and William Kunstler; Kunstler eventually agreed to serve as their legal counsel.  The primary prisoner demand was that, upon surrendering control of the prison back to the guards, they not be beaten. Farrakhan refused to attend to the situation in person, however, which Eve felt was a turning point in the negotiations.  Eve has expressed the belief that Governor Rockefeller was responsible for the massacre that subsequently occurred in the prison, and that Rockefeller made a deliberate decision to escalate the conflict knowing that there would likely be some loss of life. After negotiations stalled over a demand for amnesty, a rescue operation saved 29 hostages and led to 10 inmate deaths.  Eve was critical of Rockefeller's decision to not come observe the prison and the negotiations but rather pursue tactical measures: \"I think Governor Rockefeller ought to be indicted.\"  In the 1992 Attica civil-liability trial, Eve testified on behalf of the inmates. In March 2001, then New York Governor George Pataki appointed Eve to the Attica Task Force that met with families of Attica prison employees who survived the 1971 uprising and negotiated reparations.\n\nParagraph 8: Bioethanol plants and sugarcane mills are well-established processes where the biorefinery concept can be implemented since sugarcane bagasse is a feasible feedstock to produce fuels and chemicals; lignocellulosic bioethanol (2G) is produced in Brazil in two plants with capacities of 40 and 84 Ml/y (about 0.4% of the production capacity in Brazil). TEA of ethanol production using mild liquefaction of bagasse plus simultaneous saccharification and co-fermentation shows a minimum selling price between 50.38 and 62.72 US cents/L which is comparable with the market price. The production of xylitol, citric acid and glutamic acid from sugarcane lignocellulose (bagasse and harvesting residues), each in combination with electricity have been evaluated; the three biorefinery systems were simulated to be annexed to an existing sugar mill in South Africa. The production of xylitol and glutamic acid has shown economic feasibility with an Internal Rate of Return (IRR) of 12.3% and 31.5%, exceeding the IRR of the base case (10.3%). Likewise, the production of ethanol, lactic acid or methanol and ethanol-lactic acid from sugarcane bagasse have been studied; lactic acid demonstrated to be economically attractive by showing the greatest net present value (M$476–1278); in the same way; the production of ethanol and lactic acid as co-product was found to be a favorable scenario (net present value between M$165 and M$718) since this acid has applications in the pharmaceutical, cosmetic, chemical and food industry.\n\nParagraph 9: On July 25, 2010, it was announced that Toyota would make her first wrestling appearance in the United States, wrestling for the Chikara promotion in September.

Spessivsteva had had a series of successes with Lifar at the Paris Opera Ballet (Promethee, Giselle) and had unrequited feelings for him.  In his book The Three Graces: Anna Pavlova, Tamara Karsavina, Olga Spessivtseva (1959) Lifar describes how their personal situation came to a head during rehearsals.  \"The two heroines of this ballet were named Natasha and Olga.  I have already mentioned the friendship which had sprung up at this time between Natasha P... [Natalie Paley] and myself.  It was, therefore, perhaps a little cruel to give these two names, Natasha and Olga, to the heroines.  Be that as it may, the role of Olga was allotted to Spessivtseva, while the male part, Serge, was to be interpreted by me.  The crisis came when, at one of the rehearsals, Spessivtseva suddenly realized that it was with Natasha ... that in pursuance of the plot, I was to find happiness, whereas the leading, and, from the choreographic point of view, the most important role had been allotted to her, Olga!   This crisis, as always with her, developed with the speed of lightning.  Just as I had announced at rehearsal, that this was where my pas de deux tendre with Natasha would begin, Spessivtseva all of a sudden made a dash for the window.  In one bound I reached her, but, by that time she was already through it.  I just managed to clutch her arm.  My pianist, Leonide Gontcharov, who was hard on my heels, sprang to my assistance.  Olga hung there, suspended from our arms, thirty feet above the Place Charles-Garnier.  With great difficulty we managed to drag her back.

{"input": "", "context": "Paragraph 1: Basing citizenship off specific enrollment rolls, like the Dawes Roll (that were taken after more than 80 years after Removal, after the Civil War, and after tribal government restructuring), is what scholar Fay A.

Author Robert J. Conley has stated that if a tribe like the Cherokee Nation are \"really serious about exercising its sovereignty and determining its membership,\" then it should not use the roll that \"was put together by the U.S. government and then closed by the U.S. government,\" meaning that a tribal nation is still subject to the settler definitions of its members when other outside nations do not require rolls, ethnicity, race, or blood quantum for citizenship, but rather birth location and descendance.\n\nParagraph 2: In June 1744, at the outbreak of King George's War, he was appointed to a committee of 3 by Massachusetts Governor William Shirley (along with John Leonard and his cousin John Stoddard) to oversee the construction of a line of military forts along the western frontier of the Colonies to defend against the French. In 1754 he represented Massachusetts in the first American Congress which was convened at Albany, New York.  Congress ultimately passed Benjamin Franklin’s plan for colonial union. Upon his return to Massachusetts from New York he was commissioned a Colonel and succeeded his uncle Israel Williams in command of Britain's provincial forces on the Western frontier. In 1765 with Samuel Adams, James Otis Jr. and Timothy Ruggles, he was called to represent Massachusetts at the Stamp Act Congress in New York, which resulted in the first official American opposition to British policy. Partridge signed the Declaration of Rights and Grievances to HM King George III and Parliament in which the American Congress respectfully explained their reasons for their opposition to the Act. The Declaration emphasized the colonists' rights as natural born Englishmen with all of the rights and liberties pertaining thereto including the right to trial by jury and representation in matters of taxation. The Stamp Act Congress and its Declaration of Rights eventually resulted in the Stamp Act's repeal in March 1766. It also led the colonists to focus on the idea of constitutional limitations on parliamentary authority, a concept that contributed to the American Revolution. While Partridge was in favor of Benjamin Franklin's proposed colonial union (later the United States) and publicly defended the colonists' English liberties, when he later received a letter from revolutionary leaders in Boston in 1775 as to whether he would take up arms against the mother country he replied that he feared such action might bring the country more harm than good. As matters progressed he reconciled himself to the inevitability of separation from the Britain, and resumed his legal duties as an American patriot. Such was the respect in which he was held by his countrymen that his revolutionary neighbors in the meantime did not molest his person or property during the American Revolutionary War, and in 1780 and 1781 he was again appointed selectman for Hatfield, Massachusetts. His descendants remained active in America politics. His son William Partridge supported the career of his brother-in-law the Hon. Barnabas Bidwell who clerked under his cousin the Hon. Theodore Sedgwick (former Speaker of the House in the George Washington administration) and was elected a Massachusetts Congressman, Senator, Attorney General and U.S. Congressman and administration spokesman for President Thomas Jefferson. Oliver Partridge's great granddaughter Emily Partridge married Utah Governor Brigham Young of the Richards-Young family and his great great grandson Edward Partridge Jr. was a Utah representative and delegate to the Utah Constitutional Convention of 1895.\n\nParagraph 3: A body lift is a modification where spacers are installed between a vehicle's body and chassis in order to increase the ride height.

{"input": "", "context": "Paragraph 1: Marie is increasingly enthralled by Dante (\"When You Look At a Man\"), who arrogantly tells of his gifts on the sea (\"The Storm\"). His ship has been taken off course during a storm while delivering fruit, which has spoiled due to the lost time. He is trying to get the money he and his crew are owed, which Marie offers to get for him. She reveals her magic and how, like her mother, she helps those who ask her for her services (\"C'est L'Amour\" / \"To Find a Lover\"). Dante is skeptical of magic, and tells her of his travels (\"Nothing Beats Chicago\"). Marie has never left New Orleans and wishes to explore the world. In a rare moment of vulnerability, Dante reveals the loneliness of life at sea, although when he is on land, he hears the ocean calling to him (\"Ocean Is Different\"). To cover up his inner feelings, Dante tells Marie of his sexual exploits, and as they dance, he seduces her and they make love in the park (\"Danced With a Girl\").  Lisette attempts to find Marie (\"Tout Mi Mi\") and Marie realizes Dante is her way out of her confining life. Her mother appears to warn her of the dangers of giving into her passions (\"Miracles and Mysteries\"). Lisette discovers Marie and Dante together (\"Tout Mi Mi (Reprise)\") and Marie sharply orders her away. Marie invites Dante to live in her guest house while her brothers are away and Dante reveals that he can no longer hear the ocean calling to him as he has fallen in love with Marie (\"I Don't Hear the Ocean\").\n\nParagraph 2: He was the oldest of three gifted brothers—the others being the aeronautical engineer Theodore Paul Wright and the political scientist Quincy Wright. From an early age Wright had a love and talent for mathematics and biology. Wright attended Galesburg High School and graduated in 1906. He then enrolled in Lombard College where his father taught, to study mathematics. He was influenced greatly by Professor Wilhelmine Key, one of the first women to receive a Ph.D. in biology. Wright received his Ph.D. from Harvard University, where he worked at the Bussey Institute with the pioneering mammalian geneticist William Ernest Castle investigating the inheritance of coat colors in mammals. He worked for the U.S. Department of Agriculture until 1925, when he joined the Department of Zoology at the University of Chicago. He remained there until his retirement in 1955, when he moved to the University of Wisconsin–Madison. He received many honors in his long career, including the National Medal of Science (1966), the Balzan Prize (1984), and the Darwin Medal of the Royal Society (1980). He was a member of the National Academy of Sciences and a Foreign Member of the Royal Society. The American Mathematical Society selected him as the Josiah Willards Gibbs lecturer for 1941. For his work on genetics of evolutionary processes, Wright was awarded the Daniel Giraud Elliot Medal from the National Academy of Sciences in 1945.\n\nParagraph 3: In summer 1993 a new club was admitted to Serie D, as F.B.C. Treviso 1993. The club experienced a remarkable line of three consecutive promotions from 1994 to 1997 under coach Giuseppe Pillon which brought Treviso to Serie B, over 40 years after its last appearance in the second-highest Italian league. Treviso was relegated to Serie C1 in 2001, but returned to Serie B in 2003. In 2005, Pillon returned to Treviso and the team gained a respectable fifth place and a spot in the promotion playoffs but lost out to Perugia. However, in August 2005, after both Genoa and Torino were relegated out of Serie A, respectively for fraud and financial troubles, Treviso and Ascoli were arbitrarily promoted in Serie A as replacements.\n\nParagraph 4: In summer 1993 a new club was admitted to Serie D, as F.B.C.

It is a chemistry where most reactions are controlled by complex proteins called enzymes and are moderated and limited by hormones. The chemistry is always highly complex and is still not fully understood. Decomposition of organic material is also within the scope of biochemistry although in this case it is the growth and activity of fungi, bacteria and other micro-organisms that is involved. Typical types of change include the processes involved in photosynthesis, a process in which carbon dioxide and water are changed into sugars and oxygen by plants, digestion in which energy rich materials are used by organisms to grow and move, the Krebs cycle which liberates energy from stored reserves, protein synthesis which enables organisms to grow using processes controlled by RNA, etc.\n\nParagraph 6: The full ATLAS concept consists of eight 50-centimeter diameter f/2 Wright-Schmidt telescopes, spread over the globe for full-night-sky and 24h/24h coverage, and each fitted with a 110 Megapixel CCD array camera. The current system consists of four such telescopes:  ATLAS1 and ATLAS2 operate 160 km apart on the Haleakala and Mauna Loa volcanoes in the Hawaiian Islands, the third telescope is at the South African Astronomical Observatory and the fourth in Chile. These telescopes are notable for their large 7.4° field of view — about 15 times the diameter of the full moon — of which their 10 500 × 10 500 CCD camera images the central 5.4° × 5.4°. This system can image the whole night sky visible from a single location with about 1000 separate telescope pointings. At 30 seconds per exposure plus 10 seconds for simultaneously reading out the camera and repointing the telescope, each ATLAS unit can therefore scan the whole visible sky a little over once each night, with a median completeness limit at apparent magnitude 19. Since the mission of ATLAS is to identify moving objects, each telescope actually observes one quarter of the sky four times in a night at approximately 15-minute intervals. In perfect conditions, the four telescopes together can therefore observe the full night sky every night, but bad weather at one or the other site, occasional technical problems, and even the odd volcanic eruption of Mauna Loa, all reduce the effective coverage rate. The four exposures by a telescope allow to automatically link multiple observations of an asteroid into a preliminary orbit, with some robustness to the loss of one observation to overlap between the asteroid and a bright star, and to then predict its approximate position on subsequent nights for follow-up. Apparent magnitude 19 is classified as \"respectably but not extremely faint\", and is approximately 100 000 times too faint to be seen with a naked eye from a very dark location. It is equivalent to the light of a match flame in New York viewed from San Francisco. ATLAS therefore scans the visible sky in much less depth, but much more quickly, than larger surveying telescope arrays such as University of Hawaii's Pan-STARRS. Pan-STARRS goes approximately 100 times deeper, but needs weeks instead of a quarter of a night to scan the whole sky just once. This makes ATLAS better suited to finding small asteroids which can only be seen during the just few days that they brighten dramatically when they happen to pass very close to the Earth.\n\nParagraph 7: He was the oldest of three gifted brothers—the others being the aeronautical engineer Theodore Paul Wright and the political scientist Quincy Wright.

The Kingdom of Waalo was ruled by the Mbooj paternal family who went by the royal title Brak (title for the kings of Waalo). As well as this patrilineal mode of succession, a Brak had to belong to one of the main three royal matriclans before being eligible to succeed to the throne. These three maternal clans were the reigning maternal dynasties of Waalo and included: the Joos Maternal Dynasty (of Serer origin), Tedyek (of Fula origin although other sources suggests a Mende origin) and Loggar (of Moor origin). In Wolof, matriclans are called meen or mène, in Serer, they are called tim.  Succession was patrilineal (kurcala in Serer, meaning paternal inheritance or simanGol meaning paternal lineage) as well as matrilineal (ƭeen yaay or den yaay in Serer). Lingeer Ndoye Demba (princess of Sine) was given in marriage to the king of Waalo (Brak Caaka Mbooj) when he visited the Sine. The royal wedding took place in Sine, and after the marriage, the princess accompanied her husband to his country (Waalo). The Joos Maternal Dynasty although long established in Sine, and just one of the many Serer matriclans, it was the newest addition to the medieval maternal dynasties of Waalo. The other maternal dynasties of Waalo (Tedyek and Loggar) were already established.  The mother of Brak Caaka Mbodj was a Loggar and his first wife (Lingeer Isa Tanor) a Tedyek. Isa Tanor descended from the maternal line of Guet May Beut (the matriarch of the Tedyeks). For the next six hundred years since its foundation to the dissolution of Waalo in 1855, royal princes from these three maternal dynasties engaged in dynastic civil wars in order to secure their succession to the throne. In the 18th century, the prince Mö Mbôdy Kumba Khedy Mbooj (later – Brak Mö Mbôdy Kumba Khedy Mbooj, reigned c. 1734 – 1735, according to Amadou Wade), who was then the head of the Joos Dynasty galvanised the support of his maternal clan and led a massacre of the other maternal dynasties of Waalo, particularly the Tedyeks, the biggest rivals to the Joos. Many prominent members of the Tedyek clan were killed by the Joos including the reigning king at the time Brak Yerim Ndateh Boubou (Tedyek),  as well as his family. This historical event precipitated the Battle of Nder more commonly referred to as Talaata-i-Ndeer by the Senegambian people. The phrase \"Talaata-i-Ndeer\"  (or Talaata i Ndeer / Nder) means \"Tuesday of Ndeer\", signifying the fact the event took place on a Tuesday at the then capital of Waalo (Ndeer or Nder).\n\nParagraph 9: The penetration of the Joos matriclan of Sine in the Wolof Kingdom of Waalo came via Lingeer Ndoye Demba.

These three maternal clans were the reigning maternal dynasties of Waalo and included: the Joos Maternal Dynasty (of Serer origin), Tedyek (of Fula origin although other sources suggests a Mende origin) and Loggar (of Moor origin). In Wolof, matriclans are called meen or mène, in Serer, they are called tim.  Succession was patrilineal (kurcala in Serer, meaning paternal inheritance or simanGol meaning paternal lineage) as well as matrilineal (ƭeen yaay or den yaay in Serer). Lingeer Ndoye Demba (princess of Sine) was given in marriage to the king of Waalo (Brak Caaka Mbooj) when he visited the Sine. The royal wedding took place in Sine, and after the marriage, the princess accompanied her husband to his country (Waalo). The Joos Maternal Dynasty although long established in Sine, and just one of the many Serer matriclans, it was the newest addition to the medieval maternal dynasties of Waalo. The other maternal dynasties of Waalo (Tedyek and Loggar) were already established.  The mother of Brak Caaka Mbodj was a Loggar and his first wife (Lingeer Isa Tanor) a Tedyek. Isa Tanor descended from the maternal line of Guet May Beut (the matriarch of the Tedyeks). For the next six hundred years since its foundation to the dissolution of Waalo in 1855, royal princes from these three maternal dynasties engaged in dynastic civil wars in order to secure their succession to the throne. In the 18th century, the prince Mö Mbôdy Kumba Khedy Mbooj (later – Brak Mö Mbôdy Kumba Khedy Mbooj, reigned c. 1734 – 1735, according to Amadou Wade), who was then the head of the Joos Dynasty galvanised the support of his maternal clan and led a massacre of the other maternal dynasties of Waalo, particularly the Tedyeks, the biggest rivals to the Joos. Many prominent members of the Tedyek clan were killed by the Joos including the reigning king at the time Brak Yerim Ndateh Boubou (Tedyek),  as well as his family. This historical event precipitated the Battle of Nder more commonly referred to as Talaata-i-Ndeer by the Senegambian people. The phrase \"Talaata-i-Ndeer\"  (or Talaata i Ndeer / Nder) means \"Tuesday of Ndeer\", signifying the fact the event took place on a Tuesday at the then capital of Waalo (Ndeer or Nder).\n\nParagraph 10: Biochemistry deals with the chemistry of the growth and activity of living organisms. It is a chemistry where most reactions are controlled by complex proteins called enzymes and are moderated and limited by hormones. The chemistry is always highly complex and is still not fully understood. Decomposition of organic material is also within the scope of biochemistry although in this case it is the growth and activity of fungi, bacteria and other micro-organisms that is involved. Typical types of change include the processes involved in photosynthesis, a process in which carbon dioxide and water are changed into sugars and oxygen by plants, digestion in which energy rich materials are used by organisms to grow and move, the Krebs cycle which liberates energy from stored reserves, protein synthesis which enables organisms to grow using processes controlled by RNA, etc.\n\nParagraph 11: The penetration of the Joos matriclan of Sine in the Wolof Kingdom of Waalo came via Lingeer Ndoye Demba.

From an early age Wright had a love and talent for mathematics and biology. Wright attended Galesburg High School and graduated in 1906. He then enrolled in Lombard College where his father taught, to study mathematics. He was influenced greatly by Professor Wilhelmine Key, one of the first women to receive a Ph.D. in biology. Wright received his Ph.D. from Harvard University, where he worked at the Bussey Institute with the pioneering mammalian geneticist William Ernest Castle investigating the inheritance of coat colors in mammals. He worked for the U.S. Department of Agriculture until 1925, when he joined the Department of Zoology at the University of Chicago. He remained there until his retirement in 1955, when he moved to the University of Wisconsin–Madison. He received many honors in his long career, including the National Medal of Science (1966), the Balzan Prize (1984), and the Darwin Medal of the Royal Society (1980). He was a member of the National Academy of Sciences and a Foreign Member of the Royal Society. The American Mathematical Society selected him as the Josiah Willards Gibbs lecturer for 1941. For his work on genetics of evolutionary processes, Wright was awarded the Daniel Giraud Elliot Medal from the National Academy of Sciences in 1945.", "answers": ["6"], "length": 3262, "dataset": "passage_count_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "6e76455fc56cd6f7caac93703e8a2e1d2e56277099188e37"}

He also assembled text and executed many beautiful watercolour drawings for a Flora Hibernica, sadly never finished, and kept a detailed journal during the years 1806–1825 (both now in the Ulster Museum, Belfast). Of the 12000 algal specimens in the Ulster Museum Herbarium about 148 are in the Templeton collection and were mostly collected by him, some were collected by others and passed to Templeton. The specimens in the Templeton collection in the Ulster Museum (BEL) have been catalogued. Those noted in 1967 were numbered: F1 – F48. Others were in The Queen's University Belfast.

He finished in the points in his first race as a works driver. While letting his teammate pass during qualifying for the Race of Morocco, Hernández clashed with fellow BMW driver Andy Priaulx and finished the session nineteenth. Hernández retired from race two on the opening lap and his stranded car brought out the safety car. After qualifying for the Race of France, he was one of seven drivers who had their times from Q2 deleted for exceeding the engine rev limit on theirs cars. He finished fifth in race one but a collision with Porteiro on the first lap put Hernández out of the race and his BMW 320si caught fire, Porteiro was issued with a drive–through penalty for his involvement. He started on pole position for the reversed grid race at the Race of Spain but dropped down to sixth by the end of the race. Hernández took his first overall WTCC victory in race two of the Race of the Czech Republic, having started on the second row and passed pole sitter Yvan Muller on the third lap. Race one of the Race of Portugal saw Hernandez and the Lada of Jaap van Lagen, who started 17th and 18th respectively tangle after the rolling start, pitching Hernandez in the concrete barrier. He was subsequently taken to hospital for checks on his ankle and was unable to start race two. Contact from SEAT Sport driver Jordi Gené during race two of the Race of Italy spun Hernández and dropped him down the order and he eventually finished eleventh. He finished the season eleventh in the drivers' championship as the fourth best BMW factory driver and one place ahead of his teammate. In December 2009, BMW announced it was to reduce its involvement in the WTCC from five cars to two. ROAL Motorsport would no longer be involved with the German manufacturer, leaving Hernández to find a seat himself for 2010.\n\nParagraph 3: Months later, Mick calls Irene to try and let her know that he is up for parole from the psychiatric hospital, but she refuses to listen to him.

Mick begs Irene to help him get out, but she decides she cannot support him. Mick is later granted parole. Irene visits him at a halfway house, where she discovers he has been attacked. She moves him to a motel in the Bay. While out walking, Mick comes across Maggie Astoni (Kestie Morassi) attempting to change a flat tyre. He helps her out and she invites him back to her house, where Olivia sees him and reveals that Mick is a rapist. Maggie's husband Ben Astoni (Rohan Nichol) throws him out.

The land was purchased by one of the colonists, Matthäus Frank, from the Arabs of Beit Safafa. The Templers were Christians who broke away from the Protestant church and encouraged their members to settle in the Holy Land to prepare for Messianic salvation. They built their homes in the style to which they were accustomed in Germany - farmhouses of one or two stories, with slanting tiled roofs and shuttered windows, but using local materials such as Jerusalem stone instead of wood and bricks. The colonists engaged in agriculture and traditional trades such as carpentry and blacksmithing. Their homes ran along  two parallel streets that would become Emek Refaim and Bethlehem Road. Friedrich (Fritz) Kübler, a German-born butcher, settled in the Germany Colony in 1870. He raised livestock there and built a slaughterhouse on his property. His son took over  the meat business after the father's death and became one of the largest meat suppliers in Jerusalem. His clients were hotels, monasteries, hostels and hospitals. An apartment in the Kübler house,  on Adolphe Cremieux Street, which still has a water trough in the yard, was purchased by former Prime Minister of Israel, Ehud Olmert.       \n\nParagraph 9: The invaluable local history series, known as the 'Hewitt Histories,' written by H.W Hewitt (former historian and contributor to former Dartmouth newspaper, the 'Dartmouth Patriot') help to paint an even earlier historical portrait of the area. In particular, early recreational activity at Cow Bay, features within, 'Hewitt History No.14 [15]: How the Mosers Came into Possession of the Beach – Story of a Wreck' (April 10, 1901). It states that the history of Cow Bay as a beachside destination began 'about thirty five years,' before his time of writing, by Colonel Dawson and Colonel Sinclair, marking the year of its 'founding,' as such, to be approximately 1866. Hewitt writes: 'The history of Cow Bay as a summer resort began about 35 or 40 years ago. Some of the first to go to Cow Bay for pleasure were Colonel Dawson and his son-in-law, Colonel [Sinclair]. They used to have rooms in the house of Daniel Moser, Sr. Colonel Barnaby also rented rooms a few years after. From that time on more and more persons began to come regularly to Cow Bay, so I will say nothing of any except the first two mentioned. Colonel Dawson was a very tall and corpulent man. He served for a short time in the Crimean war. He was very wealthy, and on his return from the Crimea he left England and cam[e] to Dartmouth. […] His son-in-law, Colonel [Sinclair] , of the 42nd Regiment, known commonly as the Black Watch Regiment, did not care to leave his wife; so, when the war broke out he sold his commission and came to Dartmouth […] Colonel Dawson and [Sinclair]. Colonel Dawson took a fancy to Cow Bay. He thought that the island in Cow Bay Lake, being completely surrounded by water, belonged to nobody. He camped on the island, and thought it his own. He had a folding canvas canoe and a sailboat, which he used frequently on the lake and outside the beach. He used to put an awning over the boat and sleep in her. To make a long story short both Dawson and [Sinclair] left Dartmouth and Cow Bay about 35 years ago.'\n\nParagraph 10: John Templeton's interest in botany began with this experimental garden laid out according to a suggestion in Rousseau's 'Nouvelle Heloise' and following Rousseau's 'Letters on the Elements of Botany Here he cultivated many tender exotics out of doors (a list provided by Nelson  and began botanical studies which lasted throughout his life and corresponded with the most eminent botanists in England Sir William Hooker, William Turner, James Sowerby and, especially Sir Joseph Banks, who had travelled on Captain James Cook's voyages, and in charge of Kew Gardens.

{"input": "", "context": "Paragraph 1: Sabhāpati originally seems to have been on good terms with members of the Theosophical Society, as he is cited favorably in their works and periodical journals. However, he lost their favor after a misunderstanding over a vision in which he claimed to have been caught up to Lake Manasarovara in modern Tibet to commune with Mahādeva on Mount Kailāśa. The vision, which he communicated as happening in his physical body, is reminiscent of Kālidāsa's classical Sanskrit poem \"Meghadūta,\" in which a cloud-messenger travels in the air to Mount Kailāśa to send a message on behalf of a lonely yakṣa to his lover. In any event, the Theosophists seem to have taken it literally — Henry Olcott (1832-1907) records in his diaries that both he and H.P. Blavatsky (1831-1891) were disenchanted with Sabhāpati after they met with him personally and he recounted his vision to them in terms of a physical experience. Olcott writes:Whatever good opinion we may have formed of him before was spoilt by a yarn he told us of his exploits as a Yog. He had, he said, been taken up at Lake Mânsarovara, Tibet, high into the air and been transported two hundred miles along the high level to Mount Kailâs, where he saw Mahadeva! Ingenuous foreigners as H.P.B. and I may have been, we could not digest such a ridiculous falsehood as that. I told him so very plainly. If, I said, he had told us that he had gone anywhere he liked in astral body or clairvoyant vision, we might have believed it possible, but in physical body, from Lake Mânsarovara, in company with two Rishis mentioned in the Mahabharata, and to the non-physical Mount Kailâs—thanks, no: he should tell it to somebody else.A response to this negative view can be traced in later editions of Śrī Sabhāpati Swami's works. For example, the 1895 reprint to OM adds the following footnote (presumably written by Vasu) in the part of Sabhāpati's account that mentions this vision: \"This need not have been in the physical body of the Rishis; they might have flown towards the holy mountain in their Mayavi Rupa Kama Rupa (astral body), which to our author (who certainly is not an Adept in the sense the Theosophists use the word) must have been as real as if he had travelled through air in his physical body.\" In any event, either from this misunderstanding or from other issues the Theosophical Society subsequently abandoned the support it may have had previously for Sabhāpati and his works.\n\nParagraph 2: Rufous woodpeckers forage in pairs on ant nests on trees, fallen logs, dung heaps, ant, and termite hills. They have been noted to feed on ants of the genera Crematogaster and Oecophylla. Apart from insects, it has been seen taking nectar from flowers of Bombax and Erythrina and taking sap from the bases of banana fronds. The most common call is a sharp nasal, three-note, keenk-keenk-keenk but they have other calls including a long wicka and a series of wick-wick notes. They also have a distinctive drumming note which starts rapidly and then slows down in tempo. Drumming occurs through the year but increases in frequency in winter in southern India and peaking around March–April in Nepal. A display of unknown function between two birds facing each other involved swaying the head with bill held high and tail splayed. The breeding season is in the pre-Monsoon dry period from February to June. The rufous woodpecker is most well known for building its nest within the nest of acrobat ants (Crematogaster). Both the male and female take part in the excavation of the nest. Their feathers, particularly when nesting are said to be covered in a dark and smelly sticky fluid on which dead ants are often found sticking. Two white, matt, thin-shelled, translucent eggs are laid. The incubation period is 12 to 14 days. Both parents feed the young at nest although a 19th-century observer reported that his Indian field assistants who called the bird \"lal sutar\", meaning red carpenter, believed that the adults left the young to obtain ants to feed themselves. The moult occurs mainly from September to November. Bird lice of the species Penenirmus auritus have been recorded from this species in Thailand. The species has a wide habitat range and in Malaysia they have been found to persist even in places where swamp forests have been removed and replaced by oil palm plantations. Their habitat is mainly in the plains and lower hills mostly below 3000 m. This bird is not considered threatened on the IUCN Red List.\n\nParagraph 3: Sometimes this formula is varied. In his initial cartoon, Odor-able Kitty, Pepé (who was revealed to be a French-American skunk named Henri in this short) unwittingly pursues a red tabby cat who has intentionally disguised himself as a skunk (complete with the scent of Limburger cheese) in order to scare off a bunch of characters who have mistreated him. Scent-imental Over You has Pepé pursuing a female Chihuahua who has donned a skunk pelt (mistaking it for a fur coat). In the end, she removes her pelt, revealing that she is a dog. However, he then reveals to the audience that he is a real skunk. In Wild Over You, Pepé attempts to seduce a female wildcat who had escaped a zoo (during what is called \"Le grande tour du Zoo\" at a 1900 exhibition) and painted herself to look like a skunk to escape her keepers. This cartoon is notable for not only diverging from the Pepé/female-black-cat dynamic, but also rather cheekily showing that Pepé likes to be beaten up, considering the wildcat thrashes him numerous times. Really Scent is also a subversion with Penelope (here called Fabrette) attracted to him from the beginning, removing the need for Pepé to chase her as she goes to him. But Pepé's scent still causes a problem for her as they try to build a relationship.\n\nParagraph 4: Principal photography began at Pinewoods Studios in London on April 18, 1983, and wrapped on August 11, 1983. Although the Salkinds financed the film completely on their own budget, Warner Bros. was still involved in the production since the studio owned the distribution rights to the film, and its parent company, Warner Communications, was also the parent company of DC Comics, owners of all \"Superman and Superman family\" copyrights. The entire film was shot, edited and overseen under the supervision of Warner Bros. and originally scheduled to be released in July 1984. However, the relationship between the studio and the partnership was strained after the critical and commercial underperformance of Superman III in June 1983, during the production of the film. The Salkinds insisted on moving the opening date from the summer to the holiday season in order to avoid competition with other major films and the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. The studio claimed it could not provide a holiday slot and relinquished its distribution rights of Supergirl to the Salkinds, who gave the distribution rights to Tri-Star Pictures. The film proceeded to be released overseas, however, and received a Royal Film Premiere in the United Kingdom in July 1.\n\nParagraph 5: Rufous woodpeckers forage in pairs on ant nests on trees, fallen logs, dung heaps, ant, and termite hills.

On October 4, 2015, Kendricks earned his first career start during a 23–20 loss at the Denver Broncos. He finished the Week 4 loss with four solo tackles and made his first career sack on Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning for a six-yard loss during the second quarter. On October 7, 2015, the Minnesota Vikings traded Gerald Hodges to the San Francisco 49ers, effectively making Kendricks the starting middle linebacker for the remainder of the season. In Week 6, Kendricks collected a season-high ten combined tackles (nine solo) during a 16–10 victory against the Kansas City Chiefs in Week 6. His ten combined tackles tied a franchise record by a rookie, along with Harrison Smith in 2012 and Malik Boyd in 1994. On October 25, 2015, Kendricks recorded six solo tackles and a season-high two sacks on quarterback Matthew Stafford as the Vikings defeated the Detroit Lions 28–19. On October 29, 2015, Kendricks was named the NFL Defensive Rookie for the month of October, when he posted 20 combined tackles, four sacks and 5 quarterback pressures in just three games. He became the first Vikings defensive player to win Rookie of the Month honors since Kevin Williams did it in 2003, and the eighth to win it overall. The last Vikings player to be selected Rookie of the Month was Cordarrelle Patterson in December 2013. Kendricks was inactive for two games (Weeks 9–10) due to a rib injury. While playing 14 games in 2015, Kendricks became the first rookie to lead the Vikings in tackles (92) since Rip Hawkins in 1961, helping Mike Zimmer's team win its first NFC North title in six years before falling to the Seahawks in the NFC Wild Card Game. He also posted 4.0 sacks, which is tied with Anthony Barr for the 2nd-most sacks by a rookie linebacker in team history, trailing only Dwayne Rudd, who finished his rookie season in 2015 with 5.0 sacks. On January 19, 2016, Kendricks was named to the Pro Football Writers of America's (PFWA) 2015 NFL All-Rookie team. Kendricks led the Vikings defense in tackles as a rookie with 92 total tackles, marking the first time a rookie has led the club in tackles since Rip Hawkins in 1961. Kendricks completed his rookie campaign with a total of 92 combined tackles (72 solo), four sacks, and one pass deflection in 14 games and 11 starts.\n\nParagraph 7: Sometimes this formula is varied.

Due to 20th Century Fox owning the X-Men and the word \"Mutant\", Molly's origin is changed. She is instead a mutate with her powers seeming to come from strange rocks her parents had studied prior. Prior to the series opening, Molly's parents died in a fire and she was adopted by the Yorkes. She discovers that she has superhuman strength early on after suffering cramps and later on at home discovers a dinosaur in the basement. She begs Gert to take her away and they head to Alex's house. At Alex's house she meets her friends and while the gathering is awkward, they soon discover a secret passage in the house that leads to their parents sacrificing Destiny in a ritual. Molly's camera flash is seen by their parents. The group agree to deny seeing anything in order to figure out what Pride is doing and how to stop them. Alex's mother, Catherine, finds a hair bow that belongs to Molly and begins to question her. Molly convinces Catherine that she was told to look for alcohol by the others. Molly then questions Catherine about her parents, with Catherine promising to tell her about them another time. Molly, in an effort to know more about her parents, accidentally lets slip to Catherine about her knowledge of Pride. Geoffrey and Catherine tell Dale and Stacy that they must do something about Molly as she knows about Pride's activities. They tell Molly she is going to be sent away which angers her and Gert comforts her. While living with her relative, Graciela, Molly is given a letter containing a key which leads her to a locker that holds a VHS tape. Molly returns to the group with the VHS tape which contains a video from her parents warning her about Pride's activities. Molly and the others decide to use the school dance as a cover to infiltrate the drilling site. Molly uses her strength to push a dump truck into the drill hole in an attempt to stop the drill. Pride arrives and learn of Molly's and her friend's powers. Failing to stop them, Karolina is taken while Molly and the others escape. Molly and Chase sneak into the Church of Gibborim and rescue Karolina. Molly and the others then go to a bus station, but are forced to go on the run after the others are accused of kidnapping Molly and killing the girl that Pride had murdered.\n\nParagraph 9: Sometimes this formula is varied.

Dehner's sculptures were also on display at the 1960 Paris exhibition \"Aspects of American Culture.\"  Like many of the other works included, hers were primarily distinguished by their improvisation.  In 1965, The Jewish Museum in New York City put on a retrospective exhibit of Dehner's sculpture.  This achievement is miraculous considering that she only began sculpture a decade earlier.  In 1966 she had a solo exhibition, \"Dorothy Dehner: Recent Bronzes.\" It was held in Willard Gallery, New York City.  Dehner began experimenting with wood sculpture in 1974, following the death of her second husband.  Much of Dehner's sculpture can be identified by its totemic qualities and emphasis on Constructivist principles.  Additionally, it differs uniquely from Smith's work in its medium and construction.  Much of Smith's sculpture employed welding as a construction technique, which Dehner did not embrace. In 1981 she took her sculpture to the next level, literally, and experimented with massive steel sculptures.  In 1988 Dehner had solo exhibitions featuring her large welded pieces at Twining Fine Art, New York, and at Muhlenberg College, Allentown, Pennsylvania. This was the first time in her life that Dehner had a generous personal income.  By 1991 Dehner had lost nearly all of her vision and stopped sculpting.  By 1990, however, Dehner was working with fabricators who helped transform some of her earlier drawings into sculptures such as the painted aluminium wall piece. After a prominent career in art, Dehner was found dead in a stairwell outside her apartment in Manhattan on September 22, 1994, at the age of ninety-two.\n\nParagraph 11: Principal photography began at Pinewoods Studios in London on April 18, 1983, and wrapped on August 11, 1983.

{"input": "", "context": "Paragraph 1: During the 13th century, the majority of Estonians along the coasts were converted to Catholicism during the Livonian Crusade led by the Teutonic Order. During this time, the majority of Setos lived under the Novgorod Republic and remained followers of their native Baltic religion. Over the next two hundred years, the Setos were converted to Orthodox Christianity due to the influence from the neighboring Slavic states, but incorporated elements of their earlier pre-Christian religion. An early prevailing belief of the origin of the Seto community was that they were ethnic Estonians who had migrated east and adopted Orthodox Christianity under the influence of the Novgorod Republic.\n\nParagraph 2: A lake turn-over in Lake Kivu may occur from one of two scenarios. Either (1) up to another hundred years of gas accumulation leads to gas saturation in the lake, resulting in a spontaneous outburst of gas originating at the depth at which gas saturation has exceeded 100%, or (2) a volcanic or even seismic event triggers a turn-over. In either case a strong vertical lift of a large body of water results in a plume of gas bubbles and water rising up to and through the water surface. As the bubbling water column draws in fresh gas-laden water, the bubbling water column widens and becomes more energetic as a virtual \"chain reaction\" occurs which would look like a watery volcano. Very large volumes of water are displaced, vertically at first, then horizontally away from the centre at surface and horizontally inwards to the bottom of the bubbling water column, feeding in fresh gas-laden water. The speed of the rising column of water increases until it has the potential to rise 25m or more in the centre above lake level. The water column has the potential to widen to well in excess of a kilometre, in a violent disturbance of the whole lake. The watery volcano may take as much as a day to fully develop while it releases upwards of 400 billion cubic metres of gas (~12tcf). Some of these parameters are uncertain, particularly the time taken to release the gas and the height to which the water column can rise. As a secondary effect, particularly if the water column behaves irregularly with a series of surges, the lake surface will both rise by up to several metres and create a series of tsunamis or waves radiating away from the epicentre of the eruption. Surface waters may simultaneously race away from the epicentre at speeds as high as 20-40m/second, slowing as distances from the centre increase. The size of the waves created is unpredictable. Wave heights will be highest if the water column surges periodically, resulting in wave heights is great as 10-20m. This is caused by the ever-shifting pathway that the vertical column takes to the surface. No reliable model exists to predict this overall turnover behaviour. For tsunami precautions it will be necessary for people to move to high ground, at least 20m above lake level. A worse situation may pertain in the Ruzizi River where a surge in lake level would cause flash-flooding of the steeply sloping river valley dropping 700m to Lake Tanganyika, where it is possible that a wall of water from 20-50m high may race down the gorge. Water is not the only problem for residents of the Kivu basin; the more than 400 billion cubic metres of gas released creates a denser-than-air cloud which may blanket the whole valley to a depth of 300m or more. The presence of this opaque gas cloud, which would suffocate any living creatures with its mixture of carbon dioxide and methane laced with hydrogen sulphide, would cause the majority of casualties. Residents would be advised to climb to at least 400m above the lake level to ensure their safety. Strangely the risk of a gas explosion is not great as the gas cloud is only about 20% methane in carbon dioxide, a mixture that is difficult to ignite.\n\nParagraph 3: Duty in Missouri until February 1862.

Typically, the bidder determines what to bid by estimating how many of the forty-two total points the team will win based on those seven dominoes. The minimum bid is 30.  If all players pass the dealer must bid 30. In some variations the dominoes are reshuffled and the hand restarts. The 42 points consist of one point for each of the seven tricks, plus 35 points from the five \"count\" dominoes whose total pips are a multiple of 5 (the  and  for 10 points each, as well as the , , and  for 5 points each).  The reward for attaining the bid is typically a tally mark, or in numerical scoring, the reward is the point total the player bid in a race to 250.  The bids can occasionally be stated in \"marks\", signifying the tally mark awarded to a winning hand.  The maximum opening bid under standard bidding is two marks, or \"84\", with each successive bid being one additional mark. Each player outbidding the opening maximum bid would result in a bid of 5 marks. There are many variations and exceptions to standard bidding, which are covered in Special Contracts, below.\n\nParagraph 5: In the early 1960s, Livermore had as much area under vine as Napa Valley did at that time. However, it remained relatively unknown, while Napa rose to worldwide prominence.  Wente Vineyards has long been the largest producer in the Livermore Valley, making around 700,000 cases of wine annually with wholesale, tasting room and export sales.

Polakożerstwo described the forcible suppression of Polish culture, education and religion in historically Polish territories, and the gradual elimination of Poles from everyday life as well as from owning property. Anti-Polish policies were implemented by the German Empire under Otto von Bismarck, especially during the Kulturkampf, and enforced up to the end of the First World War. Organized persecution of Poles raged in the territories annexed by Russia, mainly under Tsar Nicholas II. Historic actions inspired by anti-Polonism ranged from felonious acts motivated by hatred, to physical extermination of the Polish nation, the goal of which was to eradicate the Polish state. During World War II, when most of Polish society became the object of genocidal policies of Nazi Germany, anti-Polonism led to an unprecedented campaign of mass murder in German-occupied Poland. In the modern day, among those who often express their hostile attitude towards the Polish people are some Russian  politicians and their far-right political parties who search for a new identity rooted in the defunct Russian Empire after the collapse of the Soviet Union.\n\nParagraph 8: A historic example of anti-Polish sentiment was polakożerstwo (in English, \"the devouring of Poles\") – a Polish term coined in the 19th century in relation to the dismemberment and annexation of Poland by Prussia, the Habsburg monarchy and Russia.

In the Nahuatl language mixiuhca means \"place of births\". The origin of this name comes from one of the Aztecs' migration stories. When the Aztecs first came to the Valley of Mexico, they lived for a long time in a place called Tizapan. However, they were violently expelled from there. Legend states that they ran out to the surrounding swamps using their shields and spears as rafts for the women and children. They ran across three places: Mexicaltzingo, Iztacalco and Temazcaltitlán, and precisely there, in that last place, one of the women gave birth to a child.  From then on, the name of that place became Mixiuhca.\n\nParagraph 13: A lake turn-over in Lake Kivu may occur from one of two scenarios.

Courtney's season started with a crash at the Clipsal 500 Adelaide in race 1 and a 25th in race 2. He then finished 18th in the first race of Symmons Plains but recorded an impressive 8th in race 2. He now sits 21st in the championship with 171 points while Tander is in 6th with 368 points.Courtney sat out the final four races of the 2013 Championship Series after a severe incident during Race 32 at the Phillip Island Grand Prix Circuit. As Courtney entered the turn 4 hairpin (Honda Corner) an out of control Alexandre Prémat, after suffering a delaminated tyre, made heavy contact to the driver's side window of James Courtney's car with the rear of his own after hitting a slight mound in the grass. The incident caused significant damage to both cars including snapping the safety bars of Courtney's car. Both cars inevitably could not compete in the next two races held on the weekend. James suffered a tear in his right quad muscle and a fractured tibia. HRT endurance co-driver Nick Percat replaced him for the final two races of the season at the Sydney 500.Courtney withdrew from the 2015 Sydney Motorsport Park Super Sprint after sustaining chest injuries whilst standing in pit lane when he was hit by an airborne piece of metal signage blown through the air by a low flying Navy helicopter. He was admitted to hospital with two broken ribs and a punctured lung. Endurance co-driver Jack Perkins substituted for Courtney while he recovered in hospital. On 26 August 2015, Courtney confirmed that he would not participate in the Sandown 500 to recover from his injuries. There was a last-minute decision at the Bathurst 1000, where he decided not to race. He returned at the Gold Coast 600, winning the 300 km race on Sunday with Perkins.\n\nParagraph 2: In the 1972–75 Goulandris era, Olympiacos had a solid presence in European competitions, eliminating great clubs, and losing their qualification to the quarter-finals of the 1975 European Cup in a highly controversial game. They managed to eliminate Cagliari in the 1972–73 UEFA Cup, a major force in Italian football during the late 1960s and the early 1970s, (1970 Serie A Champions, 1972 Serie A title contenders), with world-class Italian international players like Gigi Riva, Angelo Domenghini, Enrico Albertosi, Pierluigi Cera, Sergio Gori and Fabrizio Poletti. Olympiacos managed to beat Cagliari twice, 2–1 in Piraeus and 1–0 in Cagliari, becoming the first ever Greek football club to win on Italian soil. In the next round they faced the competition's defending champions Tottenham Hotspur, who were undefeated for 16-straight games in all European competitions. Olympiacos did not manage to qualify against Spurs, but they managed to get a 1–0 win in Piraeus, which ended Tottenham's undefeated streak and marked the first ever victory of a Greek football club against an English side. Two years later, Olympiacos entered the 1974–75 European Cup and they were drawn to face Kenny Dalglish's Celtic, one of the strongest teams in European football at that time and semi-finalists of the previous season. The first leg was played in Celtic Park, where Celtic had never been defeated, running an undefeated streak of 36 straight home games in all European competitions (27 wins, 9 draws) from 1962 to 1974. Olympiacos took the lead through Milton Viera's strike in the 36th minute, with Celtic equalising late in the game. The away draw gave Olympiacos the advantage and they finished the job in Piraeus, after a spectacular 2–0 win against the Scottish Champions with Kritikopoulos and Stavropoulos finding the net. In the next round, they were drawn to play against Anderlecht for a place in the quarter-finals of the competition. Anderlecht won the first leg with 5–1 and Olympiacos' task seemed impossible. In the second leg in Greece, however, Olympiacos put on a dominant display and almost reached a winning score in a match that was marked by referee Károly Palotai's decisions. Olympiacos beat Anderlecht 3–0, while Palotai disallowed four Olympiacos goals and did not give at least three clear penalties committed by Anderlecht players, while Stavropoulos was shown a red card for no good reason. The match is widely known in Greece as the \"Palotai massacre\" with Olympiacos coming close to one of the biggest comebacks in European Cup history.\n\nParagraph 3: „...After they took away the places where he spends his holidays, presenting pictures from Mamaia as pictures from the Cote d'Azur, the valiant employees of S.O. Vantu also reached to the 1400 sq m villa which Mr. Videanu has finished near Bucharest ... Adriean Videanu is, indeed, a very rich man and he was very rich before he became mayor general of the Capital. He is a prosperous businessman who works in a field with great weight, both literally and figuratively: the exploitation and sale of marble and tiles. I don't know if you can get rich by selling pretzels, but surely marble has great potential ... What should really interest us at Adriean Videanu and all people of his financial caliber are completely different things. First of all, we should be interested in whether every penny of his wealth was made honestly, if for every penny taxes were paid to the state and if any penny of this wealth is the result of a detrimental contract for the state ... Journalists who attack him have no way to talk about the rope in the houses of their owners, including politicians, who can be attacked both in terms of interests and business with the state, and in terms of tax evasion found by ANAF. It is simpler and safer to attack populists with houses and cars that in themselves have nothing wrong.”\n\nParagraph 4: In the near-future year of 1974, boxing between human fighters has been criminalized and the sport is dominated by fighting robots. Former boxer Timothy Kelly (nicknamed \"Steel\" because, as a heavyweight, he was never knocked down) manages a B2-model robot called \"Battling Maxo\", an older model that is no longer in demand. Kelly and his partner, Pole, have used the last of their money to get to the fight venue. They are being given this chance because one of the scheduled fighters was damaged in transport. Kelly has to assure fight promoter Nolan and his assistant Maxwell that Maxo will be able to fight. After they leave Nolan's office, Kelly and Pole argue about Maxo's fitness. Kelly feels that Maxo should be able to go through with the fight despite its age and condition. Pole tests Maxo's functions and an arm spring fails, effectively prohibiting it from fighting as they don't have the funds to repair it.\n\nParagraph 5: In the 1972–75 Goulandris era, Olympiacos had a solid presence in European competitions, eliminating great clubs, and losing their qualification to the quarter-finals of the 1975 European Cup in a highly controversial game.

Former boxer Timothy Kelly (nicknamed \"Steel\" because, as a heavyweight, he was never knocked down) manages a B2-model robot called \"Battling Maxo\", an older model that is no longer in demand. Kelly and his partner, Pole, have used the last of their money to get to the fight venue. They are being given this chance because one of the scheduled fighters was damaged in transport. Kelly has to assure fight promoter Nolan and his assistant Maxwell that Maxo will be able to fight. After they leave Nolan's office, Kelly and Pole argue about Maxo's fitness. Kelly feels that Maxo should be able to go through with the fight despite its age and condition. Pole tests Maxo's functions and an arm spring fails, effectively prohibiting it from fighting as they don't have the funds to repair it.\n\nParagraph 7: „...After they took away the places where he spends his holidays, presenting pictures from Mamaia as pictures from the Cote d'Azur, the valiant employees of S.O.

Adriean Videanu is, indeed, a very rich man and he was very rich before he became mayor general of the Capital.

I don't know if you can get rich by selling pretzels, but surely marble has great potential ... What should really interest us at Adriean Videanu and all people of his financial caliber are completely different things. First of all, we should be interested in whether every penny of his wealth was made honestly, if for every penny taxes were paid to the state and if any penny of this wealth is the result of a detrimental contract for the state ... Journalists who attack him have no way to talk about the rope in the houses of their owners, including politicians, who can be attacked both in terms of interests and business with the state, and in terms of tax evasion found by ANAF. It is simpler and safer to attack populists with houses and cars that in themselves have nothing wrong.”\n\nParagraph 8: „...After they took away the places where he spends his holidays, presenting pictures from Mamaia as pictures from the Cote d'Azur, the valiant employees of S.O.

Courtney's season started with a crash at the Clipsal 500 Adelaide in race 1 and a 25th in race 2. He then finished 18th in the first race of Symmons Plains but recorded an impressive 8th in race 2. He now sits 21st in the championship with 171 points while Tander is in 6th with 368 points.Courtney sat out the final four races of the 2013 Championship Series after a severe incident during Race 32 at the Phillip Island Grand Prix Circuit. As Courtney entered the turn 4 hairpin (Honda Corner) an out of control Alexandre Prémat, after suffering a delaminated tyre, made heavy contact to the driver's side window of James Courtney's car with the rear of his own after hitting a slight mound in the grass. The incident caused significant damage to both cars including snapping the safety bars of Courtney's car. Both cars inevitably could not compete in the next two races held on the weekend. James suffered a tear in his right quad muscle and a fractured tibia. HRT endurance co-driver Nick Percat replaced him for the final two races of the season at the Sydney 500.Courtney withdrew from the 2015 Sydney Motorsport Park Super Sprint after sustaining chest injuries whilst standing in pit lane when he was hit by an airborne piece of metal signage blown through the air by a low flying Navy helicopter. He was admitted to hospital with two broken ribs and a punctured lung. Endurance co-driver Jack Perkins substituted for Courtney while he recovered in hospital. On 26 August 2015, Courtney confirmed that he would not participate in the Sandown 500 to recover from his injuries. There was a last-minute decision at the Bathurst 1000, where he decided not to race. He returned at the Gold Coast 600, winning the 300 km race on Sunday with Perkins.\n\nParagraph 10: In the 1972–75 Goulandris era, Olympiacos had a solid presence in European competitions, eliminating great clubs, and losing their qualification to the quarter-finals of the 1975 European Cup in a highly controversial game. They managed to eliminate Cagliari in the 1972–73 UEFA Cup, a major force in Italian football during the late 1960s and the early 1970s, (1970 Serie A Champions, 1972 Serie A title contenders), with world-class Italian international players like Gigi Riva, Angelo Domenghini, Enrico Albertosi, Pierluigi Cera, Sergio Gori and Fabrizio Poletti. Olympiacos managed to beat Cagliari twice, 2–1 in Piraeus and 1–0 in Cagliari, becoming the first ever Greek football club to win on Italian soil. In the next round they faced the competition's defending champions Tottenham Hotspur, who were undefeated for 16-straight games in all European competitions. Olympiacos did not manage to qualify against Spurs, but they managed to get a 1–0 win in Piraeus, which ended Tottenham's undefeated streak and marked the first ever victory of a Greek football club against an English side. Two years later, Olympiacos entered the 1974–75 European Cup and they were drawn to face Kenny Dalglish's Celtic, one of the strongest teams in European football at that time and semi-finalists of the previous season. The first leg was played in Celtic Park, where Celtic had never been defeated, running an undefeated streak of 36 straight home games in all European competitions (27 wins, 9 draws) from 1962 to 1974. Olympiacos took the lead through Milton Viera's strike in the 36th minute, with Celtic equalising late in the game. The away draw gave Olympiacos the advantage and they finished the job in Piraeus, after a spectacular 2–0 win against the Scottish Champions with Kritikopoulos and Stavropoulos finding the net. In the next round, they were drawn to play against Anderlecht for a place in the quarter-finals of the competition. Anderlecht won the first leg with 5–1 and Olympiacos' task seemed impossible. In the second leg in Greece, however, Olympiacos put on a dominant display and almost reached a winning score in a match that was marked by referee Károly Palotai's decisions. Olympiacos beat Anderlecht 3–0, while Palotai disallowed four Olympiacos goals and did not give at least three clear penalties committed by Anderlecht players, while Stavropoulos was shown a red card for no good reason.

{"input": "", "context": "Paragraph 1: During a turbulent period in Nguni and Sotho-Tswana history, known as the Mfecane or \"the crushing\" or \"the scattering\", Mzilikazi's regiment, initially numbering 500 soldiers, moved north to the area that became Transvaal. They moved through areas that included Gauteng, Mpumalanga, North-West, and Limpopo. Mzilikazi was a skilled tactician, both militarily and politically. Mzilikazi attacked or subjugated the local tribes he found along the way, including the Khoi, Batswana, Bapedi, and the real,true and original Ndebele of Mpumalanga. In their land, between 1827 and 1832, Mzilikazi built three military strongholds. The largest was Kungwini, situated at the foot of the Wonderboom Mountains on the Apies River, just north of present-day Pretoria. Another was Dinaneni, north of the Hartbeespoort Dam, while the third was Hlahlandlela in the territory of the Fokeng near Rustenburg. Mzilikazi befriended a white missionary by the name of Robert Moffat. Earlier, he had conquered the BaHurutshe, whose capital Mosega became his military headquarters. He also built his military stronghold at Tshwenyane, Great Marico River, and at eGabeni (Kapain), where he also built a sizeable settlement. When the Voortrekkers in The Great Trek of 1836–1838 arrived in Transvaal, they found Mzilikazi there as the King of the region and he was a threat to their advancement. They fought with him, losing in the first battle but in the second battle in 1837, the Boers led by Potgieter, Maritz, and Uys, launched another attack on Mzilikazi's military stronghold at eGabeni at dawn. In a battle lasting nine days, they destroyed eGabeni as well as other Matabele camps along the Marico River.  Mzilikazi realising that he didn't have a chance against guns, decided to escape with 15,000 of his people, from the Marico valley. Mzilikazi moved to present-day Zimbabwe where the amaNdebele people overwhelmed the indigenous Lozwi which was already crumbling on leadership squabbles after the death of Changamire Dombo, eventually carving out a home. When European people arrived in the area, they found Mzilikazi settled with his people, thus they called the area Matabeleland, which encompassed the west and southwest region of the country. In the course of the migration, large numbers of raided indigenous clans and individuals were absorbed into the Ndebele tribe, adopting the Ndebele language and culture. Historically the assimilated people came from the Southern Ndebele, Swazi, Sotho-Tswana, and Lozwi ethnic groups.\n\nParagraph 2: Janet Maslin of The New York Times wrote that the film \"turns into a preposterously self-serving variation on 1960s' themes\" and that the central problem in the plot \"is certainly a real one, for rock radio stations everywhere. But Ezra Sacks's screenplay manages, by taking this crisis so very, very seriously, not to take it seriously at all.\" Variety called the film \"the modern equivalent of the 1930s newspaper film, all break-neck dialog, quirky happenstances and behind-the-scenes drama transposed to a 1970s rock radio station. Unlike such classics as the original 'Front Page,' however, this Universal release goes nowhere with a potentially-fascinating set of plot elements.\" Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune gave the film 1.5 stars out of 4 and found \"little reason to care\" about the plot, as the sales manager \"is a caricature that belongs on a TV variety show\" and the \"miserable deejays... do their best to make you want to switch stations. Unfortunately, you can't switch stations in a movie theater. All you can do is leave.\" Charles Champlin of the Los Angeles Times declared it \"Fairly Mediocre\" and \"such claptrap silliness that only the tender in years and soft in mind are apt to be enraptured.\" Gary Arnold of The Washington Post panned the film as \"a shallow attempt at rabble-rousing comedy\" which \"flounders in smarmy virtue\" and \"tries to be hip in all the worst ways.\" John Pym of The Monthly Film Bulletin wrote that the movie's central premise rests on the idea \"that commercial, pop-music radio stations were not primarily created to generate advertising revenue, and that the people who put on the records and ad-lib between the jingles are folk heroes, free from the exigencies of the business world, members of that select cinematic breed of American independent professionals. Ezra Sacks' attenuated script, which alternates between episodes of jovial high jinks and moments of melancholy self-indulgence, fails to acknowledge the practical implications of this premise (namely that, without advertising, these 'creative' broadcasters would be out of work) and instead makes the army salesman a ludicrously over-drawn figure of fun and Regis Lamar a sycophantic yes-man.\"\n\nParagraph 3: Because the music of Gigault's second Livre is more representative of the French style of the third quarter of the century, rather than the last, the collection may have been a compilation of earlier composed material. All major French forms are represented, although Gigault's way of naming them differs from his contemporaries: he uses the term \"fugue\" much more broadly (e.g., he uses \"Fugue à 2\" instead of \"Duo\"), never uses the term \"dialogue\", etc. The music is notated meticulously, with more attention to details of performance than in other contemporary sources. There is much use of notes inégales, so much that some scholars believe the music to be unlistenable today, and in general, Gigault's work was judged negatively by most scholars. Nevertheless, the music is distinguished by a serious style, more suitable to the church than that of Lebègue; Gigault's dialogues go beyond those of his contemporaries, Nivers and Lebègue, in that they employ more divisions, and he also cultivates a number of five-voice genres: préludes and récits with pedal cantus firmus in the tenor. Gigault's 1685 Livre was most probably meant as a record of Gigault's style, rather than a book for lesser organists; the music is at times quite sophisticated and requires a high degree of skill.\n\nParagraph 4: In  and , the TI Circuit hosted the Formula One Pacific Grand Prix; both events were won by Michael Schumacher in his early title-winning years. This race made Japan one of only nine countries to ever host more than one Formula One event in the same year (Autopolis was planned to host a second Japanese race in , but it never came to fruition). It was discontinued primarily due to its location in a remote area of the country. The event was also planned to host a race of the 1996 International Touring Car Championship season in August to replace the F1 race, but the race was instead moved to Suzuka Circuit, held in November.\n\nParagraph 5: During a turbulent period in Nguni and Sotho-Tswana history, known as the Mfecane or \"the crushing\" or \"the scattering\", Mzilikazi's regiment, initially numbering 500 soldiers, moved north to the area that became Transvaal.

It was customary at the Cathedral of Cádiz to produce an oratorio every year during Lent, the effect of the performance being not a little enhanced by the following circumstances. The walls, windows, and pillars of the church were hung with black cloth, and only one large lamp hanging from the center of the roof broke the solemn darkness. At midday, the doors were closed and the ceremony began. After a short service the bishop ascended the pulpit, pronounced the first of the seven words (or sentences) and delivered a discourse thereon. This ended, he left the pulpit and fell to his knees before the altar. The interval was filled by music. The bishop then in like manner pronounced the second word, then the third, and so on, the orchestra following on the conclusion of each discourse. My composition was subject to these conditions, and it was no easy task to compose seven adagios lasting ten minutes each, and to succeed one another without fatiguing the listeners; indeed, I found it quite impossible to confine myself to the appointed limits.\n\nParagraph 9: Beginning in 2004, the USMLE program undertook a comprehensive review of the USMLE, referred to as the Comprehensive Review of USMLE (CRU). The review was overseen by the committee to Evaluate the USMLE Program (CEUP),  which was composed of students, residents, clinicians, and members of the licensing, graduate, and undergraduate education communities. The goal of the committee was to determine if the mission and purpose of USMLE were effectively and efficiently supported by the current design, structure, and format of the USMLE. This process was to be guided, in part, by an analysis of information gathered from stakeholders, and was to result in recommendations to USMLE governance. The CEUP worked from 2006 to early 2008.  The CEUP's final report states that \"none of the feedback (received from other stakeholders) seemed to indicate that USMLE is broken, but there was considerable interest in enhancing and improving the program.\" Additionally, the report states that \"there appeared to be very strong reactions to Step 2 CS, and CEUP felt that survey and stakeholder meeting data on this component needed to be interpreted in a special way by attempting to separate (but still be attentive to) issues related to the mechanics and costs of Step 2 CS versus the value of what the exam is intended to measure. On the issue of mechanics and costs, CEUP recognized that USMLE must be very attentive to the burden put on examinees by this testing format and that the impact on examinees must be considered when proposing future directions. Concerning the skills measured by Step 2 CS, there seemed to be legitimate concerns about content. Many people wanted to see the exam begin to assess whether the examinee can detect and interpret abnormal findings and handle challenging communication issues. There was a frequently expressed sentiment that this exam was ripe for enhancement and that many of the more advanced communication skills and other competencies could be assessed through this vehicle.\" In response to the feedback gathered, the CEUP recommended that \"the assessment of clinical skills remain a component of USMLE, but that USMLE consider ways to further enhance the testing methods currently used, in order to address additional skills im-portant to medical practice. It is also recommended that the administrative challenges and costs to examinees associated with related testing formats be given substantial weight in the consideration of future changes.\"\n\nParagraph 10: Janet Maslin of The New York Times wrote that the film \"turns into a preposterously self-serving variation on 1960s' themes\" and that the central problem in the plot \"is certainly a real one, for rock radio stations everywhere.

He warns the Seeonee wolves that the dhole-pack will soon overrun their territory. Later that night, Mowgli meets Kaa, the huge old python, and tells him the news. Kaa does not believe that Mowgli and the pack will survive a direct attack by the dholes, and enters a trance to search his century-long memory for an effective strategy. When he awakens, Kaa takes Mowgli to the Bee Rocks: a gorge where huge hives produced by millions of wild giant honey bees overhang the river, and Mowgli and Kaa devise a plan to lure the dholes to the gorge so that the bees will attack them. Mowgli therefore lies in wait for the dholes in a tree-branch and smears himself with garlic to repel the bees. When the dholes arrive, he taunts their leader into a furious rage and cuts off the leader's tail, before fleeing to the gorge. Just before leaping into the water, Mowgli kicks piles of stones into the beehives, to arouse the bees. The garlic prevents the bees from attacking Mowgli, and he dives safely into the river where Kaa swiftly coils around his body to prevent the current from sweeping him away. Some of the dholes are stung to death by the enraged bees, while others drown in the torrent. The rest flee downstream, pursued by Mowgli. Eventually Mowgli and the surviving dholes reach shallower water, where Mowgli and the wolves fight a ferocious and bloody battle with the remaining dholes, and Won-tolla kills the dhole leader before dying of his own wounds. As the battle comes to its end, Mowgli finds Akela, mortally wounded. With his dying breath, he tells Mowgli that he must soon return to the human race. When Mowgli asks who will drive him there, Akela replies: \"Mowgli will drive Mowgli. Go back to thy people. Go to Man\". The result thereof is told in \"The Spring Running\".\n\nParagraph 5: Mowgli the feral child is about 16 years old and living contentedly with his wolves in the Seeonee jungle, when the peace is disturbed by 'Won-tolla', a solitary wolf whose mate and cubs have been killed by dholes.

{"input": "", "context": "Paragraph 1: His third book, From Darwin to Hitler, has been widely criticized by the academic community and promoted by creationists. His fourth is a sequel, Hitler's Ethic, arguing that Adolf Hitler's \"ideology revolved around evolutionary ethics -- the idea that whatever promoted evolutionary progress is good and whatever hinders it is bad.\" According to Weikart, \"This evolutionary ethic shaped nearly every major feature of Nazi policy: eugenics (measures to improve human heredity, including compulsory sterilization), euthanasia, racism, population expansion, offensive warfare and racial extermination.\" Thomas Pegelow Kaplan, a historian at Davidson College, reviewed the book for Central European History noting Weikart \"pushes his interpretations too far\"  because Weikart \"does not sufficiently integrate the complex motivational factors\" behind ideology, with Kaplan concluding Hitler's Ethic \"offers little in terms of a new, fully convincing understanding of the Nazi dictator's thought.\" Gerwin Strobl, a historian at University of Cardiff, reviewed Hitler's Ethic in European History Quarterly, writing the introduction \"reads like a mixture of a television voiceover and the worst kind of undergraduate essay\" and described the book has two notable weaknesses: \"how ‘Hitler’s ethics’ were disseminated within the party\" and its \"emphasis on intellectual developments inside Germany,\" which ignores \"that Hitler had set out to copy what he regarded as the Anglo-American example.\" Eric Kurlander, in German Studies Review, wrote: \"Though energetically drawn, this new iteration of the \"intentionalist\" argument invites skepticism in some respects, especially in its attempt to explain World War II and the Holocaust.\" Additionally, Larry Arnhart, a professor of Political Science at Northern Illinois University wrote, \"As Weikart indicates, Hitler was a crude genetic determinist who believed that not only physical traits but even morality and culture were inherited genetically along racial lines, so that moral and cultural evolution depended on genetic evolution. But Weikart doesn't indicate to his readers that Darwin denied this.\" Weikart has responded to this review.\n\nParagraph 2: Alan-Michael is the only child born to the brief marriage of Alan Spaulding and Hope Bauer. His parents were mismatched from the beginning, and their relationship was fraught with difficulties. Alan's affair with Vanessa Chamberlain Reardon finally ended the marriage, which led Hope to drink. Her battle with alcoholism continued throughout Alan-Michael's early years. In 1986, Alan-Michael fell in love with Dinah Marler. However, Cameron Stewart tried to break the couple up. Later that year, Harley Cooper came to town. Harley, who loved Cameron, teamed up with Alan-Michael to stop Dinah and Cameron from getting closer. Much to their schemes, Dinah and Cameron could not resist temptation and began dating. Cameron left Harley and Alan-Michael was dumped by Dinah. So Alan-Michael wanted to get even so he and Harley began having sex. Alan-Michael wanted to gain his trust fund but learned from Alexandra that Alan would only let him have it if he was married or until he decides it's the right time. When Alan-Michael married Harley Cooper in  1988, his mother refused to attend, since Alan would be present at the wedding. Alan-Michael only married Harley to gain his trust fund in 1988, but despite his failure in that endeavour, he ended up falling in love with her. The marriage didn't last, however, because Alan made it seem like Harley had cheated on Alan-Michael, leading him to sleep with his brother, Phillip's wife Christina \"Blake\" Thorpe, who wanted to get even with Phillip who left her for Beth, who returned to town. Blake, who pretended she was pregnant, coerced Alan-Michael into divorcing Harley and marrying her so that she could continue to interfere with Beth and Phillip. Not long after their marriage, Blake faked a miscarriage, but the truth about her fake pregnancy was found out. Alan-Michael left Blake, but throughout the early 1990s, he and Blake would team up to feud with Alan. Alan-Michael soon fell in love with and married Eleni Andros. Eleni, however, had conceived a child before they married, thinking it was Alan-Michael's; when it was revealed to be Frank Cooper's instead, Eleni left Alan-Michael to marry Frank. Heartbroken yet again, Alan-Michael took over Spaulding Enterprises. He would date Josh's ex Tangie Hill in 1994, who also flirted with Alan, much to Josh's dislike. However, his heart would later be wooed by Lucy Cooper in 1995 whom he'd marry before leaving town in 1997. During this time, Alan-Michael's ex, Dinah Marler, returned to town, vowing revenge for leaving her to marry Harley Cooper all those years ago. Knowing how much the Spauldings, especially Alan Michael, had hatred for Roger Thorpe, Dinah saw a chance at getting even by marrying Roger, trying to make Alan-Michael jealous, however he was trying to break up Lucy and Brent Lawerence. So, Dinah gave up, but continued to marry Roger in order to gain her Trust Fund. Lucy left the crazy Brent Lawerence and went back to Alan-Michael in the summer of 1995. Alan-Michael and Gilly Grant teamed up in late 1995 and early 1996 to help Reva Shayne convince Josh and Annie Dutton to agree over joint custody of Marah and Shayne.\n\nParagraph 3: Though not expected to make the rotation in 1979, Kison began the year as a starter after Reuss was traded. He had a 1–1 record and a 3.94 ERA in his first six games, but in the middle of May, he lost his rotation spot to Ed Whitson. Moving to the bullpen, he had an 0.84 ERA in six games. Then, on June 3, Don Robinson had trouble warming up, and Kison had to make a spot start against the Padres; the start would be one of the best of his career. He pitched a one-hitter against the Padres, losing his no-hit bid when San Diego's Barry Evans  doubled down the left field line with two out in the eighth. The Pirates won 7–0. After the game, Kison complained publicly about Charley Feeney and Dan Donovan's decision to give Evans a double; the incident led to the resignation of both Feeney and Donovan, and a new policy by Pittsburgh newspapers that their sportswriters would not serve as official scorers. He had another memorable game against San Diego on August 26, when he hit a grand slam against Bob Shirley in a 7–0 victory. From July 6 through the end of the year, he had a 9–3 record and a 2.93 ERA, finishing up with a 13–7 record and a 3.19 ERA. His most important start of the season came in the Pirates' last game of the year, a contest against the Cubs that had been scheduled because of an earlier tie against the New York Mets; the game was needed to determine whether the Pirates needed to play a tie-breaker against the Montreal Expos. Kison allowed one run over six innings, winning the game and the NL East pennant for the Pirates. \"This is the most emotional situation I’ve ever been in, because we had to work so hard to get there,” Kison said about returning to the playoffs. “Other years we ran away with it, but not this year. And it’s even more meaningful because the last two years we played our hearts out and came up empty.”\n\nParagraph 4: Though not expected to make the rotation in 1979, Kison began the year as a starter after Reuss was traded.

Harley, who loved Cameron, teamed up with Alan-Michael to stop Dinah and Cameron from getting closer. Much to their schemes, Dinah and Cameron could not resist temptation and began dating. Cameron left Harley and Alan-Michael was dumped by Dinah. So Alan-Michael wanted to get even so he and Harley began having sex. Alan-Michael wanted to gain his trust fund but learned from Alexandra that Alan would only let him have it if he was married or until he decides it's the right time. When Alan-Michael married Harley Cooper in  1988, his mother refused to attend, since Alan would be present at the wedding. Alan-Michael only married Harley to gain his trust fund in 1988, but despite his failure in that endeavour, he ended up falling in love with her. The marriage didn't last, however, because Alan made it seem like Harley had cheated on Alan-Michael, leading him to sleep with his brother, Phillip's wife Christina \"Blake\" Thorpe, who wanted to get even with Phillip who left her for Beth, who returned to town. Blake, who pretended she was pregnant, coerced Alan-Michael into divorcing Harley and marrying her so that she could continue to interfere with Beth and Phillip. Not long after their marriage, Blake faked a miscarriage, but the truth about her fake pregnancy was found out. Alan-Michael left Blake, but throughout the early 1990s, he and Blake would team up to feud with Alan. Alan-Michael soon fell in love with and married Eleni Andros. Eleni, however, had conceived a child before they married, thinking it was Alan-Michael's; when it was revealed to be Frank Cooper's instead, Eleni left Alan-Michael to marry Frank. Heartbroken yet again, Alan-Michael took over Spaulding Enterprises. He would date Josh's ex Tangie Hill in 1994, who also flirted with Alan, much to Josh's dislike. However, his heart would later be wooed by Lucy Cooper in 1995 whom he'd marry before leaving town in 1997. During this time, Alan-Michael's ex, Dinah Marler, returned to town, vowing revenge for leaving her to marry Harley Cooper all those years ago. Knowing how much the Spauldings, especially Alan Michael, had hatred for Roger Thorpe, Dinah saw a chance at getting even by marrying Roger, trying to make Alan-Michael jealous, however he was trying to break up Lucy and Brent Lawerence. So, Dinah gave up, but continued to marry Roger in order to gain her Trust Fund. Lucy left the crazy Brent Lawerence and went back to Alan-Michael in the summer of 1995. Alan-Michael and Gilly Grant teamed up in late 1995 and early 1996 to help Reva Shayne convince Josh and Annie Dutton to agree over joint custody of Marah and Shayne.\n\nParagraph 7: Afghanistan and Pakistan are situated at the western periphery of South Asia, where the cultural character has been made by both, Persia, a civilization rooted in Mesopotamia and the Indosphere. Pakistan is split with its two western regions of Baluchistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa sharing a greater Iranic heritage due to the native Pashtuns and Baloch people of the regions. Its two eastern regions of Punjab and Sindh share cultural links to Northwest India. Bangladesh and the Indian state of West Bengal share a common heritage and culture based on the Bengali language. The Culture of India is diverse and a complex mixture of many influences. Nepal is culturally linked to both India and Tibet and the varied ethnic groups of the country share many of the festivals and cultural traditions used and celebrated in North and East India and Tibet. Nepali, the dominant language of Nepal uses the Devanagari alphabet which is also used to write many North Indian languages. Bhutan is a culturally linked to Tibet and India. Tibetan Buddhism is the dominant religion in Bhutan and the Tibetan alphabet is used to write Dzongkha, the dominant language of Bhutan. There is a cultural and linguistic divide between North and South India. Sri Lanka is culturally tied to both India and Southeast Asia. Sinhala, the dominant language in the country is written in Sinhala script which is derived from the Kadamba-Pallava alphabet, certain cultural traditions, and aspects of its cuisine, for example, show South Indian influences. Cultural festivals, aspects of its cuisine and Theravada Buddhism, the dominant religion in Sri Lanka, show a Southeast Asian affinity.\n\nParagraph 8: His third book, From Darwin to Hitler, has been widely criticized by the academic community and promoted by creationists. His fourth is a sequel, Hitler's Ethic, arguing that Adolf Hitler's \"ideology revolved around evolutionary ethics -- the idea that whatever promoted evolutionary progress is good and whatever hinders it is bad.\" According to Weikart, \"This evolutionary ethic shaped nearly every major feature of Nazi policy: eugenics (measures to improve human heredity, including compulsory sterilization), euthanasia, racism, population expansion, offensive warfare and racial extermination.\" Thomas Pegelow Kaplan, a historian at Davidson College, reviewed the book for Central European History noting Weikart \"pushes his interpretations too far\"  because Weikart \"does not sufficiently integrate the complex motivational factors\" behind ideology, with Kaplan concluding Hitler's Ethic \"offers little in terms of a new, fully convincing understanding of the Nazi dictator's thought.\" Gerwin Strobl, a historian at University of Cardiff, reviewed Hitler's Ethic in European History Quarterly, writing the introduction \"reads like a mixture of a television voiceover and the worst kind of undergraduate essay\" and described the book has two notable weaknesses: \"how ‘Hitler’s ethics’ were disseminated within the party\" and its \"emphasis on intellectual developments inside Germany,\" which ignores \"that Hitler had set out to copy what he regarded as the Anglo-American example.\" Eric Kurlander, in German Studies Review, wrote: \"Though energetically drawn, this new iteration of the \"intentionalist\" argument invites skepticism in some respects, especially in its attempt to explain World War II and the Holocaust.\" Additionally, Larry Arnhart, a professor of Political Science at Northern Illinois University wrote, \"As Weikart indicates, Hitler was a crude genetic determinist who believed that not only physical traits but even morality and culture were inherited genetically along racial lines, so that moral and cultural evolution depended on genetic evolution. But Weikart doesn't indicate to his readers that Darwin denied this.\" Weikart has responded to this review.\n\nParagraph 9: Though not expected to make the rotation in 1979, Kison began the year as a starter after Reuss was traded. He had a 1–1 record and a 3.94 ERA in his first six games, but in the middle of May, he lost his rotation spot to Ed Whitson. Moving to the bullpen, he had an 0.84 ERA in six games. Then, on June 3, Don Robinson had trouble warming up, and Kison had to make a spot start against the Padres; the start would be one of the best of his career. He pitched a one-hitter against the Padres, losing his no-hit bid when San Diego's Barry Evans  doubled down the left field line with two out in the eighth. The Pirates won 7–0. After the game, Kison complained publicly about Charley Feeney and Dan Donovan's decision to give Evans a double; the incident led to the resignation of both Feeney and Donovan, and a new policy by Pittsburgh newspapers that their sportswriters would not serve as official scorers. He had another memorable game against San Diego on August 26, when he hit a grand slam against Bob Shirley in a 7–0 victory. From July 6 through the end of the year, he had a 9–3 record and a 2.93 ERA, finishing up with a 13–7 record and a 3.19 ERA. His most important start of the season came in the Pirates' last game of the year, a contest against the Cubs that had been scheduled because of an earlier tie against the New York Mets; the game was needed to determine whether the Pirates needed to play a tie-breaker against the Montreal Expos. Kison allowed one run over six innings, winning the game and the NL East pennant for the Pirates. \"This is the most emotional situation I’ve ever been in, because we had to work so hard to get there,” Kison said about returning to the playoffs. “Other years we ran away with it, but not this year. And it’s even more meaningful because the last two years we played our hearts out and came up empty.”\n\nParagraph 10: In 1848, Donaldson was elected a member of the original unicameral Legislative Council of New South Wales, representing the County of Durham from February 1848 to January 1853. Comments made while running for re-election in 1851, led Sir Thomas Mitchell to demand a public apology. While Donaldson complied Mitchell was not satisfied and challenged Donaldson to a duel with pistols. Both men missed but they remained antagonised. He supported the development of steam ship services to Australia and the work of Caroline Chisholm. In 1852 he achieved the carriage of a motion recommending that £10,000 should be applied to supporting Chisholm's work. He travelled to England in 1853–1854.", "answers": ["8"], "length": 3634, "dataset": "passage_count_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "c82315b20e4cb32976563f568c88cc44afe97ddc6ade258a"}

In 1349 he bought some acres of land near Smithfield, London, which were consecrated as a burying-place where large numbers of the victims of the Black Death were interred; and here he built a chapel, from which the place obtained the name of \"Newchurchhaw.\" The chapel and ground were bought from Manny by the Bishop of London, Michael Northburgh, who died in 1361 and by his will bequeathed a large sum of money to found there a Carthusian convent. It is not clear whether this direction was ever carried out; for in 1371 Manny obtained letters patent from King Edward III permitting him to found, apparently on the same site, a Carthusian monastery called \"La Salutation Mere Dieu\", where the monks were to pray for the soul of Northburgh as well as for the soul of Manny himself. The bishop's bequest may have contributed to the building and endowment of the house; or possibly, as seems to be implied by a bull granted by Urban VI, in 1378, there were originally two kindred establishments owing their foundation to Northburgh and Manny respectively. At all events Manny, who died early in 1372, left instructions in his will, dated St Andrew's Day (30 November) 1371, that he was to be buried in the church of the Carthusian monastery founded by himself. During archaeological investigations at Charterhouse in 1947, W. F. Grimes discovered a skeleton in a lead coffin before the high altar of the monastic chapel.

In this case, it could lead to misclassification of various types of exposure.  Recall bias is of particular concern in retrospective studies that use a case-control design to investigate the etiology of a disease or psychiatric condition. For example, in studies of risk factors for breast cancer, women who have had the disease may search their memories more thoroughly than members of the unaffected control group for possible causes of their cancer. Those in the case group (those with breast cancer) may be able to recall a greater number of potential risk factors they had been exposed to than those in the control group (women unaffected by breast cancer).

On the same day, however, the agreement seems to have been amended to include this mountain, even mentioning it specifically, and accordingly the monetary amount involved was raised to 480 Rhenish guilders. Less than a month later, on 12 April 1383, another record mentions several people, including three from Nanzweiler (Henne von Nancwilr, Clas von Nancwilr and Henne, Angnesen Sohn) who had sworn an oath of obeisance to Sir Bechtolff, Castle Count at Lutern (Kaiserslautern), Squire Philips and their heirs.\n\nParagraph 4: He appears in 1511 as a supporter of the pope against the claims of the Council of Pisa (1511–1512), called by dissident cardinals to punish Pope Julius II, who had ignored the electoral capitulations he had accepted before being elected.  Cajetan composed in defense of his position the Tractatus de Comparatione auctoritatis Papæ et conciliorum ad invicem. Jacques Almain answered this work, and Cajetan replied in his Apologia.  Cajetan refused to accept Almain's argument that the Church's polity had to be similar to a lay regime, complete with limits on the ruler. At the Fifth Lateran Council (1512–17) which Pope Julius II set up in opposition to that of Pisa, De Vio played the leading role. During the second session of the council, in which he gave the opening oration, he brought about a decree recognizing the superiority of papal authority to that of councils.\n\nParagraph 5: The villages of Nanzweiler and Dietschweiler arose in the Free Imperial Domain (Reichsland) when this stretched broadly over what is now the West Palatinate. From this contiguous block of territory, kings split off certain pieces to make of them donations to both ecclesiastical and secular lordships. Great parts passed into the Salians’ ownership. In 737, Count Werner I of the Salian House endowed the Hornbach Monastery, whose first abbot was Saint Pirmin. This monastery was richly furnished with estates, even with the Münchweiler Tal (dale), which had been split off the Reichsland and given into Count Werner's ownership, whereupon he then gave it to the monastery. The villages of Nanzweiler and Dietschweiler already existed at the time of this donation on each side of the Glan. Laid down as the border of the monasterial landhold in the Münchweiler Tal was the river Glan in the area of what is now the village of Nanzdietschweiler. The centres on the right bank remained in the Reichsland whereas the parts on the left bank passed into the monastery's ownership. Throughout this period in history, the villages each side of the Glan, which then even bore the same names, were set asunder by this border. Nanzweiler and Dietschweiler on the Glan's right bank, which became Nanzdiezweiler by the 19th century, remained in Imperially immediate ownership and over the course of the centuries was pledged several times, in the 14th century to the Electorate of Trier, and in the 15th to Electoral Palatinate. Both villages on the right bank then remained with Electoral Palatinate, thereby sharing a history with the region around Kaiserslautern, generally known as the Reichswald (“Imperial Forest”). An utterly different course was taken by the two villages on the Glan's left bank. As a fief of the Hornbach Monastery whose hub was at Glan-Münchweiler, they passed in the 14th century (1323) first to the Raugraves in the Nahegau, then to the Archbishop of Trier (1344) and to Breidenborn (1383), finally ending up in the 16th century with the Counts of Leyen.

{"input": "", "context": "Paragraph 1: Coached at the Ipswich Jets by Australian former international  Tommy Raudonikis, Langer was playing first grade when he was only 17 in the Brisbane Rugby League premiership by 1986. He played as a  for Ipswich and in 1987 opposed his older brother Kevin, who was  of Wests. That year his selection from left field for the Wayne Bennett-coached Queensland side in the 1987 State of Origin series was questioned by several key figures in the Maroons camp who called for the selection in-form Eastern Suburbs  Laurie Spina. It was Raudonikis who stood up for him, backing Langer's selection and he made his Queensland début in the 1987 State of Origin series while still playing for the Jets. Paul Vautin claimed in his autobiography that during a team meeting, Bennett kept going on about where they were going to hide Langer in defense. He was upset that no-one was defending him against Bennett's comments and so stood up and said \"He's a Queenslander and won't let us down\". Langer's superb performance, including a man-of-the-match award in the decider, silenced the critics and saw him signed on with the newly established Brisbane Broncos team who would enter the New South Wales Rugby League premiership in 1988.\n\nParagraph 2: Second restoration (2016–2022)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n\nParagraph 3: Second restoration (2016–2022)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n\nParagraph 4: Daffney spent the next couple of months mainly managing Stevie and Raven, before making her in-ring return on the February 18, 2010, episode of Impact!, losing to the TNA Women's Knockout Champion Tara via disqualification, after hitting her with a toolbox. After the match, Daffney continued her assault, before being dragged away by Dr. Stevie. The following week on Impact! she annihilated ODB in similar fashion as it was noted that she had her eye set on the title. On the March 8 episode of Impact!, Daffney cost Tara and her tag team partner Angelina Love the Knockouts Tag Team Championship by hitting her with the Women's Knockout Championship belt during a match for the vacant titles. At Destination X Daffney failed in her attempt to win the Knockout Championship from Tara, but managed to steal her spider Poison from her after the match. The following day on Impact! Daffney used distraction from Poison to pin Tara in an eight wrestler tag team match to earn her a First Blood match for the Women's Knockout Championship the following week. The following week Tara defeated Daffney in a First Blood match after hitting her with a toolbox. The following week Daffney was one of the four winners in an eight knockout Lockbox match, contested for four keys to four boxes containing prizes. During the contest Tara, one of the three other winners, won back Poison, while Daffney came up empty handed and was forced to strip down, but before she could she was attacked by Lacey Von Erich. The attack resulted in a match on the April 19 episode of Impact!, where Daffney, now seemingly a face, and a partner of her choice, ODB, unsuccessfully challenged Von Erich and Velvet Sky for the TNA Knockouts Tag Team Championship. At the following day's Impact! tapings, Daffney was injured in a dark match against Miss Betsy in her tryout match and was taken to a hospital, where she was diagnosed with a deeply bruised sternum, a severe stinger, and a concussion.\n\nParagraph 5: A long time ago, the small kingdom of Vittoria was built around a lofty tower, which pierced the sky. The people of the city, guarded by a mighty Dragon, lived in peace and abundance. However, King Bistalle, the ruler of Vittoria, desired to expand his kingdom and ordered the scholars to research the Tower. Soon he was brought a tome written in an ancient language. As they were deciphering the tome, some scholars feared that they might be laying their hands on the forbidden knowledge of the ancients. The tome reads, \"The Great Guardian of Vittoria, the Dragon, and the Essence of Power lies in the top of the Tower; the one who possesses the Essence will possess all.\" Undaunted by these otherwise ominous words, Bistalle decided to make this Essence of Power his own. He secretly organized an army which soon attacked the Tower and overwhelmed the Dragon. But as Bistalle grasped at the Essence of Power, the Dragon gave up its own life to destroy it. The Essence, losing control, transformed the King into a hideous monster and sank the entire kingdom of Vittoria, including the great tower, under the ground. All people on the surface forgot about Vittoria and the Tower in its center, and a thousand years passed.\n\nParagraph 6: Second restoration (2016–2022)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n\nParagraph 7: The school was built in late thirties and started in 1941. The \"boys\", as those attending this boarding school were called, came mostly from Trinidad. Most were boarders but a dozen or so lived at home and were bused daily to attend classes. Other boarders came from the Caribbean region..Venezuela, Colombia, British and Dutch Guyanas, Barbados, Curacao, Martinique, Guadalupe, Dominica. The administration and teachers were primarily monks from the monastery. As time passed the number of non-monk and lay teachers increased. There were 7 grade levels; Preps A&B, Forms I to V. The school followed the British education system. It followed a calendar year schedule till 1963 when it changed to a fiscal year from September to June. Sports played an important activity in the daily life of the students: football, cricket, basketball, volleyball, tennis, table tennis. The entire school was divided into three groups named St Anthony, St Lawrence and St Francis; within each group there were 3 divisions with different age groups. The Abbey School competed in cricket, football, tennis, basketball and swimming with other schools in and outside Trinidad. Scouting was another major activity in which a large number of boys participated in. Two major additions were made to the school in the late 1960s: an Olympic size pool and a refectory. The second floor of the refectory was an assembly hall where movies were shown every Saturday night, plays acted out, dances held, music shows presented by talented students. The pool presented a new opportunity for students to enjoy their free time. It led to the creation of the Aqua Lads swimming team which became a competitive force in Trinidad and the Caribbean area. The Black Power revolution that took place in Trinidad in 1970 had a negative impact on attracting new students from the other islands and countries. Financial challenges began to appear in the 1970s as the caribbean area economy began to face serious inflation related issues. By the 1980s the large number of Venezuelan boarders were reduced to only a handful. There were still about approximately 40–50 boarders and the Monastic Community were at pains to find ways to keep the school open for the 100 or so boys. A temporary solution was to employ more monk teachers and pay out less in salaries. This only worked for a short time and the school was closed at the end of the 1986 school year due to financial challenges. It is estimated that around 2000 boys attended the Abbey School through its lifetime.\n\nParagraph 8: Second restoration (2016–2022)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n\nParagraph 9: A long time ago, the small kingdom of Vittoria was built around a lofty tower, which pierced the sky.

Langer's superb performance, including a man-of-the-match award in the decider, silenced the critics and saw him signed on with the newly established Brisbane Broncos team who would enter the New South Wales Rugby League premiership in 1988.\n\nParagraph 11: Second restoration (2016–2022)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ", "answers": ["5"], "length": 1627, "dataset": "passage_count_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "d50e378285ffe6f2eb6ea81e130fe710246d93408b867267"}

(The Cerberus-led group later acquired New Albertsons from SuperValu in March 2013, reuniting the two Albertsons companies under the common holding company Albertsons LLC.) Since Cerberus took control, four locations (Algonquin, Bedford Park, 87th Street in Chicago, and Naperville) closed, and Cerberus then announced that it was selling the remaining Illinois stores to other operators. The last of the Chicago-area Cub Foods stores closed on December 10, 2006. A majority of them were sold to Central Grocers Cooperative and operated as Strack & Van Til and Ultra Foods by a wholly-owned unit of the cooperative, and as Garden Fresh Markets by one of its members; others were sold to Grand Mart International Foods. However, only four of the eight stores sold to Grand Mart opened under that company's ownership, and all were closed after less than five months of operation. Central Grocers Cooperative subsequently went bankrupt in 2017. In recent months among the inflation crisis of 2021-2022, Cub Foods was considered overpriced by local pricing experts.\n\nParagraph 3: The film was shot from 25 March to 11 May 1974, at a cost of $686,000 (), with $200,000 coming from the Canadian Film Development Corporation.

His paternal grandfather was Jewish (of Russian origin). The rest of his ancestry is mostly northern European, including some Scottish. Wise has said that when he was about 12 years old his synagogue was attacked by white supremacists. Wise attended public schools in Nashville, graduating from Hillsboro High School in 1986. Wise has a BA from Tulane University in New Orleans. He majored in Political Science and minored in Latin American Studies. While a student, he was a leader in the campus anti-apartheid movement, which sought to force Tulane to divest from companies still doing business with the government of South Africa. His anti-apartheid activism was first brought to national attention in 1988, when South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu announced he would turn down an offer of an honorary degree from Tulane after Wise's group informed him of the school's ongoing investments there.\n\nParagraph 5: The Bagh District is bounded on the north by the Muzaffarabad District, the Hattian Bala District, and the Baramulla District of Indian-administered Jammu and Kashmir, on the east by the Haveli District, on the south by the Poonch District, and on the west by the Rawalpindi District of Pakistan's Punjab Province. The total area of the district is 770 square kilometers. The Bagh District is linked to the Muzaffarabad District by two roads, one via Sudhan Gali (80 km) and the other via Kohala (97 km). The district headquarters is the city of Bagh, which is situated 46 km from Rawalakot. It is said that a bagh (garden) was set up by a landowner where the premises of the Forest Department are now located. As a result, the area that is now the district headquarters was named \"Bagh\".\n\nParagraph 6: Wise was born in Nashville, Tennessee, to Michael Julius Wise and LuCinda Anne (née McLean) Wise.

The A.H. Belo Corporation, owner of The Dallas Morning News, had attempted to launch a new television station in Dallas two years earlier, when it applied for a construction permit to build transmitter and broadcasting facilities for a proposed station that would have transmitted on VHF channel 12. The FCC rejected Belo's application and, following the issuance of the Sixth Report and Order that lifted the agency's freeze on new television station licensing applications in 1952, eventually chose to reassign the Channel 12 allocation to Waco (after the agency assigned that same channel to Ardmore, Oklahoma, where it would be licensed to KXII, the FCC would eventually move the VHF channel 12 allocation from Waco to Abilene, which became home to present-day ABC affiliate KTXS-TV). Complicating matters, the agency's moratorium on new license applications, which the FCC instituted to sort out the backlog of prospective applicants that already filed to build such operations, left Belo with the sole recourse of acquiring a television station that was already on the air if it wanted to own one in the Dallas–Fort Worth area.\n\nParagraph 8: Wise was born in Nashville, Tennessee, to Michael Julius Wise and LuCinda Anne (née McLean) Wise.

Five years earlier in 2004, the Massachusetts General Court had withdrawn the authority of the governor to fill a U.S. Senate vacancy by appointment, to prevent the then-Governor Mitt Romney, a Republican, from appointing a fellow Republican to fill the remainder of Democrat John Kerry's Senate term, if Kerry were to win the 2004 presidential election. The legislation was enacted over Romney's veto. At that time, Senator Ted Kennedy successfully made personal appeals to Massachusetts Democratic legislative leaders to pass the bill, which had been stalled prior to his request. The new law called for a special election months later to fill the vacancy. However, Kennedy's death denied Democrats in the U.S. Senate the 60‑vote supermajority required to end filibusters. Given the urgency of and narrow partisan support for some legislation before Congress, most notably health care reform, Democratic lawmakers and liberal pundits called for an interim senator to be appointed so that Massachusetts would have full Senate representation until the special election; Kennedy himself had requested such a change before he died. In September, the General Court passed legislation restoring the governor's power to make interim appointments to serve until the special election stipulated in the earlier legislation is held, over multiple bipartisan concerns of hypocrisy. Kennedy's two sons, Patrick J. Kennedy and Edward Kennedy Jr.; and his wife, Victoria Reggie Kennedy, had all expressed their preference for Kirk. On September 23, 2009, several national media organizations reported that Kirk was favored by the family of the late Senator Edward M. Kennedy to be the senator's interim replacement, and that the family had communicated their preference to Governor Deval Patrick. Governor Patrick announced Kirk's appointment the next day. Kirk pledged he would not be a candidate in the special election, which was won by Republican Scott Brown. Kirk was sworn into office on September 25, 2009.\n\nParagraph 10: Wise was born in Nashville, Tennessee, to Michael Julius Wise and LuCinda Anne (née McLean) Wise.

In 1388, Feroz Shah Tughlaq appointed Malik Sarwar, a eunuch, who is notorious for having been the lover of Feroz Shah Tughlaq's daughter, as the governor of the region. The Sultanate was in disarray because of factional fighting for power, and in 1393 Malik Sarwar declared independence. He and his adopted son Mubarak Shah founded what came to be known as the Sharqi dynasty (dynasty of the East). During the Sharqi period the Jaunpur Sultanate was a strong military power in Northern India, and on several occasions threatened the Delhi Sultanate. The Jaunpur Sultanate attained its greatest height under the younger brother of Mubarak Shah, who ruled as Shams-ud-din Ibrahim Shah (ruled 1402–1440). To the east, his kingdom extended to Bihar, and to the west, to Kanauj; he even marched on Delhi at one point. Under the aegis of a Muslim holy man named Qutb al-Alam, he threatened the Sultanate of Bengal under Shihabuddin Bayazid Shah.\n\nParagraph 14: Lacy-Potter Television Broadcasting lost $128,020 in net revenue during its four-month stewardship of KBTV, leading Tom Potter to make the decision to put the station up for sale.

Unable to take care of him, Dot has Jim admitted to a nursing home. He visits his family and friends in Walford several times, the first occasion being on his 75th birthday in August 2008 when his daughter Suzy (Maggie O'Neill) has come to stay. He later visits at Christmas, but continues to reject his son Max and animosity between them resurfaces. Following rehabilitation, Jim is permitted to return to live at home in 2009, now in better health. He can speak no more than a few words, but communicates through gestures and facial expressions, and uses a walking stick and wheelchair to get around. In February 2010, Dot's granddaughter Dotty (Molly Conlin) attempts to get Jim sent back to the care home by pouring water on his lap to make it look like he has wet himself. However, Dotty is immediately caught out. As Dot and Jim celebrate their eighth wedding anniversary in The Queen Victoria, the police arrest Dot, ruining the party and distressing Jim. He draws a picture of him and Dot as an anniversary present for her. Jim and Max bond over the death of his grandson, Max's son Bradley (Charlie Clements) and he comforts Max on the day of the funeral, kissing his hand. When Jim's youngest son Jack (Scott Maslen) is in a coma after being shot, Jim is present when he is woken up by medical staff. Jim then cries when he finds out Jack is paralysed, knowing the pain of living with a disability. Jim and Dot are later befriended by teenager Fatboy (Ricky Norwood). A few weeks later, when his grandson Billie Jackson (Devon Anderson) dies, Carol goes to visit Jim, who starts crying, and she breaks down in his arms.\n\nParagraph 16: As part of SuperValu's acquisition of New Albertsons, including its Chicago-based Jewel-Osco stores, SuperValu divested its Chicago-area Cub Foods locations to an investment group headed by Cerberus Capital Management, to avoid market concentration issues.

InfoWorlds 1983 review of the QX-10 described the software as \"great idea, questionable implementation\". It reported that Valdocs on the computer \"is slow. Sometimes it merely dawdles slightly, but other times, it crawls. Entering text becomes a disconcerting pastime when the screen display lags as many as 60 characters behind your typing, and you lose characters\". The magazine added that \"VALDOCS crashed (failed) numerous times while we were using it to write this review. We lost data each time, came close to losing a whole disk, and ended up retyping it into our trusty IBM PC to meet deadline\". It advised users to backup their files, but stated that since the process was so slow the computer encouraged them to avoid doing so until it was too late. While praising the QX-10 itself (\"Physically this is an excellent machine\") and Valdocs' ease of use, Jerry Pournelle wrote in BYTE in August 1983 that \"the first problem is obvious from the other side of the room. The Valdocs system is slow. It seems to take forever to do disk operations ... Getting from the beginning to the end of a six-page document takes 15 seconds. Deleting the first three pages of the same document takes 20 seconds\". He believed that the software \"has pushed the Zilog Z80 chip past its limits ... I don't think Valdocs will ever run properly until something like the 8086 or 68000 is used\".\n\nParagraph 4: Zebina made his debut for the club, starting the whole game, in a 4–1 win against ND Gorica in the first round of the UEFA Cup.

Like previous games in the Sonic series, basic gameplay involves running quickly, collecting rings, tricky platforming and destroying enemies. Shadow collects rings as a form of health; when he is attacked by an enemy or takes damage from the environment, ten of his rings bounce away from and form into a circle around him. When Shadow has no rings and takes damage from an enemy he dies, loses a life and goes back to the last checkpoint. Each level is completed by undertaking a mission, and each mission is labelled \"Hero,\" \"Dark,\" or \"Normal\". The \"Hero\" missions involve completing tasks for the Sonic series' heroic characters, or Doctor Eggman on one occasion, and the \"Dark\" missions involve completing tasks for Black Doom or Doctor Eggman. The \"Normal\" missions involve reaching the Chaos Emerald or Goal Ring at the end of the stage. Examples of non-neutral mission objectives include killing all enemies in the stages, destroying an aircraft flying to the end of the level, or activating or destroying objects in the stage. All enemies attack Shadow regardless of the mission chosen. The mission types selected affect the plot, the levels played, and the ending received out of ten possibilities. Each level features cutscenes that advance the story, and seven levels also feature boss battles. There are 326 possible paths to take in Shadow the Hedgehog, and each pathway is individually named.\n\nParagraph 6: Nylon ropes that were used in yachts for hauling were tested and found useful in climbing and caving and are now the modern standard.  The German company Edelrid introduced the first kernmantel rope in 1953, which revolutionized fall prevention. Hemp climbing rope became a thing of the past and rope breakage was greatly reduced. In 1964, Edelrid and Mammut both developed dynamic ropes capable of withstanding multiple falls. These became the forerunner of the modern dynamic climbing rope. Although there were occasional innovations, the rope used today is similar in construction, strength, and durability across manufacturers. Overall there is a huge variety of climbing ropes available for different purposes; for instance, there are well over one hundred different dynamic single ropes (the most popular rope system in climbing). Kernmantle ropes are still used in sailing and other sports, but the technical requirements are usually not as rigorous for such purposes as for climbing. Small kernmantle ropes are commonly called accessory cords; they are often used to make prusik knots and loops or to attach accessories such as chalk bags.\n\nParagraph 7: Zebina made his debut for the club, starting the whole game, in a 4–1 win against ND Gorica in the first round of the UEFA Cup.

Three of his letters to his mother survive in this collection, but most of the references to him are contained in letters written to his mother and step-father in Calais by their London business agent John Husee, who advised them and made practical arrangements and who knew his way amongst court and legal circles. He studied Latin for 14 months under the parson of Colmer. In 1534 aged 16 he entered Lincoln's Inn to train in the law, where he remained until 1536. Much detail of his life as a trainee lawyer are preserved in the Lisle Papers, mainly in the letters from John Husee to Lord and Lady Lisle, concerning domestic matters such as the clothing he required, rent of his chambers, financial allowance, his recreations, etc. It was Husee who arranged for John's admittance to Lincoln's Inn and who found him a law tutor and chambers, and who advised John on his clothing requirements and how to decorate his chambers. John had his own servant who lived with him named \"Bremelcum\". Husee wrote the following letter to Lady Lisle on 27 January 1535:\"My humble duty premised unto your good ladyship...Mr Basset is all out of apparel. He hath never a good gown but one of chamlet the which was very ill-fashioned but it is now a'mending. His damask gown is nothing worth, but if it be possible it shall make him a jacket, for his coat of velvet was broken to guard his camlet gown. His satin jacket is meetly good and the other two nothing worth. His two doublets will serve, the third is but easy. He hath but one pair of white hosen and the kersey is not for him, therefore I have sent it by Edward Russell. More, he hath brought with him a feather bed, bolster, blankets, counterpoint and two pair of sheets. He must have another bed furnished with a pillow, tester, saye or other, with curtains. Madame, I intend to make him two pair of black hosen, a new gown of damask faced with foynes or genettes, and a study gown faced with fox pelts of cloth of five shillings the yard. His damask gown shall be guarded with velvet. And if I can compass it he shall have a gown of fine cloth furred with bogy, with a small guard of velvet; and his old damask gown shall make him a jacket. And this done he shall be well apparelled for this two years. He must have wood and coal in his chamber. And less than here written he cannot have to be anything likely apparelled as appertaineth to his birth...Bremelcum would have a new coat, for he hath but one...\"\n\nParagraph 2: Ewing's parents were both musical enthusiasts: her mother was a keen collector of classical recordings, and her father played the piano well enough to attract an audience of admiring neighbors. Ewing's own musical education began with piano lessons when she was thirteen. As well as playing solo piano pieces, she sometimes acted as an accompanist for one of her sisters, Frances, occasionally singing duets with her; their mother was sufficiently impressed by her voice to encourage her to complement her keyboard work by studying singing too. Coached by a local voice teacher, Ewing joined the alto section of the chorus at her Detroit high school—Jared W. Finney High School—and was soon participating in and winning singing competitions. When she was seventeen, she became a pupil of Marjorie Gordon, a coloratura soprano (not to be confused with an English Gilbert and Sullivan soprano of the same name). After only a year of teaching her, Gordon suggested that she should apply to take part in Oakland University's Meadow Brook Music Festival. She auditioned for the role of Maddalena in a production of Rigoletto that was to be conducted by a young James Levine. Their meeting proved to be wonderfully serendipitous: Levine was so struck by her expressive power that he assured her that she had the potential to become a major artist, while for her part, she found in him a teacher, mentor, guide, champion and friend. It was in order to study with Levine that she sought and won a scholarship at the Cleveland Institute of Music, where her other instructors included the soprano Eleanor Steber. And after her graduation in 1970, it was at Levine's urging that she continued her training in New York City as a private pupil of the great mezzo-soprano Jennie Tourel, supporting herself by working in offices and clothing stores.\n\nParagraph 3: He joined Bristol City as a youth player and was their number one goalkeeper in the early 1970s despite starting his career as a fullback. He made his debut for Bristol City against Southampton in the FA Cup in 1970. In the 1975–76 season, City were promoted to the First Division but Cashley lost his place to John Shaw soon afterwards and had only brief spells in the side for the remainder of his time with City. Cashley even scored a goal for City on 18 September 1973, with a long clearance from his own penalty area against Hull City on a gusty night. In total, he made 262 appearances, 227 of those in the league for The Robins.\n\nParagraph 4: Little is known about this new transfer student to Setsuna's class except that she is the princess of Adenbulk, the Western Oni World which are known as Zombie Oni and are constantly battling (and losing to) the Oni Royal Family (which Kanna and Rena are part of.) This is because the Oni Royal Family treats and thinks about the Zombie Oni as dirty, weak and not worth enough to even be considered servants.  With soulless eyes and long black hair that goes down to her legs, she has been tasked with the assassination of the two demon princesses under the orders of her father. Unlike the other Oni shown so far, she shows absolutely no desire to obtain the Banrikou Heart and only wishes to eliminate the White and Black Princess. Destroying the Banrikou Heart is only a means to prevent the princesses from receiving more power and the extreme humiliation they'd receive for failing to protect the heart. As a Royal Zombie Oni she is able to use Death Illusion, a spell that forces a target to experience their most feared death over and over until the day they die or the spell is removed by somebody else, with ease where other Oni would be hard pressed to even attempt much less control the spell. While stronger than Rena she is no match for Kanna. She develops a huge crush on Setsuna after he buys her lunch and saves her shortly after they met. As such she protects him from a minion after his heart and performs a special ritual known only to the Zombie Clan on him. Being more direct than Kanna or Rena with her feelings for him she keeps using rather aggressive, blunt and direct methods such as using the others as hostages if he doesn't go to her home and marry her. How her family and court are reacting to this is unknown. In her true form she doesn't take on an Oni's demonic appearance like the other princesses but looks just as she does in her human guise except for her skin turning a pale violet tinged grey and her hair turning silver. Although how is not explained her clothes also change to a dark purple frilled headband, black and grey plate mail boots, black and grey plate mail gauntlets covering her hands to upper arms, and an open dark purple coat over a white frilled dress with a ripped hem. She wields a double-edged, guardless greatsword and is a Power type Oni that excels in strength. While angry with how the Royal Oni Clan looks down on the Zombie Oni she is similar to Kanna in that she doesn't like using dishonorable means but prefers to fight head on at full power.\n\nParagraph 5: John's education is well recorded in the Lisle Papers, covering the period 1533 to 1540, held at the UK National Archives. Three of his letters to his mother survive in this collection, but most of the references to him are contained in letters written to his mother and step-father in Calais by their London business agent John Husee, who advised them and made practical arrangements and who knew his way amongst court and legal circles. He studied Latin for 14 months under the parson of Colmer. In 1534 aged 16 he entered Lincoln's Inn to train in the law, where he remained until 1536. Much detail of his life as a trainee lawyer are preserved in the Lisle Papers, mainly in the letters from John Husee to Lord and Lady Lisle, concerning domestic matters such as the clothing he required, rent of his chambers, financial allowance, his recreations, etc. It was Husee who arranged for John's admittance to Lincoln's Inn and who found him a law tutor and chambers, and who advised John on his clothing requirements and how to decorate his chambers. John had his own servant who lived with him named \"Bremelcum\". Husee wrote the following letter to Lady Lisle on 27 January 1535:\"My humble duty premised unto your good ladyship...Mr Basset is all out of apparel.

{"input": "", "context": "Paragraph 1: On November 16, 2001, after discussing the idea with the US State Department (who were not only supportive but offered financial assistance) Tahir lead a delegation to Pakistan \"to promote better understanding between Pakistan and the United States of America.\" The central points of the trip were to promote the idea that \"Pakistan's future development relies heavily on foreign investment, especially from the United States and the European Union\", \"to establish better awareness between the people of Pakistan and the USA\", and \"to inform Pakistanis that are many Americans who support fair policies towards Muslim nations.\" Tahir's press release stated that he \"feels that American citizens should know that the people in Pakistan care for them equally\" and that he believed that \"there are tremendous mis-impressions regarding how Pakistanis view Americans and vice versa.\" Which \"has resulted in lack of trust and confidence between the two peoples.\" The delegation visited Islamabad, Lahore, Karachi and Quetta. Press conferences were held with the local media with the facilitation of the US Embassy of Pakistan in Washington DC. The Pakistani Government also offered financial assistance, but both their and the State Dept.'s offers were politely declined and the mission was self-funded by the delegation. Tahir's personal goals for the delegation was to combat the sentiments in Pakistan that led some Pakistanis to burn American flags before the media. He held this \"can only infuriate Americans all over the world. This type of behavior does not promote the investments that can create jobs and lead to progress.\" He hoped the delegation could \"turn sentiments around as both Pakistan and the United States are now at the threshold of establishing a more durable and lasting relationship.\" In a press release by the United States Embassy, Tahir was quoted as saying \"Who is teaching Pakistanis about how good America is? There's been a relationship between the U.S. government and the government of Pakistan, but there has never been much people-to-people contact. We're going to tell Pakistanis how good a life, we as Muslims, live here in the U.S. Freedom of speech, freedom of religion, human rights, justice for all - this is exactly what Islam is.\" He expressed that \"he would like to see Pakistan develop the same level of tolerance and respect that he experiences in the United States, and he sees education as the key to that achievement. As a boy, he said, he spent an hour every morning in the madrassa, learning the Koran, and then went to school, where he studied mathematics and science for the rest of the day. 'We need education'.\"\n\nParagraph 2: In early February 2004, Chanté's third single, \"Bad Boy\", was released. It was also successful, breaking the Top 10 on radio and sitting at No. 3 on MuchMusic for 4 weeks before later earning the No. 1 position on the chart. The video was directed by Director X. Later, in June 2004, Chanté's fourth single \"Does He Love Me?\" ft. Foxy Brown reached top 5 at radio. The video was also directed by Director X and became No. 1 on MuchMusic for 3 weeks. The video also garnered her an Urban Music Video Award for \"Video of the Year\". On June 22, 2004, Chanté released her self-titled debut album. On December 3, 2004 it was certified gold. In October 2004, at the Canadian Urban Music Awards Chanté swept all three of her nominations, winning awards for \"Best New Artist\", \"Video of the Year\" (for Bad Boy), \"Fans' Choice Award\" and by surprise taking home the \"Rising Star of the Year\" award. This brought the attention of the President of BET, Stephen Hill, who became Chanté's mentor and putting the video for \"Bad Boy\" into heavy rotation.

We're going to tell Pakistanis how good a life, we as Muslims, live here in the U.S. Freedom of speech, freedom of religion, human rights, justice for all - this is exactly what Islam is.\" He expressed that \"he would like to see Pakistan develop the same level of tolerance and respect that he experiences in the United States, and he sees education as the key to that achievement. As a boy, he said, he spent an hour every morning in the madrassa, learning the Koran, and then went to school, where he studied mathematics and science for the rest of the day. 'We need education'.\"\n\nParagraph 14: The following morning the Away Team is invited to witness the execution of Ramsey and his followers. Moments after Riker rejects their invitation, Data makes contact and informs them that there is a 48-minute window in which Dr. Crusher has to find a cure and Riker must defuse the situation on the planet, before the ship must leave for the Neutral Zone. On the planet, Ramsey and his men are prepared to be executed by disintegration despite Ariel's pleas, while Dr. Crusher discovers a cure for the virus. Riker is prepared to have the away team and the Odin survivors beamed to the Enterprise, then attempts to dissuade Beata, stating their execution is only bound to create martyrs which would only worsen her situation. Beata reconsiders, then announces that she will stay the execution but Ramsey, his men, their families, and any others that support them, are to be banished to the far side of the planet. She explains that their banishment will not stop the fall of the oligarchy, but will slow it down enough that Beata will not be around to see its end. She then compliments Riker on his wisdom, a surprise to her for a mere male.\n\nParagraph 15: In early February 2004, Chanté's third single, \"Bad Boy\", was released. It was also successful, breaking the Top 10 on radio and sitting at No. 3 on MuchMusic for 4 weeks before later earning the No. 1 position on the chart. The video was directed by Director X. Later, in June 2004, Chanté's fourth single \"Does He Love Me?\" ft. Foxy Brown reached top 5 at radio. The video was also directed by Director X and became No. 1 on MuchMusic for 3 weeks. The video also garnered her an Urban Music Video Award for \"Video of the Year\". On June 22, 2004, Chanté released her self-titled debut album. On December 3, 2004 it was certified gold. In October 2004, at the Canadian Urban Music Awards Chanté swept all three of her nominations, winning awards for \"Best New Artist\", \"Video of the Year\" (for Bad Boy), \"Fans' Choice Award\" and by surprise taking home the \"Rising Star of the Year\" award. This brought the attention of the President of BET, Stephen Hill, who became Chanté's mentor and putting the video for \"Bad Boy\" into heavy rotation.  In that same month, she sang the national anthem at the Canadian Football League's Grey Cup championship game.

Among Herberger's moves credited with helping the team in the final are: fielding a below strength and largely out-of-position team in the first match against Hungary, to disguise the team's strengths; giving Fritz Walter defensive help, so he could concentrate his energies on attacking; and instructing his team to attack the Hungarian penalty area from the wings, instead of down the middle.\n\nParagraph 17: Robert John Riggins (born August 4, 1949), nicknamed \"Riggo\" and \"Diesel\", is an American former professional football player who was a fullback in the National Football League (NFL) for the New York Jets and Washington Redskins. He played college football for the Kansas Jayhawks. He was known for his powerful running style and productivity well into the latter years of his career: in 1983 at age 34, he rushed for an NFL single-season record 24 touchdowns and again led the league in rushing touchdowns the following year at age 35. Although he earned only one Pro Bowl appearance in his career, Riggins had his greatest success in the postseason and was named the Most Valuable Player of Super Bowl XVII where he scored one touchdown and rushed for 166 yards in a 27–17 win for the Washington Redskins over the Miami Dolphins.

Its legendary Golden Team, also known as the Mighty Magyars, had not lost a match in four years. They were the reigning Olympic Champion and had won the Central European International Cup in 1953. Once the World Cup started, Hungary had been dominant, outscoring their opponents 17–3 in their two group games while West Germany had been outscored 9–7. In their match against each other, Hungary had won 8–3. The final was played in heavy rain. Hungary scored an early goal and minutes later doubled their lead.

{"input": "", "context": "Paragraph 1:  Arishem appears in Eternals, voiced by David Kaye. He is the Prime Celestial, credited for creating the first Sun and bringing light to the universe. His purpose is to expand the universe, which requires having to sacrifice lesser life forms to do so. Millions of years ago, Arishem created the Deviants to aid in Celestial births. But when his creations went rogue, the Judge created the race of Eternals using the World Forge to combat the Deviants who were interfering in his work. One such world Arishem sent his Eternals to was Earth to ensure the birth of Tiamut. Arishem communicated directly with Ajak on Earth. After her death at the hands of the Deviants, he instead made contact with Sersi, informing her of the Eternals' true purpose, the fact that the Eternals being from the planet Olympia was untrue, and to ensure the emergence takes place. However, the group grew attached to Earth and worked to stop the emergence and prevent the death of humanity. After they prevented the emergence, Arishem pulled Sersi, Kingo, and Phastos into space to study their memories and to judge if humanity was worth preserving, agreeing to spare the people of Earth if they are.\n\nParagraph 2: Reference groups provide the benchmarks and contrast needed for comparison and evaluation of group and personal characteristics. Robert K. Merton hypothesized that individuals compare themselves with reference groups of people who occupy the social role to which the individual aspires.[Merton] developed a theory of the reference group (i.e., the group to which individuals compare themselves, which is not necessarily a group to which those individuals belong), and elaborated on the concepts of in-group and out-group. For any group of people there are always other groups whom they look upon to and aspire to be like them.Such groups act as a frame of reference to which people always refer to evaluate their achievements, their role performance, aspirations and ambitions. A reference group can be either from a membership group or non-membership group. An example of a reference group being used would be the determination of affluence. An individual in the U.S. with an annual income of $80,000, may consider themself affluent if they compare themself to those in the middle of the income strata, who earn roughly $32,000 a year.  If, however, the same person considers the relevant reference group to be those in the top 0.1% of households in the US, those making $1.6 million or more, then the individual's income of $80,000 would make them consider themself as rather poor.\n\nParagraph 3: Joseph and Janice Nicolich were on their way to their son's wedding in Salt Lake City, Utah, on June 28, 1996. They were on Interstate 80, near Sidney, Nebraska in their Chrysler Town & Country van. Joe was driving, his wife was in the passenger seat, and their granddaughter, Robyn Griffiths (1985–1996), was in the rear seat. It was raining and Joe saw a car stationary at the side of the road with its flashers on. He was pulling onto the shoulder and slowed down to approximately  when he was hit from behind. Robyn Griffiths and Janice Winblad Nicolich were killed.\n\nParagraph 4: Old Highfield was established in the 1930s, and it comprises 3 distinct areas, namely The 2 Pounds, 5 Pounds, 12 Pounds and The Stands. The most affluent parts of Highfield are the two areas of Old Highfield; The Stands and the 5 Pounds. The Stands are so named because when first sold, the area was a greenfield and residents had to build houses of their choices; this is in comparison to the other areas of Highfield where the government had built low-cost basic housing for the natives and sold it at reflective prices. Historically, the yards here are very large and the houses, flamboyant and indulgent to reflect the affluent status of the black Rhodesians who settled here. Black Rhodesians who, even if they afforded, could not buy properties outside African designated areas, naturally settled there. Some of the famous Zimbabweans to own properties here include musician Innocent Utsiwegota's family, the Mwaera family, the Tawengwa family and Robert Mugabe. The 5 Pounds area is so named because the houses here were priced at 5 Rhodesian pounds when first sold, compared to the average of 2 pounds in other areas as reflected in the 2 Pounds name. The 2 Pounds area is relatively deprived in comparison to the other two.\n\nParagraph 5: Reference groups provide the benchmarks and contrast needed for comparison and evaluation of group and personal characteristics.

Prior to the production of local films, most of those shown were of European origin. By this year, the business had spread and permanent theaters had appeared at various municipalities including San Juan, Mayagüez and Ponce. Some cinemas were established in municipalities like San Juan and Ponce. The first attempt took place in 1912, when Juan Emilio Viguié began filming the daily life of the Ponceños with a Pathé camera. His films were shown at Cine Habana, where he worked and producing them required a revelation technique that he invented. Francisco Maymón made the second attempt, beginning a film based on the legends surrounding pirate captain Roberto Cofresí, but complications prevented the culmination of the project. Rafael Colorado, the owner of the first film rental on the island, would create the first film of its class when he filmed Un drama en Puerto Rico, which was able to recover its $700 investment in its first showing. These early attempts gathered general interest and lead to the formal creation of a local film industry, leading to the creation of the Sociedad Industrial Cine Puerto Rico in March 1916. Its creators, Colorado and Antonio Capella would employ actual jíbaros in their country film, Por la hembra y por el gallo, as had been the case in the former's first production. The film debuted at Cine Tres Banderas with tickets being sold at 50 cents. This company would produce religious film El milagro de la Virgen, Mafia en Puerta de Tierra, among others. However, insufficient funding and foreign competition lead to the ceasing of functions. Colorado was also involved in the filming of political activities involving José de Diego and Luis Muñoz Rivera.\n\nParagraph 10: both forks.

Gruev was elected as chairman of this Congress, and the latter decided that the day of the declaration of the insurrection was to be 2 August 1903.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has received reports of approximately 8500 animal deaths, including at least 1950 cats and 2200 dogs who have died after eating contaminated food, but have only confirmed 14 cases, in part because there is no centralized government database of animal sickness or death in the United States as there are with humans (such as the Centers for Disease Control). For this reason, many sources speculate the full extent of the pet deaths and sicknesses caused by the contamination may never be known. In October, the results of the \"AAVLD survey of pet food-induced nephrotoxicity in North America, April to June 2007,\" were reported, indicating 347 of 486 cases voluntarily reported by 6 June 2007 had met the diagnostic criteria, with most of the cases reported from the United States, but also including cases of 20 dogs and 7 cats reported from Canada.The cases involved 235 cats and 112 dogs, with 61 percent of the cats and 74 percent of the dogs having died. Dr. Barbara Powers, AAVLD president and director of the Colorado State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory, said the survey probably found only a percentage of the actual cases. She also said the mortality rate is not likely to be representative of all cases, because survey respondents had more information to submit for animals that had died. A number of dogs were also reported affected in Australia, with four in Melbourne and a few more in Sydney. No legal action or repercussions have as yet occurred regarding these cases. Dr. Powers elaborated further: “But there absolutely could be more deaths from the tainted pet food.... This survey didn’t catch all the deaths that happened. In order to be counted in our survey, you had to meet certain criteria.... If someone had a pet that died and they buried it in their back[yard], they weren’t eligible for our survey. We had to have confirmed exposure to the recalled pet food, proof of toxicity, and clinical signs of kidney failure. So this is only a percentage of the deaths that are out there.

England batted first and amassed 494, largely on the back of Wally Hammond's 240. Brown featured in an opening stand of 69 before Fingleton was dismissed. Hedley Verity then bowled Bradman for 18, leaving the score at 101, before Stan McCabe fell after a quickfire 38 with the score at 3/152. Brown registered his century in 193 minutes, during an innings highlighted by his driving on both sides of the wicket. After Lindsay Hassett was dismissed for 56 following a 134-run partnership, Australia reached stumps at 5/299, with Brown on 140. The following day, Brown set about ensuring that Australia would avoid the follow on, featuring in an aggressive eighth-wicket stand with tailender Bill O'Reilly. The pair added 85 runs in just 46 minutes, with Brown recalling \"It was a nice day, and a nice wicket. O'Reilly came in, and I told him I'd take the quicks—Wellard and Farnes—and Tiger [O'Reilly] took Verity.\" Brown continued past his double century and remained unbeaten on 206 from just 375 minutes when his last partner fell, leaving Australia all out for 422. Brown's innings was the 100th century by an Australian against England, and the highest Test score for a batsman carrying his bat; it stood until Glenn Turner made an unbeaten 223 in 1972. Ray Robinson quipped that Brown's performance \"did not cause smoke to rise from the back of those [television] sets but the charm of his style gave viewers a favourable impression of Australian batsmanship\". They went on to draw the match, which was crucial in Australia's eventual retention of the Ashes.

The generational garbage collector minimises most collection pauses, but may not be suitable for hard real-time and determinism requirements, as long full collections may occur, which may stop the world for tens to hundreds of milliseconds, proportional to heap size. However, garbage collection is preferable over manual memory management in an object-oriented language, and the programmer can take various actions to control when and for how long garbage collection occurs; so under most circumstances, garbage collection is not a concern.\n\nParagraph 9: He left Thessaloniki and went to Smilevo where the insurrectionary Congress was to be held. The purpose of this Congress was to set the date for the declaration of the general insurrection and to outline the methods and tactics in its prosecution. Here Gruev met Boris Sarafov, who had just arrived from Bulgaria. Gruev was elected as chairman of this Congress, and the latter decided that the day of the declaration of the insurrection was to be 2 August 1903. Gruev, Boris Sarafov, and Anastas Lozanchev were elected by the Congress as the three members of the General Staff and empowered to direct the insurrectionary forces in the Bitola region. Gruev lived to see the retreat of the Turkish troops from his native village of Smilevo. He was engaged, during the course of the insurrection, in numerous skirmishes with the Ottoman Army. But with the arrival of Ottoman troops, any progress of the insurrection was made impossible and in a period of six weeks, it was completely crushed. Gruev put himself on the task of touring various revolutionary districts, disarming the insurgents, and storing up the war materials for future use. Gruev and his followers continued the work of organization and preparation for another uprising.\n\nParagraph 10: By the end of March, veterinary organizations reported more than 100 pet deaths amongst nearly 500 cases of kidney failure, and experts expected the death toll to number in the thousands, with one online database already self-reporting as many as 3,600 deaths as of 11 April. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has received reports of approximately 8500 animal deaths, including at least 1950 cats and 2200 dogs who have died after eating contaminated food, but have only confirmed 14 cases, in part because there is no centralized government database of animal sickness or death in the United States as there are with humans (such as the Centers for Disease Control). For this reason, many sources speculate the full extent of the pet deaths and sicknesses caused by the contamination may never be known. In October, the results of the \"AAVLD survey of pet food-induced nephrotoxicity in North America, April to June 2007,\" were reported, indicating 347 of 486 cases voluntarily reported by 6 June 2007 had met the diagnostic criteria, with most of the cases reported from the United States, but also including cases of 20 dogs and 7 cats reported from Canada.The cases involved 235 cats and 112 dogs, with 61 percent of the cats and 74 percent of the dogs having died. Dr. Barbara Powers, AAVLD president and director of the Colorado State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory, said the survey probably found only a percentage of the actual cases. She also said the mortality rate is not likely to be representative of all cases, because survey respondents had more information to submit for animals that had died. A number of dogs were also reported affected in Australia, with four in Melbourne and a few more in Sydney. No legal action or repercussions have as yet occurred regarding these cases. Dr. Powers elaborated further: “But there absolutely could be more deaths from the tainted pet food.... This survey didn’t catch all the deaths that happened. In order to be counted in our survey, you had to meet certain criteria.... If someone had a pet that died and they buried it in their back[yard], they weren’t eligible for our survey. We had to have confirmed exposure to the recalled pet food, proof of toxicity, and clinical signs of kidney failure. So this is only a percentage of the deaths that are out there. There’s no way to guess how many pets were affected.”", "answers": ["5"], "length": 3224, "dataset": "passage_count_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "bf1b0a93802e558790a7ecacb1c167698cd8b5158104ca69"}
{"input": "", "context": "Paragraph 1: The Pre-Sequel!, set after the first Borderlands and before the second one, explores Jack's rise to power. Jack (also known as John) is introduced as a low-ranking programmer who, despite the animosity of Hyperion CEO Harold Tassiter towards him, has managed to obtain command of the Helios station. Jack intends to unlock a Vault on Pandora's moon Elpis, and to this end hires six Vault Hunters: Wilhelm, Nisha, Athena, Claptrap, Aurelia Hammerlock, and one of his body doubles, Timothy Lawrence. However, Helios is invaded by the Lost Legion, and Jack and the Vault Hunters are forced to evacuate to Elpis. The leader of the Lost Legion, Colonel Tungsteena Zarpedon, takes control of the Eye of Helios laser, and uses it to begin destroying Elpis, claiming that it is for the greater good. Jack begins a campaign to retake the station; he destroys a jamming signal disabling Helios' defense systems and confronts the corrupt Meriff of Concordia who was working for Zarpedon. Although Jack initially spares the Meriff, the Meriff shoots at him when his back is turned, leading Jack to kill him, now deciding that mercy is a weakness. Jack then creates a robot army, using the AI Felicity as its core, but the Vault Hunters are forced to destroy her when she becomes unwilling to be used as a weapon. With the aid of Mad Moxxi, Roland, and Lilith, Jack and the Vault Hunters then invade Helios Station, kill Zarpedon, and retake the station. However, Roland and Lilith betray the group at the behest of Moxxi, who believes that Jack is dangerous and not the hero he claims to be; they destroy the Eye of Helios and nearly kill Jack and the Vault Hunters. The group heads to the Elpis Vault to exact revenge. They enter the Vault, kill the alien Eridian guardians protecting it, and discover an ancient artifact. Jack uses the artifact and gains knowledge of a powerful Vault monster sealed in Pandora that will obey whoever unseals it. Lilith teleports in and punches the artifact into Jack's face, severely disfiguring him before disappearing; Jack proclaims his intention to take control of the monster and raze Pandora. He murders Tassiter, takes control of Hyperion, and renames himself Handsome Jack. Wilhelm and Nisha remain his top enforcers, Claptrap is betrayed, shot, and left for dead and his entire product line is wiped out, while Athena becomes disgusted with him and leaves his employ.\n\nParagraph 2: He was subsequently cast as the title role in director Mark Rydell's 2001 TV biographical film James Dean. To immerse himself in the role, Franco went from being a non-smoker to smoking two packs of cigarettes a day, bleached his dark brown hair blond, and learned to ride a motorcycle as well as play guitar and the bongos. To have a greater understanding of Dean, Franco spent hours with two of Dean's associates. Other research included reading books on Dean and studying his movies. While filming James Dean, Franco, to get into character, cut off communication with his family and friends, as well as his then-girlfriend. \"It was a very lonely existence,\" he notes. \"If I wasn't on a set, I was watching James Dean. That was my whole thinking. James Dean. James Dean.\" Despite already being a fan of Dean, Franco feared he might be typecast if he'd captured the actor too convincingly. Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly wrote: \"Franco could have walked through the role and done a passable Dean, but instead gets under the skin of this insecure, rootless young man.\" He received a Golden Globe Award and nominations for an Emmy Award and a Screen Actors Guild Award (SAG).\n\nParagraph 3: Analysis of the genomes of Mollicutes (\"mycoplasmas\") gives solid support for the hypothesis that Mollicutes have developed from Gram-positive bacteria by a process of reductive evolution. By adopting a parasitic mode of life with use of nutrients from their hosts, many Mollicutes were able to reduce their genetic material considerably. On the other hand, they lost the genes for many assimilative processes. Thus, Mycoplasma possibly became the smallest self-replicating organism in nature. Mycoplasma genitalium, with 580,000 base pairs, has an especially small genome size. Some phytoplasmas also have a very small genome size. The genera with the smallest genome are considered to be phylogenetically the most \"recent\" mollicutes.\n\nParagraph 4: Isaac Le Maire sold his property in Amsterdam and retired to his possessions in Egmond aan den Hoef, which he had bought between 1598 and 1600 from the estate of the Count of Egmont. After some time, he again started to make plans to break the VOC monopoly. The VOC owned by patent from the States-General the Dutch monopoly on travels to the Indies via the Cape of Good Hope and through the Strait of Magellan, until then the only two known passages to the Indies. From various travel accounts Le Maire assumed that south of the Magellan Strait another passage from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean could exist. In 1614 he founded the Austraalse Compagnie for the purpose of discovering this passage, which would fall outside the VOC monopoly. The voyage was prepared in Hoorn. Two ships were fitted out, the Eendracht and the Hoorn. The journey would be made under the responsibility of his son Jacob Le Maire. Willem Schouten was recruited as an experienced captain. The sailing orders expressly forbade a passage through the Strait of Magellan, even if a new route to the Pacific Ocean could not be found. Furthermore, the expedition was forbidden to trade on the coasts where the VOC had a trading post. At that time, there was still the expectation that a great unknown South Land would exist. Isaac Le Maire hoped to discover it, and in this way tap into an unimagined trading area. But above all, his motive was to circumvent the VOC monopoly. But Isaac gave his son a remarkable secret instruction: although the official sailing order was that no trade should be driven on the coasts where the VOC was established, on arrival in the Indies his son had to make clear to the administrators of the VOC that their monopoly had not been violated, because they had not sailed via the Cape of Good Hope or the Strait of Magellan. Then, he should ask permission to still be allowed to trade. Isaac le Maire anticipated it would not be granted, so Jacob would then have to do everything needed to win Governor-General Gerard Reynst, who had been, like Isaac Le Maire, a participant in the Brabant Company, for their cause. This even went so far as to Jacob asking Van Reynst the hand of one of his daughters. In this way Isaac le Maire tried to sow dissension within the VOC, because if Gerard Reynst allowed them to trade in this way it could lead to a major conflict within the VOC.\n\nParagraph 5: Jon Silkin was born in London, in a Litvak Jewish family, his parents were Joseph Silkin and Doris Rubenstein. His grandparents were all from the Lithuanian- part of the Russian Empire. His uncle was Lewis Silkin, 1st Baron Silkin. He was named Jon after Jon Forsyte in The Forsyte Saga, and attended Wycliffe College and Dulwich College During the Second World War he was one of the children evacuated from London (in his case, to Wales); he remembered that he \"roamed the countryside incessantly\" while in Wales, collecting \"fool's gold\" and exploring old Roman mines. For a period of about six years in the 1950s, after National Service, he supported himself by manual labour and other menial jobs. By 1956 he rented the top-floor flat at 10, Compayne Gardens, Hampstead, (), the house of Bernice Rubens, who later won the Booker Prize, and her husband Rudolf Nassauer, also a published novelist, later. Silkin, in turn, sublet rooms to, among others, David Mercer, later a prolific TV and West End dramatist, and Malcolm Ross-Macdonald, then a diploma student at the Slade and later a novelist; his first novel, The Big Waves (Cape, 1962) is a roman à clef of life in that flat, in which Silkin features as Somes Arenstein. All three men lived by teaching English as a foreign language at the St Giles School of English in Oxford Street.\n\nParagraph 6: He was subsequently cast as the title role in director Mark Rydell's 2001 TV biographical film James Dean.

The IRA is held at a custodian institution such as a bank or brokerage, and may be invested in anything that the custodian allows (for instance, a bank may allow certificates of deposit, and a brokerage may allow stocks and mutual funds). Unlike the Roth IRA, the only criterion for being eligible to contribute to a traditional IRA is sufficient income to make the contribution. However, the best provision of a traditional IRA — the tax-deductibility of contributions — has strict eligibility requirements based on income, filing status, and availability of other retirement plans (mandated by the Internal Revenue Service). Transactions in the account, including interest, dividends, and capital gains, are not subject to tax while still in the account, but upon withdrawal from the account, withdrawals are subject to federal income tax (see below for details). This is in contrast to a Roth IRA, in which contributions are never tax-deductible, but qualified withdrawals are tax free. The traditional IRA also has more restrictions on withdrawals than a Roth IRA. With both types of IRA, transactions inside the account (including capital gains, dividends, and interest) incur no tax liability.\n\nParagraph 8: Isaac Le Maire sold his property in Amsterdam and retired to his possessions in Egmond aan den Hoef, which he had bought between 1598 and 1600 from the estate of the Count of Egmont.

As a maximum, if the longer ancestry from Luke is used, there are 43 generations between Jesse and Jesus. The identity of the figures also varies, and may not be specified, but Solomon and David are usually included, and often all shown wear crowns. Most Jesse Trees include Mary immediately beneath the figure of Jesus (or, in the Gothic period, show a Virgin and Child), emphasising that she was the means by which the shoot of Jesse was born. See for example, Sermon 24 of St Leo the Great: \"In which rod, no doubt the blessed Virgin Mary is predicted, who sprung from the stock of Jesse and David and fecundated by the Holy Ghost, brought forth a new flower of human flesh, becoming a virgin-mother\".  Saint Joseph is rarely shown, although unlike Mary he is a link in the Gospel genealogies. It was believed in the Middle Ages that the House of David could only marry within itself, and that she was independently descended from Jesse. Sometimes Jesus and other figures are shown in the cups of flowers, as the fruit or blossom of the Tree.\n\nParagraph 10: As biographers noted, in his youth, Zinoviev was seized with the desire to \"build a new world\" and faith in a \"bright future\", he was fascinated by dreams of social justice, the ideas of equality and collectivism, material asceticism; his idols were Spartacus, Robespierre, Decembrists and Populists. As Konstantin Krylov wrote, the ideas corresponded to his personal experience: Zinoviev recalled that \"he was a beggar among beggars\", emphasizing that the communist utopia was the idea of beggars. On the one hand, the social, cultural and economic changes that occurred in the 1930s contributed to optimism; on the other hand, Alexander noticed and increasing inequality, saw how families of party and state officials live; drew attention to the fact that in the advancement of the social scale the most successful were activists, demagogues, talkers and scammers; observed the discrimination of the peasants in comparison with the working class, the degradation of the village and the formation of the new \"serfdom\" of the collective farms, which he witnessed when he came on holidays in Pakhtino. Impressed by the famous book of Radishchev, he wanted to write an accusatory \"Journey from Chukhloma to Moscow\"; in 1935, after the promulgation of the draft Stalin constitution, he jokingly made up a fictional constitution in which \"idlers and stupids\" had \"the right to the same marks as the honors pupils\" (the story caused a school scandal, but the matter was hushed up). As Pavel Fokin writes, \"the exploits and meanness\" of Soviet society, the contradictions and problems of everyday life provoked a \"spiritual rebellion\". According to the interpretation of Konstantin Krylov, disappointment in the practical implementation of the ideals of communism did not encourage young Zinoviev to deny the very idea of communism, or to search for other ideals. He chose the third way, concluding that evil is inevitably inherent in the social world, and that this world is essentially evil. This position later influenced his sociology.\n\nParagraph 11: The number of figures depicted varies greatly, depending on the amount of room available for the design.

The picture that emerges is one of severe hardship, where prisoners are kept on a starvation diet, overworked and harshly punished for minor infractions of camp rules. We know of cases where prisoners have been beaten to death, confined to dark cells or in ditches dug around the perimeters of the camps and executed for attempting escape. A common form of punishment is confinement to the CONEX boxes—air-freight containers that were left behind by the United States in 1975. The boxes vary in size; some are made of wood and others of metal. In a CONEX box 4 feet high and 4 feet wide, for example, several prisoners would be confined with their feet shackled, and allowed only one bowl of rice and water a day. \"It reminded me of the pictures I saw of Nazi camp inmates after World War II,\" said a physician we interviewed who witnessed the release of four prisoners who had been confined to a CONEX box for one month. None of them survived.\"\n\nParagraph 14: Isaac Le Maire sold his property in Amsterdam and retired to his possessions in Egmond aan den Hoef, which he had bought between 1598 and 1600 from the estate of the Count of Egmont.

{"input": "", "context": "Paragraph 1: \"I Was Here When the Woods Were Burnt\" is the first publication of the Texas Folklore Society. This account appears in a 1946 TFS sheet and the 1925 reprint of Happy Hunting Ground. Happy Hunting Ground is a \"collection of popular folklore from Central and South America, including Mexican ballads, primitive art, cowboy dances, reptile myths, superstitions, Indian pictographs, and other folktales.\" The piece was originally a speech given during the twenty-fifth anniversary of the organization in April 20, 1934 by then President Leonidas Warren Payne. This piece's presentation at the Founders' Day dinner in the Union Building at the University of Texas marked the perseverance and accomplishments of the Society. In the speech, Payne narrates the inception of the Texas Folklore Society, which began as a conversation between himself and John Avery Lomax in 1909, after a Thanksgiving collegiate football game. Interestingly, he uses racially charged language to detail the brilliance of their plan by comparing themselves to African-American children. In reference he states, \"I think the case is somewhat similar to that of the two little darkies sitting snuggled up to each other... One said to the other, 'Who's sweet?' and the other replied, 'Bofe uv us!'. Thus, they regarded themselves as elite, white, and intelligent subjects--thus, these became the very individuals they sought after to join the Society. Afterwards, they determined academia to be the necessary elite space to gather folklorist whom document Texas culture they proceeded to draft a charter for the organization. All in all, the speech's symbolism placed Payne at the origin of the Society, thus firmly founding its prosperity. This speech reflects the lack of diversity in membership, as many proceeding publications depicted racial stereotypes. Yet, in response to these claims, editor J. Franke Dobie stated, \"It is none of the editors business\". Despite TFS writers becoming the \"most educated and sophisticated people of their time and culture\" they knowingly distributed accounts that justified the racial hierarchy.\n\nParagraph 2: Although best known for his work in costume dramas, Sewell prefers \"cravat-less\" roles in modern pieces, such as the role of Petruchio in the BBC's 2005 version of Shakespeare's The Taming of the Shrew. This was shown as part of the ShakespeaRe-Told series, and the role earned him a Best Actor nomination at the 2006 BAFTA Television Awards. In this modern retelling of the story, the action moves from 17th century Padua, Italy to 21st century London. This production marked the fourth time that Sewell had acted in a work based on a Shakespeare play since becoming a professional actor: he previously portrayed Hotspur in Henry IV, Part 1 in 1995, Fortinbras in Hamlet in 1996 and the title role in Macbeth in 1999. The role also reunited him with his Charles II co-star Shirley Henderson.\n\nParagraph 3: Two years before, the Seljuk sultan Mahmud II had named his cadet son Alp-Arslan as overlord of Zengi, but the latter had neutralized him and carried with him at the siege. At Zengi's death, Alp-Arslan tried to exploit the ensuing disorder to gain the power in Mosul. Two of Zengi's advisors, the head of the diwan al-Din Muhammad Jemal and hajab  Amir Salah al-Din Muhammad al-Yaghisiyani took the side of Saif ad-Din: taking advantage of the inexperience of the young Seljuk, giving Saif ad-Din the time necessary to take control of Mosul. When Alp Arslan appeared in Mosul, he was arrested and imprisoned in the citadel.\n\nParagraph 4: The bill was initiated in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina when the abandonment of many thousands of pets and other animals brought the matter of animal welfare to national attention. In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, the Bush administration conducted a review of public relief efforts and where the infrastructure in place at the time failed. The Pets Evacuation and Transportation Act served as an amendment to section 403 of Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act. which had been in place since November 23, 1988 with no previous amendments. PETS was put in place to ensure that upon major disaster or emergency,  FEMA has authorization to give shelter and care to people with service animals as well as household pets. Two other documents were involved in the activation of the PETS Act. These documents were Post Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act and National Response Framework. The PKERA made FEMA the sole agency responsible for national emergency response, while the National Response Framework was used to identify how the national government, along with communities and states would execute well coordinated national responses to disasters and emergencies. PERKA was signed into law August 3, 2006. National Response Framework amendments were finished October 4, 2006. To determine when the PETS Act would be activated, FEMA developed a policy titled Eligible Costs Related to Pet Evacuations and Sheltering. This policy operationally defined the terms household pet, service animal, and congregate household pet shelter. The policy states that only local and state governments are eligible to participate in the rescue and shelter of pets for reimbursement. The policy also states that private nonprofit groups can not be reimbursed directly. The bill's primary proposer, Tom Lantos, indicated that a press picture of a child being separated from his dog was the bill's catalyst;  \"The dog was taken away from this little boy, and to watch his face was a singularly revealing and tragic experience. This legislation was born at that moment.\" On the congressional record for the bill, he explained more fully:The scene from New Orleans of a 9-year-old little boy crying because he was not allowed to take his little white dog Snowball was too much to bear. Personally, I know I wouldn't have been able to leave my little white dog Masko to a fate of almost certain death. As I watched the images of the heartbreaking choices the gulf residents had to make, I was moved to find a way to prevent this from ever happening again.\n\nParagraph 5: The bill was initiated in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina when the abandonment of many thousands of pets and other animals brought the matter of animal welfare to national attention.

This account appears in a 1946 TFS sheet and the 1925 reprint of Happy Hunting Ground. Happy Hunting Ground is a \"collection of popular folklore from Central and South America, including Mexican ballads, primitive art, cowboy dances, reptile myths, superstitions, Indian pictographs, and other folktales.\" The piece was originally a speech given during the twenty-fifth anniversary of the organization in April 20, 1934 by then President Leonidas Warren Payne. This piece's presentation at the Founders' Day dinner in the Union Building at the University of Texas marked the perseverance and accomplishments of the Society. In the speech, Payne narrates the inception of the Texas Folklore Society, which began as a conversation between himself and John Avery Lomax in 1909, after a Thanksgiving collegiate football game. Interestingly, he uses racially charged language to detail the brilliance of their plan by comparing themselves to African-American children. In reference he states, \"I think the case is somewhat similar to that of the two little darkies sitting snuggled up to each other... One said to the other, 'Who's sweet?' and the other replied, 'Bofe uv us!'. Thus, they regarded themselves as elite, white, and intelligent subjects--thus, these became the very individuals they sought after to join the Society. Afterwards, they determined academia to be the necessary elite space to gather folklorist whom document Texas culture they proceeded to draft a charter for the organization. All in all, the speech's symbolism placed Payne at the origin of the Society, thus firmly founding its prosperity.

Arthur, a rather suspect fellow with an interest in cigarette card collecting and women-watching, sits next to Beryl and starts to relate his story of his likes and dislikes. Beryl is understandably quite disturbed by this, and proceeds in leaving her current bench and going to sit with Charles. Beryl is a young woman with a husband who beats her, and so she tells Charles this story and reads out a letter from the \"bastard\". Charles becomes quite sick of hearing this, so excuses himself and goes to sit next to man-hating dog-loving Doreen. Charles is an old business man on the verge of bankruptcy and so has no time for the youth of today. He reminisces on a happier time with his wife and children and asks Doreen to help him decipher his business report. Doreen is at this point very scared of the man who she thinks is perving on her, and so she sits next to Ernest. Ernest at this point is happily relaxing on his bench and so is very annoyed with being disturbed by a paranoid woman who starts to harp on about her dog. Doreen relates the story of taking her dog to the vets to get the snip, which is not a topic Ernest is interested in so he sneaks off leaving Doreen talking to herself. Ernest then collapses on the bench where Arthur is and proceeds in taking it over whilst moaning about his wife. The scene ends with each character trying to get the attention of the person they were trying to talk to, but failing.

{"input": "", "context": "Paragraph 1: The North American least shrew (Cryptotis parvus) is one of the smallest mammals, growing to be only up to 3 inches long. It has a long pointed snout and a tail never more than twice the length of its hind foot. The dense fur coat is either grayish-brown or reddish-brown with a white belly. Its fur becomes lighter in the summer and darker in the winter. Although similar in appearance to several species of rodents, all shrews are members of the order Eulipotyphla and should not be mistaken for a member of the order Rodentia. The North American least shrew's eyes are small and its ears are completely concealed within its short fur, giving it very poor eyesight and hearing.\n\nParagraph 2: Stuyvesant, however, with his 1656 ordinance against illegal religious meetings, had formally banned the practice of all religions outside of the Dutch Reformed Church, the established church of the Netherlands, in the colony. His often-derided decision flew against the approximately hundred-year development of religious tolerance in the Netherlands. During this time the country was revolting against Spanish rule, rebelling against an imposed Inquisition, attempting to form a national identity, and trying to unify Calvinist and Catholic provinces. The Dutch toleration debates were lengthy, bumpy, heated, and full of political intrigue and even assassination. The writer Thomas Broderick states, \"I believe the true Dutch legacy is not one of toleration but of discussion. New Amsterdam and the Republic show us that a robust, open public discourse is the surest way to eventual social improvement. Toleration and acceptance are political and moral imperatives, and the Flushing remonstrance and great Dutch toleration debates in Europe and North America teach us that social change takes time, open dialogue, disagreement, and failure before progress is to be made.\"\n\nParagraph 3: Stuyvesant, however, with his 1656 ordinance against illegal religious meetings, had formally banned the practice of all religions outside of the Dutch Reformed Church, the established church of the Netherlands, in the colony.

From there they flew to Famagusta, Cyprus, via Haifa, and back. On 18 July they left Aboukir, making the return journey via Suda Bay, Corfu and Malta, Italy and France, arriving back at Cattewater on 30 July, having flown . The purpose of the flight was to show that the aircraft were capable of extended operations independent of bases or a parent ship. It also tested the reliability of wireless communications, with both aircraft being in constant communication with land stations for the exchange of location and weather information. On 19 April 1927 Livock was posted to Headquarters, Coastal Area, and on 17 May to the Far East Flight, based at Felixstowe. Livock was sent out to reconnoitre suitable landing places between India and Australia for another long-distance flight, returning to England in September 1927. On 17 October 1927 four Supermarine Southamptons set off from Cattewater. The flight was under the command of Group Captain Henry Cave-Browne-Cave, with Livock as his second-in-command. The aircraft had been fitted with anodized Duralumin hulls and Leitner-Watts steel propellers, rather than the wooden ones of the standard aircraft. They were also fitted with cooking and sleeping facilities inside, and also carried hammocks and awnings for use in tropical climates. They followed the course of the 1926 flight to Egypt, then across Iraq to the Persian Gulf, and followed the northern coast of the Indian Ocean to Karachi, around the coast of India to Ceylon, and around the Bay of Bengal to Burma, and down the Malay Peninsula, finally arriving at Singapore on 28 February. The flight left Singapore on 21 May, flying via Batavia and Surabaya to Kupang in Timor from where on 1 June 1928 they flew to Broome, Western Australia. From there they flew around the coast, accompanied by Wing Commander Lawrence Wackett, RAAF, in his Wackett Widgeon II, to Perth, and then circumnavigated the entire continent via Adelaide, Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane, and Darwin, before arriving back in Singapore on 15 September. An additional flight was then made, calling at Kuching, Manila, and Hong Kong, returning to Singapore via Tourane and Penang. On 1 March 1929 Livock was awarded the Air Force Cross. The flight remained at Singapore, based at RAF Seletar where it became No. 205 (Flying Boat) Squadron, under the command of Cave-Browne-Cave until 1 January 1930, when Livock took over as Officer Commanding.\n\nParagraph 5: He was then involved in two long-distance flying boat flights; on 1 July 1926 two Supermarine Southamptons under Livock's command took off from RAF Cattewater, Plymouth, on a flight to Egypt, via Hourtin and Berre in France, then Naples, Valletta, Benghazi and Sollum, arriving at Aboukir on 10 July.

On the 2d of May, the column marched into the beautiful town of Port Gibson, and bivouacked in the streets. The beauty and fashion of this place had made great preparations for a grand ball in honor of the victory over our fleet at Grand Gulf. The Battle of Port Gibson had altogether changed the programme. Many of our troops partook of the viands which had been prepared for guests of another sort. Here the column halted three days. The country roundabout Port Gibson is one of the richest cotton-growing regions of Mississippi. The white inhabitants were wealthy, cultivated after the Southern fashion, and aristocratic according to Southern notions. The war had hitherto not been carried into their door-yards. Their dwellings were magnificent mansions. They had fine carriages and blooded horses. Many of them had blooded negroes, too, for coachmen. They fared sumptuously every day. Thus were they living till our troops landed, when the most of the wealthy planters suddenly decamped. Our foraging parties met with all the embarrassment of riches. They would return, loaded down with supplies—beef, bacon, pork, poultry, vegetables. One might see gorgeous family carriages coming into Port Gibson from all directions, filled with geese, ducks, and chickens, or coming from the mills, laden with great bags of meal. Yet no man's property was destroyed, or even taken for the use of the army, without there being first obtained evidence of his disloyalty to the Union, which evidence very often consisted of the fact that he had run away from the Union army. No houses were burned, no cotton was destroyed. The Union troops simply did what the planters had done before them. They fared sumptuously every day. Having remained here long enough to get together a large quantity of supplies, the column moved on the 6th to Rocky Springs. On the next day, it moved to Big Sandy Creek, and was there reviewed by General Grant. On the 10th it moved still farther northward, halting near Cayuga. Here the grand army first came together, and marched forward in an unbroken line of several miles extent, making a grand sight. McClernand's Corps was on the left. On the morning of the 12th, his advance Division, being that of General Hovey, to which the Twenty-fourth belonged, moved to Fourteen Mile Creek, in the direction of Edwards’ Depot. Here he had a sharp skirmish with the enemy, and deployed his men in line of battle. The main rebel army from Vicksburg, twenty-five thousand strong, as reported, was drawn up two or three miles in advance. Meantime, while Hovey was here amusing the enemy, McPherson whipped the rebel force at Raymond. Hovey then withdrew, and taking a new road just made by his pioneers, passed through Raymond on the day after the battle, and reached Clinton on the 14th. On the next morning the Thirteenth Corps turned about, and marching westward, reached Bolton Depot in the evening.\n\nParagraph 7: More education and cognitively complex occupation are some of the factors that predict higher cognitive abilities in old age. Therefore, two most commonly used proxies to study cognitive reserve are education and occupation. Education is known to play a role in cognitive decline in normal aging, as well as in degenerative diseases or traumatic brain injuries. A higher prevalence of dementia in individuals with fewer years of education has suggested that education may protect against Alzheimer's disease. Moreover, the level of education has a strong impact on adult's lifestyle. Level of education is measured by the number of years an individual spends in school or alternatively, the degree of literacy. Possibly, the level of education itself provides a set of cognitive tools that allow the individual to compensate for the pathological changes. Cognitive Reserve Index Questionnaire (CRIq), devised to assess the level of cognitive reserve in order to provide better diagnosis and treatment, takes into account years of education and possible training courses lasting at least six months to assess the education load on cognitive reserve. Clinically, education is negatively correlated with dementia severity, but positively correlated with grey matter atrophy, intracranial volume, and overall global cognition. Neurologically, education is correlated to greater functional connectivity between fronto-parietal regions and greater cortical thickness in the left inferior temporal gyrus. In addition to the level of education, it has been shown that bilingualism enhances attention and cognitive control in both children and older adults and delays the onset of dementia. It allows the brain to better tolerate the underlying pathologies and can be considered as a protective factor contributing positively to the cognitive reserve. Another proxy for cognitive reserve is the occupation. Studies suggest that occupation may provide additive and independent source of cognitive reserve throughout person's life. The last or the longest job is usually taken into account. Occupation values may vary in terms of cognitive load involved. Some other common indices, such as prestige or salary can also be considered. Working activity measured by CRIq assesses adulthood professions. There are five different levels of working activities available, differing in the degree of intellectual involvement and personal responsibility. Working activity was recorded as the number of years in each profession over the lifespan. Occupation as a proxy for cognitive reserve is positively correlated with local efficiency and functional connectivity in the right medial temporal lobe. More cognitively stimulating occupations are weakly associated with greater memory, but are more strongly correlated with greater executive functioning. These two proxies are typically measured together and are typically highly correlated with each other. A genetic study using Mendelian randomization analysis demonstrated that high occupation levels were associated with reduced risk for Alzheimer’s disease. In addition, this study confirmed that occupational attainment had an independent effect on the risk for Alzheimer’s disease even after taking educational attainment into account.\n\nParagraph 8: He was then involved in two long-distance flying boat flights; on 1 July 1926 two Supermarine Southamptons under Livock's command took off from RAF Cattewater, Plymouth, on a flight to Egypt, via Hourtin and Berre in France, then Naples, Valletta, Benghazi and Sollum, arriving at Aboukir on 10 July.

The flight left Singapore on 21 May, flying via Batavia and Surabaya to Kupang in Timor from where on 1 June 1928 they flew to Broome, Western Australia. From there they flew around the coast, accompanied by Wing Commander Lawrence Wackett, RAAF, in his Wackett Widgeon II, to Perth, and then circumnavigated the entire continent via Adelaide, Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane, and Darwin, before arriving back in Singapore on 15 September. An additional flight was then made, calling at Kuching, Manila, and Hong Kong, returning to Singapore via Tourane and Penang. On 1 March 1929 Livock was awarded the Air Force Cross. The flight remained at Singapore, based at RAF Seletar where it became No. 205 (Flying Boat) Squadron, under the command of Cave-Browne-Cave until 1 January 1930, when Livock took over as Officer Commanding.\n\nParagraph 9: Jingle Belle Kringle - The rebellious and mischievous, but ultimately good-hearted daughter of Santa Claus and his wife, Queen Mirabelle. In \"Santa Claus vs. Frankenstein\" she gives her age as 151 (\"that's sixteen in elf years\"). This places her year of birth as 1857, the same year the song \"Jingle Bells\" was originally published. In \"The Homemades' Tale\", however, she states that she is nearly 300 years old. She appears to be an attractive teenage girl with pointed ears, blonde hair and blue eyes. Her typical costume consists of green shortalls over a white cardigan sweater, red and white striped stockings, black boots, and sometimes a green \"elf hat\" with a red feather. According to Dini: \"[S]he's just a fun personality who rebels against an established structure. That structure just happens to be her father and all the Christmas stuff\". Jing's troublemaking often stems either from her desire to avoid her family Christmas duties, or to express her opinion that her father doesn't appreciate her and is too hard on her. Sometimes, however, the trouble she gets into results from attempts to help people, especially those she feels are being taken advantage of. Jingle Belle is a good athlete, although she tends to be violently hyper-competitive, and is the captain of the North Pole Elves hockey team.\n\nParagraph 10: Motley was signed to a contract worth $4,500 a year ($ in  dollars). With the Browns, he joined a potent offense led by quarterback Otto Graham, tackle and placekicker Lou Groza and receivers Dante Lavelli and Mac Speedie. He was a force to be reckoned with in the AAFC, and helped the team win every championship in the league's four years of existence between 1946 and 1949. He had a combination of quickness and power – he was listed at 238 pounds – that helped him plow through tacklers. He was also an able pass blocker and played on defense as a linebacker. Motley rushed for an average of 8.2 yards per carry in his first season. His forte was the trap play, a scheme where a defensive lineman was allowed to come across the line of scrimmage unblocked, opening up space for Motley to run. He led the league in rushing in 1948 as the Browns posted a perfect 15–0 record. He was the AAFC's all-time rushing leader when the league folded after the 1949 season and the Browns were absorbed into the more established National Football League (NFL). The Browns had a 47–4–3 overall regular-season win-loss-tie record during the AAFC years as Motley rushed for a total of 3,024 yards.\n\nParagraph 11: On the final weekend before the election, the Sudbury Star published an article headlined, \"City misled public about manager's dismissal,\" alleging that Rodriguez and the incumbent council had deliberately lied to the public about the resignation of Alan Stephen, the former manager of the city's infrastructure and emergency services division, in 2006. The incident described in the article was one in which the city appeared to simply have followed its legal obligation to maintain confidentiality around matters involving employee relations. Still, the article disclosed that Stephen promoted friends within his department, locked the city into 10-year contracts that cost the city up to $1.2 million annually, and took a leadership role at the site of an incident in which he was not qualified to do so, promoting a Ministry of Labour investigation into whether firefighters' lives were put at risk. The newspaper subsequently faced criticism for its portrayal of the story and for publishing the story only after it would be too late for Rodriguez or any other member of the city's staff to respond ahead of election day; in an interview on CBC Northern Ontario's Points North following the election, Sudbury Star managing editor Brian MacLeod pointed out that Rodriguez had several days to respond, but offered no comment on the story. He stated that the paper had received the information in an anonymous brown envelope several days before the story went to print. The Ontario Provincial Police subsequently announced that they were conducting an investigation into the leak.\n\nParagraph 12: The North American least shrew (Cryptotis parvus) is one of the smallest mammals, growing to be only up to 3 inches long. It has a long pointed snout and a tail never more than twice the length of its hind foot. The dense fur coat is either grayish-brown or reddish-brown with a white belly. Its fur becomes lighter in the summer and darker in the winter. Although similar in appearance to several species of rodents, all shrews are members of the order Eulipotyphla and should not be mistaken for a member of the order Rodentia. The North American least shrew's eyes are small and its ears are completely concealed within its short fur, giving it very poor eyesight and hearing.\n\nParagraph 13: Motley was signed to a contract worth $4,500 a year ($ in  dollars).

Located off Taylor Blvd, the park includes 13 acres (5.3 hectares) of open space, hiking, and scenic views. The elevation is 308 feet. There is a small parking area accessible only by northbound traffic. From here a staircase and railroad tie steps lead to the top of the hill. The park is one of several parks owned and managed by the Pleasant Hill Recreation and Park District. The park offers good views of Mount Diablo and is popular on the 4th of July as several simultaneous (although distant) fireworks displays can be seen. The park offers a panoramic view of Pleasant Hill, Concord, and Walnut Creek and the northern reach of the Diablo Range.\n\nParagraph 16: From this time until the Battle of Champion Hills, our regiment did much marching, skirmishing, and foraging, but was not engaged at Raymond or at Jackson. On the 2d of May, the column marched into the beautiful town of Port Gibson, and bivouacked in the streets. The beauty and fashion of this place had made great preparations for a grand ball in honor of the victory over our fleet at Grand Gulf. The Battle of Port Gibson had altogether changed the programme. Many of our troops partook of the viands which had been prepared for guests of another sort. Here the column halted three days. The country roundabout Port Gibson is one of the richest cotton-growing regions of Mississippi. The white inhabitants were wealthy, cultivated after the Southern fashion, and aristocratic according to Southern notions. The war had hitherto not been carried into their door-yards. Their dwellings were magnificent mansions. They had fine carriages and blooded horses. Many of them had blooded negroes, too, for coachmen. They fared sumptuously every day. Thus were they living till our troops landed, when the most of the wealthy planters suddenly decamped. Our foraging parties met with all the embarrassment of riches. They would return, loaded down with supplies—beef, bacon, pork, poultry, vegetables. One might see gorgeous family carriages coming into Port Gibson from all directions, filled with geese, ducks, and chickens, or coming from the mills, laden with great bags of meal. Yet no man's property was destroyed, or even taken for the use of the army, without there being first obtained evidence of his disloyalty to the Union, which evidence very often consisted of the fact that he had run away from the Union army. No houses were burned, no cotton was destroyed. The Union troops simply did what the planters had done before them. They fared sumptuously every day. Having remained here long enough to get together a large quantity of supplies, the column moved on the 6th to Rocky Springs. On the next day, it moved to Big Sandy Creek, and was there reviewed by General Grant. On the 10th it moved still farther northward, halting near Cayuga. Here the grand army first came together, and marched forward in an unbroken line of several miles extent, making a grand sight. McClernand's Corps was on the left. On the morning of the 12th, his advance Division, being that of General Hovey, to which the Twenty-fourth belonged, moved to Fourteen Mile Creek, in the direction of Edwards’ Depot. Here he had a sharp skirmish with the enemy, and deployed his men in line of battle. The main rebel army from Vicksburg, twenty-five thousand strong, as reported, was drawn up two or three miles in advance. Meantime, while Hovey was here amusing the enemy, McPherson whipped the rebel force at Raymond. Hovey then withdrew, and taking a new road just made by his pioneers, passed through Raymond on the day after the battle, and reached Clinton on the 14th. On the next morning the Thirteenth Corps turned about, and marching westward, reached Bolton Depot in the evening.\n\nParagraph 17: Stuyvesant, however, with his 1656 ordinance against illegal religious meetings, had formally banned the practice of all religions outside of the Dutch Reformed Church, the established church of the Netherlands, in the colony. His often-derided decision flew against the approximately hundred-year development of religious tolerance in the Netherlands. During this time the country was revolting against Spanish rule, rebelling against an imposed Inquisition, attempting to form a national identity, and trying to unify Calvinist and Catholic provinces. The Dutch toleration debates were lengthy, bumpy, heated, and full of political intrigue and even assassination. The writer Thomas Broderick states, \"I believe the true Dutch legacy is not one of toleration but of discussion. New Amsterdam and the Republic show us that a robust, open public discourse is the surest way to eventual social improvement. Toleration and acceptance are political and moral imperatives, and the Flushing remonstrance and great Dutch toleration debates in Europe and North America teach us that social change takes time, open dialogue, disagreement, and failure before progress is to be made.\"\n\nParagraph 18: Jingle Belle Kringle - The rebellious and mischievous, but ultimately good-hearted daughter of Santa Claus and his wife, Queen Mirabelle.

{"input": "", "context": "Paragraph 1: Jerome: \" From this is taken one of Helvidius’s propositions, on the ground that mention is made in the Gospel of the brethren of the Lord. How, says he, are they called brethren of the Lord, if they were not his brethren? But now it should be known that in divine Scripture men are said to be brethren in four different ways, by nature, by nation, by kindred, and by affection. By nature, as Esau and Jacob. By nation, as all Jews are called brethren, as in Deuteronomy, Thou shalt not set over thee a foreigner who is not thy brother. (Deut. 17:15) They are called brethren by kindred who are of one family, as in Genesis, Abraham said unto Lot, Let there not be strife between thee and me, for we are brethren. (Gen. 13:8) Also men are called brethren by affection, which is of two kinds, special and general. Special, as all Christians are called brethren, as the Saviour says, Go tell my brethren. General, inasmuch as all men are born of one father, we are bound together by a tie of consanguinity, as in that, Say unto them that hate you, Ye are our brethren. (Is. 66:5 sec. LXX (Septuagint).) I ask then, after which manner these are called the Lord’s brethren in the Gospel? According to nature? But Scripture saith not, neither calling them sons of Mary nor of Joseph. By nation? But it is absurd that some few out of all the Jews should be called brethren, seeing that all the Jews who were there might have thus been called brethren. By affection, either of a human sort, or of the Spirit? If that be true, yet how were they more His brethren than the Apostles, whom He instructed in the inmost mysteries. Or if because they were men, and all men are brethren, it was foolish to say of them in particular, Behold, thy brethren seek thee. It only remains then that they should be His brethren by kindred, not by affection, not by privilege of nation, not by nature.\"\n\nParagraph 2: Fowler was born in Pittsfield, Massachusetts.  his mother Francis is first cousins with Alice Brock (Alice's Restaurant) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_Brock and his maternal grandmothers first cousin was Sen. Margaret Chase Smith of Maine who famously denounced Sen. McCarthy during 1950 a brave \"Declaration of Conscience\" speech on the Senate floor. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Chase_Smith The family moved to Carpinteria, California and returned to Lenox, Massachusetts a year and half later.  Fowler performed in local bands throughout the mid-1980s and relocated to 1960s Counterculture Icon Wavy Gravy's Hog Farm in Laytonville, California in 1987. He later migrated to Los Angeles, CA where he attended the Musicians Institute in Hollywood, CA and shortly after became a studio assistant to John Barnes Sr., Fowler later joined the reconstituted British reggae ska group General Public appearing on the live recording of the international hit song \"Save it for later\" which became the B side to the hit single remake of \"I'll take you there\" and was featured in the film \"Threesome\" that same year.  During this time Fowler teamed up with well-known producer Andrew Growcott aka \"Stoker\" (drummer for Dexis Midnight Runners) and through this relationship was a featured guitarist on several hit songs with artists such as Sting, UB40, Rosanne Cash, Taylor Dayne, General Public, Clint Black, Kelly Price. Fowler left General Public to join Boxing Gandhis in support of their top 10 AAA hit self-titled debut album released on Mesa Blue Moon / Atlantic and which featured the hit single \"If you Love Me Why am I dying\".  The video for this song won Billboard Magazine award for Best Jazz Music Video which was odd since the band was an acoustic soul band reminiscent of Sly and the Family Stone, Little Feat and War.  Boxing Gandhis were the opening act for The Dave Matthews Band during the \"Under the Table and Dreaming\" album tour. After the tour the band was signed to Atlantic Records and secured a publishing deal with EMI Music Publishing in advance of the release of their 2nd Album Howard which was released on Atlantic Records.  The band embarked on a 2nd tour as opening act for The Dave Matthews Band in support of this 2nd album and released a 3rd record several years later.  The band is still actively recording and touring. Fowler continues to compose and produce music for film and television as well as for new artists.  Fowler and Boxing Gandhis bandmate Ernie Perez started a production company with Dave Matthews Band saxophonist Leroi Moore.  The three collaborated on recordings at the famed Dave Matthews Band recording studio \"Haunted Hollow\" culminating in the release of new albums by several artists including (Samantha Farrell, Melodrome & Art Decade). In 2014 Boxing Gandhis performed at WitZend in Venice, CA and announced that the group was planning to reform and release a new album with original members Dave Darling, Brie Darling, Ernie Perez, Alfredo Ballesteros, Ted Zig Zag Andreadis.\n\nParagraph 3: Following the 2.7 Ga rifting or accretion event, the Slave underwent large scale extension at 2680 Ma resulting in the formation of the > 400x800 km Burwash Basin, widespread mafic sills, and other younger turbidites along the northwestern margin. The Burwash Basin consists of metamorphosed turbiditic sandstones and slates interspersed with thin felsic tuff layers. At 2634 Ma the Slave switched to a compressional regime and the Burwash Basin started to close, possibly due to shallow subduction from the NW or SE. By 2.6 Ga the Slave had collided with the much larger Sclavia, resulting in shortening and cross-folding over the craton. The presence of three rifted margins around the Slave, as well as similarly aged 3.3–3.5 Ga basement rocks, fuchsitic quartzite, and 2.9 Ga tonalites, suggest that the Dharwar, Zimbabwe, and Wyoming cratons were also part of Sclavia. The Slave broke off of Sclavia between 2.2 and 2.0 Ga, as noted by a host of dyke swarms at its margins. The Slave Craton drifted for approximately 200 million years before its accretion with the Rae Craton around 2.0–1.8 Ga in the Taltson–Thelon orogeny. The orogenic belt accreted smaller exotic terranes before the Slave was eventually subducted eastward under the Rae, resulting in a continental magmatic arc known as the Taltson magmatic zone. Continual eastward movement of the Slave province, along with collision of the Hottah terrane on the western margin of the Slave,  lead to intense deformation of the Taltson magmatic zone. The Hottah terrane accreted with the Slave during the Wopmay orogeny at 1.88 Ga, shortly after the Thelon orogeny. This event produced another continental magmatic arc on the Slave's western margin, the Great Bear magmatic zone, as well as the Wopmay fault zone. The Wopmay fault zone consists of thin skinned thrust belts that mark the suture between the Hottah terrane and Slave Craton. These two orogenies have emplaced the Slave Craton within Laurentia, where it is still found today.\n\nParagraph 4: Omnimon X is referred to here as \"Omega of Power\", first appearing in Chapter 3 :\"Fāng's Trap\". One of only three remaining Royal Knights of thirteen originally. Fāng was under the control of a MetalPhantomon in Chapter 2 and Zhìguāng receives a message from Fāng on his Digital Monster D-Cyber Version 1.0 to head North and find him at MetalPhantomon's lair. A battle ensues and Luò tells Zhìguāng not to argue with Fāng and that he wants to remain in the Digital World, believing Fāng that MetalPhantomon will give them power. Zhìguāng strikes Luò and tells him to wake up. In doing so, Luò is rendered unconscious. Fāng believes Luò murdered and orders his Digimon to come out, a Gaiomon (Samudramon in the Digital Monster D-Cyber Special Limited Edition and GaiOumon in the Digimon Chronicle). Zhìguāng's Digimon Death-X Evolves to a DexDoruGreymon in his grief and guilt. In trying to recover Luò, Zhìguāng realizes Fāng's trap and that the Luò before him is not the real one, an illusion. Fāng switched the real one to anger Zhìguāng. Fāng says he will send him to the \"God of Death\" (MetalPhantomon), his Gaiomon is however defeated by Zhìguāng's DexDorugoramon, who in his anger, caused the evolution but his Digimon is on a rampage. Afterwards, Zhìguāng recovers the real Luò but is interrupted in seeing Omnimon X before them, asking \"Who dares to break the peace of the Digital World?\" He smelled the scent of DexDorugoramon's Digi-Core and goes on to say he defeated the same evil Digi-Core ten thousand years ago and orders the children to leave. Omnimon X engages DexDorugoramon in battle and Fāng is freed of MetalPhantomon's control. Omnimon X discovers DexDorugoramon to be stronger than he was ten thousand years ago and inflicts insufficient damage with his Garuru Cannon even at a close distance. As Omnimon X invokes his Grey Sword, Zhìguāng's body produces a huge energy sphere and Omnimon X realizes it is Zhìguāng transferring power to DexDorugoramon making him seem invincible, although unknowingly. Omnimon X attempts to then kill Zhìguāng but Fāng says they can still control DexDorugoramon and tells Zhìguāng to take the power back. Zhìguāng then strikes DexDorugoramon and calms him but MetalPhantomon arrives and steals his Dragon Spirit to revive the Digi-Core of a Dexmon. Omnimon X attempts to prevent it but MetalPhantomon escapes. Omnimon X says Zhìguāng's Dorumon's body will disappear in ten days and even he can not save him. He tells them to head through the Valley of the Morning Dragon and to the Jade Waterfall to obtain a new one from a Royal Knight called \"Duke\", a MedievalGallantmon. He then attempts to track MetalPhantomon. While he is able to follow him to where Dexmon is sealed away as the Digicore, he is unable to prevent Dexmon's revival nor defeat him in battle. He does however eventually assist Alphamon (King Dragon) along with the others in defeating Dexmon when they arrive to help.\n\nParagraph 5: Omnimon X is referred to here as \"Omega of Power\", first appearing in Chapter 3 :\"Fāng's Trap\".

He tells them to head through the Valley of the Morning Dragon and to the Jade Waterfall to obtain a new one from a Royal Knight called \"Duke\", a MedievalGallantmon. He then attempts to track MetalPhantomon. While he is able to follow him to where Dexmon is sealed away as the Digicore, he is unable to prevent Dexmon's revival nor defeat him in battle. He does however eventually assist Alphamon (King Dragon) along with the others in defeating Dexmon when they arrive to help.\n\nParagraph 8: Following the 2.7 Ga rifting or accretion event, the Slave underwent large scale extension at 2680 Ma resulting in the formation of the > 400x800 km Burwash Basin, widespread mafic sills, and other younger turbidites along the northwestern margin. The Burwash Basin consists of metamorphosed turbiditic sandstones and slates interspersed with thin felsic tuff layers. At 2634 Ma the Slave switched to a compressional regime and the Burwash Basin started to close, possibly due to shallow subduction from the NW or SE. By 2.6 Ga the Slave had collided with the much larger Sclavia, resulting in shortening and cross-folding over the craton. The presence of three rifted margins around the Slave, as well as similarly aged 3.3–3.5 Ga basement rocks, fuchsitic quartzite, and 2.9 Ga tonalites, suggest that the Dharwar, Zimbabwe, and Wyoming cratons were also part of Sclavia. The Slave broke off of Sclavia between 2.2 and 2.0 Ga, as noted by a host of dyke swarms at its margins. The Slave Craton drifted for approximately 200 million years before its accretion with the Rae Craton around 2.0–1.8 Ga in the Taltson–Thelon orogeny. The orogenic belt accreted smaller exotic terranes before the Slave was eventually subducted eastward under the Rae, resulting in a continental magmatic arc known as the Taltson magmatic zone. Continual eastward movement of the Slave province, along with collision of the Hottah terrane on the western margin of the Slave,  lead to intense deformation of the Taltson magmatic zone. The Hottah terrane accreted with the Slave during the Wopmay orogeny at 1.88 Ga, shortly after the Thelon orogeny. This event produced another continental magmatic arc on the Slave's western margin, the Great Bear magmatic zone, as well as the Wopmay fault zone. The Wopmay fault zone consists of thin skinned thrust belts that mark the suture between the Hottah terrane and Slave Craton. These two orogenies have emplaced the Slave Craton within Laurentia, where it is still found today.\n\nParagraph 9: Omnimon X is referred to here as \"Omega of Power\", first appearing in Chapter 3 :\"Fāng's Trap\". One of only three remaining Royal Knights of thirteen originally. Fāng was under the control of a MetalPhantomon in Chapter 2 and Zhìguāng receives a message from Fāng on his Digital Monster D-Cyber Version 1.0 to head North and find him at MetalPhantomon's lair. A battle ensues and Luò tells Zhìguāng not to argue with Fāng and that he wants to remain in the Digital World, believing Fāng that MetalPhantomon will give them power. Zhìguāng strikes Luò and tells him to wake up. In doing so, Luò is rendered unconscious. Fāng believes Luò murdered and orders his Digimon to come out, a Gaiomon (Samudramon in the Digital Monster D-Cyber Special Limited Edition and GaiOumon in the Digimon Chronicle). Zhìguāng's Digimon Death-X Evolves to a DexDoruGreymon in his grief and guilt. In trying to recover Luò, Zhìguāng realizes Fāng's trap and that the Luò before him is not the real one, an illusion. Fāng switched the real one to anger Zhìguāng. Fāng says he will send him to the \"God of Death\" (MetalPhantomon), his Gaiomon is however defeated by Zhìguāng's DexDorugoramon, who in his anger, caused the evolution but his Digimon is on a rampage. Afterwards, Zhìguāng recovers the real Luò but is interrupted in seeing Omnimon X before them, asking \"Who dares to break the peace of the Digital World?\" He smelled the scent of DexDorugoramon's Digi-Core and goes on to say he defeated the same evil Digi-Core ten thousand years ago and orders the children to leave. Omnimon X engages DexDorugoramon in battle and Fāng is freed of MetalPhantomon's control. Omnimon X discovers DexDorugoramon to be stronger than he was ten thousand years ago and inflicts insufficient damage with his Garuru Cannon even at a close distance. As Omnimon X invokes his Grey Sword, Zhìguāng's body produces a huge energy sphere and Omnimon X realizes it is Zhìguāng transferring power to DexDorugoramon making him seem invincible, although unknowingly. Omnimon X attempts to then kill Zhìguāng but Fāng says they can still control DexDorugoramon and tells Zhìguāng to take the power back. Zhìguāng then strikes DexDorugoramon and calms him but MetalPhantomon arrives and steals his Dragon Spirit to revive the Digi-Core of a Dexmon. Omnimon X attempts to prevent it but MetalPhantomon escapes. Omnimon X says Zhìguāng's Dorumon's body will disappear in ten days and even he can not save him.

The tag team was dissolved in the middle of a feud, due to an injury to his partner. Cotto continued to feud for the tag team championships, but once the opportunity took place, he was removed, in order to introduce Savio Vega's student, Diego de Jesús. He was subsequently fired as part of a storyline, returning masked under his El Illegal character. He continued wrestling unmasked in the independent circuit, even challenging for the Extreme Wrestling Organization's heavyweight title under his common character, in a contest that ended in a double disqualification. Cotto went on to pursue a feud with the Intercontinental and Undisputed Heavyweight Champion, Chris Angel. He was initially awarded the Intercontinental belt and Angel's undefeated record, but the result was revoked due to external interference from a second masked \"Illegal\" and an unclean pin. In a rematch, he won the Championship in a two on one contest, pinning Phillip Davian following an attack from a third masked wrestler. Zona 101 reunited on December 10, 2011, in Caribbean Wrestling Federation, an independent promotion based in the south region of Puerto Rico, where he teamed with one half of the CWF Tag Team Champions. The following week, the team was booked over Dennis Rivera and Noel Rodríguez. On December 17, 2011, Cotto won the EWO World Heavyweight Championship, only to be interrupted by IWA president Miguel Pérez. This was in response to a previous confrontation between both, that occurred following a benefit card where Cotto wrestled and defeated Mesias. After defending the title at Tierra de Nadie 2012, Pérez once again reclaimed his contract. This was followed by confrontations in IWA's Histeria Boricua and Kaos & Odissey, which expanded to include EWO's CEO, Richard Rondón, as well. On February 25, 2012, following more intervention from the IWA, Cotto issued a challenge to end the conflict, an unification match for the EWO World Heavyweight Championship and IWA Undisputed World Heavyweight Championship. On March 1, 2012, the challenge was accepted by Pérez and Rondón in a backstage segment. At Clash of the Titans, Cotto lost the EWO World Championship, losing to a masked wrestler only known as \"Bonecrusher\", whom he had defeated to win this belt and had since gained the IWA Undisputed Heavyweight Champion. In this match, a new angle was launched that involved him being involved in \"friendly\" confrontations with the other members of his stable, which was continued in the next event, Payback.\n\nParagraph 11: U and non-U English usage, where \"U\" stands for upper class, and \"non-U\" represents the aspiring middle classes, was part of the terminology of popular discourse of social dialects (sociolects) in Britain in the 1950s. The different vocabularies can often appear quite counter-intuitive: the middle classes prefer \"fancy\" or fashionable words, even neologisms and often euphemisms, in attempts to make themselves sound more refined (\"posher than posh\"), while the upper classes in many cases stick to the same plain and traditional words that the working classes also use, as, confident in the security of their social position, they have no need to seek to display refinement.\n\nParagraph 12: The story starts on Valentine's Day. Where everyone is so busy with all the usual rituals couples do. On the other hand. Zach is an attorney at the Public Attorney's Office who always takes his best friend Andie on a date during Valentine's Day for the last 3 years. This has become a usual thing for them during this day. Zach is becoming worried about the real status of the relationship that he and Andie holds. On Valentine's Day while on their date with Andie, Andie introduced Zach to her girl best friend Ruby. Ruby on the other hand, is a brokenhearted girl. She was about to marry her fiance but the guy left him on the same day. Being bored at the bar where she meets Zach, Zach and Ruby decide to go out and they got the chance to talk and learn more about their lives. They decide to come by the house of Ruby's ex-fiance. She got excited with the rock and she throw it at his car. The alarm of the car was turned on immediately. They were in panic that Ruby's shoe was almost lost and so is Zach's sentimental wrist watch. They swore that they will never ever forget each other and maybe they'll see each other again if Ruby dreams of Zach that night. The next day, Andie and Zach spent the whole day together. Clearly states that Zach really loves Andie. Ruby was at Zach's court case to see him. Zach told Ruby that he will be giving up his job at the Public Attorney's Office and will be working at an aw firm after the current case he's handing. The two went on several dates and eventually fall in love and became lovers. Andie was so happy to hear the news that her best friends worked out together but she was kind of upset that Zach doesn't do the usual things they do before he had a girlfriend. Zach comforted her and she eventually got over it. They became close again but Ruby was so insecure about their friendship. One day, Ruby got Zach a wrist watch for his birthday and he was confused on what to do with his two wrist watches. On his surprise birthday party, Ruby heard Zach's grandfather talking to Andie about the sentimental watch she gave him on his last birthday. Ruby approached Zach and she saw that he was not wearing the watch that she gave him. She was so upset and walked out the birthday party. She was followed by Zach. They talked about Zach's real feelings for Andie and he doesn't love her. During a traffic fight, Ruby was caught in the middle and got shot. Zach was sorry because Ruby got hurt and Andie also admitted to Ruby that she was scared that's why she can't show her love to Zach. Valentine's Day was upon them once more. Ruby has already moved on and is dating her ex-fiance. Zach finally admitted his real feelings for Andie and Andie told Zach that \"I could tell you over and over how much I love you but I'd rather show it\". They share a passionate kiss.\n\nParagraph 13: Jerome: \" From this is taken one of Helvidius’s propositions, on the ground that mention is made in the Gospel of the brethren of the Lord. How, says he, are they called brethren of the Lord, if they were not his brethren? But now it should be known that in divine Scripture men are said to be brethren in four different ways, by nature, by nation, by kindred, and by affection. By nature, as Esau and Jacob. By nation, as all Jews are called brethren, as in Deuteronomy, Thou shalt not set over thee a foreigner who is not thy brother. (Deut. 17:15) They are called brethren by kindred who are of one family, as in Genesis, Abraham said unto Lot, Let there not be strife between thee and me, for we are brethren. (Gen. 13:8) Also men are called brethren by affection, which is of two kinds, special and general. Special, as all Christians are called brethren, as the Saviour says, Go tell my brethren. General, inasmuch as all men are born of one father, we are bound together by a tie of consanguinity, as in that, Say unto them that hate you, Ye are our brethren. (Is. 66:5 sec. LXX (Septuagint).) I ask then, after which manner these are called the Lord’s brethren in the Gospel? According to nature? But Scripture saith not, neither calling them sons of Mary nor of Joseph. By nation? But it is absurd that some few out of all the Jews should be called brethren, seeing that all the Jews who were there might have thus been called brethren. By affection, either of a human sort, or of the Spirit? If that be true, yet how were they more His brethren than the Apostles, whom He instructed in the inmost mysteries. Or if because they were men, and all men are brethren, it was foolish to say of them in particular, Behold, thy brethren seek thee. It only remains then that they should be His brethren by kindred, not by affection, not by privilege of nation, not by nature.\"\n\nParagraph 14: Omnimon X is referred to here as \"Omega of Power\", first appearing in Chapter 3 :\"Fāng's Trap\".

{"input": "", "context": "Paragraph 1: Some proponents of TL loudspeakers consider that using a TL is the theoretical ideal manner in which to load a moving-coil drive unit. However, it is also one of the more complex of constructions. The most common and practical implementation is to fit a drive unit to the end of a long duct that is usually open at the far end. In practice, the duct is folded inside a conventional shaped cabinet, so that the open end of the duct appears as a vent on the speaker cabinet. There are many ways in which the duct can be folded, and the line is often tapered in cross section to avoid parallel internal surfaces that encourage standing waves. Some speaker designs also use a spiral or elliptic spiral shaped duct, usually with one speaker element in the front or two speaker elements arranged one on each side of the cabinet. Depending upon the drive unit, and quantity and various physical properties of absorbent material, the amount of taper will be adjusted during the design process to tune the duct to remove irregularities in its response. The internal partitioning provides substantial bracing for the entire structure, reducing cabinet flexing and colouration. The inside faces of the duct or line, are treated with an absorbent material to provide the correct termination with frequency to load the drive unit as a TL. The enclosure behaves like an infinite baffle, potentially absorbing most or all of the speaker unit's rear energies. A theoretically perfect TL would absorb all frequencies entering the line from the rear of the drive unit but remains theoretical, as it would have to be infinitely long. The physical constraints of the real world, demand that the length of the line must often be less than 4 meters before the cabinet becomes too large for any practical applications, so not all the rear energy can be absorbed by the line. In a realized TL, only the upper bass is TL loaded in the true sense of the term (i.e. fully absorbed); the low bass is allowed to freely radiate from the vent in the cabinet. The line therefore effectively works as a low pass filter, another crossover point in fact, achieved acoustically by the line and its absorbent filling. Below this “crossover point” the low bass is loaded by the column of air formed by the length of the line. The length of the line is specified so as to reverse the phase of the rear output of the drive unit as it exits the vent. This acoustic energy combines with the output of the bass unit, extending its response and effectively creating a second driver.\n\nParagraph 2: Some proponents of TL loudspeakers consider that using a TL is the theoretical ideal manner in which to load a moving-coil drive unit.

At some point before the disbanding of the Ghostbusters, Stantz and Egon added a scissor seat to the Ecto-1 and built radio-controlled cars (labeled remote trap vehicles or RTV for short), each loaded with a ghost trap that can match the Cadillac's speed. He returned to running Ray's Occult Books. In order to make a profit, Stantz has to expand his inventory to compete with other booksellers and metaphysical supply stores. However, unable to match the services of large bookstore chains, Stantz leases a back room to a palm reader. In a post-credits scene, it's revealed that the rent at Stantz's store is paid for by Winston. A week after Egon died, Stantz receives a phone call from Egon's granddaughter Phoebe, asking for the Ghostbusters' help against Summerville's supernatural threats. He explains that when Egon's teammates doubted his belief in the return of Gozer and the coming apocalypse, Egon stole the Ecto-1 along with the team's gear and moved to Summerville. Stantz feels especially betrayed by this act, telling her that \"Egon Spengler can rot in hell,\" though he is remorseful upon being informed of Egon's death and Phoebe's relation to him. Phoebe's call ultimately prompts Stantz and the other surviving original Ghostbusters to travel to Summerville to assist Phoebe's team in battling Gozer. Stantz is revealed to be one of Phoebe's friend Podcast's subscribers on his vlogs about paranormal and conspiracies, and he is impressed after discovering that the person he followed is a 12-year-old.\n\nParagraph 4: He was not drafted by any team, and was signed as a free agent by the Philadelphia Eagles in April 2001 before being waived a short while later, not having appeared in any regular season games for them.  He was then picked up by the San Francisco 49ers, and was their regular punter during the 2001 NFL season.  Unfortunately, he was released the next year, and signed again by the Eagles.  He played several games for them before being released again at the end of the season.  He was signed by the Kansas City Chiefs before the 2003 season, and was their regular punter for the whole season, averaging a respectable 39.5 yards per punt.  Baker then had a bizarre season in 2004.  He was waived by Kansas City, then re-signed two weeks later, then waived  a week after that.  He was then picked up by the Indianapolis Colts, played with them for 5 weeks, then Indianapolis waived him and he was picked up by the Denver Broncos, who he finished the season with.  He played for Denver in the AFC wild card game against his former team, Indianapolis.  After the season, he was traded to the Carolina Panthers with a 2006 draft pick for Pro Bowl punter Todd Sauerbrun.  Baker eventually won the punting job, after battling with Tom Rouen and Steve Cheek during training camp and the preseason.  He played the rest of his seven seasons in Carolina, where he averaged 44.0 yards per punt in 112 games, set most of the franchise records, twice led the league in punts, and was a Pro Bowl alternate multiple times but never attended. The Panthers rewarded him with a contract making him the highest paid punter in the NFL prior to the 2007 season. Baker is one of the fastest running punters in the NFL. He managed to surprise the Seahawks' Leon Washington in a game on December 5, 2010, tripping up the prematurely celebrating Washington to save a touchdown.\n\nParagraph 5: Some proponents of TL loudspeakers consider that using a TL is the theoretical ideal manner in which to load a moving-coil drive unit.

The Institute is unusual as the miners themselves built it, borrowing the money through a private mortgage. The Memo was built to commemorate the 75 Newbridge men who died in the First World War. It is still the focus of Armistice Day and Remembrance Sunday activities every year. The Memo contains a ballroom with a sprung dance floor and an art deco auditorium which was designed to be both a theatre and a cinema. Both buildings now provide community facilities for local groups and societies, live music and community events but are both in urgent need of repair. After the mines closed, the Institute & Memorial Hall lost its income and became a drinking club. In 2004, when the local council was considering purchasing the land for a car park, a public meeting called by local MP Don Touhig led to the formation of The Friends of Newbridge Memo who got the buildings onto the BBC2 programme Restoration. They narrowly missed winning the final but received assistance from the Heritage Lottery Fund to begin the long process of raising money to restore both buildings. After a development grant was awarded by the Heritage Lottery Fund in summer 2009, Cadw and Caerphilly County Borough Council are actively supporting the scheme and the Big Lottery awarded £500,000 in December 2009. In July 2010 it was announced that the Heritage Lottery would grant the project £2.9 million to restore the buildings.\n\nParagraph 7: Some proponents of TL loudspeakers consider that using a TL is the theoretical ideal manner in which to load a moving-coil drive unit.

From 1897 to 1902 he served as magistrate and chairman of the municipality at Howrah near Calcutta. He was promoted to commissioner of Orissa in 1905, eventually being appointed the chief secretary of Bengal in 1909. In 1910 Duke became a member of the newly created executive council for Bengal. Duke was the last lieutenant-governor of Bengal as the province was then being re-organised due to the reversal of the 1905 Bengal partition, with the capital of India being relocated from Calcutta to New Delhi. Bengal also became a full-fledged Governorship at this time and Sir Thomas David Gibson Carmichael, was transferred from Madras to Governor of Bengal. Duke remained with him as his senior member of Council until November 1914, at which time he retired and was appointed as a member of the Council of India. Duke joined a study group of India Office members and the Round Table Group founded by Lionel George Curtis which had a lot of influence on Indian constitutional reforms, In this capacity he formulated the \"Duke Memorandum\" in which he devised a practical scheme of reforms relating to how the Indians could implement responsible government by means of dyarchy Duke's long experience in India had lent authority to the Round table reform schemes and his memorandum formed the basis of the Montagu–Chelmsford Reforms and the subsequent Government of India Act of 1919. After the 1919 Act was given royal assent the Chamber of Princes was established in 1920 to provide a forum for the rulers of the princely states to have a say in the government of British India. Duke was the chairman of the committee that was ultimately responsible for bringing the chamber into existence.\n\nParagraph 12: The Celynen Collieries' Institute (1908) and Memorial Hall (1925) on High Street, are both listed buildings, the Memo being Grade II*. The Institute is unusual as the miners themselves built it, borrowing the money through a private mortgage. The Memo was built to commemorate the 75 Newbridge men who died in the First World War. It is still the focus of Armistice Day and Remembrance Sunday activities every year. The Memo contains a ballroom with a sprung dance floor and an art deco auditorium which was designed to be both a theatre and a cinema. Both buildings now provide community facilities for local groups and societies, live music and community events but are both in urgent need of repair. After the mines closed, the Institute & Memorial Hall lost its income and became a drinking club. In 2004, when the local council was considering purchasing the land for a car park, a public meeting called by local MP Don Touhig led to the formation of The Friends of Newbridge Memo who got the buildings onto the BBC2 programme Restoration. They narrowly missed winning the final but received assistance from the Heritage Lottery Fund to begin the long process of raising money to restore both buildings. After a development grant was awarded by the Heritage Lottery Fund in summer 2009, Cadw and Caerphilly County Borough Council are actively supporting the scheme and the Big Lottery awarded £500,000 in December 2009. In July 2010 it was announced that the Heritage Lottery would grant the project £2.9 million to restore the buildings.\n\nParagraph 13: He was not drafted by any team, and was signed as a free agent by the Philadelphia Eagles in April 2001 before being waived a short while later, not having appeared in any regular season games for them.  He was then picked up by the San Francisco 49ers, and was their regular punter during the 2001 NFL season.  Unfortunately, he was released the next year, and signed again by the Eagles.  He played several games for them before being released again at the end of the season.  He was signed by the Kansas City Chiefs before the 2003 season, and was their regular punter for the whole season, averaging a respectable 39.5 yards per punt.  Baker then had a bizarre season in 2004.  He was waived by Kansas City, then re-signed two weeks later, then waived  a week after that.  He was then picked up by the Indianapolis Colts, played with them for 5 weeks, then Indianapolis waived him and he was picked up by the Denver Broncos, who he finished the season with.  He played for Denver in the AFC wild card game against his former team, Indianapolis.  After the season, he was traded to the Carolina Panthers with a 2006 draft pick for Pro Bowl punter Todd Sauerbrun.  Baker eventually won the punting job, after battling with Tom Rouen and Steve Cheek during training camp and the preseason.  He played the rest of his seven seasons in Carolina, where he averaged 44.0 yards per punt in 112 games, set most of the franchise records, twice led the league in punts, and was a Pro Bowl alternate multiple times but never attended. The Panthers rewarded him with a contract making him the highest paid punter in the NFL prior to the 2007 season. Baker is one of the fastest running punters in the NFL. He managed to surprise the Seahawks' Leon Washington in a game on December 5, 2010, tripping up the prematurely celebrating Washington to save a touchdown.\n\nParagraph 14: Aykroyd reprises his role as Stantz in Ghostbusters: Afterlife (2021).

{"input": "", "context": "Paragraph 1: The team changed its logo for the 2013–14 season per requests from the National Hockey League's Washington Capitals, who claim the former Hurricanes’ logo was too similar to theirs. Despite the optimism going into the season under new head coach Drake Berehowsky, who replaced the fired Rich Preston, the 2013–14 season would be a record-setting one, but in the wrong categories; the team stumbled out of the gate and dealt with turmoil amongst the players and coaching staff. Some notable occurrences saw veteran forwards Sam McKechnie and Jaimen Yakuboski sent home until both players were dealt to the Seattle Thunderbirds in October. A week later, third year defenseman Ryan Pilon requested a trade and left the team. Pilon got his wish and was dealt to the Brandon Wheat Kings in a multiplayer deal shortly afterwards. In addition to two more players requesting trades, the team endured a public relations nightmare when Assistant Coach Brad Lukowich walked out on the team following a 3–2 victory over the Prince Albert Raiders. Lukowich was terminated \"with cause\" days later. The team hit new lows by scoring a franchise-low 171 goals, allowing 358 goals and earned notoriety by losing two games by a combined score of 22–0; the first humiliation was a 10–0 loss to the Vancouver Giants on January 24, 2014, followed by a 12–0 loss to the Edmonton Oil Kings on February 17. The team capped off the season on a 15-game losing streak, finishing the year at 12–55–2–3 with 29 points, the League's lowest point total, placing them in last place in the entire WHL. The 12 wins and 29 points also set records for fewest wins and fewest points in the 26-year history of the Lethbridge Hurricanes, and the 46-year history of the franchise that began as the Winnipeg Jets.\n\nParagraph 2: Kasparov had beaten Deep Blue, a computer designed specifically to beat him, in a match played in 1996. He agreed to offer a rematch the following year. Kasparov won the first game of the rematch easily with the white pieces. In the second game, Kasparov was struggling with the black pieces, but set a trap that most computers fall for. Deep Blue didn't fall for it and won to level the match. At the time it was reported that both Kasparov and Deep Blue missed a perpetual check that could have given Kasparov a draw, but the strongest computer chess engines today, for example Stockfish, don't consider the final position as draw, but as having better winning chances for white, contradicting the human analysis at the time that Kasparov missed an opportunity to enter into a perpetual check. The next three matches ended in draws, with Kasparov appearing to weaken psychologically. Deep Blue went on to win the decisive sixth game, marking the first time in history that a computer defeated the World Champion in a match of several games.\n\nParagraph 3: In 2009, Dr. Susie Andretta, senior lecturer in Information Management at London Metropolitan University, conducted interviews with four different information professionals including an academic librarian, an outreach librarian, a content manager, and a scholar within the library science and information discipline. She was aiming to explore how transliteracy was colliding and combining with the print-world of libraries. Dr. Andretta defines transliteracy as \"an umbrella term encompassing different literacies and multiple communication channels that require active participation with and across a range of platforms, and embracing both linear and non-linear messages (3).\" The goals of these interviews ranged from the following: to test the information professional's awareness of transliteracy, to have them identify transliteracy and how it is integrated into their work, and to explain the impact transliteracy has had on they library they work at. Andretta found that out of all the information professionals interviewed, it was only the academic librarian who was vaguely familiar with the concept of transliteracy. Bernadette Daly Swanson, an Academic Librarian at UC Davis, expresses in her interview with Dr. Andretta how she would \"like to think that the transliterate library is more of an environment where we do different things [...] I would take maybe about a third of the first floor of our library and transform it into a lab [...] where we can start to evolve [..] explore, and experiment in media development, content development,  and do it not just with librarians; so open up the space for other people [...] so you don't get people working in isolation.\" Although the other three candidates that Dr. Andretta interviewed had not heard of the term \"transliteracy,\" they responded well to the concept once it was explained to them and agreed with its impact on the workplace. Dr. Michael Stephens, an assistant professor in the Graduate School of Library and Information Science at Dominican University, explains in his interview how the term transliteracy describes the courses he teaches on libraries and Web 2.0 technologies. Dr. Stephens states that students being educated in Web 2.0 technologies gives them \"the opportunity to experience what the channel can be and the potential for that sharing learning, for asking questions, just for out loud thinking- I think it's incredibly valuable. [..] this is where this wonderful concept comes in, it was teaching them transliteracy and the fact that they can move across channels without getting worried about it (Andretta, 5).\"\n\nParagraph 4: There is a  long wheelchair accessible circular trail along the Ae riverside from the main car park where there is disabled parking. The path is wide and generally flat and consists of a combination of cinder and compacted gravel tracks with very few low obstacles and slight inclines. The route is suitable for manual wheelchair users, just follow the yellow post markers. There is also the option of parking at the upper/overflow car park, shortening the walk to less than  and avoiding the first part of the trail which is shared with vehicles. For the more adventurous with \"off road\" wheelchairs the yellow trail can be extended by following the green mountain bike trail markers up to Dan's pool and back.\n\nParagraph 5: \"Township 7 South, Range 25 East and Township 8 South, Ranges 24 and 25 East, Mount Diablo Meridian:  These townships are very rough, intersected by deep canyons and very steep, almost impassable mountains, in part covered with dense chaparral.  Six weeks before the deputy claims to have commenced his surveys, all the people who live there in the summer are driven out by the snows, all business is suspended, and the mountain country abandoned.  A comparison of the original field notes, transcript notes, plats and report of the examiner, shows that at the season of the year (from December 1, 1884, to January 3, 1885) when the deputy pretends to have made the surveys, the deep snows made the survey at that time impossible; that in the original notes (which are now in this office) much is omitted that is found in the transcripts and data supplied from memory, or rather made up; that disregarding clerical errors the transcripts are not in any sense copies of the original notes; that triangulations omitted in originals are audaciously given in detail in the transcripts, just as if they had really been made in the field, that the high speed, more than 6 miles per day, at which it is pretended the work was executed, surpasses belief when we take into consideration the nature of the ground, and bear in mind that the surveying was done during the shortest days of the year; that the deputy gives descriptions of erroneous bearing trees where no such trees, either as regards size or species, are to be found; that in the face of all the embarrassing conditions, big canyons, high and steep mountains, deep snow, impenetrable chaparral, precipices impossible to ascend or descend, the deputy with his two parties of four men each, frequently with the impassable San Joaquin river between them, pretends to have subdivided T8SR24E at the rate of more than 6 miles per day, and then accomplishes the feat of recording all this work in one field book.  The conclusion is that the deputy did not make the surveys of these townships according to his field notes and that the notes are in large part fictitious and fraudulent.\"\n\nParagraph 6: Lucille Wexler soon found out that her housekeeper Jennifer was the long lost Jane Marie Stafford, when she paid a visit to the Springfield Arms hotel and to Jane Marie's older brother, Chet Stafford. Lucille, who had continued to drive a wedge between Ben McFarren and her \"daughter\", Amanda and their new marriage (including trying to still kill Ben), became increasingly paranoid that someone would find out that Amanda wasn't her biological daughter but Jennifer and Alan's. After Lucille made anonymous threatening phone calls to Amanda, Lucille arrived home to find Jennifer playing the piano (Alan and Jane Marie's favorite song, Misty by Johnny Mathis) and tried to kill Jennifer, shouting, \"JANE MARIE!\". Jennifer quickly whirled around to find Lucille behind her about to stab her, and Jennifer started fighting with the older woman. When Amanda came home with Ross, Lucille had ended up stabbing herself, and on her deathbed Lucille falsely told Amanda that Jennifer had stabbed her in cold blood. When Mike defended Jennifer of murder charges, with Ross now District Attorney and out for blood, Jennifer wouldn't offer any defense. Jennifer also refused to meet with either Alan or Jane Marie's brother, Chet. In January 1981, after Derek (now working for Mike) investigated and found Alan's new private investigator in Chet's hotel room, Mike decided to put Jennifer on the witness stand in her own defense while Derek brought both Alan and Chet into the courtroom. In emotional scenes (interrupted by CBS News reports of the end of the Iran hostage crisis; the producers later showed these scenes due to the amount of phone calls into CBS's switchboard angry with the interruption), it was revealed that Amanda was the biological daughter of both Alan and Jennifer. Amanda suffered a miscarriage (of Ben's baby) due to the stress of finding out the truth (in 1997, in a major rewrite, Amanda learned that her father was Brandon Spaulding and Alan was her brother—a move that was unpopular with many long time viewers).\n\nParagraph 7: Lucille Wexler soon found out that her housekeeper Jennifer was the long lost Jane Marie Stafford, when she paid a visit to the Springfield Arms hotel and to Jane Marie's older brother, Chet Stafford.

The first, a single platform terminus was built on what became the coal yard by the South Yorkshire Railway (SYR). Today this approximates to the land off Brinsworth Street below the bridge which carries the Inner Relief Road over the railway. The SYR could not gain permission to pass below the already built line of the Sheffield and Rotherham Railway, opened in 1838. A few years later and following amalgamation into the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway (MS&LR), a scheme was developed to fill the South Yorkshire Navigation, a canal already owned by that railway company and divert its course into the nearby River Don. As the Navigation already passed below the Sheffield and Rotherham line this would solve the problem, although until recent years the line was prone to flooding. The SYR already had a single line from Mexborough, on its Barnsley to Doncaster line, towards Rotherham, running alongside the canal but only as far as the pottery and brickworks at Kilnhurst, leaving a gap of almost  between. When the through line was completed a new, although temporary Rotherham station was built in the cut with access from the road above named \"Amen Corner\". This served the town from 1 August 1868. The line between Rotherham and Mexborough opened for goods traffic on 13 March 1871; passenger services began on 3 April 1871 but these continued to use the temporary station until the permanent Rotherham Central station was opened on 1 February 1874. This was an elongated affair with staggered platforms and a large stone main building adjacent to the \"Statutes Fair Ground\" (now the site of Rotherham's main police station). Originally the access was from Main Street, at the Sheffield end, and College Road, at the Doncaster end. In January 1889 this station was renamed Rotherham and Masborough. This station came under the ownership of the Great Central Railway (GCR) when the MS&LR changed its name in anticipation of its extension to London (Marylebone station), in 1897. The station was served by Sheffield Victoria -  local trains and others ranging from the north east to the south coast, the Great Central Railway being involved in many operations jointly with other companies. The GCR amalgamated with other railways to form the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) at the start of 1923; the LNER was itself nationalised at the start of 1948, becoming part of the newly formed British Railways (BR). Following this, Rotherham and Masborough was renamed Rotherham Central on 25 September 1950. Its last main line train, a throw-back to pre-First World War One joint operations, being the Newcastle to Bournemouth express. This station was closed on 5 September 1966 and soon demolished.\n\nParagraph 12: Lucille Wexler soon found out that her housekeeper Jennifer was the long lost Jane Marie Stafford, when she paid a visit to the Springfield Arms hotel and to Jane Marie's older brother, Chet Stafford.

Amanda suffered a miscarriage (of Ben's baby) due to the stress of finding out the truth (in 1997, in a major rewrite, Amanda learned that her father was Brandon Spaulding and Alan was her brother—a move that was unpopular with many long time viewers).\n\nParagraph 13: This is the fourth station to be built, within the town centre, on the line from . The first, a single platform terminus was built on what became the coal yard by the South Yorkshire Railway (SYR). Today this approximates to the land off Brinsworth Street below the bridge which carries the Inner Relief Road over the railway. The SYR could not gain permission to pass below the already built line of the Sheffield and Rotherham Railway, opened in 1838. A few years later and following amalgamation into the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway (MS&LR), a scheme was developed to fill the South Yorkshire Navigation, a canal already owned by that railway company and divert its course into the nearby River Don. As the Navigation already passed below the Sheffield and Rotherham line this would solve the problem, although until recent years the line was prone to flooding. The SYR already had a single line from Mexborough, on its Barnsley to Doncaster line, towards Rotherham, running alongside the canal but only as far as the pottery and brickworks at Kilnhurst, leaving a gap of almost  between. When the through line was completed a new, although temporary Rotherham station was built in the cut with access from the road above named \"Amen Corner\". This served the town from 1 August 1868. The line between Rotherham and Mexborough opened for goods traffic on 13 March 1871; passenger services began on 3 April 1871 but these continued to use the temporary station until the permanent Rotherham Central station was opened on 1 February 1874. This was an elongated affair with staggered platforms and a large stone main building adjacent to the \"Statutes Fair Ground\" (now the site of Rotherham's main police station). Originally the access was from Main Street, at the Sheffield end, and College Road, at the Doncaster end. In January 1889 this station was renamed Rotherham and Masborough. This station came under the ownership of the Great Central Railway (GCR) when the MS&LR changed its name in anticipation of its extension to London (Marylebone station), in 1897. The station was served by Sheffield Victoria -  local trains and others ranging from the north east to the south coast, the Great Central Railway being involved in many operations jointly with other companies. The GCR amalgamated with other railways to form the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) at the start of 1923; the LNER was itself nationalised at the start of 1948, becoming part of the newly formed British Railways (BR). Following this, Rotherham and Masborough was renamed Rotherham Central on 25 September 1950.

Lucille, who had continued to drive a wedge between Ben McFarren and her \"daughter\", Amanda and their new marriage (including trying to still kill Ben), became increasingly paranoid that someone would find out that Amanda wasn't her biological daughter but Jennifer and Alan's. After Lucille made anonymous threatening phone calls to Amanda, Lucille arrived home to find Jennifer playing the piano (Alan and Jane Marie's favorite song, Misty by Johnny Mathis) and tried to kill Jennifer, shouting, \"JANE MARIE!\". Jennifer quickly whirled around to find Lucille behind her about to stab her, and Jennifer started fighting with the older woman. When Amanda came home with Ross, Lucille had ended up stabbing herself, and on her deathbed Lucille falsely told Amanda that Jennifer had stabbed her in cold blood. When Mike defended Jennifer of murder charges, with Ross now District Attorney and out for blood, Jennifer wouldn't offer any defense. Jennifer also refused to meet with either Alan or Jane Marie's brother, Chet. In January 1981, after Derek (now working for Mike) investigated and found Alan's new private investigator in Chet's hotel room, Mike decided to put Jennifer on the witness stand in her own defense while Derek brought both Alan and Chet into the courtroom. In emotional scenes (interrupted by CBS News reports of the end of the Iran hostage crisis; the producers later showed these scenes due to the amount of phone calls into CBS's switchboard angry with the interruption), it was revealed that Amanda was the biological daughter of both Alan and Jennifer. Amanda suffered a miscarriage (of Ben's baby) due to the stress of finding out the truth (in 1997, in a major rewrite, Amanda learned that her father was Brandon Spaulding and Alan was her brother—a move that was unpopular with many long time viewers).\n\nParagraph 20: In 2009, Dr. Susie Andretta, senior lecturer in Information Management at London Metropolitan University, conducted interviews with four different information professionals including an academic librarian, an outreach librarian, a content manager, and a scholar within the library science and information discipline. She was aiming to explore how transliteracy was colliding and combining with the print-world of libraries. Dr. Andretta defines transliteracy as \"an umbrella term encompassing different literacies and multiple communication channels that require active participation with and across a range of platforms, and embracing both linear and non-linear messages (3).\" The goals of these interviews ranged from the following: to test the information professional's awareness of transliteracy, to have them identify transliteracy and how it is integrated into their work, and to explain the impact transliteracy has had on they library they work at. Andretta found that out of all the information professionals interviewed, it was only the academic librarian who was vaguely familiar with the concept of transliteracy. Bernadette Daly Swanson, an Academic Librarian at UC Davis, expresses in her interview with Dr. Andretta how she would \"like to think that the transliterate library is more of an environment where we do different things [...] I would take maybe about a third of the first floor of our library and transform it into a lab [...] where we can start to evolve [..] explore, and experiment in media development, content development,  and do it not just with librarians; so open up the space for other people [...] so you don't get people working in isolation.\" Although the other three candidates that Dr. Andretta interviewed had not heard of the term \"transliteracy,\" they responded well to the concept once it was explained to them and agreed with its impact on the workplace. Dr. Michael Stephens, an assistant professor in the Graduate School of Library and Information Science at Dominican University, explains in his interview how the term transliteracy describes the courses he teaches on libraries and Web 2.0 technologies. Dr. Stephens states that students being educated in Web 2.0 technologies gives them \"the opportunity to experience what the channel can be and the potential for that sharing learning, for asking questions, just for out loud thinking- I think it's incredibly valuable. [..] this is where this wonderful concept comes in, it was teaching them transliteracy and the fact that they can move across channels without getting worried about it (Andretta, 5).\"\n\nParagraph 21: Lucille Wexler soon found out that her housekeeper Jennifer was the long lost Jane Marie Stafford, when she paid a visit to the Springfield Arms hotel and to Jane Marie's older brother, Chet Stafford.

He agreed to offer a rematch the following year. Kasparov won the first game of the rematch easily with the white pieces. In the second game, Kasparov was struggling with the black pieces, but set a trap that most computers fall for. Deep Blue didn't fall for it and won to level the match. At the time it was reported that both Kasparov and Deep Blue missed a perpetual check that could have given Kasparov a draw, but the strongest computer chess engines today, for example Stockfish, don't consider the final position as draw, but as having better winning chances for white, contradicting the human analysis at the time that Kasparov missed an opportunity to enter into a perpetual check. The next three matches ended in draws, with Kasparov appearing to weaken psychologically. Deep Blue went on to win the decisive sixth game, marking the first time in history that a computer defeated the World Champion in a match of several games.\n\nParagraph 23: Speakers may find it challenging to deliver a speech using extemporaneous speech style in order to make the delivery organized, conversational, and responsive to the audience and context. An extemporaneous delivery will require that the speaker use a limited number of notes, and avoid a read or memorized presentation; instead, the speaker should practice and rehearse as many times as needed to become familiar with the subject and deliver the content using their own words and a conversational style. A conversational style is engaging for the audience, while the organization allows for greater understanding of the topic. The first couple of times the speech is rehearsed, speakers may stumble and forget words or what order to follow. Because of this, it is recommended that speakers practice multiple times well in advance of the speech event. Practice should be realistic, replicating the speaking event as closely as possible (using presentation aids and technology, including an audience, the size of the room, mic, etc.). As such, it is imperative that speakers practice with their speaker notes, allowing for familiarity and adjustments to be made so they are useful at a glance. Therefore, practicing the speech out loud is better than silently because it will help master the content being presented.", "answers": ["8"], "length": 7562, "dataset": "passage_count_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "90a34e79c780c2df4d2dad95609a596c6098240e94842bf6"}
{"input": "", "context": "Paragraph 1: For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty while serving as a Squad Leader of Company E, Second Battalion, Seventh Marines, First Marine Division(Reinforced), in action against enemy aggressor forces in Korea on 4 November 1950. Assuming the point position in the attack against a strongly defended and well-entrenched numerically superior enemy force occupying a vital hill position which had been unsuccessfully assaulted on five separate occasions by units of the Marine Corps and other friendly forces, Corporal Phillips fearlessly led his men in a bayonet charge up the precipitous slope under a deadly hail of hostile mortar, small-arms and machine-gun fire. Quickly rallying his squad when it was pinned down by a heavy and accurate mortar barrage, he continued to lead his men through the bombarded area and, although only five members were left in the casualty ridden unit, gained the military crest of the hill where he was immediately subjected to an enemy counterattack. Although greatly outnumbered by an estimated enemy squad, Corporal Phillips boldly engaged the hostile force with hand grenades and rifle fire and, exhorting his gallant group of Marines to follow him, stormed forward to completely overwhelm the enemy. With only three men now left in his squad, he proceeded to spearhead an assault on the last remaining strong point which was defended by four of the enemy on a rocky and almost inaccessible portion of the hill position. Using one hand to climb up the extremely hazardous precipice, he hurled grenades with the other and, with two remaining comrades, succeeded in annihilating the pocket of resistance and in consolidating the position. Immediately subjected to a sharp counterattack by an estimated enemy squad, he skillfully directed the fire of his men and employed his own weapon with deadly effectiveness to repulse the numerically superior hostile force. By his valiant leadership, indomitable fighting spirit and resolute determination in the face of heavy odds, Corporal Phillips served to inspire all who observed him and was directly responsible for the destruction of the enemy stronghold. His great personal valor reflects the highest credit upon himself and enhances and sustains the finest traditions of the United States Naval Service.\n\nParagraph 2: Accomplishments and progress of Native American organizations on the national level inspired change on the local level. It did not take too long for local tribes to begin to establish their own organizations that would benefit them directly. One of the earliest of such organizations was the Determination of Rights and Unity for Menominee Shareholders (DRUMS) - a citizens' group founded in 1970. It focused on stopping the Legend Lake sales, establishing Menominee control over the Menominee Enterprises, Inc. (MEI), and, eventually, even reversing termination, which was the main purpose of self-determination. DRUMS made an immediate impact. Within months of establishment, the Menominee organized a series of well-planned and smoothly executed demonstrations. In an effort to interrupt the Legend Lake land development, DRUMS picketed Legend Lake's Menominee County sales office and promotional events in nearby cities, such as Milwaukee, Green Bay, and Appleton. In October 1971, DRUMS led an impressive 12-day,  from Menominee County, to the state capitol in Madison. Like the other DRUMS protests, the march to Madison, was non-violent but sharp-edged nonetheless. Minnesota Governor Patrick Lucey met with DRUMS leaders and discussed prevalent issues in the Menominee community. Within a month of the march, Governor Lucey visited Menominee County, and consistently supported the Menominee movement. In addition, DRUMS managed to produce a first draft of the Menominee restoration bill by the end of 1971 and by early 1972 the tribe had already obtained an astounding level of support, including the support of Democratic Presidential nominee Henry Jackson. Though it took a prodigious amount of work, the Menominee Restoration Act moved through Congress with rare speed. In April 1975, MEI was dissolved and all Menominee lands were transferred back to the tribe, to be held in trust by the United States of America and governed by the sovereign Menominee Tribe of Wisconsin. Although DRUMS set its sights on improving the status of the local Menominee people, it was a big step toward the nationwide self-determination movement. The success of DRUMS let other Indians know that they too could make an impact, if only on a local level, and motivated other tribes to fight for their rights. On the national scope, DRUMS allowed Native American leaders to assume prominent positions. For instance, Ada Deer was catapulted to the top of the federal government; In 1993, Deer was appointed Assistant Secretary of the Interior by President Bill Clinton and served as head of the Bureau of Indian Affairs from 1993–1997.\n\nParagraph 3: David Metcalfe (Matthew Wolfenden) finds out that Lachlan and Lawrence's stepdaughter, Gabby (Rosie Bentham), were responsible for the break in at Eric Pollard's (Chris Chittell) house and the theft of Val's ring. David is unhappy at Lawrence's discipline suggestion by paying for damages and insists on phoning the police. When Gabby's father, Ashley Thomas (John Middleton), finds out what Gabby has done, he is furious with Bernice and Lawrence and insists Gabby lives with him full-time. Later, Lawrence talks to Ashley, agreeing with what he said and the reason he is soft with Gabby is because he doesn't feel like it's his place to discipline Gabby, but Ashley reminds him he has to be a dad through the bad as well as the good. They later inform Bernice of the plan for Lawrence to adopt Gabby when Ashley's dementia worsens. Lawrence arranges for Lachlan and Gabby to apologise to Eric in front of their parents. When Gabby complains about being embarrassed and that Lawrence isn't her father, Ashley tells her that Lawrence is as much of a parent to her as him and Bernice. Later, Lawrence finds Lachlan's laptop open and finds footage of Bernice. He suspects Lachlan is responsible, when in fact it is Chrissie and he tells Bernice what Lachlan may be doing. Chrissie later confesses it was her and that she didn't want Bernice betraying him, but Chrissie learns her dad offered Bernice an open marriage and did the same with her mother. Chrissie later fears that she and Rebecca may not be Lawrence's children. A few weeks later Chrissie's new boyfriend Andy Sugden (Kelvin Fletcher) convinces her to ask for a DNA test but after an argument over it Lawrence finally tells Chrissie the truth, that he is not her real father. Ronnie Hale (John McArdle), who Bernice believes to be Chrissie's biological father, turns up at Home Farm looking for Lawrence. He reveals that Chrissie asked him to fix a leak weeks before. They have an argument until Bernice interrupts. Ronnie says goodbye to Lawrence and leaves. He tells Bernice who he really is. It is later confirmed that Lawrence and Ronnie were lovers while he was married to Ellen. When he sees Ronnie talking to Lachlan he orders him to leave but Ronnie refuses. He then asks Sam Dingle (James Hooton) to kill Ronnie. He reluctantly agrees. When he goes to shoot him Ronnie talks him down. He then gives Lawrence back the gun and confronts him. Lawrence accidentally hits Ronnie and Ronnie leaves telling Lawrence that he won't be seeing him again. Lawrence later tells Bernice she made the biggest mistake of her life marrying him.\n\nParagraph 4: David Metcalfe (Matthew Wolfenden) finds out that Lachlan and Lawrence's stepdaughter, Gabby (Rosie Bentham), were responsible for the break in at Eric Pollard's (Chris Chittell) house and the theft of Val's ring.

For purposes of biogeography, islands are divided into two classes. Continental islands are islands like Great Britain, and Japan that have at one time or another been part of a continent. Oceanic islands, like the Hawaiian islands, the Galápagos Islands and St. Helena, on the other hand are islands that have formed in the ocean and never been part of any continent. Oceanic islands have distributions of native plants and animals that are unbalanced in ways that make them distinct from the biotas found on continents or continental islands. Oceanic islands do not have native terrestrial mammals (they do sometimes have bats and seals), amphibians, or fresh water fish. In some cases they have terrestrial reptiles (such as the iguanas and giant tortoises of the Galápagos Islands) but often (such as in Hawaii) they do not. This is despite the fact that when species such as rats, goats, pigs, cats, mice, and cane toads, are introduced to such islands by humans they often thrive. Starting with Charles Darwin, many scientists have conducted experiments and made observations that have shown that the types of animals and plants found, and not found, on such islands are consistent with the theory that these islands were colonized accidentally by plants and animals that were able to reach them. Such accidental colonization could occur by air, such as plant seeds carried by migratory birds, or bats and insects being blown out over the sea by the wind, or by floating from a continent or other island by sea (for example, by some kinds of plant seeds like coconuts that can survive immersion in salt water), and reptiles that can survive for extended periods on rafts of vegetation carried to sea by storms.\n\nParagraph 7: The first federal protection of shoreline in the U.S. for public recreation purposes was in 1930, when Congress established \"the principle of conserving the natural beauty of shore lines for recreational use\" in northern Minnesota. With a push for job-creating conservation programs during the Great Depression, the National Park Service expanded its role in managing national parks and national monuments to protecting historic sites and recreation areas, including coastlines. Its work controlling erosion at North Carolina's Outer Banks led to it considering designation of Cape Hatteras, where not only beach-going but also fishing and hunting were already popular, as a national beach or national recreation area, but debate over the meaning of this status and how the land would be acquired by the NPS delayed action, as existing and expected development made it unsuitable for a national park. The 1936 Park, Parkway, and Recreational Area Study Act gave the Park Service a framework to designate and protect a wider variety of resources that included recreational land use. Congress authorized Cape Hatteras National Seashore in August 1937, and President Roosevelt signed the bill before visiting Roanoke Island. It was not established, however, until 1953 and dedicated in 1958 after permission to hunt was determined, the land was purchased and donated to the Park Service, and ongoing funding was authorized, but the process would serve as an example for how to create and manage similar dual-purpose sites.\n\nParagraph 8: For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty while serving as a Squad Leader of Company E, Second Battalion, Seventh Marines, First Marine Division(Reinforced), in action against enemy aggressor forces in Korea on 4 November 1950. Assuming the point position in the attack against a strongly defended and well-entrenched numerically superior enemy force occupying a vital hill position which had been unsuccessfully assaulted on five separate occasions by units of the Marine Corps and other friendly forces, Corporal Phillips fearlessly led his men in a bayonet charge up the precipitous slope under a deadly hail of hostile mortar, small-arms and machine-gun fire. Quickly rallying his squad when it was pinned down by a heavy and accurate mortar barrage, he continued to lead his men through the bombarded area and, although only five members were left in the casualty ridden unit, gained the military crest of the hill where he was immediately subjected to an enemy counterattack. Although greatly outnumbered by an estimated enemy squad, Corporal Phillips boldly engaged the hostile force with hand grenades and rifle fire and, exhorting his gallant group of Marines to follow him, stormed forward to completely overwhelm the enemy. With only three men now left in his squad, he proceeded to spearhead an assault on the last remaining strong point which was defended by four of the enemy on a rocky and almost inaccessible portion of the hill position. Using one hand to climb up the extremely hazardous precipice, he hurled grenades with the other and, with two remaining comrades, succeeded in annihilating the pocket of resistance and in consolidating the position. Immediately subjected to a sharp counterattack by an estimated enemy squad, he skillfully directed the fire of his men and employed his own weapon with deadly effectiveness to repulse the numerically superior hostile force. By his valiant leadership, indomitable fighting spirit and resolute determination in the face of heavy odds, Corporal Phillips served to inspire all who observed him and was directly responsible for the destruction of the enemy stronghold. His great personal valor reflects the highest credit upon himself and enhances and sustains the finest traditions of the United States Naval Service.\n\nParagraph 9: Accomplishments and progress of Native American organizations on the national level inspired change on the local level. It did not take too long for local tribes to begin to establish their own organizations that would benefit them directly. One of the earliest of such organizations was the Determination of Rights and Unity for Menominee Shareholders (DRUMS) - a citizens' group founded in 1970. It focused on stopping the Legend Lake sales, establishing Menominee control over the Menominee Enterprises, Inc. (MEI), and, eventually, even reversing termination, which was the main purpose of self-determination. DRUMS made an immediate impact. Within months of establishment, the Menominee organized a series of well-planned and smoothly executed demonstrations. In an effort to interrupt the Legend Lake land development, DRUMS picketed Legend Lake's Menominee County sales office and promotional events in nearby cities, such as Milwaukee, Green Bay, and Appleton. In October 1971, DRUMS led an impressive 12-day,  from Menominee County, to the state capitol in Madison. Like the other DRUMS protests, the march to Madison, was non-violent but sharp-edged nonetheless. Minnesota Governor Patrick Lucey met with DRUMS leaders and discussed prevalent issues in the Menominee community. Within a month of the march, Governor Lucey visited Menominee County, and consistently supported the Menominee movement. In addition, DRUMS managed to produce a first draft of the Menominee restoration bill by the end of 1971 and by early 1972 the tribe had already obtained an astounding level of support, including the support of Democratic Presidential nominee Henry Jackson. Though it took a prodigious amount of work, the Menominee Restoration Act moved through Congress with rare speed. In April 1975, MEI was dissolved and all Menominee lands were transferred back to the tribe, to be held in trust by the United States of America and governed by the sovereign Menominee Tribe of Wisconsin. Although DRUMS set its sights on improving the status of the local Menominee people, it was a big step toward the nationwide self-determination movement. The success of DRUMS let other Indians know that they too could make an impact, if only on a local level, and motivated other tribes to fight for their rights. On the national scope, DRUMS allowed Native American leaders to assume prominent positions. For instance, Ada Deer was catapulted to the top of the federal government; In 1993, Deer was appointed Assistant Secretary of the Interior by President Bill Clinton and served as head of the Bureau of Indian Affairs from 1993–1997.\n\nParagraph 10: Lincoln Financial also acquired Jefferson-Pilot's television and radio operations, which were renamed Lincoln Financial Media. Jefferson Standard Insurance put WBTV in Charlotte on the air on Channel 3 in 1949.  At the time, Jefferson Standard Insurance also had a 16.5% interest in the Greensboro News Company, licensee of WFMY, which signed on from Greensboro two months after WBTV. Jefferson Standard had purchased WBT radio from CBS in 1947. In 1970, the media interests were folded into a new subsidiary, Jefferson-Pilot Communications, still owned by the insurance company.  The broadcasting subsidiary acquired several other radio and television stations across the country, with WBTV serving as the company's flagship station. The group owned 18 radio stations in Miami, Florida; San Diego, California; Denver, Colorado; and Atlanta, Georgia.  It also owned WBTV, the CBS affiliate in Charlotte; WCSC-TV, the CBS affiliate in Charleston, South Carolina and WWBT, the NBC affiliate in Richmond, Virginia.  In June 2007, the company publicly announced it would explore a sale of this division, and hired Merrill Lynch to assess its strategic options.  It was announced on November 12 that Raycom Media purchased the three TV stations, including its sports production division, which was the co-holder to football and basketball games in the Atlantic Coast Conference with Raycom and sole rightsholders to the Southeastern Conference until 2009, when ESPNPlus and CBS Sports acquired the rights.  The Raycom Sports brand was merged with LFS as of January 1, 2008.\n\nParagraph 11: The Tiananmen Papers was first published in English in January 2001 by PublicAffairs.

These were known as sídhe (\"Otherworld dwellings\") and were the dwellings of the gods, later called the aos sí or daoine sí (\"Otherworld folk\"). Irish mythology says the gods retreated into the sídhe when the Gaels (Milesians) took Ireland from them. In some tales, the Otherworld is reached by going under the waters of pools, lakes, or the sea, or else by crossing the western sea. In Irish Immrama (\"voyage\") tales, a beautiful young Otherworld woman often approaches the hero and sings to him of this happy land. Sometimes she offers him an apple, or the promise of her love in exchange for his help in battle. He follows her, and they journey over the sea together and are seen no more. Their journey may be in a boat of glass, in a chariot, or on horseback (usually on a white horse, as in the case of the goddess Niamh of the Golden Hair). Sometimes the hero returns after what he believes is a short time, only to find that all his companions are dead and he has actually been away for hundreds of years. Sometimes the hero sets out on a quest, and a magic mist descends upon him. He may find himself before an unusual palace and enter to find a warrior or a beautiful woman who makes him welcome. The woman may be the goddess Fand, the warrior may be Manannán mac Lir or Lugh, and after strange adventures the hero may return successfully. However, even when the mortal manages to return to his own time and place, he is forever changed by his contact with the Otherworld. \n\nParagraph 18: David Metcalfe (Matthew Wolfenden) finds out that Lachlan and Lawrence's stepdaughter, Gabby (Rosie Bentham), were responsible for the break in at Eric Pollard's (Chris Chittell) house and the theft of Val's ring. David is unhappy at Lawrence's discipline suggestion by paying for damages and insists on phoning the police. When Gabby's father, Ashley Thomas (John Middleton), finds out what Gabby has done, he is furious with Bernice and Lawrence and insists Gabby lives with him full-time. Later, Lawrence talks to Ashley, agreeing with what he said and the reason he is soft with Gabby is because he doesn't feel like it's his place to discipline Gabby, but Ashley reminds him he has to be a dad through the bad as well as the good. They later inform Bernice of the plan for Lawrence to adopt Gabby when Ashley's dementia worsens. Lawrence arranges for Lachlan and Gabby to apologise to Eric in front of their parents. When Gabby complains about being embarrassed and that Lawrence isn't her father, Ashley tells her that Lawrence is as much of a parent to her as him and Bernice. Later, Lawrence finds Lachlan's laptop open and finds footage of Bernice. He suspects Lachlan is responsible, when in fact it is Chrissie and he tells Bernice what Lachlan may be doing. Chrissie later confesses it was her and that she didn't want Bernice betraying him, but Chrissie learns her dad offered Bernice an open marriage and did the same with her mother. Chrissie later fears that she and Rebecca may not be Lawrence's children. A few weeks later Chrissie's new boyfriend Andy Sugden (Kelvin Fletcher) convinces her to ask for a DNA test but after an argument over it Lawrence finally tells Chrissie the truth, that he is not her real father. Ronnie Hale (John McArdle), who Bernice believes to be Chrissie's biological father, turns up at Home Farm looking for Lawrence. He reveals that Chrissie asked him to fix a leak weeks before. They have an argument until Bernice interrupts. Ronnie says goodbye to Lawrence and leaves. He tells Bernice who he really is. It is later confirmed that Lawrence and Ronnie were lovers while he was married to Ellen. When he sees Ronnie talking to Lachlan he orders him to leave but Ronnie refuses. He then asks Sam Dingle (James Hooton) to kill Ronnie. He reluctantly agrees. When he goes to shoot him Ronnie talks him down. He then gives Lawrence back the gun and confronts him. Lawrence accidentally hits Ronnie and Ronnie leaves telling Lawrence that he won't be seeing him again. Lawrence later tells Bernice she made the biggest mistake of her life marrying him.\n\nParagraph 19: Lincoln Financial also acquired Jefferson-Pilot's television and radio operations, which were renamed Lincoln Financial Media.

The financial situation was bad and bankruptcy was only minutes away. The question was again whether MVV would celebrate their 100th anniversary. Yet again, MVV management decided to go to the municipal government. With arguments such as \"the bankruptcy of the Sport7 channel caused the bad financial situation\" and \"MVV is very important to the people of Maastricht\" etc. they were able to convince mayor Houben and the aldermen. So eventually they managed to keep the club alive for 2002. MVV had a debt of 1.5 million euros and the last solution was to go to the municipal government again, for the second time within only a couple of years. But this time, in April 2003, they refused. According to newly appointed mayor Leers, \"the town could not grant MVV yet another loan because the citizens would not accept it.\" However, thousands of people gathered around the town hall to protest the intentions of the municipal government. Later, just in time, billionaire Léon Melchior saved the club again by paying off its debts. Currently, the club has reorganised their finances and is building on a solid financial basis.\n\nParagraph 22: The first federal protection of shoreline in the U.S. for public recreation purposes was in 1930, when Congress established \"the principle of conserving the natural beauty of shore lines for recreational use\" in northern Minnesota.

{"input": "", "context": "Paragraph 1: In 1979, an event then called \"Springfest\" was held on the last day of classes. Cornell Dining sponsored a chicken barbecue on Libe Slope and served beer to the students. At the time, New York State's drinking age was 18, making it easy for the university to sponsor both food and alcohol service for the event. For the next six years, Springfest involved live bands playing at the base of Libe Slope, with students dancing and drinking on the Slope itself.  In December 1985, New York state raised the drinking age to 21, so University officials announced that the 1986 Springfest would be held in a fenced-in area on North Campus instead of the Slope.  The student body responded with a massive \"Take Back the Slope\" campaign. All across campus, T-shirts, signs and chalk on sidewalks beckoned students to boycott the official Springfest and \"Take Back the Slope.\"  They did by the thousands, and the name \"Slope Day\" replaced \"Springfest.\"  In 1987, the University caved to pressure and had Robert Cray play on the Slope, but by 1988 the bands were gone once again and Slope Day became an unofficial event. For the next decade or so, the University tolerated Slope Day, and took little action to control it except for the banning of beer kegs in 1991.  For many students the focus of Slope Day became the consumption of excessive amounts of alcohol. \n\nParagraph 2: Ornament in the Roman empire utilized a diverse array of styles and materials, including marble, glass, obsidian, and gold. Roman ornament, specifically in the context of Pompeii, has been studied and written about by scholar Jessica Powers in her book chapter “Beyond Painting in Pompeii’s Houses: Wall Ornaments and Their Patrons.” Instead of studying ornamental objects in isolation, Powers argues that, if the information is provided, objects must be approached in their original context. This information might include the location where the work was found, other objects located or found nearby, or who the patron was who might have commissioned the work.   Jessica Powers’ chapter primarily discusses the Casa Degli Amorini Dorati in Pompeii, where 18 wall ornaments were found, the most of any Pompeiian home. Interior wall ornament in a Pompeian home would typically divide the wall into three or more sections under which there would be a dado taking up roughly one-sixth of the height of the wall. The wall sections would be divided by broad pilasters connected by a frieze which bands across the top of the wall. The ornament found at the Casa Degli Amorini Dorati in Pompeii reflected this standard style and included objects that had clearly been reused, and rare and imported objects. Several of the panels on the walls of the Casa Degli Amorini Dorati were removed during archeological work in the 1970s, revealing that the panels had been stuck on different walls before the one on which they were found. Jessica Powers argues that these panels illustrate the home owner and correlating patrons’ willingness to utilize damaged or secondhand materials in their own home. Moreover, the materials used in the decorative wall panels were identified as being from the Greek East or Egypt, not from Pompeii. This points to the elaborate trade routes that flourished across the Roman Empire, and that home owners were interested in using materials from outside of Pompeii to embellish their homes. \n\nParagraph 3: On 29 November 2014, \"Uptown Funk\" debuted at number 63 on the Canadian Hot 100. The following week it reached the top ten, in the third week entered the top five peaking at number two in the fourth week. On the issue date of 10 January 2015, the song reached number one, a position it held for fifteen consecutive weeks. It became the second longest-running number-one single on the Canadian Hot 100, behind The Black Eyed Peas' \"I Gotta Feeling\" (2009), which spent sixteen weeks at number one. On the issue date of 25 April 2015, the song was replaced by Wiz Khalifa and Charlie Puth's \"See You Again\" (2015). It was certified diamond by Music Canada (MC) for track-equivalent sales of 800,000 units. It finished at number one on the Canada Hot 100. In the United Kingdom, \"Uptown Funk\" was covered by Fleur East on The X Factor before its official release date, the cover reached number one on iTunes. This led the original version being released five weeks earlier than originally planned. Nevertheless, it debuted at number one on the UK Singles Chart on 14 December 2014, giving Ronson his first UK number one as a producer and artist and also giving Mars his fifth UK number one. The following week, the song was replaced in the top spot by the X Factor winner Ben Haenow's single, \"Something I Need\" (2014), making it the Christmas number one. It then returned to number one for a further six consecutive weeks spending seven non-consecutive weeks at number one in total, before finally being knocked off from the top on 8 February 2015 by Ellie Goulding's \"Love Me Like You Do\" (2015). The track was certified six times platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI), for track-equivalent sales of 3,600,000 units. \"Uptown Funk\" was the best-selling song of 2015 in the UK, with combined sales of 1.76 million during the year (total 2.25 million). As of September 2017, the song had 2,723,470 combining units, making the list of best-selling singles of the 21st century in the United Kingdom as the fourth best-selling single based on paid-for sales and the second best-selling song based on combined sales. It made the year-end charts in 2014 and 2015, topping the latter. \"Uptown Funk\" debuted at number two on 12 December 2014, and the following week peaked at the top of the Irish Singles Chart, taking the Christmas number one spot. It became the first song not released by The X Factor winner to reach this position in nine years. It spent seven weeks at number one on the Irish Charts, before being knocked off the top by Ellie Goulding's \"Love Me Like You Do\" (2015).\n\nParagraph 4: By 102 BC, Marius was ready to face the Cimbri; the latter, after difficulties in Spain, had turned north into Gaul, where they were joined by the Teutons. After this union, the Germanic coalition determined to move back south upon Italy, which they had previously avoided. Marching south through Switzerland and Savoy, their army was augmented by some tribes of Helvetians, particularly the Tigurini, and the Ambrones of uncertain descent. Before approaching Italy, the Germans decided on a two-pronged movement; the Teutons with the Ambrones and the Tigurini would move from the west along the coast-road from Transalpine into Cisalpine Gaul; while the Cimbri would march east and turn around into Italy by the Julian and Carnic Alps. When Marius heard of their movements, he advanced to Valence, and established his camp at the confluence of the Isère and the Rhône, where he could observe and halt the march of the Teutons. When the Teutons arrived, they attempted to force him into battle, but he declined; they attacked the Roman camp, but were beaten off. Impatient of the delay and of Marius' passivity, they finally decided to simply march past him into Italy. So enormous were their numbers, that they reportedly took 6 whole days marching by his camp, and in their arrogance they taunted the Romans, what message they wished them to give to their wives?  Marius followed cautiously, maintaining distance from the enemy, but closely following his movements. A few days later, a skirmish turned into a battle with the Ambrones, who for some reason camped separately from the Teutones. The Ambrones were defeated with heavy losses and fled to their Teutonic allies. The Teutones halted their trek south and awaited Marius near Aquae Sextiae. This afforded Marius favorable conditions, for with his enemy stationary he got to scout the battlegrounds and he chose his ground carefully. In the subsequent battle, he lured the Teutones and their allies into attacking him while his army was occupying the high ground. During their attack they were ambushed from the rear by a select force of five cohorts which Marius had hidden in a nearby wood. The Teutones were routed and massacred and their king, Teutobod, was placed in Roman chains. But Aquae Sextiae had only evened the score: while the Teutones had been eliminated, the Cimbri remained a formidable threat.\n\nParagraph 5: There were at least five attempts to impersonate Cooke. The first of these appeared in a Pennsylvania town with a woman who claimed there that she had written everything ever published under Rose Terry's name, that the name was a pen name any way, the name of a little cousin of hers who died young, her uncle, the child's father, allowing her to use it. This person aroused a wild religious excitement among the young people of the place, fell into hysteric trances on hearing sacred music, and made herself generally adored and followed. As irritating as this was, she further stated that she had received  from these writings of hers, and had used it all in educating poor girls. After a time, Harriet Beecher Stowe received a note from the lady with whom this pretender boarded, which ran, —\"dear Madam,—I call upon you to silence the base reports spread about here concerning a lovely Christian woman at present staying with me. A line from you, stating that she is the author of the works written under the signature of Rose Terry will stop the rumors at once, and much oblige yours truly.\" Stowe immediately responded that she had known Rose Terry from her birth, and that she was then, and had been for many years, living in Hartford, and the other person was an impostor. Years afterward, this deceiver came to Rose Terry's home town, established herself there as one of the leaders in religious and charitable matters, told someone that she had written much under Rose's name, told someone else that she had  a year from the \"Atlantic Monthly,\" and marked several of the best poems in a religious collection as her own, the publisher positively denying her statement when asked about it. This peculiar individual held a trusted position in a city charity, and lived in a wealthy family as a guide, although the truth was told to her clientele, who persisted in regarding her as a persecuted saint.\n\nParagraph 6: In 1979, an event then called \"Springfest\" was held on the last day of classes. Cornell Dining sponsored a chicken barbecue on Libe Slope and served beer to the students. At the time, New York State's drinking age was 18, making it easy for the university to sponsor both food and alcohol service for the event. For the next six years, Springfest involved live bands playing at the base of Libe Slope, with students dancing and drinking on the Slope itself.  In December 1985, New York state raised the drinking age to 21, so University officials announced that the 1986 Springfest would be held in a fenced-in area on North Campus instead of the Slope.  The student body responded with a massive \"Take Back the Slope\" campaign. All across campus, T-shirts, signs and chalk on sidewalks beckoned students to boycott the official Springfest and \"Take Back the Slope.\"  They did by the thousands, and the name \"Slope Day\" replaced \"Springfest.\"  In 1987, the University caved to pressure and had Robert Cray play on the Slope, but by 1988 the bands were gone once again and Slope Day became an unofficial event. For the next decade or so, the University tolerated Slope Day, and took little action to control it except for the banning of beer kegs in 1991.  For many students the focus of Slope Day became the consumption of excessive amounts of alcohol. \n\nParagraph 7: By 102 BC, Marius was ready to face the Cimbri; the latter, after difficulties in Spain, had turned north into Gaul, where they were joined by the Teutons. After this union, the Germanic coalition determined to move back south upon Italy, which they had previously avoided. Marching south through Switzerland and Savoy, their army was augmented by some tribes of Helvetians, particularly the Tigurini, and the Ambrones of uncertain descent. Before approaching Italy, the Germans decided on a two-pronged movement; the Teutons with the Ambrones and the Tigurini would move from the west along the coast-road from Transalpine into Cisalpine Gaul; while the Cimbri would march east and turn around into Italy by the Julian and Carnic Alps. When Marius heard of their movements, he advanced to Valence, and established his camp at the confluence of the Isère and the Rhône, where he could observe and halt the march of the Teutons. When the Teutons arrived, they attempted to force him into battle, but he declined; they attacked the Roman camp, but were beaten off. Impatient of the delay and of Marius' passivity, they finally decided to simply march past him into Italy. So enormous were their numbers, that they reportedly took 6 whole days marching by his camp, and in their arrogance they taunted the Romans, what message they wished them to give to their wives?  Marius followed cautiously, maintaining distance from the enemy, but closely following his movements. A few days later, a skirmish turned into a battle with the Ambrones, who for some reason camped separately from the Teutones. The Ambrones were defeated with heavy losses and fled to their Teutonic allies. The Teutones halted their trek south and awaited Marius near Aquae Sextiae. This afforded Marius favorable conditions, for with his enemy stationary he got to scout the battlegrounds and he chose his ground carefully. In the subsequent battle, he lured the Teutones and their allies into attacking him while his army was occupying the high ground. During their attack they were ambushed from the rear by a select force of five cohorts which Marius had hidden in a nearby wood. The Teutones were routed and massacred and their king, Teutobod, was placed in Roman chains. But Aquae Sextiae had only evened the score: while the Teutones had been eliminated, the Cimbri remained a formidable threat.\n\nParagraph 8: It was observed that his prior reasoning for the impeachment of President Bill Clinton contradicted the opinions he shared against the impeachment of President Donald Trump. Turley sought to clarify his positions regarding the two impeachments the next day in an op-ed. Turley noted that in both hearings he stressed that a president could be impeached for non-criminal acts, including abuse of power, and House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler ended the Trump impeachment hearings by quoting him to that effect. He has noted that the only disagreement was the sufficiency of the record and his calling on House to issue subpoenas for key witnesses like former national security adviser John Bolton. The push for additional time was due in part to Turley's concern that the House was going to impeach a president for going to the courts rather than yielding to congressional demands for witnesses and documents. Given the short period of investigation, Turley objected that such a move would effectively make seeking judicial review as high crime and misdemeanor. He noted that both Presidents Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton were able to go all the way to the Supreme Court on their challenges before impeachment. While Turley told the Committee that such judicial opinions were not required to impeach on obstruction, the abbreviated period of investigation undermined the foundation of that article.\n\nParagraph 9: Rodgers led them in the 2013–14 season to a surprise title challenge, however Liverpool ended the league season in second place, despite scoring 101 goals, the club's most since the 1895–96 season and the third-highest in Premier League history. Rodgers was the first Liverpool manager to win the LMA Manager of The Year Award. However, he was the first manager of the club not to win a major trophy in his first three years at the helm, and on 4 October 2015, he was sacked. On 8 October, he was replaced by former Borussia Dortmund manager Jürgen Klopp. Klopp made an instant impact on the club and guided them to a League Cup Final and a surprise Europa League Final in his first season at the club. During their Europa League campaign, he beat both English rivals Manchester United and his former club Borussia Dortmund en route to the final. However, they lost the League Cup Final to Manchester City via penalty shoot-out and they lost 1–3 to Spanish side Sevilla in the Europa League Final. They also finished 8th in the league, meaning they wouldn't qualify for European competition for the 2016–17 season. On 8 June 2016, Klopp and his coaching staff signed six-year contract extensions that ran until 2022. Klopp guided the club to a fourth-place finish in the 2016–17 season, qualifying them for the 2017–18 UEFA Champions League qualifying play-offs, where they beat German club, TSG 1899 Hoffenheim 6–3 on aggregate in a two-legged play-off to reach the group stage. Klopp led to the team to finish top of their group and beat eventual English champions, Manchester City, and Italian club Roma in the knockout phase en route to the 2018 UEFA Champions League Final. Unfortunately for Liverpool, they lost 1–3 to Spanish giants Real Madrid. During the 2018–19 season, Klopp guided Liverpool to their sixth Champions League triumph with a 2–0 win over fellow English club, Tottenham Hotspur, and also guided the club to a second-place finish in the league. At the start of the 2019–20 season, Klopp's Liverpool side played against Manchester City in the FA Community Shield and against Chelsea in the UEFA Super Cup. Both matches went into penalty shoot-outs, with Liverpool losing the former and winning the latter. Later in December, Klopp also guided Liverpool to their first ever FIFA club World Cup trophy, making it 3 trophies in 2019. In the 2019–20 season, Klopp secured Liverpool's first Premier League title and first top flight title since 1990 by finishing on the most points in their history (99 points). The season was notable both for Liverpool's huge points lead over the rest of the league and for its interruption by the Coronavirus shutdown, meaning Liverpool won the Premier league at both the earliest (7 games to go) and the latest time (June) ever.\n\nParagraph 10: By 102 BC, Marius was ready to face the Cimbri; the latter, after difficulties in Spain, had turned north into Gaul, where they were joined by the Teutons.

The one which crashed in Meads on 16 August 1940 (A2 + GL) was the first enemy aircraft to be brought down in the County Borough of Eastbourne. At about 5.30 pm on Friday 16 August 1940, the first German aircraft to be brought down within what was then the County Borough of Eastbourne crashed in Meads.  A Messerschmitt Bf 110 of the Luftwaffe unit known as ZG 2 had left the former French aerodrome at Guyancourt as part of an escort for bombers raiding RAF airfields at Feltham, Heston and Heathrow.  Over the South Downs, the Messerschmitt was engaged by a British fighter – almost certainly the Hurricane flown by Pilot Officer H N E Salmon of No. 1 Squadron. The German aircraft broke up in the air, and the pilot, Hauptmann Ernst Hollekamp, was killed when he fell on the roof of Hill Brow School in Gaudick Road, his parachute unopened. Part of the nose fell onto the Royal Eastbourne golf course, close to the end of Gaudick Road.  The rear gunner, Feldwebel Richard Schurk, came down in the sea off Holywell and was drowned.  The bulk of the aircraft crashed in the grounds of Aldro School in Darley Road — the wreckage was incorrectly identified in the local press as being that of a Heinkel He 111.  At the same time, a lorry was hit in Hampden Park by a bomb which had probably been jettisoned by one of the German bombers returning from the raid on RAF airfields.  Three Council workmen were killed – two instantly, the other dying the following day from burns.\n\nParagraph 14: There were at least five attempts to impersonate Cooke. The first of these appeared in a Pennsylvania town with a woman who claimed there that she had written everything ever published under Rose Terry's name, that the name was a pen name any way, the name of a little cousin of hers who died young, her uncle, the child's father, allowing her to use it.

The route crosses Newell Branch and heads past several businesses as it runs through the eastern edge of the town, coming to an intersection with DE 10. The road passes near homes and commercial establishments, heading east of a park and ride lot located at a church, before reaching a junction with the northern terminus of US 13 Alt. in the northern part of Camden east of Brecknock County Park. US 13 crosses Isaac Branch and heads into the community of Rodney Village, where it intersects the southern terminus of POW/MIA Parkway and another US 13 Alt. splits off to the northwest. Following this, the road passes to the west of the community of Kent Acres. US 13 enters the city of Dover at the Webbs Lane junction and comes to an at-grade intersection with the western terminus of the Puncheon Run Connector freeway, which heads east to provide access from northbound US 13 to the northbound direction of the DE 1 toll road and access from southbound DE 1 to US 13. Past this, the route runs northeast through business areas with some nearby homes, crossing Puncheon Run before reaching a junction with South State Street. The road curves north and passes over the St. Jones River, continuing past more commercial areas. US 13 intersects Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard, which heads west to the Dover Green Historic District and Delaware Legislative Hall, a short distance before four-lane divided Bay Road merges into the northbound direction of US 13 at a directional intersection. Past Bay Road, US 13 widens to six lanes and continues northwest, crossing DE 8. At this intersection, the name of the road changes to North Dupont Highway. The route curves north and then northwest again as it is lined with several businesses. The roadway passes southwest of a park and ride lot located at a church south of the Lakeview Drive/Townsend Boulevard junction. North of Silver Lake, US 13 intersects the northern terminus of US 13 Alt. along with Leipsic Road east of the Delaware Agricultural Museum and Village, which is home to a park and ride lot. The highway runs between Dover Motor Speedway and the Bally's Dover hotel, casino, and harness racetrack to the northeast and Delaware State University and the university's Alumni Stadium to the southwest. The route passes to the southwest of the Dover Mall and the Delaware State Police Headquarters and Museum as it continues past more businesses. US 13 heads southwest of the Dover Campus of Wilmington University prior to coming to an intersection with Scarborough Road, which leads northeast to an interchange with DE 1 and southwest to DE 15 in the western part of Dover.\n\nParagraph 17: Rodgers led them in the 2013–14 season to a surprise title challenge, however Liverpool ended the league season in second place, despite scoring 101 goals, the club's most since the 1895–96 season and the third-highest in Premier League history.

Because she is a woman, she has to constantly prove herself. The only person who seems to accept her is the priest, Sesehaten. Although she can still hear Egyptian as English, she eventually accepts that the Doctor will not be coming to rescue her. When Sedjet tries to take her on as his mistress, Ace realises that he will only ever see her as a curiosity. She leaves his house, abandoning the force field generator she used to travel through the rift. Unable to find work as a soldier, she is reduced to working as a waitress. She encounters Sesehaten again, who tells her that odd lights have been seen in the sky. Ace realises that the rift may be opening and rushes back to Sedjet's house. The building is empty and the ants are there looking for the force field generator. Sesehaten reveals that he is part of the cult of Set (also known as Sutekh), which has been outlawed since Pharaoh forced Egypt to accept a single religion and one god Aten. Sesehaten's cult will help Ace leave through the rift, if she helps them kidnap the Pharaoh. Ace agrees, as she sees Akhenaten as another in the long line of fascists she has fought. Ace breaks into Akhenaten's palace and takes him hostage, but Ace realises through talking to him that he is no better or worse than any other ruler. In the courtyard he reveals the TARDIS, which his army recovered when it fell from the sky, explaining how Ace could understand Egyptian. Using the instruments, Ace discovers that Sesehaten is not human, but a machine built by Ship to control the rift.\n\nParagraph 20: Nguyen was recognized by the Smithsonian Institution in 2007 as the first Vietnamese-American to anchor a national television news broadcast in the United States.

In fact, people should be wary of superficial ethical practices that \"are adopted primarily as a marketing device, without any effect on relationships inside and outside the business itself\" and without promoting justice and the common good, said Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone, the Vatican's secretary of state. Cardinal Bertone was one of a number of speakers invited to the Executive Summit on Ethics for the Business World, sponsored by the Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace and the Legionairies of Christ's Fidelis International Institute, which promotes ethics in business. The June 16–17 conference brought high-profile leaders from the manufacturing, industrial, banking and financial sectors including representatives from General Electric and Goldman Sachs, as well as Catholic experts in Catholic social teaching. \"Everyone here has been 'cherry-picked.' It wasn't an open invitation to everybody,\" said Father Luis Garza Medina, vicar general of the Legionairies of Christ, who helped in the planning of the event. Organizers purposely chose people from different industries, countries and religions in order to hammer out ethical principles held in common, which often reflect the views inherent in Catholic social thought, namely the principles of the centrality of the human person, subsidiarity, solidarity and the pursuit of the common good, he told Catholic News Service June 17. The real challenge, however, is taking those common principles and translating them into concrete action that will have a real impact on local and world economies, and on people's lives, he said. The meeting's goal was to show how \"Charity in Truth\", Pope Benedict XVI's 2009 encyclical on social justice issues, could inspire leaders to find practical applications of these universal values. In his talk June 16, Cardinal Bertone said the encyclical makes clear that there is no way businesses can remain ethically neutral: They are either serving the common good or they are not,\"\n\nParagraph 3: Clint Bowyer was the fastest in the first practice session with a time of 47.788 and a speed of . Kyle Busch was the fastest in the final practice session with a time of 49.056 and a speed of . Brian Vickers won the pole with a time of 48.825 and a speed of . “I thought that coming to three (laps) to go that we literally no shot,’’ said Vickers, who scored his first career Sprint Cup victory at this track in 2006. “We were way back. Like a half a straightaway behind the whole field and they all checked up and gave me a chance and gave me a run.’’ Justin Allgaier, Joe Nemechek and Ricky Stenhouse Jr. failed to qualify. “I thought being the last car in line would be beneficial for us,’’ Stenhouse said. “We had Jeff Gordon leading the pack there I thought we would have a good shot at putting a good lap in, but my spotter was telling me, ‘Hey, you have 30 seconds to get across the start-finish line’ as we were entering Turn 3. I don’t guess Eddie d'Hondt (No. 24 team spotter) was giving him a lot of information. He kept slowing the pack down, and we didn’t get a good lap and never got across the start-finish line in time. My spotter was giving me the information I needed, and I wish (Gordon’s spotter) would have been doing the same.” Jeff Gordon started 43rd for only the second time in his career. “The plan was shot before the plan started,’’ Gordon said. “I messed up ultimately. I just mistimed getting to the line. The whole group was going so slow, I knew I had to have a gap. When I came across the line, I thought I had enough to be able to complete that lap and get one more, which was the only way we were going to be to make it (to the second round), but we came up short. It’s a mess out there. It’s not easy.’’ Originally, Nemechek made it through the first round, but his time was disallowed after the oil tank encasement was found to be improperly installed. This allowed Reed Sorenson, who originally failed to qualify, to start the race. Brad Keselowski qualified fifth, but due to an alternator change (parc fermé rules are in effect at Talladega), started from the rear along with Matt Kenseth, who changed an engine. Terry Labonte, who made his final start, qualified ninth (although he had to go to the rear of the field due after NASCAR made the team change their paint scheme). It was his best qualifying performance since Sonoma 2005. \"You know, it's only about the third time I've said this is gonna be my last race, but this is really gonna be the last one,\" he said Saturday. \"It's been fun.\"\n\nParagraph 4: During seasons one and two, the opening sequence begins with images of Balki and Larry wiping sideways from opposite sides of the screen to meet in the middle, with the series title superimposed on top.  Larry is shown saying good-bye to his family as he leaves his home in Wisconsin, and drives to Chicago in his old red Ford Mustang.  The sequence then shifts to Balki, who is shown making his own farewells on Mypos before being driven off on the back of a horsecart, sitting alongside a box mislabeled \"America or Burst\".  Balki is next seen on the tramp steamer as he sights the Statue of Liberty, then on a bus, presumably making his way to Chicago.  After a brief shot of Larry driving under a \"Welcome to Chicago\" sign (in reality, located on eastbound Interstate 190 leading out of O'Hare International Airport), the sequence ends with the same shot of Balki and Larry together that began the sequence.

Bergman went down twice in the first round, but recovered in the second round, knocking Judah down. Judah knocked out Bergman in the fourth round to win the title. On June 20, 2000, Judah made his first title defense against Junior Witter in Glasgow, Scotland. It was an awkward fight for Judah, as Witter rarely engaged in an extended exchange of punches. Witter frequently switched between fighting right-handed and left-handed, making him an elusive opponent. Judah's consistent body punching slowed Witter down, and in the fifth round, Judah caught Witter with a straight left hand that hurt Witter and sent his mouthpiece skittering across the ring. Judah defeated Witter by unanimous decision.\n\nParagraph 15: The island was severely affected by the tsunami that was caused by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake, which led to many deaths and damaged infrastructure.

Brian Vickers won the pole with a time of 48.825 and a speed of . “I thought that coming to three (laps) to go that we literally no shot,’’ said Vickers, who scored his first career Sprint Cup victory at this track in 2006. “We were way back. Like a half a straightaway behind the whole field and they all checked up and gave me a chance and gave me a run.’’ Justin Allgaier, Joe Nemechek and Ricky Stenhouse Jr. failed to qualify. “I thought being the last car in line would be beneficial for us,’’ Stenhouse said. “We had Jeff Gordon leading the pack there I thought we would have a good shot at putting a good lap in, but my spotter was telling me, ‘Hey, you have 30 seconds to get across the start-finish line’ as we were entering Turn 3. I don’t guess Eddie d'Hondt (No. 24 team spotter) was giving him a lot of information. He kept slowing the pack down, and we didn’t get a good lap and never got across the start-finish line in time. My spotter was giving me the information I needed, and I wish (Gordon’s spotter) would have been doing the same.” Jeff Gordon started 43rd for only the second time in his career. “The plan was shot before the plan started,’’ Gordon said. “I messed up ultimately. I just mistimed getting to the line. The whole group was going so slow, I knew I had to have a gap. When I came across the line, I thought I had enough to be able to complete that lap and get one more, which was the only way we were going to be to make it (to the second round), but we came up short. It’s a mess out there. It’s not easy.’’ Originally, Nemechek made it through the first round, but his time was disallowed after the oil tank encasement was found to be improperly installed. This allowed Reed Sorenson, who originally failed to qualify, to start the race. Brad Keselowski qualified fifth, but due to an alternator change (parc fermé rules are in effect at Talladega), started from the rear along with Matt Kenseth, who changed an engine. Terry Labonte, who made his final start, qualified ninth (although he had to go to the rear of the field due after NASCAR made the team change their paint scheme). It was his best qualifying performance since Sonoma 2005. \"You know, it's only about the third time I've said this is gonna be my last race, but this is really gonna be the last one,\" he said Saturday. \"It's been fun.\"\n\nParagraph 21: Dunn played as an attacking midfielder and spent the majority of his playing career representing Blackburn Rovers. His first stint began as a youth player in 1997 and he signed professional terms a year later. During this time, Dunn helped the club to win promotion out of the First Division in 2000–01, as well as lift the League Cup the following season. He also made his only appearance for England in 2002. He was sold to Premier League rivals Birmingham City for £5.5 million a year later, before returning to Blackburn in 2007 for a fee of £2.2 million; continuing as a crucial squad member. He remained there until 2015, with them now a Championship club, when he signed for Oldham Athletic, his final club as a player before his retirement under a year later.\n\nParagraph 22: On February 12, 2000, he defeated Jan Piet Bergman to win the vacant IBF Light Welterweight title. Bergman went down twice in the first round, but recovered in the second round, knocking Judah down. Judah knocked out Bergman in the fourth round to win the title. On June 20, 2000, Judah made his first title defense against Junior Witter in Glasgow, Scotland. It was an awkward fight for Judah, as Witter rarely engaged in an extended exchange of punches. Witter frequently switched between fighting right-handed and left-handed, making him an elusive opponent. Judah's consistent body punching slowed Witter down, and in the fifth round, Judah caught Witter with a straight left hand that hurt Witter and sent his mouthpiece skittering across the ring. Judah defeated Witter by unanimous decision.\n\nParagraph 23: In 1957 Waterford reached the Munster final for the first time in almost a decade.  Cork provided the opposition on that occasion and were widely tipped to take the title.  Waterford, however, outplayed ‘the Rebels’ and took the title giving Morrissey his first Munster senior medal.  Waterford later defeated Galway in the All-Ireland semi-final, setting up a championship decider with Kilkenny.  With fifteen minutes left in the game Morrissey's side were leading ‘the Cats’ by six points, however, Kilkenny fought back to win the game by a point on a score line of 4–10 to 3–12.  In 1958 Waterford were classed as one-season wonders as they were trounced by Tipperary in the provincial championship.  Morrissey's side bounced back in 1959 by reaching the final of the National Hurling League.  Once again, Tipp had the upper hand and defeated Waterford.  In spite of this Waterford went on to defeat Cork in the provincial final, giving Morrissey a second Munster medal.  This victory allowed Waterford to advance to the All-Ireland final where Kilkenny provided the opposition once again.  The game is regarded as one of the all-time classics.  Waterford led by five points at the break; however, Kilkenny came back and led by a goal with time running out.  Just then Waterford's Séamus Power scored a goal for Waterford and the game ended in a draw.  The replay four weeks later began badly for Morrissey's side, however, Waterford came back into the game and outclassed Kilkenny.  The score line of 3–12 to 1-10 resulted in Morrissey collecting his first senior All-Ireland medal.  Waterford surrendered their provincial title the following year and went into declined.  In 1963 Morrissey's side defeated Munster rivals Tipperary and the exiles of New York to take the National league title.  The 'home final' of the league turned out to be the provincial final, with Waterford defeating Tipperary in a low-scoring game giving Morrissey his third Munster title.  The subsequent All-Ireland final saw Waterford square up to Kilkenny for the third time in seven years.  Once again, the game was regarded as a classic with 35 scores being recorded during the sixty minutes of play.  Waterford trailed at half-time; however, they fought back in the second-half.  The brilliance of Kilkenny's Ollie Walsh denied Waterford some more goals as Eddie Keher scored a record 0–14.  The final score of 4–17 to 6-8 gave Kilkenny the victory and brought an end to Waterford's greatest hurling era.\n\nParagraph 24: Armed assault version of the Mi-8AMT, can carry the same range of weapons as the Mi-24 including unguided weapons and high-precision armaments, in particular, antitank guided 9M120 Ataka or 9M114 Shturm missiles. Fitted with a new large door on the right side (except the prototype), aramid fiber plates around the cockpit area and engines, and sometimes a loading ramp in place of the usual clamshell doors. The helicopter can carry up to 37 paratroopers, 12 wounded on stretchers or airlift up to 4 tons of cargo, engage in search-and-rescue and evacuation operations. The craft has two VK-2500 engines of enhanced capacity and a complex of defense means. The cockpit of the new helicopter is equipped with multifunctional indicators to display the map of the terrain and the latest navigational and piloting equipment which operates with GPS and GLONASS satellite navigation systems. The Russian air force received a first batch of 10 Mi-8AMTSh in December 2010, and a second batch in June 2011. Deliveries were continued in 2012 and 2013. Russian Defense Ministry signed a contract for 40 helicopters in August 2013. First 8 upgraded helicopters were delivered in 2014. In total, 40 helicopters were delivered in 2014. Long-term government contract to supply modernized Mi-8AMTSh was signed in Ulan-Ude in August 2013 and provides for the delivery of unique machines – the first production batch with improved resource performance including significant savings on maintenance during the life cycle of the helicopter. Mi-8AMTSh passed to the Defense Ministry obtains a larger capacity engines VK-2500 with an upgraded (reinforced) transmission that provide objective control of exploratory work, and make the use of the helicopter in the highlands and hot climates more efficient. 13 helicopters were delivered in 2015. 8 helicopters were delivered in the first half of 2016. More than 20 Mi-8AMTs and Mi-8AMTShs were delivered to the Russian Interior Ministry in recent years. Mi-8AMTSh-VA arctic version is also supplied to the Russian Air Force and Naval Aviation. The first batch of Mi-8AMTSh for 2017 was delivered in late May. A new delivery in June 2017. 13 more in early 2018. A new large delivery in June 2018. The last delivery held in December 2018. A new delivery of a special modification held in early 2019. New deliveries in November 2019 and April 2020. 10 Mi-8AMTSH-VN Special Ops helicopters are on order since summer 2019 and the first helicopters reportedly entered service as of late 2021. 2 helicopters were delivered and 6 modernized with the Vitebsk onboard defense system in July 2020.\n\nParagraph 25: Dunn played as an attacking midfielder and spent the majority of his playing career representing Blackburn Rovers.

{"input": "", "context": "Paragraph 1: A protocol agreement called the \"Corubal River Agreement\" was signed on 21 October 1978 at Conakry by the Republic of Guinea and the Republic of Guinea Bissau to develop and manage the Kaliba-Koribal River; the Corubal River is also called the Kaliba. The \"Organisation pour la Mise en Valeur du Fleuve Gambie\" (OMVG) also known as \"The Gambia River Basin Development Organization\" was also agreed to be established to study and develop management plans for projects on the Gambia River, the Geba River and the Corubal River for power generation, irrigation, flood control, navigation, water quality and infrastrcutre. The agreement has also recognized the total basin area of the Corubal River of 24000 km2 with 17500 km2 (72.71%) in Guinea and the balance 27.02% in Guinea Bissau. OMVG have studied four sites for development as hydro-electric power projects. The projects are, the Sambangalou on the River Gambia, the Fello Sounga and Saltinho Projects on the River Koliba/Corubal, and the Gaoual Project on the River Géba. However, the general agreement does not have any relevant substantive and procedural rules governing cooperation between Guinea and Guinea-Bissau. Hence it has been suggested that recourse should be taken to \"The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Non-Navigational Uses of International Watercourses“ which  is a global instrument, adopted in 1997, to promote the equitable and sustainable development and management of river basins shared by two or more states. Using the provisions of this convention the existing agreement between the two basin states on development of Corubal River would need to be enlarged making specific provisions for \"informing and guiding cooperation, as well as by providing the technical committee with legal guidance for better implementing its activities.\"\n\nParagraph 2: Akin to modern tax avoidance, it was a legal loop-hole to avoid the suffering of the customary feudal incidents, namely the payment of feudal relief on an inheritance, the temporary loss of control of a fiefdom through wardship where the landholder was under the age of majority of 21, and the forcible marriage of a young heiress. Nor could the land-holding escheat, that is to say revert permanently to the overlord, as was customary where the land-holder died without a legal heir. When the fiefdom was held by a group of feoffees, the death of the beneficial holder was legally irrelevant to its continued holding by them. They simply allow the lands to continue to be used by the deceased's heir. The feoffees are \"an undying corporation which never suffered a minority and could not be given in marriage\" (McFarlane, p. 146). The feudal overlord, the king himself if the land was held in-chief, was not entitled to exact feudal relief from the new beneficiary nor was he entitled to seize control of the lands and their revenues until such heir was of full-age, nor was he entitled to sell the heiress in marriage or to marry her to one of his own sons. This had a considerably deleterious effect on the royal finances, which state of affairs was rectified by the aggressive and imaginative new fiscal measures taken by King Henry VII after his accession in 1485.\n\nParagraph 3: A protocol agreement called the \"Corubal River Agreement\" was signed on 21 October 1978 at Conakry by the Republic of Guinea and the Republic of Guinea Bissau to develop and manage the Kaliba-Koribal River; the Corubal River is also called the Kaliba.

Cuny had previously worked with FC Nancy, but left the club prior to its destruction. Cuny is considered one of the leaders of French football mainly because of his innovative ideas and strategies. After forming Nancy, he created the first youth academy of French football. Prior to the club beginning its life as a football club, Cuny devised a strategy to immerse the club into the city's public. First, he sent out over 18,000 letters and petitions to draw interest to the team. Once the public gained notice, Cuny organised friendly matches to raise funds for the club. After accruing enough money, Cuny sought to turn the club professional, and, despite several setbacks, on 16 June 1967, Nancy were granted professional status and inserted into Division 2, the second level of French football.

The feoffees are \"an undying corporation which never suffered a minority and could not be given in marriage\" (McFarlane, p. 146). The feudal overlord, the king himself if the land was held in-chief, was not entitled to exact feudal relief from the new beneficiary nor was he entitled to seize control of the lands and their revenues until such heir was of full-age, nor was he entitled to sell the heiress in marriage or to marry her to one of his own sons. This had a considerably deleterious effect on the royal finances, which state of affairs was rectified by the aggressive and imaginative new fiscal measures taken by King Henry VII after his accession in 1485.\n\nParagraph 18: The idea of a new professional club in the city was thought of by Claude Cuny in spring 1964 based on amateur Association sportive Lorraine, formerly known as Union sportive Frontière. Cuny had previously worked with FC Nancy, but left the club prior to its destruction. Cuny is considered one of the leaders of French football mainly because of his innovative ideas and strategies. After forming Nancy, he created the first youth academy of French football. Prior to the club beginning its life as a football club, Cuny devised a strategy to immerse the club into the city's public. First, he sent out over 18,000 letters and petitions to draw interest to the team. Once the public gained notice, Cuny organised friendly matches to raise funds for the club. After accruing enough money, Cuny sought to turn the club professional, and, despite several setbacks, on 16 June 1967, Nancy were granted professional status and inserted into Division 2, the second level of French football. The club's first manager was René Pleimelding, a former French international who played for FC Nancy. Nancy, subsequently, recruited several former FC Nancy players such as Antoine Redin, as well as players from the region such as Michel Lanini, Gérard Braun and Roger Formica.\n\nParagraph 19: A protocol agreement called the \"Corubal River Agreement\" was signed on 21 October 1978 at Conakry by the Republic of Guinea and the Republic of Guinea Bissau to develop and manage the Kaliba-Koribal River; the Corubal River is also called the Kaliba. The \"Organisation pour la Mise en Valeur du Fleuve Gambie\" (OMVG) also known as \"The Gambia River Basin Development Organization\" was also agreed to be established to study and develop management plans for projects on the Gambia River, the Geba River and the Corubal River for power generation, irrigation, flood control, navigation, water quality and infrastrcutre. The agreement has also recognized the total basin area of the Corubal River of 24000 km2 with 17500 km2 (72.71%) in Guinea and the balance 27.02% in Guinea Bissau. OMVG have studied four sites for development as hydro-electric power projects. The projects are, the Sambangalou on the River Gambia, the Fello Sounga and Saltinho Projects on the River Koliba/Corubal, and the Gaoual Project on the River Géba. However, the general agreement does not have any relevant substantive and procedural rules governing cooperation between Guinea and Guinea-Bissau. Hence it has been suggested that recourse should be taken to \"The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Non-Navigational Uses of International Watercourses“ which  is a global instrument, adopted in 1997, to promote the equitable and sustainable development and management of river basins shared by two or more states. Using the provisions of this convention the existing agreement between the two basin states on development of Corubal River would need to be enlarged making specific provisions for \"informing and guiding cooperation, as well as by providing the technical committee with legal guidance for better implementing its activities.\"\n\nParagraph 20: A protocol agreement called the \"Corubal River Agreement\" was signed on 21 October 1978 at Conakry by the Republic of Guinea and the Republic of Guinea Bissau to develop and manage the Kaliba-Koribal River; the Corubal River is also called the Kaliba.

{"input": "", "context": "Paragraph 1: According to fellow composer and friend Laura Karpman, Walker was among the few female composers who managed to make her mark in the highly competitive world of Hollywood scoring: “She’s one of a tiny little group, and was the first one to poke through,” Karpman said. “She’s been an incredible mentor to a lot of men and women in Hollywood. She was an important role model.”  Not only did Walker compose, she also conducted, orchestrated, arranged, and oftentimes did all three. Walker had an incredible impact not only on the films and television shows she worked on, but also on the musicians she worked with. When Warner Bros. hired her in 1990 to supervise the music for Batman: The Animated Series, Walker decided to see if she “could find the next generation of orchestral film composers and give them a chance to do this work,” Walker told Daily Variety in 2002. According to a statement by one of more than 30 composers Walker brought in to work on the Batman series, Walker’s “determination to open doors of opportunity for aspiring composers is unrivaled in our industry.” Walker not only supported up-and-coming composers in the industry, she also watched over the orchestra and ensured the musicians would not burn out. In the DVD commentary for Final Destination, Walker recounts a time when there was a problem with music being recorded for a Disney picture she was conducting. The composer and producers were sitting in the control booth, playing back the recordings and bickering, leaving the musicians idle for forty-five minutes. Rather than have them be paid to do nothing, the producers suggested to Shirley that they rehearse music not yet recorded. Shirley agreed but quietly told the orchestra how she felt this was ridiculous, that she didn’t want them wearing out, and she had a different plan. In this particular studio, Shirley was on an elevated platform to where the orchestra was essentially hidden below and only Shirley could be seen from the booth. She utilized this, and knowing that the orchestra couldn’t actually be heard unless recording was in progress, she mimed conducting, waving her arms, pointing to the score, and completely putting on an act for the producers, but all the while telling jokes and keeping things light with the musicians.\n\nParagraph 2: Rulers of the Muhammad Ali Dynasty governed Egypt and Sudan as absolute monarchs until constitutional rule was established in August 1878. Following the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire, the Egyptian and Sudanese monarchy emerged as the most important in the Middle East and the wider Arab world. Finding themselves as mere figureheads during the period of British control, Egypt and Sudan's monarchs saw their powers increased following the recognition of independence, and the subsequent adoption of the 1923 Constitution, the most liberal in the country's history. Although King Fuad I often ruled as an autocrat, partly because he repeatedly overrode some provisions of the Constitution, Egypt and Sudan had the freest parliament in the region. During Fuad's reign and that of his son, Farouk, the country witnessed six free parliamentary elections and enjoyed a free press as well as an independent judiciary. According to historian Philip Mansel, \"the Egyptian monarchy appeared so splendid, powerful and popular that King Farouk's ignominious end seems inexplicable.\" The Muhammad Ali Dynasty's downfall is often regarded as having begun with the Abdeen Palace Incident of 1942, which greatly discredited the King. It accelerated with the growing discontent of Egypt's armed forces following the country's defeat in the First Arab-Israeli War. Disgruntled members of the military formed the Free Officers Movement, which led a coup d'état on 23 July 1952, thereby marking the beginning of the Egyptian Revolution of 1952. The toppling of the monarchy, and the resultant establishment of a revolutionary republican government, was the first of its kind in the modern Arab world, and was a crucial event in the region's history; it accelerated dramatically the rise of Pan-Arabism, and had a domino effect leading to similar military overthrows of the monarchies of Iraq (1958), North Yemen (1962), and Libya (1969). Egypt has had a republican form of government since the end of monarchical rule. Although the establishment of genuine democratic rule was one of the six core principles of the Revolution, political parties were banned in 1953 and the country was turned into a military dictatorship. The thriving pluralism that characterized political life during the latter period of the Muhammad Ali Dynasty's rule was thus brought to an end. Even though a multi-party system was officially restored in Egypt in 1976, the country has never recovered the level of political freedom it had enjoyed during the monarchy. In common with most deposed royal families, the Muhammad Ali Dynasty was initially vilified by the new revolutionary regime. Nonetheless, it has undergone re-evaluation in recent years; nostalgia for the former monarchy has been growing among some in Egypt, largely fuelled by the airing in 2007 of a hugely successful serial about the life of King Farouk I.\n\nParagraph 3: The first attempts for creation of the Macedonian ethnicityLoring Danforth, The Macedonian Conflict: Ethnic Nationalism in a Transnational World, Princeton University Press, December 1995, p. 63: \"Finally, Krste Misirkov, who had clearly developed a strong sense of his own personal national identity as a Macedonian and who outspokenly and unambiguously called for Macedonian linguistic and national separatism, acknowledged that a 'Macedonian' national identity was a relatively recent historical development.\"Throughout this article, the term \"Macedonian\" will refer to ethnic Macedonians. There are many other uses of the term, and comprehensive coverage of this topic may be found in the article Macedonia (terminology). can be said to have begun in the late 19th and early 20th century.Social cleavages and national \"awakening\" in Ottoman Macedonia by Basil C. Gounaris, East European Quarterly 29 (1995), 409–426  This was the time of the first expressions of Macedonism by limited groups of intellectuals in Belgrade, Sofia, Thessaloniki and St. Petersburg. However, up until the 20th century and beyond, the majority of the Slavic-speaking population of the region was identified as Macedono-Bulgarian or simply as Bulgarian and after 1870 joined the Bulgarian Exarchate. Although he was appointed Bulgarian metropolitan bishop, in 1891 Theodosius of Skopje attempted to restore the Archbishopric of Ohrid as an autonomous Macedonian church, but his idea failed.Although he was named Bulgarian metropolitan bishop in Skopje, in 1890–1892 Gologanov tried to establish a separate Macedonian Church, an activity that resulted in his dismissal and temporary marginalization. Thus after his short period as an early Macedonian national ideologist, Gologanov again became a Bulgarian bishop, as well as a writer and a member of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences. He contributed significantly to the construction of the image of Macedonia as cradle of the Bulgarian National Revival. For more see: Roumen Daskalov, Alexander Vezenkov as ed., Entangled Histories of the Balkans - Volume Three: Shared Pasts, Disputed Legacies, BRILL, 2015, , p. 451. Some authors consider that at that time, labels reflecting collective identity, such as \"Bulgarian\", changed into national labels from being broad terms that were without political significance. According to Nick Antonovski, presenting a pro-Macedonian view, the 19th century foreign observers considered Macedonian Slavs to be Bulgarians - a view influenced by the Ottoman millet system, even though the term Bulgarian was a broad label that had no political significance, meaning nothing more than peasant. Per John Van Antwerp Fine Jr. until the late 19th century those Macedonian Slavs who had developed an ethnic identity believed they were Bulgarians.\n\nParagraph 4: Rulers of the Muhammad Ali Dynasty governed Egypt and Sudan as absolute monarchs until constitutional rule was established in August 1878.

He returned from the injury on December 21. His first big match since his return took place on February 2, 2015, when he unsuccessfully challenged Shuji Ishikawa for the BJW World Strong Heavyweight Championship. On February 15, Okabayashi and Sekimoto won another tag team title, when they defeated Konosuke Takeshita and Tetsuya Endo to win the DDT Pro-Wrestling promotion's KO-D Tag Team Championship. On July 20, Okabayashi scored his first-ever win over Sekimoto, when he defeated him to become the new BJW World Strong Heavyweight Champion, winning the first singles title of his professional wrestling career. On August 23, Okabayashi and Sasaki lost the KO-D Tag Team Championship to Daisuke Sasaki and Kota Ibushi. On October 29, Okabayashi and Sekimoto defeated Kohei Sato and Shuji Ishikawa in the finals to win the 2015 Saikyo Tag League and the BJW Tag Team Championship. They lost the title to Hideyoshi Kamitani and Ryota Hama on December 30.

On January 2, 2017, Okabayashi and Sekimoto defeated Kohei Sato and Shuji Ishikawa to win the BJW Tag Team Championship for the third time. They lost the title to Abdullah Kobayashi and Ryuji Ito in their fifth defense on July 17. On August 27, Okabayashi and Sekimoto defeated Kai and Naoya Nomura to win the vacant AJPW World Tag Team Championship for the second time. They relinquished the title on October 16 after Okabayashi suffered a shoulder injury. It was later announced that Okabayashi would be undergoing surgery the following December, which would sideline him for up to a year.\n\nParagraph 6: In 1829, aged 80, he wrote a \"Cantata Sacra\", based on Isaiah Chapter 12 for the Birmingham Music Festival. This was the occasion for the memorably inauspicious début of his protégé and representative Michael Costa, aged 19. The intention was that Costa should rehearse and conduct the work; but J. B Cramer and Thomas Greatorex elbowed him out and was instead engaged as a tenor soloist in another concert. Unfortunately both the work and Costa's singing met with ferocious criticism: \"[This cantata] is one of the most tame, insipid things we were ever doomed to hear: a heap of common-place trash from the first to the last note. After twaddling in B flat for half-an-hour, he ventures for a few bars into F, then returns to B, and there is an end.\" \"As a singer [Costa] is far below mediocrity, and he does not compensate for his vocal deficiencies by his personal address, which is abundantly awkward. In the theatre while singing the air \"Nel furor delle tempeste,\" [from Bellini's Il pirata] and accompanying himself, he had a narrow escape. The tempests proved contagious, and were beginning to manifest themselves in the galleries, and had he remained but a few moments longer on the stage, he would have witnessed a storm compared to which the roarings of his own Vesuvius would have seemed but a murmur.\"\n\nParagraph 7: In 1829, aged 80, he wrote a \"Cantata Sacra\", based on Isaiah Chapter 12 for the Birmingham Music Festival.

He graduated from George Washington High School in Manhattan, and went on to study at Upsala College in East Orange, New Jersey. After graduation he went to work for Vanderbilt Music, a small music publishing company owned by former Tin Pan Alley lyricist Al Lewis. Kirshner brought Lewis together with Sylvester Bradford, an African-American songwriter. Lewis and Bradford wrote \"Tears on My Pillow\", which was a big hit for Little Anthony and the Imperials in 1958.\n\nParagraph 9: In 1829, aged 80, he wrote a \"Cantata Sacra\", based on Isaiah Chapter 12 for the Birmingham Music Festival.

In 1953’s movie How to Marry a Millionaire, Lauren Bacall, Betty Grable, and Marilyn Monroe consider “the mink department at Bergdorf’s” the ideal location to meet men. Cary Grant sent Doris Day on a shopping spree at the store in the 1962 movie That Touch of Mink. The store has also made several appearances in the cartoon Neo Yokio. The protagonist, Kaz Kaan, and his rival, Arcangelo, both buy their suits from Bergdorf's. Most recently, Bergdorf Goodman was featured in a scene of the film Ocean's 8 in which Sandra Bullock's character steals cosmetics from the store. In 2019, news journalist E. Jean Carroll alleged that Donald Trump had sexually assaulted her in a Bergdorf Goodman dressing room in the 1990s. The store was prominently featured in the film Arthur in 1981. The store was featured in the Miss Piggy/ Joan Rivers scene of The Muppets Take Manhattan. The store was also featured in Sex and the City as a favorite shopping location of central character Carrie Bradshaw.  It was particularly featured in the Sex and the City 2 movie. In the television show Parks and Recreation, the character April Ludgate pretends on multiple occasions to be an exaggerated socialite named \"Janet Snakehole,\" whose husband keeps her in \"the finest Bergdorf Goodman\" clothing. The first time April plays this character within a character, she is mock arrested by another character-in-character, Andy Dwyer pretending to be FBI agent Burt Macklin. Macklin attempts to arrest Snakehole, causing Snakehole to shriek that she never stole the (assumedly Bergdorf Goodman) jewels, her sister did, \"but now she's been eaten by wolves!\"\n\nParagraph 11: The Gentoo Code (also known as A Code of Gentoo Laws or Ordinations of the Pundits) is an 'Anglo-Brahminical' legal code which was created under Warren Hastings, the Governor General of India, at a time when the Colonizers realized it was important to know India to rule India. The purpose was to create a distorted version of cultural and historical scriptures of Hindus and Muslims to govern the people of India. It was translated from Sanskrit (in which it was known as ) into Persian by Brahmin scholars; and then from Persian into English by Nathaniel Brassey Halhed, a British grammarian working for the East India Company. Vivādārṇavasetu is a digest of Hindu law in 21 sections (taraṅga) compiled for Warren Hastings by the pandits. The translation was funded and encouraged by Warren Hastings as a method of consolidating company control on the Indian subcontinent. It was translated into English with a view to know about the culture and local laws of various parts of Indian subcontinent. It was printed privately by the East India Company in London in 1776 under the title A Code of Gentoo Laws, or, Ordinations of the Pundits. Copies were not put on sale, but the Company did distribute them. In 1777 a pirate (and less luxurious) edition was printed; and in 1781 a second edition appeared. Translations into French and German were published in 1778. It is basically about the Hindu law of inheritance (Manusmriti). The Pandits and the Maulvis were associated with judges to understand the civil law of Hindus and Muslims.\n\nParagraph 12: Okabayashi missed most of 2014 with a left shoulder injury, which he suffered while wrestling in Germany in January.

They crossed the Missouri River at the small Mormon settlement of Kanesville (today Council Bluffs, Iowa). Meeker recounted that, as he stood on the far side of the Missouri, he felt as if he had left the United States. As they journeyed westward along the Platte River in Nebraska Territory, there were such large numbers traveling that they were never out of sight of the tens of thousands of other pioneers journeying west that year. Sometimes several wagons advanced side by side. The Meekers chose a slow, steady pace, unlike many who sought to rush along as quickly as possible. Piles of abandoned possessions lined the way, cast aside to lighten loads. As the party went further west, they passed some of those who had hurried past them, and whose wagons had broken down or whose oxen had died as a result of failure to care for them properly. Disease was an ever-present risk; at the present site of Kearney, Nebraska, Oliver Meeker was stricken with illness. This led to a division of the group when most of Oliver's friends, including later Idaho Territory governor David W. Ballard, refused to wait. Oliver recovered after four days, and was one of the lucky ones—his brother later estimated that one in ten of those who took the Trail perished during the journey. Ezra Meeker remembered meeting one wagon train, slowly moving east against the flow of traffic. That group had made it as far as Fort Laramie (today in Wyoming) before losing the last of its menfolk, and the women and children turned back, hoping to regain their homes in the East. He never learned if they made it. According to local historians Bert and Margie Webber, \"all of these deaths made a great impression on the young man\".\n\nParagraph 15: The first commercial recording by the original lineup of the Graham Bond Organisation was released under the name of singer Winston G. (real name Winston Gork). A protégé of expatriate Australian impresario Robert Stigwood, Winston had launched his career under the pseudonym \"Johnny Apollo\". In early 1965 both Winston and the Graham Bond Organisation were part of Stigwood-promoted UK package tour headlined by Chuck Berry (on which Stigwood incurred heavy losses). Since they shared management, the Graham Bond Organisation backed Winston on the Parlophone single \"Please Don't Say\" / \"Like A Baby\"; the A-side was credited \"Arrangement directed by Graham Bond\" and the B-side \"Arrangement directed by Ginger Baker\". The band signed for Decca Records who released their dynamic version of the Don Covay composition \"Long Tall Shorty\" in 1964, backed with \"Long Legged Girl\" (\"Long Tall Shorty\" had been popularised by US singer/organist Tommy Tucker). Their best-known single, and the second released under their own name, was \"Tammy\" (Jay Livingston/Ray Evans) / \"Wade in the Water\" (trad. arr. group), recorded on 4 January 1965 at Olympic Sound Studios, London (EMI Columbia DB 7471, 29 January 1965). The track also appeared on their debut album The Sound of 65 (EMI Columbia, March 1965).\n\nParagraph 16: The first commercial recording by the original lineup of the Graham Bond Organisation was released under the name of singer Winston G.

Allmusic stated \"Bassist Mario Pavone just keeps on keeping on with yet another fine recording in his expanding and substantive discography ... While Pavone's recordings are generally reliable and pointedly original, this effort is close to his very best, and deserves consideration for best jazz CD of 2008\". On All About Jazz Marc Corroto said \"It might be cliche to say that the recording Ancestors by Mario Pavone's Double Tenor Quintet has caught lightning in a bottle, but this is indeed a potent feat of extraordinary music making ... Pavone's energy and pace may be challenging, but trying to keep up is a thing of beauty\". On the same site Troy Collins called it \"one of Pavone's most uncompromising and passionate recordings. For those inclined towards more adventurous fare, this is essential listening\" and Nic Jones observed The very idea of a two-tenor front line is potentially fraught with complication but Pavone has been scrupulous with regards to who occupies the roles. There's enough contrast in the respective approaches of Jimmy Greene and Tony Malaby to ensure that the feeling of sameness doesn't set in. Malaby's work is the more fractious of the two whilst Greene, working a freer seam than the one he might be more readily associated with, brings to his work a kind of agitated grace which is symptomatic of a multi-faceted musician who's really coming into his own\"  For JazzTimes, Chris Kelsey wrote \"Mario Pavone is a splendid composer and bandleader, as well. His group plays a highly evolved postbop, his compositions (arranged by Steven Bernstein, Dave Ballou and Michael Musillami) combining odd-time vamps, intricate melodies and knotty chord progressions with an open-ended modality that provides the soloists maximum freedom ... The band does a terrific job of interpreting Pavone’s highly complex tunes. This is sophisticated, exciting musi\". PopMatters critic Michael Kabran, however, was less enthused stating \"Pavone’s second career as a bandleader and composer has by-and-large resulted in music that is intellectually stimulating and technically challenging but ultimately devoid of feeling. Pavone’s latest effort, Ancestors, is no exception ... This is jazz and so there is certainly spontaneity: the drums crackle; the horns squawk and blare; and the bass pulses. But it all sounds exactly like you’d expect it to sound, the aural equivalent of a textbook on modern jazz techniques. The rest of Ancestors can be similarly characterized. As an intellectual exercise, the album is first rate. As a work of great emotional depth, it leaves something to be desired\".\n\nParagraph 18: The store has been the subject of two documentary films: the 2001 film Dita and the Family Business, exploring the store from the point of view of its owners, and the 2013 feature documentary Scatter My Ashes at Bergdorf's, which features many testimonials from designers and celebrities. In 1953’s movie How to Marry a Millionaire, Lauren Bacall, Betty Grable, and Marilyn Monroe consider “the mink department at Bergdorf’s” the ideal location to meet men. Cary Grant sent Doris Day on a shopping spree at the store in the 1962 movie That Touch of Mink. The store has also made several appearances in the cartoon Neo Yokio. The protagonist, Kaz Kaan, and his rival, Arcangelo, both buy their suits from Bergdorf's. Most recently, Bergdorf Goodman was featured in a scene of the film Ocean's 8 in which Sandra Bullock's character steals cosmetics from the store. In 2019, news journalist E. Jean Carroll alleged that Donald Trump had sexually assaulted her in a Bergdorf Goodman dressing room in the 1990s. The store was prominently featured in the film Arthur in 1981. The store was featured in the Miss Piggy/ Joan Rivers scene of The Muppets Take Manhattan. The store was also featured in Sex and the City as a favorite shopping location of central character Carrie Bradshaw.  It was particularly featured in the Sex and the City 2 movie. In the television show Parks and Recreation, the character April Ludgate pretends on multiple occasions to be an exaggerated socialite named \"Janet Snakehole,\" whose husband keeps her in \"the finest Bergdorf Goodman\" clothing. The first time April plays this character within a character, she is mock arrested by another character-in-character, Andy Dwyer pretending to be FBI agent Burt Macklin. Macklin attempts to arrest Snakehole, causing Snakehole to shriek that she never stole the (assumedly Bergdorf Goodman) jewels, her sister did, \"but now she's been eaten by wolves!\"\n\nParagraph 19: Don Kirshner was born to a Jewish family in the Bronx, New York, United States, the son of Gilbert Kirshner, a tailor, and Belle Jaffe. He graduated from George Washington High School in Manhattan, and went on to study at Upsala College in East Orange, New Jersey. After graduation he went to work for Vanderbilt Music, a small music publishing company owned by former Tin Pan Alley lyricist Al Lewis.

{"input": "", "context": "Paragraph 1: On the July 3 SmackDown, Ziggler defeated Alex Riley to qualify for a spot in the World Heavyweight Championship Money in the Bank ladder match. On July 13, Ziggler, Zack Ryder and Justin Roberts were involved in a car accident in San Diego while driving from Comic-Con; none of them suffered severe injuries. Two days later at the Money in the Bank pay-per-view, Ziggler won the Money in the Bank ladder match to guarantee him the opportunity to challenge for the World Heavyweight Championship at a time of his choosing within the next year. Later that night, Ziggler attempted to cash in the briefcase on Sheamus after Alberto Del Rio attacked him after their match, but Del Rio stopped Ziggler from cashing in. On the following episode of SmackDown, Ziggler again attempted to cash in the briefcase on Sheamus following a tag team match with Del Rio, but was laid out by Rey Mysterio and Sheamus before he could do so. During this time, Ziggler began a feud with Chris Jericho after claiming he had lost his touch, which resulted in Jericho attacking him on two occasions, and defeating him in a singles match at SummerSlam on August 19. The night after SummerSlam, Ziggler defeated Jericho in a rematch; as a result Ziggler retained his Money in the Bank contract and Jericho's WWE contract was terminated. Following this, Ziggler began feuding with Randy Orton on SmackDown four days later, after Orton hit him with an RKO when Ziggler tried to cash his Money in the Bank contract on a vulnerable Sheamus. The following week on SmackDown, Ziggler faced Orton in a match that was won by Orton, Ziggler defeated him in a rematch on Raw by pinning him while holding his tights. Ziggler faced Orton again at Night of Champions on September 16 where he lost again, ending the feud. On November 18 at Survivor Series, Ziggler captained the traditional 5-on-5 elimination tag team match opposite Mick Foley and won the match by last pinning Orton, making him the sole survivor of the match.\n\nParagraph 2: During the Republican era, the votum was a regular part of ceremonies conducted at the Capitoline by a general holding imperium before deploying. The triumph with its dedication of spoils and animal sacrifices at the Capitol was in part a fulfillment of such a vow. A general who faced an uncertain outcome in battle might make a votum in the field promising to build a temple out of gratitude for divine aid in a victory. In 311 BC, Junius Bubulcus became the first plebeian general to vow and oversee the building of a temple; he honored the goddess Salus, \"Salvation\". A vow would also be made in connection with the ritual of evocatio, negotiations with the enemy's tutelary deity to offer superior cult. An extreme form of votum was the devotio, the ritual by which a general sacrificed himself in battle and asked the chthonic deities to take the enemy as offerings along with him.\n\nParagraph 3: The story of how the tail section survivors cope during their first forty-eight days on the Island is shown in \"The Other 48 Days\". After landing in the ocean, Ana Lucia does her best to help everyone in need. That night, some of the survivors are kidnapped by the Others, the mysterious inhabitants of the Island, then a few nights later, nine more are taken. During the second raid, Ana Lucia kills one of the Others and finds a list on him, which has descriptions of the victims. Suspecting fellow survivor Nathan (Josh Randall) as a traitor, she moves everyone inland, digs a pit and throws him in it until he confesses. 4 nights later, Goodwin (Brett Cullen) tricks Nathan and kills him. The small group heads further inland, discovering a bunker known as the Arrow. Ana Lucia and Goodwin trek atop a hill, where she tells Goodwin she has worked out he is the real traitor. After a struggle, she impales him on a broken stick, then returns to the group and tells them they are safe. Fellow tail section survivors Libby (Cynthia Watros) and Cindy (Kimberley Joseph) bring Jin (Daniel Dae Kim) to her after discovering him washed up on shore. He breaks free, so Ana Lucia follows and finds Michael (Harold Perrineau) and Sawyer (Josh Holloway). Jin, Michael and Sawyer are thrown into the pit, and Ana Lucia follows, pretending to have also been captured. Once she believes they are fellow 815 survivors she releases them, and they travel to the camp of the other survivors. When they near the camp, Ana Lucia mistakes Shannon (Maggie Grace) for an Other and fatally shoots her. The on-island events of \"Collision\" show her guilt after Shannon's death. She has Shannon's lover Sayid (Naveen Andrews) tied up and refuses to let the group move on. After some reasoning from Libby, she reluctantly lets them go. She is invited into a bunker the fuselage survivors found to interrogate a man claiming to be Henry Gale (Michael Emerson), and manages to receive a map to his crashed balloon. She takes Sayid and Charlie (Dominic Monaghan) with her, and eventually discovers the crash site, and the body of the real Henry Gale. In her second centric episode, \"Two for the Road\", Ana Lucia attempts to speak to Henry again, but she is assaulted by him and nearly killed. Seeking revenge, she seduces Sawyer and steals his gun. She returns to the hatch and attempts to kill Henry, but is unable to bring herself to do it. She confides in Michael, who offers to kill him on her behalf.\n\nParagraph 4: The quiet life of Oxford professor James Westgate (Bob Peck) is shattered when he is introduced to Penny (Miranda Richardson), the wife of his crass new colleague (Barry Foster). Westgate recognises her as his childhood sweetheart \"Patch\", and the two resume their friendship.  Westgate is bored with his mundane college life, including his German friend Boris who experiments on animals in the lab, and his lady friend Amanda, as well as the attentions of a shy male student who claims to be in love with him.  He is only too happy to be diverted into joining Penny in her search for missing archaeologist Pilkington (a fellow Oxford colleague). As Westgate's obsession with his childhood friend grows, he is drawn into a tangle of misunderstanding, intrigue, and murder.  Bob Peck imbues his character with comic ineptitude.\n\nParagraph 5: On 24 October 1944 while Princeton steamed with Task Group 38.3 (part of Task Force 38) in Leyte Gulf off the east coast of Luzon, Philippines, a Japanese plane, tentatively identified as a Yokosuka D4Y1 Type 2 [Judy], attacked the ship. Its bomb penetrated the flight, hangar, and main decks and exploded, igniting an inferno that swept across the hangar deck. Explosions rocked the carrier, but Bradley, the ship's assistant first lieutenant, led a repair party and battled the blaze on the second and third decks. The intense heat compelled Bradley and his men to abandon their efforts, and after verifying that no wounded men remained behind, he entered the water at 10:05, rescued soon thereafter by . Their success in fighting the fire led many of the men to believe that if they could clear the smoke from Princeton's largely undamaged machinery spaces, they could raise steam and save the ship. At 13:00 Bradley returned to Princeton from Morrison — which lay alongside Princeton's starboard quarter to play her hoses onto the flames and became temporarily wedged between two of the carrier's overhanging stacks.  A submarine and air alert sounded 30 minutes later and  and Morrison, the two closest ships, pulled away from Princeton to take their antisubmarine stations. The determined firefighting efforts had nearly controlled the fire, but it raged again during the ensuing lull. Following the alert, Birmingham and Morrison closed and attempted to secure a line to Princeton. At 15:15 the cruiser succeeded on its third try, but at 15:23 the flames touched off four hundred 100-pound bombs stowed aft in the torpedo magazine. The resulting explosion blew off the upper part of the carrier's stern, killing Bradley and every man in the vicinity.\n\nParagraph 6: The quiet life of Oxford professor James Westgate (Bob Peck) is shattered when he is introduced to Penny (Miranda Richardson), the wife of his crass new colleague (Barry Foster).

The Greek international was handed the number 16 shirt. Kyrgiakos scored his first goal for the club against Stoke City on 16 January 2010 in the 57th minute and also completed the full 90 minutes in a 1–1 draw alongside Martin Škrtel at the Britannia Stadium, later being named man of the match by various British sport sites for his performance in that match. On 17 January 2010, former Liverpool striker and football pundit/journalist Stan Collymore wrote an article acknowledging Kyrgiakos' ability, stating that \"Kyrgiakos may be keeping Rafa (Benítez) in a job...\". Collymore argued that \"Sotirios Kyrgiakos could become an unlikely poster boy for the 'new Liverpool.'\" He stated, \"The big pony-tailed Greek put in a sterling performance at The Britannia and may typify the less football, more grit of the new Reds... And it is no-nonsense men such as Kyrgiakos who like to roll up their sleeves which can keep Rafa in a job right now.\" Liverpool's very next game was a crunch-match against Tottenham Hotspur, who were perceived as one of the clubs rivalling Liverpool for fourth in the Premier League table. Liverpool won 2–0 and Kyrgiakos put in another solid performance, one described by Sky Sports as \"magnificent.\"\n\nParagraph 8: A study of was done comparing the performance of athletics competitors at the 1984 Summer Paralympics.  It found there was little significant difference in performance in distance between women in 1A (SP1, SP2) and 1B (SP3) in the club throw. It found there was little significant difference in performance in distance between men in 1A (SP1, SP2) and 1B (SP3) in the club throw.

In May 2015 the joint review of the panels found that the banks had failed to fully comply with the standards to which they had committed themselves. While the banks took significant steps to understand the situation as part of their due diligence process, they accepted an indigenous peoples report that was insufficient for the purpose to approve the credit in January 2011, requiring further investigations as a condition for disbursement, while their own standards would have required a fully satisfactory report at the time of approval. The two banks accepted the conclusions and committed themselves to \"further raise the bar on the required level of information on stakeholder consultation available to (them) at the time of credit approval.\" In the meantime, the government of Panama - since June 2014 led by a new President, Juan Carlos Varela - suspended the construction of the dam in February 2015 on the grounds that the environmental and social impact assessment was faulty pending the outcome of a court case that challenges the assessment. In June 2015 new protests erupted, with protesters shutting down the Interamerican Highway for two days, as a result of which the President sent a riot squad to the area. On August 10, 2015, President Varela and the Cacica General of the indigenous Comarca, Silvia Carrera, signed an agreement to the effect that the civil works of the dam would be completed, but that the electromechanical works would remain suspended and the dam would not be flooded until a final agreement had been reached. GENISA complained that it had been left out of the agreement and that the agreement violated the agreements concluded by the state with the company. In September 2015 the environmental agency ANAM imposed a 775,200 USD fine on GEMISA for having failed to comply with the resettlement and compensation measures under the project. On January 21, 2016 the indigenous movement 10th of April claimed that the agreement had been violated, because tests to fill the reservoir had been made. On January 28, 2016, a technical report was presented to the indigenous communities, showing that the dam was technically safe. Furthermore, a sub-commission consisting of the government and traditional authorities was created to further study the impacts of the project in view of a \"final decision\". Filling of the reservoir began on May 24th, leading to further protests and road blocks. In response, Vice-President and Minister of Foreign Affairs Isabel Saint Malo de Alvarado held talks with indigenous leaders early June 2016. Carrera said that the filling \"was a violation of the rights of indigenous people in the area, and of the contract signed by President Juan Carlos Varela.\" On August 22, 2016, Silva Carrera and President Varela signed another agreement. This agreement was voted down by the Ngäbe-Bugle General Congress in September 2016. The UN Clean Development Mechanism deregistered the dam in October 2016.\n\nParagraph 10: The quiet life of Oxford professor James Westgate (Bob Peck) is shattered when he is introduced to Penny (Miranda Richardson), the wife of his crass new colleague (Barry Foster).

Shortly before the end of the War Beel was appointed as Minister of the Interior in the Cabinet Gerbrandy III, the last government-in-exile taking office on 23 February 1945. After a cabinet formation Beel retained his position in the national unity Cabinet Schermerhorn–Drees. After the election of 1946 Beel was asked to lead a new cabinet and following a successful cabinet formation with Labour Leader Willem Drees formed the Cabinet Beel I and became Prime Minister of the Netherlands and dual served as Minister of the Interior taking office on 3 July 1946.\n\nParagraph 12: The story of how the tail section survivors cope during their first forty-eight days on the Island is shown in \"The Other 48 Days\".

Wyle, who worked with TNT on the Librarian films, was sent scripts for various shows on their network. He said part of the reason he chose the part was to gain credibility from his children. \"With the birth of my kids, I started to really look at my career through their eyes more than my own, so that does dictate choice, steering me toward certain things and away from other things,\" he said. He also decided to do it as he could relate with his character, stating \"I identified with Tom's devotion to his sons, and admired his sense of social duty.\" Spielberg wanted Wyle for the role because he knew him from his previous series ER, which Spielberg's company produced. He had wanted Wyle to appear in his 1998 film Saving Private Ryan but due to scheduling conflicts, he was unable to star. Spielberg stated that he was determined to work with him again. In July 2009, Moon Bloodgood, Jessy Schram, Seychelle Gabriel and Maxim Knight were cast as Anne Glass, Karen Nadler, Lourdes and Matt Mason, respectively. Bloodgood, the female lead, did not have to audition for the role. She received the script and was offered the role. Bloodgood was drawn to the role because of Spielberg and Rodat's involvement. She stated: \"Well certainly when you get handed a script and they tell you it’s Bob Rodat and Steven Spielberg, you’re immediately drawn to it. It’s got your attention. I was a little cautious about wanting to do science fiction again. But it was more of a drama story, more of a family story. I liked that and I wanted to work with Spielberg.\" Bloodgood added that portraying a doctor excited her. \"I liked the idea of playing a doctor and deviating from something I had done already,\" she said. In August 2009, Drew Roy and Peter Shinkoda were cast as Hal Mason and Dai, respectively. Drew Roy's agent received the script and the pair joked that Roy might get the role. \"This one came to me through my agent, just like everything else. We even joked about the fact that it was a Steven Spielberg project. We were like, \"Oh yeah, I might have a chance.\" We were just joking.\" He auditioned four times for the part. \"The whole process went on for quite some time, and then towards the end, it was down to me and one other guy, and we were literally waiting for the word from Steven Spielberg ‘cause he had to watch the two audition tapes and give the okay. That, in and of itself, had me like, \"Okay, even if I don’t get it, that’s just cool.\" Fortunately, it went my way.\"\n\nParagraph 14: Records of her concert Bir Akdeniz Rüyası, which took place in KüçükÇiftlik Park in Istanbul on 8 September 2012, was released as her first live album by GNL Entertainment as Bir Akdeniz Rüyası. She won the Best Music Video at the 1st Turkey Music Awards on 12 April 2013 with the music video of \"Her Şey Çok Güzel Olacak\" that was directed by Nihat Odabaşı. The music video also won an award in the same category at the 3rd Pal FM Music Awards on 6 May 2013. In November 2013, a non-album single which was written and composed by Sinan Akçıl \"Gelemiyorum Yanına\" was released by GNL Entertainment. On 27 December 2013 she won the Best Female Pop Artist award at the 2013 Bests of the Year Awards of the Haliç University. She became one of the judges of the Kanal D reality talent show X Factor from the first episode on 10 February 2014, but the show had a break after the episode on 24 March, and after it started to be aired again, Sali was dismissed from the judging panel. She, Volkan Konak and Fettah Can voiced \"Arzuhalcinin Yazamadıkları\" in Büyük Resim, an album released in April 2014 for the 15th anniversary of the establishing of the Turkey Handicapped Sports, Education and Assistance Foundation. She had a guest appearance as herself in the 16th episode of Kanal D TV show Arkadaşım Hoşgeldin, broadcast on 17 April 2014. She performed \"Naparsan Yap\" in the Ozan Doğulu album 130 Bpm Moderato (July 2014) and appeared in the music video of the song. Her non-album singe \"Benim Adım Leyla\" was released by DMC along with an accompanying music video in September 2014. In November 2014, her three CD album Bugün Adım Leyla was released by DMC.

The two banks accepted the conclusions and committed themselves to \"further raise the bar on the required level of information on stakeholder consultation available to (them) at the time of credit approval.\" In the meantime, the government of Panama - since June 2014 led by a new President, Juan Carlos Varela - suspended the construction of the dam in February 2015 on the grounds that the environmental and social impact assessment was faulty pending the outcome of a court case that challenges the assessment. In June 2015 new protests erupted, with protesters shutting down the Interamerican Highway for two days, as a result of which the President sent a riot squad to the area. On August 10, 2015, President Varela and the Cacica General of the indigenous Comarca, Silvia Carrera, signed an agreement to the effect that the civil works of the dam would be completed, but that the electromechanical works would remain suspended and the dam would not be flooded until a final agreement had been reached. GENISA complained that it had been left out of the agreement and that the agreement violated the agreements concluded by the state with the company. In September 2015 the environmental agency ANAM imposed a 775,200 USD fine on GEMISA for having failed to comply with the resettlement and compensation measures under the project. On January 21, 2016 the indigenous movement 10th of April claimed that the agreement had been violated, because tests to fill the reservoir had been made. On January 28, 2016, a technical report was presented to the indigenous communities, showing that the dam was technically safe. Furthermore, a sub-commission consisting of the government and traditional authorities was created to further study the impacts of the project in view of a \"final decision\". Filling of the reservoir began on May 24th, leading to further protests and road blocks. In response, Vice-President and Minister of Foreign Affairs Isabel Saint Malo de Alvarado held talks with indigenous leaders early June 2016. Carrera said that the filling \"was a violation of the rights of indigenous people in the area, and of the contract signed by President Juan Carlos Varela.\" On August 22, 2016, Silva Carrera and President Varela signed another agreement. This agreement was voted down by the Ngäbe-Bugle General Congress in September 2016. The UN Clean Development Mechanism deregistered the dam in October 2016.\n\nParagraph 16: On 21 August 2009, it was announced that he had signed a two-year deal with the option of a further year for Liverpool. The Greek international was handed the number 16 shirt. Kyrgiakos scored his first goal for the club against Stoke City on 16 January 2010 in the 57th minute and also completed the full 90 minutes in a 1–1 draw alongside Martin Škrtel at the Britannia Stadium, later being named man of the match by various British sport sites for his performance in that match. On 17 January 2010, former Liverpool striker and football pundit/journalist Stan Collymore wrote an article acknowledging Kyrgiakos' ability, stating that \"Kyrgiakos may be keeping Rafa (Benítez) in a job...\". Collymore argued that \"Sotirios Kyrgiakos could become an unlikely poster boy for the 'new Liverpool.'\" He stated, \"The big pony-tailed Greek put in a sterling performance at The Britannia and may typify the less football, more grit of the new Reds... And it is no-nonsense men such as Kyrgiakos who like to roll up their sleeves which can keep Rafa in a job right now.\" Liverpool's very next game was a crunch-match against Tottenham Hotspur, who were perceived as one of the clubs rivalling Liverpool for fourth in the Premier League table. Liverpool won 2–0 and Kyrgiakos put in another solid performance, one described by Sky Sports as \"magnificent.\"\n\nParagraph 17: Cavaretta attended Lane Technical High School on Chicago's North Side (now known as Lane Tech College Prep), where he played baseball and basketball, and signed a professional contract with the Cubs before finishing high school. In his first professional game with Peoria at age 17 in , Cavaretta hit for the cycle as a right fielder. That same year he was brought up to the Cubs to replace manager Charlie Grimm at first base. He first appeared in a major league game on September 16, 1934, less than two months after his 18th birthday, pinch-hitting unsuccessfully for the Cubs' shortstop Billy Jurges in the fifth inning of the first game of a doubleheader in Brooklyn. A week later, on September 25, in his first start and his first appearance at the Cubs' home park, Wrigley Field, Cavaretta hit a home run that supplied the winning margin in the Cubs' 1–0 win over Cincinnati. In his  rookie season, he batted .275 with 82 runs batted in, also leading the league in double plays, as the Cubs captured their third pennant in seven years by winning 21 straight games in September; however, he batted only .125 in the World Series loss to the Detroit Tigers. Over the next several seasons he provided solid play at first base, routinely batting between .270 and .291 every season but one through 1943, though he lost significant playing time from 1938 to 1940 due to a hip injury and an ankle broken twice while sliding. In the 1938 World Series against the New York Yankees, he batted .462 as the Cubs were swept.", "answers": ["17"], "length": 5199, "dataset": "passage_count_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "7ff28d71a9f01fa3c22a85a55a9aab15ad353c412087dc4e"}
{"input": "", "context": "Paragraph 1: In 1961, chairman Jack Doherty persuaded Bertie Peacock to sign for Coleraine after he left Celtic. It would prove to be one of the most important transfers in the club's history. In 1965, Coleraine won the Irish Cup for the first time, defeating Glenavon 2–1 at Windsor Park, with goals from Shaun Dunlop and Derek Irwin. Coleraine thus gained its first experience of European football, against Soviet outfit Dynamo Kiev. Coleraine also won the first two Blaxnit all-Ireland cups in 1969 and 1970. Coleraine faced Kilmarnock in the 1970 Fairs Cup, and after a 1–1 draw in the first leg, the Bannsiders pulled off an historic 3–2 victory thanks to a Des Dickson hat-trick.\n\nParagraph 2: In 1796, Captain Robert Calder (First Captain) and Captain George Grey (Second Captain), commanded Victory under Admiral Sir John Jervis's flag. By the end of 1796, the British position in the Mediterranean had become untenable. Jervis had stationed his fleet off Cape St Vincent to prevent the Spanish from sailing north, whilst Horatio Nelson was to oversee the evacuation of Elba. Once the evacuation had been accomplished, Nelson, in HMS Minerve, sailed for Gibraltar. On learning that the Spanish fleet had passed by some days previous, Nelson left to rendezvous with Jervis on 11 February. The Spanish fleet, which had been blown off course by easterly gales, was that night working its way to Cadiz. The darkness and a dense fog meant Nelson was able to pass through the enemy fleet without being spotted and join Jervis on 13 February. Jervis, whose fleet had been reinforced on 5 February by five ships from Britain under Rear-Admiral William Parker, now had 15 ships of the line. The following morning, having drawn up his fleet into two columns, Jervis impressed upon the officers on Victorys quarterdeck how, \"A victory to England is very essential at the moment\". Jervis was not aware of the size of the fleet he was facing, but at around 0630 hours, received word that five Spanish warships were to the south-east. By 0900 hours the first enemy ships were visible from Victorys masthead, and at 1100 hours, Jervis gave the order to form line of battle. As the Spanish ships became visible to him, Calder reported the numbers to Jervis, but when he reached 27, Jervis replied, \"Enough, Sir. No more of that. The die is cast and if there are 50 sail, I will go through them\". The Spanish were caught by surprise, sailing in two divisions with a gap that Jervis aimed to exploit. The ship's log records how Victory halted the Spanish division, raking ships both ahead and astern, while Jervis' private memoirs recall how Victorys broadside so terrified Principe de Asturias that she \"squared her yards, ran clear out of the battle and did not return\". Jervis, realising that the main bulk of the enemy fleet could now cross astern and reunite, ordered his ships to change course, but Sir Charles Thompson, leading the rear division, failed to comply. The following ships were now in a quandary over whether to obey the Admiral's signal or follow their divisional commander. Nelson, who had transferred to , was the first to break off and attack the main fleet as Jervis had wanted and other ships soon followed his example. The British fleet not only achieved its main objective, that of preventing the Spanish from joining their French and Dutch allies in the channel, but also captured four ships. The dead and wounded from these four ships alone amounted to 261 and 342, respectively; more than the total number of British casualties of 73 dead and 327 wounded. There was one fatality aboard Victory; a cannonball narrowly missed Jervis and decapitated a nearby sailor.\n\nParagraph 3: In spring 1625, in order to avoid a forthcoming revolt, Shah-Abbas I sent  his troops into Georgia under the orders of Qarachaqay Khan. He attempted to carry out the policy of wholesale massacre and deportation in Kartli. Apparently, the Shah did not fully trust Giorgi as he took his son Paata hostage, after appointing Giorgi the adviser to the Persian general. By the side of Giorgi in the army of the enemy, there was another son of his, Avtandil. Upon Giorgi's advice, Qarachaqay Khan dispatched most of his troops to different parts of Javakheti, caused them disperse and made them easier to defeat. The Georgians owe their success to the preparations carried out by commander-in-chief Saakadze. According to the plans of the leaders of the revolt, the Georgians were to assault the enemy camp earlier than planned; Saakadze and his entourage were to slaughter the commanders of the Persian army. At dawn on 25 March, Annunciation, the joint Kartlian and Kakhetian troops approached the enemy's camp. Hearing the noise, the guards gave alarm. All Persian commanders gathered in Qarachaqay Khan's tent and also summoned Giorgi. Giorgi killed  Qarachaqay Khan with help of his son, while Avtandil took the life of Qarachaqay's son. It did not take long for Giorgi and his entourage to slaughter the stunned Persian commanders. The rest of the Georgians under their second commander Zurab Eristavi, encroached upon the confused enemy who were left without any guidance at that time. After a fierce and bloody massacre throughout the evening, the Georgians won a crushing victory. The data about the Martqopi battle are given in “the Life of Kartli” and by a Turkish chronicler Mustafa Naima of the 17th century. In the aftermath of the battle, the Georgians took Tbilisi and drove the Persians out of other regions, while half of the Shah's army which did not take part in the battle, still remained combat effective.\n\nParagraph 4: It is a tree reaching 12 meters in height.

The seeds are wrinkly.\n\nParagraph 5: The Anugita sub-parva recites a restatement of Bhagavad Gita teachings by Krishna to Arjuna. Arjuna asks Krishna to repeat the holy discourse, what he told to him in time of battle as that has been forgotten by him. Krishna shows his disagreement and says that either he is destitute of faith or his understanding is not good as that discourse is impossible to repeat, in detail, what he told him in higher state. However, out of affection, Krishna tells him other ancient stories to help know the nature of Brahman. After this, Krishna returns to Dwaraka and on his way he meets ascetic Utanka. The sage tries to curse Krishna for not doing enough to avert the war. Krishna apologies for his act but tells him that low level curses cannot put him down and curses cause destruction of merit. He tells him that he strove his best for peace, but it is impossible to transgress destiny by either intelligence or might. He then discourse him on Darkness, Passion and Goodness, saying Dharma is very dear to him, so in every yuga he took birth in diverse wombs, for restoring it, with the aid of others. He did this for protecting Righteousness and for establishing it. Whether he live among deities, Gandharvas, Nagas, Yakshas or Rakshasas, he lived & acted after the manner of that order. Born he is now in the order of humanity, he must act as a human being. And later shows him his true form with a boon. Krishna on returning to Dwaraka when asked, narrates the battle to Vasudeva and others. And later with his power revives the deadborn Parikshit. The royal ceremony of the Ashvamedha was initiated by Yudhishthira, after recommendations of Krishna. The ceremony is a year-long event where the horse roams any land in any direction it wishes to. The horse is followed by an army led by Arjuna, whose mission is to challenge any ruler who objects the free movement of the horse. This ceremony establishes the primacy of Yudhishthira as the emperor, and his recognition by other rulers and kingdoms. On his way Arjuna battled grandsons of Trigartas, Bhagdatta's son, Saindhavas who were able to overpower Arjuna who was fighting mildly as per his brother words, but at last defeated and spared by him. When Arjuna reaches Manipura, their ruler Vabhruvahana with his people welcomes him. Arjuna do not approve it and challenges him to battle. And as per Ulupi(Naga) words both fights, in which at last both struck each other and fell down. The latter's swoon was however due to his exertions in battle. Arjuna's wife Chitrangada comes and starts to lament for her husband death by his son and vows for suicide if he does not comes back. Ulupi(Arjuna's wife) at last uses her mystical gem to revive him and tells them her intentions. After which Arjuna again follows the horse. On his return he battled Sahadeva, Chedis, Gandharas and bested them. At the end of the year, victorious Arjuna's army and the horse return to the emperor's capital. When all the people were made gift, a half-golden mongoose came there who spoke to their amaze and compared that sacrifice inferior to that of a Brahmana family with just powdered barley, without any wealth & animal sacrifice, and then disappears.\n\nParagraph 6: Without promotional efforts of a major record label, This Strange Engine continued the decline in mainstream success for Marillion, reaching only number 27 in the UK Albums Chart and staying there for three weeks. It sold significantly better in the Netherlands, home of one of the band's most loyal audiences, peaking at number 10 on the charts. Two singles from the album were released: \"Man of a Thousand Faces\" and \"Eighty Days\". For the first time in the band's history, no song cracked the UK Top 40 as the first single reached number 98 and the second one failed to chart at all.\n\nParagraph 7: Later on, Jacob's shapeshifter wolf pack and the Cullen family join forces to defeat Victoria and the army of newborn vampires she has created. The wolf pack have agreed to meet at their house.  They are in their wolf form as they don't trust the Cullen's enough to be in their human form as they possibly believe this to be a plot to destroy the pack.  Carlisle greets them and tells how they should accurately and successfully attack a newborn.  Sam telepathically asks what a newborn is and what the difference is between them and the newborn.  He tells them that the newborns are a fresh breed of vampires that were humans forcibly turned with a combination of both human and vampire strength with most of their human element relying on intelligence.  Carlisle tells them that they should never let a single one get their arms around them as they are strong enough to crush their bodies. He also says that they should never go for the \"obvious\" kill as they can get outnumbered easily and lose most of the pack. As the Cullen's demonstrate their tactics to the wolves on how they deal with newborns, Jacob also in his wolf form comes up to Bella. He nudges close to her as he still has a crush on her. She tells Jacob that if they join this attack many of them could get hurt or even killed. In response Jacob places his head in front of her and she pets him. Suddenly Edwards sees this and Jacob looks at him with a disgusted and annoyed look and walks off. The night before the battle, Edward and Jacob are alone with Bella on the top of a mountain. They are there, in a secluded spot, to protect her from Victoria and her blood-hungry army. It is night, and a blizzard beats at their tent. Bella is freezing to death, huddled in a blanket hold and shivering violently. Edward watches on with despair, as he can do nothing to help because his vampire skin is ice-cold. Jacob, being a werewolf, is never cold and has very a warm body. Because of his enhanced senses he can hear Bella's teeth chattering as he claims that he \"can't sleep with all that teeth chattering going on.\" He moves forward to lay down with Bella, knowing his body heat would keep her warm. Edward shoves him away, outraged, and says he will not go near her. Jacob demands that Edward lets him go. Bella, hardly conscious, pleads for them not to fight. Jacob insists that Bella needs his warmth, and reluctantly Edward lets him crawl into the blankets with her. She cuddles into his warmth, still hardly conscious. Bella stops shaking and chattering. She falls asleep in his arms. While she is sleeping, Edward and Jacob begin to talk quietly. As the night wears on, their private conversation softens and the two become closer.\n\nParagraph 8: Michael Starr, former Minister of Labour in Diefenbaker's government, MP for Oshawa, Ontario, and PC House Leader in the House of Commons, was considered to be the most loyal of the Diefenbaker supporters, and declared that he was running only because Diefenbaker was not. Many believed that he was just a “stalking horse” for Diefenbaker, i.e., trying to hold delegates’ support until Diefenbaker himself joined the campaign. Starr did not, however, withdraw when Diefenbaker joined the campaign, and even stayed for the second ballot even though he had won only a few votes.  Starr did little campaigning prior to the convention because he said that he did not have the resources of the other candidates.  He focused on meeting delegates at the convention, but by then, most of his campaign team, headed by future Deputy Prime Minister Erik Nielsen, had quit in frustration over the lack of organization, and joined other campaigns. Starr proposed a “wage and price freeze” to fight inflation – a policy that ended up as the centrepiece of the 1974 PC campaign, and replacing personal income taxation by a “trading tax” on goods and services – a policy that was implemented by the PC government of Brian Mulroney in 1990.  He also proposed that the British North America Acts be brought back to Canada without amendments. During the campaign he suggested that Canada withdraw from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, a comment that he later regretted and withdrew.\n\nParagraph 9: The Anugita sub-parva recites a restatement of Bhagavad Gita teachings by Krishna to Arjuna.

The future Pequeño Olímpico was brought into CMLL to replenish the Mini division. He was given the ring persona of Cicloncito Ramírez, a mini version of Ciclón Ramirez who worked in CMLL at the time. He kept working as Cicloncito Ramírez even after the man he was based on left CMLL. Working in the Mini division does not necessarily mean that he is a dwarf as several short wrestlers work in the \"Mini\" division. In the mid to late-1990s CMLL did not focus much on their Minis division, thus Ciclocito Ramirez rarely made it onto CMLL's television shows. In 2002, years after Ciclón Ramírez had left CMLL, it was decided to repackage him as \"Pequeño Olímpico\", a mini of a popular Tecnico (Face or \"good guy\") Olímpico. About a year after becoming Pequeño Olímpico he defeated Pierrothito to win the CMLL World Mini-Estrella Championship on December 9, 2003. Pequeño Olímpico successfully defended the title against former champion Pierrotito, Pequeño Violencia, Toro Bill, Gitanito, and had three defenses against Pequeño Damián 666. On November 20, 2007, Pequeño Olímpico lost the title to Pequeño Damián 666, ending his title reign after 1,442 days, the longest reign of any Mini's champion. Pequeño Olímpico remains one of CMLL's main \"tecnico\" Minis as the Mini division has gotten more air time and promotional focus in the last couple of years. Pequeño Olímpico was one of 13 Minis that risked their mask in a Steel Cage Luchas de Apuestas match in the main event of CMLL's La Hora Cero pay-per-view on January 11, 2009. Pequeño Olímpico was the 7th wrestler to escape the cage to save his mask. In August CMLL began a \"Bicentennial tournament\" specifically for the Mini-Estrella division, both to celebrate the 200th anniversary of Mexico as a nation and the 18th anniversary of CMLL's Mini-Estrella division. The prize of the tournament was an opportunity to leave the Mini-Estrellas division and work with the regular male wrestlers of CMLL. Pequeño Olímpico was part of the first of two torneo cibernetico elimination matches but did not qualify for the finals. On February 13, 2011, Olímpico regained the Mini-Estrella Championship from Bam Bam. On November 6, 2012, 12 competitors met in a special steel cage match where the loser of the match would be forced to unmask or have his hair shaved completely off. During Pequeño Olímpico's attempt to climb out of the cage the wire mesh broke lose from the metal frame, trapping Pequeño Olímpico's arm in it. He needed help from ringside officials to safely untangle himself and climb down. Following the escape Pequeño Olímpico was immediately taken to the back to have his arm checked out. On September 7, 2014, Pequeño Olímpico lost the CMLL World Mini-Estrella Championship to Astral, ending his three and a half year reign.\n\nParagraph 11: The man who would later wrestle as \"Pequeño Olímpico\" made his professional wrestling debut in 1992, that same year Antonio Peña, head booker of Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL), left CMLL to form his own promotion, Asistencia Asesoría y Administración (AAA); Peña had been the mastermind behind the CMLL Minis division and most of the Minis in CMLL decided to leave with Peña.

He goes on to say, \"This frank and confiding conduct, so indicative of a brave and generous nature, was properly appreciated by Columbus; he received the cacique cordially\". Columbus, however, makes no mention of this sort in his logs. He makes very little mention of the Indians at all. The dominant bulk of his entry while moored in the bay is spent talking about the possibility of gold on the island and the exploitation thereof. Irving also makes assumptions about the nature of the Indians. He frequently refers to them as a mountaineering and brave people. Irving also assumes they are an amiable people who traded at length with Columbus. The facts for this are also absent in the primary source. Irving states, \"Columbus remained a day or two longer in the bay, during which time the most friendly intercourse prevailed with the natives, who brought cotton, and various fruits and vegetables, but still maintained their warrior character, being always armed with bows and arrows\". Columbus makes no mention in his log of their warrior character or of extensive trading with the Indians while in the bay. The log of Columbus does mention, however, that the bows were made of fairly light materials and that the style of shooting was not overly deadly and didn’t make too much of an impact on future decisions to come to the island. Irving goes on to say that Columbus leaves on good terms with the Indians. There is no evidence to support this in the log of Columbus either. It is known that Columbus did take four young Indians with him to Spain from this location and that they did provide him with helpful information but it does not say that the Indians were overly fond of him as Irving suggests. It is known that Columbus leaves due to the lack of opportunity left for him at the Bay of Arrows. His log seems to show he is ashamed of how he and his men treated the Natives at the bay.

Comments from younger viewers read on Junior Points of View were mixed; some found the episode \"exciting and hair-raising\", while others complained about the \"pointless, noisy, bleeping\" of the Zarbi. Following the broadcast of the second episode, Patrick Skene Catling of Punch wrote that the serial was guilty of \"ludicrous bathos\".

Following the fifth episode, the Sunday Mirror received a complaint from A. N. Thompson that the show was \"slipping\" due to its newly-comedic nature. At the BBC Programme Review Board in March 1965, Alasdair Milne said that the series was \"difficult to follow, unless one watched every edition\"; at the following Review Board, controller of programmes Huw Wheldon said that the serial was going well, while BBC1 controller Michael Peacock felt that the series had too much \"mumbo-jumbo\" and that the character names were difficult to follow.

However, in 1975 with Ross willing to spend the big money, conditions were finally there to make the dream transfer happen. He sent Emmett, Toye, Cosmos vice-president Raphael de la Sierra, and Nesuhi Ertegun to Brazil where they met with 34-year-old Pelé at a seaside resort and played soccer with him on the beach. Since by this time Real Madrid and Juventus also started sniffing around Pelé in an attempt to bring him to Europe for the first time, the Cosmos delegation used the possibility of making soccer big in a country new to the sport as their main lure and by the end of the day, the Brazilian agreed in principle to come to New York. The actual negotiation with Warner Communications lawyer Norman Samnick, who was deployed to Brazil by Ross, turned out to be a little more difficult: Ross was willing to risk $2 million for three years of play while Pelé demanded $5 million for two years. In the end, the deal agreed was a complex five-part contract worth around $4.5 million in total that included $1 million for three years of play, $1 million for ten years of marketing rights, $1 million for a fourteen-year PR contract, and another $1 million for a music contract. Warner Communications money thus managed to lure arguably then still the biggest name in soccer out of retirement. In addition to huge amounts of money, due to Pelé's special status in Brazil as the country's national treasure, getting him to leave his homeland for the first time in his career involved a lot of politics as well, especially when the Brazilian president demanded that Pelé play another year in Brazil for the \"good of his people\". Ross called on his political connections in an attempt to soften the Brazilian government's position and eventually managed to get to the US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, who personally called his Brazilian counterpart telling him that Pelé's move to New York would be a huge step forward in the US–Brazil relations.\n\nParagraph 5: The idea of bringing Pelé to America had actually been around for a while as NASL commissioner Phil Woosnam and eventual Cosmos GM Clive Toye discussed it as far back as 1970 and even made an approach to the player in spring 1971, one month after the Cosmos had been formed.

The first document, from March 1954 refers to a list requested by an unknown CIA official of government officials, members of the Communist Party, and others \"of tactical importance whose removal for psychological, organizational or others reasons is mandatory for the success of military action\" and asks for a final list to be narrowed down for \"disposal\" by the Junta group, though the names of any individuals, CIA, Guatemalan, or otherwise, were withheld. The conditions for selecting names to add to the list were broken down into three conditions: the target had to be, a Communist driven politician who was not outwardly supportive of Communism, a public Communist whose elimination was necessary for the success of the future government, or a military target whose elimination was necessary for certain military actions. The memorandum was addressed to \"All Staff Officers,\"and included instructions for its circulation, requesting input (\"Your careful consideration is requested in making additions or deletions\"), so that the \"planning [could] proceed on schedule.\" Psychological warfare was also brought upon the individuals on this list. Mourning cards were used in an attempt to scare off the communist leaders and supporters.  These cards threatened communist political figures and were meant to foreshadow their assassinations.  The dissident leaders wanted to take the psychological warfare in a more violent direction at one point, recommending that eliminating a top communist official would help the resistance movement. The CIA advised against this and said that it would not be beneficial to resistance and that it would \"set off wholesale reprisals\". The second document from an unspecified date (though after February 1952, according to point 2) introduces a list of \"Guatemalan Communist Personnel to be disposed of [...] by Calligeris.\" The list was split into two categories, Category I and Category II, Category I was a list of people to be taken out by means of executive action and Category II which was individuals selected to be imprisoned or exiled. Of the two categories, 58 individuals (names withheld) to be disposed of through \"Executive action\" and 74 individuals to be imprisoned or exiled. A description of this second document found on the National Security Archive webpage by Kate Doyle and Peter Kornbluh notes that the \"Executive action\" for members of the first category likely means \"killed\"; however, this information cannot be verified through these documents.  This description also states that \"Calligeris\" was the code-name given to Castillo Armas by the CIA. The Guatemalan exiles that were trained in Honduras were led by Carlos Armas and later Carlos Diaz agreed to lead the group against Arbenz. Castillo Armas' CIA-supported force entered Guatemala on June 16, 1954.\n\nParagraph 7: Two declassified CIA documents reveal such a discussion of assassination of the Guatemalans.

She is attended by a number of people including Sampat Rai (Prem Chopra), her business manager, and Chhaya (Shilpa Shetty), a girl from the local village. Chhaya was raised by Anjali Devi and the two are very fond of each other. One day Anjali Devi receives a telegram intimating that her grandson Raja (Saif Ali Khan) is coming to visit her from London. It is revealed that Anjali Devi's only son married against her husband's wishes and was subsequently thrown out of the house. At his deathbed her husband made Anjali Devi promise that she wouldn't let their son or his family cross the threshold of their house. Anjali Devi's son and daughter in law later pass away in an accident, but bound by the promise to her dying husband, Anjali Devi repudiates Raja when he comes to see her. Chhaya advises Raja to set up a tent outside the house and slowly win over his grandmother. The plan succeeds and eventually Anjali Devi accepts him. Raja and Chhaya fall in love and decide to get married. In the meantime Sampat Rai, who had hoped to inherit her business, is furious at Raja's arrival in Anjali Devi's life. He decides to set up his daughter Sonu (Somy Ali) with Raja. Sonu and Raja become good friends. Anjali Devi too agrees to their marriage. However, Raja refuses to marry Sonu and tells Anjali Devi that he loves Chhaya. Anjali Devi is furious at the thought of her grandson marrying down into a poor family and has Sampat Rai throw Chhaya out. Chhaya's brother Shankar (Mukesh Khanna) takes her back home. He too is furious that she fell in love with Raja and vows to get her married to the ultra creepy Maniram (Gulshan Grover). He locks up Chhaya to stop her from meeting Raja. When Raja tries to find Chhaya he is beaten up by Maniram. Eventually Chhaya and Raja run away with the aid of Shankar's wife. Maniram, Shankar, and Sampat Rai find out and pursue the couple. Before they catch up with the runaways, the latter get married in a temple. Shankar and Anjali Devi decide to forgive them.  However, Maniram with the help of Sampat Rai kidnaps Chhaya and Raja and takes them to Sampat's Rai's abandoned factory. Sampat Rai in the meantime also kidnaps Anjali Devi and takes her there. He tortures her into signing over her property to Sampat Rai. Shankar finds his way to the factory and helps Chhaya and Raja fight Maniram and Sampat Rai. Sonu too has followed her father to the factory. She tries to free Anjali Devi but is killed herself in the process. Sampat Rai breaks down when he realizes that he has accidentally killed his own daughter. Just then the police arrive and arrest the goons. In the end Anjali Devi, Raja, and Chhaya are reunited.\n\nParagraph 10: Two declassified CIA documents reveal such a discussion of assassination of the Guatemalans.

He writes \"They parted with two of their bows; but, suddenly conceiving some distrust, or thinking to overpower this handful of strangers, they rushed to the place where they had left their weapons, snatched them up . . .\" This is not overly imaginative and rather looks like it could be plagiarism. Irving does, however go on to make quite a few assumptions. In fact, Irving writes another page and a half on the Natives of the island. He goes on to say, \"This frank and confiding conduct, so indicative of a brave and generous nature, was properly appreciated by Columbus; he received the cacique cordially\". Columbus, however, makes no mention of this sort in his logs. He makes very little mention of the Indians at all. The dominant bulk of his entry while moored in the bay is spent talking about the possibility of gold on the island and the exploitation thereof. Irving also makes assumptions about the nature of the Indians. He frequently refers to them as a mountaineering and brave people. Irving also assumes they are an amiable people who traded at length with Columbus. The facts for this are also absent in the primary source. Irving states, \"Columbus remained a day or two longer in the bay, during which time the most friendly intercourse prevailed with the natives, who brought cotton, and various fruits and vegetables, but still maintained their warrior character, being always armed with bows and arrows\".

Since by this time Real Madrid and Juventus also started sniffing around Pelé in an attempt to bring him to Europe for the first time, the Cosmos delegation used the possibility of making soccer big in a country new to the sport as their main lure and by the end of the day, the Brazilian agreed in principle to come to New York. The actual negotiation with Warner Communications lawyer Norman Samnick, who was deployed to Brazil by Ross, turned out to be a little more difficult: Ross was willing to risk $2 million for three years of play while Pelé demanded $5 million for two years. In the end, the deal agreed was a complex five-part contract worth around $4.5 million in total that included $1 million for three years of play, $1 million for ten years of marketing rights, $1 million for a fourteen-year PR contract, and another $1 million for a music contract. Warner Communications money thus managed to lure arguably then still the biggest name in soccer out of retirement. In addition to huge amounts of money, due to Pelé's special status in Brazil as the country's national treasure, getting him to leave his homeland for the first time in his career involved a lot of politics as well, especially when the Brazilian president demanded that Pelé play another year in Brazil for the \"good of his people\". Ross called on his political connections in an attempt to soften the Brazilian government's position and eventually managed to get to the US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, who personally called his Brazilian counterpart telling him that Pelé's move to New York would be a huge step forward in the US–Brazil relations.\n\nParagraph 17: Anjali Devi (Bharati) is a rich businesswoman who lives by herself in a palatial mansion. She is attended by a number of people including Sampat Rai (Prem Chopra), her business manager, and Chhaya (Shilpa Shetty), a girl from the local village. Chhaya was raised by Anjali Devi and the two are very fond of each other. One day Anjali Devi receives a telegram intimating that her grandson Raja (Saif Ali Khan) is coming to visit her from London. It is revealed that Anjali Devi's only son married against her husband's wishes and was subsequently thrown out of the house. At his deathbed her husband made Anjali Devi promise that she wouldn't let their son or his family cross the threshold of their house. Anjali Devi's son and daughter in law later pass away in an accident, but bound by the promise to her dying husband, Anjali Devi repudiates Raja when he comes to see her. Chhaya advises Raja to set up a tent outside the house and slowly win over his grandmother. The plan succeeds and eventually Anjali Devi accepts him. Raja and Chhaya fall in love and decide to get married. In the meantime Sampat Rai, who had hoped to inherit her business, is furious at Raja's arrival in Anjali Devi's life. He decides to set up his daughter Sonu (Somy Ali) with Raja. Sonu and Raja become good friends. Anjali Devi too agrees to their marriage. However, Raja refuses to marry Sonu and tells Anjali Devi that he loves Chhaya. Anjali Devi is furious at the thought of her grandson marrying down into a poor family and has Sampat Rai throw Chhaya out. Chhaya's brother Shankar (Mukesh Khanna) takes her back home. He too is furious that she fell in love with Raja and vows to get her married to the ultra creepy Maniram (Gulshan Grover). He locks up Chhaya to stop her from meeting Raja. When Raja tries to find Chhaya he is beaten up by Maniram. Eventually Chhaya and Raja run away with the aid of Shankar's wife. Maniram, Shankar, and Sampat Rai find out and pursue the couple. Before they catch up with the runaways, the latter get married in a temple. Shankar and Anjali Devi decide to forgive them.  However, Maniram with the help of Sampat Rai kidnaps Chhaya and Raja and takes them to Sampat's Rai's abandoned factory. Sampat Rai in the meantime also kidnaps Anjali Devi and takes her there. He tortures her into signing over her property to Sampat Rai. Shankar finds his way to the factory and helps Chhaya and Raja fight Maniram and Sampat Rai. Sonu too has followed her father to the factory. She tries to free Anjali Devi but is killed herself in the process. Sampat Rai breaks down when he realizes that he has accidentally killed his own daughter. Just then the police arrive and arrest the goons. In the end Anjali Devi, Raja, and Chhaya are reunited.", "answers": ["6"], "length": 7079, "dataset": "passage_count_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "ec42df1dd4a8be4502339260c265a799c464c8a1cb7c25e1"}
{"input": "", "context": "Paragraph 1: The village has a long educational history. In 1686, Alderman John Preston founded a private school in the village known as Ballyroan School, endowed with lands in Cappaloughlan. The school was in a large slated building erected at a cost of £500, which has since been demolished. Protestant boys received a free education, while Catholic boys paid £1 per quarter. In the nineteenth century, the school moved to Abbeyleix. The Brigidine Sisters came to the village in 1877 and opened a school operating under a Catholic ethos. Three sisters (nuns) from the Abbeyleix Community took up residence in their newly built convent on 25 September of that year. Their convent and school closed in 1974.\n\nParagraph 2: The first gameplay mode is the Arcade mode, where a player controlled character encounters CPU controlled characters in a random or set order which can be entirely customized. There are also three different kinds of Team modes: Single, Simul, and Turns. A fourth mode, Tag, is listed in the EXE along with two related script controllers, but was never used. In Team mode, either side can use any of the team modes. Single is identical to not having a team, Simul gives that side a computer-controlled partner who fights simultaneously, and Turns uses a different character for each round of play, varying through a set number (usually from 2 to 4) of different characters in a row. If set, the characters' starting life will be adjusted according to the number of players on each side. If one side has two characters and the other has only one in one of the Team modes, the two characters that are on the same side will each have half their respective normal maximum life values. Pre-Win M.U.G.E.N versions of the engine could have this feature adjusted or disabled via the options screen or the config file, but due to the nature of the hack, the option has not yet been reactivated. Team Co-op is similar to Simul, except that both human players fight on the same side and at the same time.\n\nParagraph 3: The first gameplay mode is the Arcade mode, where a player controlled character encounters CPU controlled characters in a random or set order which can be entirely customized.

It is dedicated to Lord Shiva. This place is presumed to be the same spot where Lord Shiva was stopped for meditation where he was on his way to Kedarnath. According to local mythology, this temple has its presence since the time of Bhasmasur (the Deadly Asur/demon), who received a boon from \"Shiva\" that turned a head into Bhasma or ashes whenever he touched with boon to anyone's head. Lord Shiva accompanied by another one reached to a cave which was the home of Lord Shiva, and finally lord \"Vishnu\" helped him by killing the demon. The temple is filled with fantastic energy/aura, and one can feel it. Few drops of water are continually running through the hill.Dhari Devi temple of \"Dhari Devi\" is situated on the banks of the river Alaknanda. One has to travel  from Srinagar (Pauri Garhwal) on Srinagar-Badrinath highway to Kaliya Saur, and then turn down where one has to travel half of a kilometre towards Alaknanda river. The upper part of Goddess \"Kali\" is worshipped here. According to the local people, the face of the idol changes as a girl, a woman, and an old lady according to the passage of time. This idol is located in an open area. Many times, villagers and some philanthropists tried to build a roof for Goddess, but their efforts returned empty handed as the roof gets dismantle every time. As per \"Srimad Devi Bhagwat\", there are 108 Shakti Peeth as in India, and this holy shrine is one of them.Kalimath''', also known as \"Kaviltha\", is a village which is regarded as a divine place and Shakti Peeth. It lies at an altitude of around 6,000 feet (1,800 m) on the river Saraswati in the Himalayas, surrounded by the peaks of Kedarnath in Rudraprayag district of Uttarakhand. Kalimath is situated close to Ukhimath and Guptakashi. It is one of the \"Siddha Peeths\" of the region and is regarded a respectful place with religious importance. The temple of the goddess Kali is located in this village and is visited by many devotees throughout the year, especially during the \"Navratras\". There are 108 Shakti Peethas'' in India, and this holy shrine is one of them as described in the \"Srimad Devi Bhagwat\". The upper part of goddess Kali is worshipped in \"Dhari Devi\". Goddess Kali killed the demon \"Raktavija\" here in this area. After killing the demon, they went under the earth.\n\nParagraph 5: Soledad (Alejandra Onieva) is Francisca and Salvador's only common child and Pepa and Tristan's half-sister. She's proud, refined and kind-hearted lady from the upper class but suffers a lot because of her love for Juan (Jonàs Beramì), son of Francisca's and then Tristan's maid Rosario (Adelfa Calvo) and Alfonso's younger brother, who often gets into trouble. Soledad and Juan get married but soon divorce after Juan unintentionally causes Soledad's miscarriage, leaving her childless. Both of them try to move on, Juan by hiring a call girl named Enriqueta (Andrea Duro), who falls in love with him, and Soledad by getting engaged to Pepa's step-brother Olmo (Iago Garcìa). Olmo leaves Soledad when he finds out she is unable to have children, but then comes back when he learns that he has a son, Fernando, from his former school teacher with whom he had had an affair. Soledad refuses to accept Olmo and reunites with Juan whom she has always loved. They decide to move to Paris and start their life together again but Olmo and Enriqueta team up to stop them. When Soledad and Juan leave, Enriqueta comes across them and shoots at Soledad, but Juan sacrifices his life to save his beloved. Enriqueta flees, leaving Soledad heartbroken. However, the latter prefers retiring to a monastery than staying with Olmo. Years later, after several attempts of committing suicide, she returns home. Soledad is extremely depressed and to help her overcome her sadness, her servant and best friend, Mariana and the village's priest Padre Anselmo (Mario Martìn) decide to bring Soledad's happy memories of piano lessons by hiring a teacher. However, she has no interest, as her only wish is going to Paris where she would be happy with Juan and end her life there. The teacher helps her fulfill her wish. Later, Soledad returns from Paris. Changed. She's no longer the miserable person, with no desire for life, but a cheerful, vivacious and carefree woman who lives the way she wants. In Paris, she met Enriqueta, now begging on the streets, who revealed her everything about Olmo's true colours, including their alliance and how Juan's murder was part of his plan. This was not Olmo's solely crime, he also killed his own adoptive and Pepa's real mother for the sake of his inheritance and is responsible for Fernando's mother's death. Soledad goes back to Puente Viejo for 1 reason: punishing Olmo and stopping him from committing more crimes. With the help of Olmo's assassin, she exposes Olmo and sends him to jail. After that, she leaves to continue her life. When Fernando discovers that his father stands behind his mother's death, he disowns him. He even tries to get his father killed in jail. Olmo survives but loses his memory and turns into a modest, hard-working blue-collar worker. Soon, he gains his memory back but terrified of what he has done and fearing he would do such things again, commits suicide. Soledad marries Terence, an American gentleman with dark complexion but falls in love with Simòn (Jonàs Beramì), a blue-collar worker who looks just like Juan. Despite Soledad's affords to forget Simon and stay with her husband, Terence lets her free. She moves to Australia with Simon and they live happily ever after.\n\nParagraph 6: Beside its holdings in the East Midlands, the priory held many very small pieces of property, mostly donated by local families, around Brewood and scattered across Shropshire to its south and west. On 6 October 1254, for example, Philip de Beckbury, in response to a fine levied at Westminster, agreed to pay the priory one mark annually as rent for two mills at Beckbury. In 1256 William de Ercall, and Prioress Agnes engaged in a complicated series of lawsuits, including a fine of lands, to transfer to the convent a very small rent (a ninth of the sheaves on three carucates of land) and small piece of land for a weir. This involved settling any competing claim that might come from Wombridge Priory. Some small transfers represented the dowries of canonesses on their admission to the community.  Bartholomew Terret gave a virgate in Lawley as dowry for his sister Gundred. Richard de Harley and his wife Burga went to considerable trouble and expense to donate property and rights to the priory, the most important being the advowson of Bold church, which was in southern Shropshire and part of the Diocese of Hereford. On 11 May 1309 Bishop Swinefield asked the dean and chapter of Hereford Cathedral to approve the transfer of the advowson from Harley to White Ladies. He issued an ordinance to this effect on 3 August. As it involved an alienation  in mortmain, the transfer required royal approval, and this could only be secured through payment of a fine. Edward II's licence was issued on 6 August, permitting the transfer of a messuage and half a virgate of land at Bold, in addition to the advowson. This was probably to provide a dowry for Alice de Harley, who later became prioress. In the longer term, the value of Bold declined greatly, probably as a result of declining population, and the income proved insufficient to maintain a priest, prompting Bishop Thomas Mylling to issue an ordinance on 10 October 1481, amalgamating the church with that of neighbouring Aston Botterell. Although a pension of ten shillings, payable each Michaelmas, was promised to White Ladies, Bold was bringing in only 6s. 8d. in 1536.\n\nParagraph 7: The first gameplay mode is the Arcade mode, where a player controlled character encounters CPU controlled characters in a random or set order which can be entirely customized.

The feud between Los Psycho Circus and Los Perros del Mal continued on May 29, 2011, at Perros del Mal Producciones third anniversary show, where the two groups faced each other in a six-man tag team steel cage Mask vs. Hair Lucha de Apuesta. In the end, Psycho Clown was the last person to escape the cage, leaving behind Super Crazy, who was then forced to have his head shaved bald. The feud continued at Triplemanía XIX, where Damián 666, Halloween, and X-Fly defeated Los Psycho Circus in a tournament final to become the inaugural AAA World Trios Champions. On July 31 at Verano de Escándalo, Los Psycho Circus faced Los Perros del Mal faced in a steel cage match, where the last person left in the cage would lose either his mask or hair.

He received his title shot on October 18 at Héroes Inmortales VII, but was defeated by El Texano Jr., following a fast count from rudo referee Hijo del Tirantes. This led to another AAA World Trios Championship match on December 8 at Guerra de Titanes, where Los Psycho Circus defeated El Consejo representatives El Texano Jr., El Hijo del Fantasma and Silver King to retain their title. On June 7, 2014, at Verano de Escándalo, Psycho Clown once again failed to capture the AAA Mega Championship from El Texano Jr. after referee Rafael el Maya turned rudo and joined El Consejo. The rivalry between Psycho Clown and El Texano Jr. culminated on August 17 at Triplemanía XXII, where Psycho Clown was victorious in a Lucha de Apuestas between the two, forcing his rival to have his head shaved. Los Psycho Circus lost the AAA World Trios Championship to Los Hell Brothers (Averno, Chessman and Cibernético) on June 14, 2015, at Verano de Escándalo.\n\nParagraph 9: Beside its holdings in the East Midlands, the priory held many very small pieces of property, mostly donated by local families, around Brewood and scattered across Shropshire to its south and west.

Three sisters (nuns) from the Abbeyleix Community took up residence in their newly built convent on 25 September of that year. Their convent and school closed in 1974.\n\nParagraph 15: Beside its holdings in the East Midlands, the priory held many very small pieces of property, mostly donated by local families, around Brewood and scattered across Shropshire to its south and west. On 6 October 1254, for example, Philip de Beckbury, in response to a fine levied at Westminster, agreed to pay the priory one mark annually as rent for two mills at Beckbury. In 1256 William de Ercall, and Prioress Agnes engaged in a complicated series of lawsuits, including a fine of lands, to transfer to the convent a very small rent (a ninth of the sheaves on three carucates of land) and small piece of land for a weir. This involved settling any competing claim that might come from Wombridge Priory. Some small transfers represented the dowries of canonesses on their admission to the community.  Bartholomew Terret gave a virgate in Lawley as dowry for his sister Gundred. Richard de Harley and his wife Burga went to considerable trouble and expense to donate property and rights to the priory, the most important being the advowson of Bold church, which was in southern Shropshire and part of the Diocese of Hereford. On 11 May 1309 Bishop Swinefield asked the dean and chapter of Hereford Cathedral to approve the transfer of the advowson from Harley to White Ladies. He issued an ordinance to this effect on 3 August. As it involved an alienation  in mortmain, the transfer required royal approval, and this could only be secured through payment of a fine. Edward II's licence was issued on 6 August, permitting the transfer of a messuage and half a virgate of land at Bold, in addition to the advowson. This was probably to provide a dowry for Alice de Harley, who later became prioress. In the longer term, the value of Bold declined greatly, probably as a result of declining population, and the income proved insufficient to maintain a priest, prompting Bishop Thomas Mylling to issue an ordinance on 10 October 1481, amalgamating the church with that of neighbouring Aston Botterell. Although a pension of ten shillings, payable each Michaelmas, was promised to White Ladies, Bold was bringing in only 6s. 8d. in 1536.\n\nParagraph 16: Beside its holdings in the East Midlands, the priory held many very small pieces of property, mostly donated by local families, around Brewood and scattered across Shropshire to its south and west.

In 1686, Alderman John Preston founded a private school in the village known as Ballyroan School, endowed with lands in Cappaloughlan. The school was in a large slated building erected at a cost of £500, which has since been demolished. Protestant boys received a free education, while Catholic boys paid £1 per quarter.

{"input": "", "context": "Paragraph 1: SH 72 was originally proposed on August 21, 1923 from Cuero to Carmine, absorbing previously designated SH 3B. On March 17, 1924, it extended southwest to Yorktown. On December 21, 1926, it extended to Karnes City. On February 21, 1928, its south end was rerouted to Kenedy. On March 3, 1931, SH 72 Spur to Sweet Home was added, but was not part of the state highway system (it was added to the state highway system on March 16, 1937). On May 15, 1934, SH 72 Bypass was designated in Yoakum. On November 24, 1936, its route had been readjusted, with the section north of Cuero transferred to US 77/SH 44 and SH 128. On November 16, 1937, it extended to Three Rivers. On September 26, 1939, it extended west to Cotulla, replacing part of SH 202, and everything north of Cuero was cancelled (as it was part of US 77). SH 72 Spur and SH 72 Bypass were renumbered Spur 27 (Sweet Home) and Loop 51 (Yoakum). On June 23, 1942, the section from Fowlerton to Three Rivers was either cancelled or transferred to Farm to Market Road 63. On July 31, 1942, the section from Fowlerton to Cotulla was transferred to SH 97. On December 15, 1960, the section from Fowlerton to Three Rivers was transferred back to SH 72, replacing FM 63. On March 2, 1981, the section between Three Rivers and Tilden was relocated around the then-proposed Choke Canyon Reservoir, as the old route would be inundated by the Choke Canyon Reservoir. The section from the junction with  US 87 in Cuero into the city was designated Farm to Market Road 3402 in 1977; this route was extended to the west to US 87 in 1983. FM 3402 was combined with SH 72 on March 31, 1994, completing the current route.\n\nParagraph 2: ERM: An ERM requires an integrated risk organization, which normally means that a centralized risk management unit has to report to the CEO and the board of directors. The chief risk officer in an ERM is responsible for knowing and gathering information over all the different aspects within an organization. He takes a portfolio view of all types of risks within the company. In an ERM approach, the use of insurance and alternative risk transfer products is only considered if the risk seemed undesirable or unwanted to the management. Integration of risk management in the whole company's business process becomes necessary. The ERM optimizes business performance by influencing different aspects like pricing and resource allocation. There are three major benefits connected to the use of the ERM approach and the CRO as liaison: Due to the fact that a CRO and an integrated team can better manage individual risks and interdependencies between these risks, the use of an ERM leads to increased organizational effectiveness. Apart from this fact, better risk reporting can be reached by prioritizing the content of risk reporting that should go to the different instances like the senior management or the board of directors. A side effect of this information prioritizing is much better transparency throughout the whole organization. Last but not least you can also reach a better overall business performance in the company. This is only possible if the risk management team uses an ERM approach and supports key management decisions like pricing, product development or Mergers and acquisitions. Given the support, there will be several benefits like increased earnings and improved shareholder value. An ERM can combine and integrate several risk silos into a firm-wide risk portfolio and can consider aspects such as volatility and correlation of all risk exposures. This can lead to a maximization of the diversification's benefits.\n\nParagraph 3: After he was released, in 1965, Brutus left South Africa on an exit permit, which meant he could never return home while the apartheid regime stayed in power. He went into exile in Britain, where he first met George Houser, the Executive Director of the American Committee on Africa (ACOA).  South Africa made a concerted effort to get reinstated to the Olympic Games in Mexico City in 1968. Its Prime Minister John Vorster outlined a new policy of fielding a multi-racial team.  At first the IOC accepted this new policy and was going to allow South Africa to compete, but SANROC pointed out that there would be no mixed sporting events within South Africa and therefore all South African athletes chosen for the Games would be chosen under a segregated framework. In 1967, Brutus came to the United States under the auspices of the ACOA on a speaking tour, where he acquainted Americans more closely with the present situation in South Africa, informed American sports organisations about the segregated conditions that South African athletes must endure, and raised money to support the ACOA's Africa Defense and Aid Fund to support the defence of those charged under the apartheid laws.  The Supreme Council for Sport in Africa which represented the independent African nations at the IOC threatened to boycott if South Africa was included in the 1968 Games. In co-operation with SANROC, the ACOA organised a boycott of American athletes in February 1968.  Jackie Robinson, the first African American athlete to break the colour barrier in major league baseball, published a statement calling for continued suspension of South Africa from the Olympic Games. As a result of the international pressure, the IOC relented and kept South Africa out of the Olympic Games from 1968 until 1992.\n\nParagraph 4: ERM: An ERM requires an integrated risk organization, which normally means that a centralized risk management unit has to report to the CEO and the board of directors.

Integration of risk management in the whole company's business process becomes necessary. The ERM optimizes business performance by influencing different aspects like pricing and resource allocation. There are three major benefits connected to the use of the ERM approach and the CRO as liaison: Due to the fact that a CRO and an integrated team can better manage individual risks and interdependencies between these risks, the use of an ERM leads to increased organizational effectiveness. Apart from this fact, better risk reporting can be reached by prioritizing the content of risk reporting that should go to the different instances like the senior management or the board of directors. A side effect of this information prioritizing is much better transparency throughout the whole organization. Last but not least you can also reach a better overall business performance in the company. This is only possible if the risk management team uses an ERM approach and supports key management decisions like pricing, product development or Mergers and acquisitions. Given the support, there will be several benefits like increased earnings and improved shareholder value. An ERM can combine and integrate several risk silos into a firm-wide risk portfolio and can consider aspects such as volatility and correlation of all risk exposures. This can lead to a maximization of the diversification's benefits.\n\nParagraph 17: After he was released, in 1965, Brutus left South Africa on an exit permit, which meant he could never return home while the apartheid regime stayed in power. He went into exile in Britain, where he first met George Houser, the Executive Director of the American Committee on Africa (ACOA).  South Africa made a concerted effort to get reinstated to the Olympic Games in Mexico City in 1968. Its Prime Minister John Vorster outlined a new policy of fielding a multi-racial team.  At first the IOC accepted this new policy and was going to allow South Africa to compete, but SANROC pointed out that there would be no mixed sporting events within South Africa and therefore all South African athletes chosen for the Games would be chosen under a segregated framework. In 1967, Brutus came to the United States under the auspices of the ACOA on a speaking tour, where he acquainted Americans more closely with the present situation in South Africa, informed American sports organisations about the segregated conditions that South African athletes must endure, and raised money to support the ACOA's Africa Defense and Aid Fund to support the defence of those charged under the apartheid laws.  The Supreme Council for Sport in Africa which represented the independent African nations at the IOC threatened to boycott if South Africa was included in the 1968 Games. In co-operation with SANROC, the ACOA organised a boycott of American athletes in February 1968.  Jackie Robinson, the first African American athlete to break the colour barrier in major league baseball, published a statement calling for continued suspension of South Africa from the Olympic Games. As a result of the international pressure, the IOC relented and kept South Africa out of the Olympic Games from 1968 until 1992.", "answers": ["3"], "length": 5177, "dataset": "passage_count_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "b663180eb540c7a1cfecc13b032d5e636bd71e8247925ad2"}
{"input": "", "context": "Paragraph 1: In January 1942, SS-Untersturmführer Herbert Andorfer was appointed to replace the inexperienced Enge as commander of the camp. Enge was subsequently made Andorfer's deputy. That month, German military authorities demanded the camp be cleared of Jews in order to accommodate the growing number of captives taken in battles with the Partisans. By February the camp held about 6,500 inmates, ten percent of whom were Romani. In early March, Andorfer was informed that a gas van had been sent to the camp from Berlin. The Sauer van had been delivered upon the request of the German military administration chief in Serbia, Harald Turner. Stricken with guilt over having to play a central role in the murder of the Jewish inmates, some of whom he had developed good relations with, Andorfer requested a transfer; this was denied. In order to ensure the quickness and efficiency of the gassings, he made announcements intended to convince the prisoners that they were going to be transferred to another, better-equipped camp. He went so far as to post fictitious camp regulations, and announced that prisoners would be allowed to take their bags with them. Many detainees registered for the supposed transfer, hoping to escape the camp's terrible living conditions. Inmates who had volunteered to leave the previous evening climbed into the van the next day in groups of between 50 and 80. The drivers of the van, SS-Scharführers Meier and Götz, distributed candy to children in order to win their affection. Afterwards, the doors of the van were sealed shut. The van then followed a small car driven by Andorfer and Enge, before crossing the border into German-occupied Serbia. It was here that one of the drivers exited the van and crawled underneath it, diverting its exhaust into the interior of the vehicle and killing the inmates with carbon monoxide gas. The van was then taken to the Avala firing range, where corpses were dumped into mass graves freshly dug by Serbian and Romani prisoners. Such gassings became routine, and the gas van arrived every day except Sunday. Rumours quickly circulated about the gassings, with news reaching German troops stationed in Belgrade and even some Serbians. Consequently, the gas van was nicknamed the \"soul killer\" () by the Serb population exposed to these rumours. It is thought that the gassings took the lives of as many as 8,000 inmates, mostly women and children. The seven Serbian prisoners that had participated in unloading the murdered inmates from the van were shot after the gassings stopped, but the gravedigger, a Serb named Vladimir Milutinović, survived. \"Eighty-one or eighty-two trenches were prepared and I helped dig all of them,\" he recalled. \"At least 100 people [fit] into each trench [...] These ones were only for those suffocated in the truck. We dug a different set for those who were shot.\"\n\nParagraph 2: The 1976 season began with the Panthers ranked ninth in the AP preseason poll. The first game was at Notre Dame, where the Irish grew the grass long on the playing field in a failed attempt to slow down Dorsett, who had burned them for 303 rushing yards the year before. Their efforts were in vain as Dorsett ran for a 61-yard touchdown on Pitt's first play from scrimmage on the way to a 31–10 win. The season continued with a 42–14 win at Georgia Tech and a 36–19 win over Miami. On October 23, the Panthers travelled to Annapolis to face Navy during which Dorsett broke the NCAA career rushing record on a 32-yard touchdown run in Pitt's 45–0 victory. Dorsett's achievement prompted a mid-game celebration in which even Navy saluted the feat with a cannon blast. Pitt next defeated eastern rival Syracuse 23–13, and on November 6, number two ranked Pitt easily handled Army while number one ranked Michigan lost to Purdue. For the first time since 1939, the Pitt Panthers were the number one ranked team in the country. The following week, they successfully defended their top rating in a close Backyard Brawl against rival West Virginia. With a record of 10–0, the Panthers headed into their regular season finale with only heated instate rival Penn State standing in the way of Pitt's national title aspirations. At a packed Three Rivers Stadium on the day after Thanksgiving, the Nittany Lions held Dorsett to 51 yards in the first half and had the game tied 7-7. Majors adjusted for the second half by shifting Dorsett from tailback to fullback, enabling him to explode for an additional 173 yards as Pitt rolled to a 24–7 victory that capped an undefeated regular season. In December, Dorsett became the first Pitt Panther to win the Heisman Trophy as the nation's best college football player. Dorsett also won the Maxwell Award, the Walter Camp Player of the Year Award, and was named UPI Player of the Year. The 11-0 Panthers accepted an invitation to the 1977 Sugar Bowl to face second ranked Georgia. Pitt defeated the Bulldogs 27-3 and was voted number one in both the final Associated Press and Coaches polls, claiming their ninth national championship. This was Pitt's first undefeated national championship since 1937. The American Football Coaches Association (AFCA) named Majors the 1976 Coach of the Year. Following this historic season, Majors returned to his alma mater, the University of Tennessee, to take the head coaching job.\n\nParagraph 3: The 1936 United States House of Representatives elections were elections for the United States House of Representatives to elect members to serve in the 75th United States Congress. They were held for the most part on November 3, 1936, while Maine held theirs on September 14. They coincided with President Franklin D. Roosevelt's landslide re-election. Roosevelt's Democratic Party gained twelve net seats from the Republican Party, bringing them above a three-fourths majority. This was the largest majority since Reconstruction, as the last time a party won so decisively was in 1866. This is the last time any party held 3/4ths of all House seats. \n\nParagraph 4: Papalote has a long and rich history. The community, one of Bee County's oldest, was first settled on Papalote Creek and its name was reported to either be from a Karankawa word for \"kite\" or a Mexican Spanish word for \"windmill\" or \"powered by air\". Some of the community's first settlers included Robert Carlisle, Brigida Quinn Black, and brothers Patrick and William Quinn. These settlers immigrated from Ireland in 1828 and obtained land grants from Mexico. There were three separate communities in the area by 1857. The first one was Lower Papalote, also known as Steenville. This community had the first store that was owned by R.W. Steen, as well as a church, a post office, and a large Protestant population. The second one was Central Papalote, also known as Cravensville. This community developed around a lumber business that was started by Felix Hart. It was named Cravensville by the local Craven family. It was predominantly Catholic and the first Catholic church was built in 1871. A community center named Chattam Hall was built in 1900 on land donated by W.B. Hatch. The third one was Upper Papalote, also known as Murdock Place or Spangle Field. This community was the site of a store that was owned by Luke Hart on the south side of the creek from the other two communities. It is unknown if either Upper or Central Papalote was also known as Harts. The lower part of the Papalote community had residents move to nearby Mineral, and all three of these communities came together as one in the mid-1880s. Papalote had several saloons, churches, two stores, a meat market, a saddle shop, a gristmill, and a doctor in 1872. It held the most votes in Bee County until 1880. The community had several post offices. One named Papalota was in operation from 1860 to 1866 in Lower Papalote. Another one named Popolote opened in Central Papalote in 1870, renamed itself Papalote in 1883, and shut down in 1923. It reopened in 1926 and remained in operation until 1953. Mail was then delivered from Sinton. The San Antonio and Aransas Pass Railroad built a track through the community in 1886, on a right-of-way donated by Hatch. A depot was also built on the railroad and was then moved to Skidmore. That same year, the German-American Land Company bought land from Hatch and gave it to new settlers from Iowa and Hawaii. They planted orange orchards on their  of land. It all came to an end when a freeze destroyed the project, forcing residents to move to other communities and the land titles being returned to Hatch's possession. It was revived by a canning factory, a hotel, and a tinsmith and blacksmith shop in 1910, but with no further development. A hurricane destroyed Papalote's Baptist church in 1919. It had a population of 52 in 1890, 134 in 1904, and 50 in the 1930s. There were several scattered homes in the area in 1936 and had three businesses, Chattam Hall, and a cemetery on the south side of Papalote Creek at the site of the former Upper Papalote in 1983. The community's population was 70 from 1968 through 2000.\n\nParagraph 5: The first half of the 19th century saw the heyday of the Qing order. Both Inner and Outer Mongolia continued to supply the Qing armies with cavalry, although the government had tried to keep the Outer Mongols apart from the empire's wars in that century. Since the dynasty placed the Mongols well under its control, the government no longer feared of them. At the same time, as the ruling Manchus had become increasingly sinicized and population pressure in China proper emerged, the dynasty began to abandon its earlier attempts to block Han Chinese trade penetration and settlement in the steppe. After all, Han Chinese economic penetration served the dynasty's interests, because it not only provided support of the government's Mongolian administrative apparatus, but also bound the Mongols more tightly to the rest of empire. The Qing administrators, increasing in league with Han Chinese trading firms, solidly supported Chinese commerce. There was little that ordinary Mongols, who remained in the banners and continued their lives as herdsmen, could do to protect themselves against the growing exactions that banner princes, monasteries, and Han creditors imposed upon them, and ordinary herdsmen had little resource against exorbitant taxation and levies. In the 19th century, agriculture had been spread in the steppe and pastureland was increasingly converted to agricultural use. Even during the 18th century growing number of Han settlers had already illegally begun to move into the Inner Mongolian steppe and to lease land from monasteries and banner princes, slowing diminishing the grazing areas for the Mongols' livestock. While alienation of pasture in this way was largely illegal, the practice continued unchecked. By 1852, Han Chinese merchants had deeply penetrated Inner Mongolia, and the Mongols had run up unpayable debts. The monasteries had taken over substantial grazing lands, and monasteries, merchants and banner princes had leased many pasture lands to Han Chinese as farmland, although there was also popular resentment against oppressive taxation, Han usurpers, shrinkage of pasture, as well as debts and abuse of the banner princes' authority. Northern parts of what are today's Chinese provinces of Shaanxi, Shanxi and Hebei were ethnically cleansed of Mongols, with the erasing of nomadic minorities legacies in these regions so as to dispel the notion of borderlands as traditionally Mongolian inhabited. Increasingly during the nineteenth century, the Manchurians were becoming increasingly sinicized themselves, and faced with the Russian threat, they began to encourage Han Chinese farmers to settle in both Mongolia and Manchuria. This policy was followed by subsequent governments. The railroads that were being built in these regions were especially useful to the Han Chinese settlers. Land was either sold by Mongol Princes, or leased to Han Chinese farmers, or simply taken away from the nomads and given to Han Chinese farmers. Many impoverished Mongols also began to take up farming in the steppe, renting farmlands from their banner princes or from Han merchant landlords who had acquired them for agriculture as settlement for debts. Qing rule with tacit continuous Han illegal settlement over the 18th and 19th centuries, had led to a wave of incidents culminating in Mongol ethnic cleansing and displacement.\n\nParagraph 6: The first half of the 19th century saw the heyday of the Qing order.

In June 2015, it served over 108,000 student members in over 2,200 chapters in the United States and in 20 foreign countries. Its main goals are to inspire keen interest in mathematics, develop strong scholarship in the subject, and promote the enjoyment of mathematics in high school and two year college students. The name is a rough transliteration of math into Greek (Mu Alpha Theta). Buchholz High School won first place in 2022 for the 14th time in the annually held national convention.\n\nParagraph 8: At the time of Bruce's service in Malta, British soldiers suffered an outbreak of what was called the Malta fever. The disease caused undulant fever in man and of abortion in goats. It is transmitted by goat milk. In 1886, Bruce led the Malta Fever Commission that investigated the epidemic. Between 1886 and 1887, he studied five patients having Malta fever who died of the disease. From the spleen of corpses, he recovered a bacterium which he referred to as Micrococcus, which he described:When a minute portion taken from one of these [culture] colonies is placed in a drop of sterilized water and examined under a high power [of microscope], innumerable small micrococci are seen. They are very active, and dance about—as a rule singly, sometimes in pairs, rarely in short chains.Bruce's assistant, Surgeon Captain Matthew Louis Hughes named the disease \"undulant fever\" and the bacterium, Micrococcus melitensis. The source of the infection was not clear, Hughes believing it to come from soil and the bacterium inhaled from the air. Bruce reported the discovery in The Practitioner in 1887 with the conclusion:I think it will appear to be sufficiently proved: (a) that there exists in the spleen of cases of Malta fever a definite micro-organism; and (b) that this micro-organism can be cultivated outside the human body. On the latter point I may remark that I have already cultivated four successive generations. It now remains to be seen what effect, if any, this micro-organism has on healthy animals; what are the conditions of temperature, &c., under which it flourishes; where it is to be found; how it gains entrance to its human host; and many other points. All of these will take a long time to investigate. I have therefore published this preliminary note in order to draw the attention of other workers to what seems to me to be an attractive field.He was correct in his prediction that it was only in 1905 goat milk was established as the source of the infection. The discovery that the disease was transmitted from goat milk was generally attributed to Bruce himself. But an analysis of historical record in 2005 revealed that Themistocles Zammit, one of the members of the commission, was the one who experimentally demonstrated the origin of the bacterium from goat milk.\n\nParagraph 9: In January 1942, SS-Untersturmführer Herbert Andorfer was appointed to replace the inexperienced Enge as commander of the camp. Enge was subsequently made Andorfer's deputy.

{"input": "", "context": "Paragraph 1: Abernethy completed his Moscow assignment in 1994 and subsequently retired from NBC. He spent the next three years developing Religion & Ethics NewsWeekly for PBS. Using his personal background as part of a family of Northern Baptist ministers, his education at Yale Divinity and having covered religion stories for NBC, Abernethy crafted the program to fill a void in objective reporting of faith-based issues in American television. Religion & Ethics NewsWeekly premiered in September 1997, produced by WNET in New York City and underwritten primarily by a $5 million grant from the Lilly Endowment. An executive there said it was ''one of the largest amounts our religion program has ever made to a single project.''\n\nParagraph 2: In 1809, when William W. Stewart visited and mapped the island that was later named after him, he named the small bay \"South Port\". Later, it was renamed \"Port Pegasus\" to commemorate the Pegasus, Stewart's ship. The brig Pegasus was the former Pegaso, captured at the Peruvian port of Trujillo on 28 July 1807 by the British frigate , commanded by Captain Charles James Johnston, during a cruise against Spanish shipping and ports along the coasts of Spanish America. Johnston dispatched the Pegaso to Port Jackson, where she arrived at the end of October. Submitted to the Court of Admiralty in Sydney, the Pegaso, was condemned as a prize on 24 January 1808 and sold off, renamed Pegasus. A few months later she was acquired by Thomas Moore and in May of that year she was made ready to go on the sealing trade to the southern part of New Zealand. This expedition took place between August 1808 and March 1809, when Pegasus was commanded by Captain Eber Bunker.  Pegasus went on a second expedition under the command of Samuel Chase from Port Jackson to London by way of the sealing grounds in southern New Zealand from May 1809 to August 1810: William Stewart was first officer and made charts of the New Zealand coast, including Stewart Island, which was subsequently named after him. It appears to have been Jules de Blosseville who first applied the name Port Pegasus to South Port, on his 1824 Carte de la côte méridionale de l'île de Tawaï-Poénammou (Nouvelle-Zélande); Blosseville was an officer on the expedition of the corvette Coquille commanded by Louis Isidore Duperrey. Duperrey's expedition did not visit the southern part of New Zealand but Jules Alphonse Rene Poret de Blosseville compiled several charts of parts of New Zealand including charts of the southern part of the South Island, from information received when the Coquille called at Sydney. De Blosseville obtained most of his information about southern areas from Captain William Edwardson of the sloop Snapper but he also questioned captains of sealing vessels regarding New Zealand. Several charts of parts of New Zealand compiled by de Blosseville were included in the atlas dated 1827 published to accompany the account of Duperrey's voyage, Voyage autour du monde executé par ordre du Roi sur la corvette La Coquille pendant les années 1822…1825, Paris, 1826). In the title of Carte de la cote meridionale de l'lle de Tawai-Poenammou... de Blosseville acknowledged the chart was drawn from original work by Captain Edwardson. \n\nParagraph 3: As the school expanded and added a secondary school, it moved into a new building at 66 Bond Street, which was designed by the ecclesiastical architect James Haffa and opened in 1950. In 1955, the school was granted affiliation with the Pontifical Institute of Sacred Music, becoming one of six choirs and choir schools in the world to share this affiliation. The affiliation authorized St. Michael's Choir School to grant the degree of Bachelor of Sacred Music, with a specialization in Gregorian chant. In 1966, St. Michael's Choir School entered into an agreement with the Toronto Catholic District School Board, then called the Metropolitan Separate School Board, to place secular, non-music courses under the publicly funded Catholic school system. In 1975, the secondary school expanded further and moved to 69 Bond Street. By 1987, the school was fully funded by government with the exception of its music program, for which students continue to pay fees. In 1987, St. Michael's Choir School celebrated its fiftieth anniversary, and in recognition of this milestone, Toronto mayor Art Eggleton declared June 15, 1987 as the official \"St. Michael's Choir School Day.\" In 1996, the elementary school moved into a renovated building at 67 Bond Street and left 66 Bond Street as an administrative building, auditorium, and rehearsal space for the school's music division.\n\nParagraph 4: Abernethy completed his Moscow assignment in 1994 and subsequently retired from NBC.

The Bussell brothers Charles, Lenox and Alfred then got together with the Chapmans and took various steps to retaliate and locate the suspected perpetrator, a Noongar warrior called Gaywal; including taking four Noongar women and a child hostage for a day. The young warrior who threw the spears was Knockindon, a Wardandi man whose land the Bussells were occupying. On 24 July Vernon returned from Perth with the year's rations. On 30 July shouting was heard down at the estuary, and the Bussells, Dawson and other settler men armed themselves and headed down there. They shot and killed at least six people. Bessie Bussell wrote \"Three women, one man, one boy are known to be dead, but more are supposed to be dying.\" Three days later the Bussell brothers buried the bodies when they realised that Noongar people were not going to come back for their dead. Lenox refused to do a report on this incident to the resident magistrate John Molloy.

XXII of file D of his catalogue), indicated that Diston introduced this variety in Tenerife in 1824:\"Dwarf banana. Musa Cavendish. It is fair to honour here the memory of the man who provided us with such a pleasant benefit. In the year 1824, Mr. Alfred Diston, a curious Scotsman who grew up in Puerto de la Cruz, on a trip to his homeland Scotland, saw the dwarf banana from the East Indies—whose botanical name is Musa Cavendish—in the garden of Sir Thomas Hempburen and took a plant that he brought to Tenerife, where it has proliferated admirably, inasmuch as it has three advantages over the plantains or bananas that we have previously known, they are: less risk of the winds affecting its growth, due to its short elevation and the sturdiness of its trunk; it reaches its full growth before the others, and it also produces a larger cluster. Although the bananas are somewhat thinner, some prefer its delicate taste to that of our primitive banana. The desire and impatience to multiply this admirable plant everywhere caused someone to steal the crop that Mr. Diston had in his orchard in Cueva del Pino in 1853, a violent procedure worthy of punishment, if those responsible for the deed had been discovered. El Eco del Comercio (no. 167)  published the news of the introduction of this tree in the Canary Islands, as it has been said\".This same chronicler in his annals of 1853  also collected the news published on 12 November 1853 by this newspaper from Tenerife. The newspaper reported that “seven years earlier”, in 1846, Alfred Diston introduced the variety of Musa Cavendish in Puerto de La Orotava:BANANAS. We do not want to conclude this article without expressing some recent observations on a species of dwarf bananas native to Cochinchina that Mr. Alfred Diston introduced in these islands about seven years ago. This excellent fruit of rich and exquisite flavour has propagated extraordinarily in La Orotava, and even in this capital; whether it be because it is preferable to those of a more ordinary sort, because it lacks sapwood, or because of its yield: some bunches weighed 73 pounds and had 255 bananas each. This species is known by the scientific name of Musa Cavendishia, but the most peculiar thing is that said plant, native to warm regions or at least with very mild weather, was brought to these islands from Scotland by Mr. Diston, who obtained three original seedlings from the greenhouse of Sir Thomas Hepburer (sic) that have successfully proliferated in our country. \n\nParagraph 7: Researcher Iain R. Williamson, in his 1998 paper \"Internalized Homophobia and Health Issues Affecting Lesbians and Gay Men\" finds the term homophobia to be \"highly problematic\" but for reasons of continuity and consistency with the majority of other publications on the issue retains its use rather than using more accurate but obscure terminology. The phrase internalized sexual stigma is sometimes used in place to represent internalized homophobia. An internalized stigma arises when a person believes negative stereotypes about themselves, regardless of where the stereotypes come from. It can also refer to many stereotypes beyond sexuality and gender roles. Internalized homophobia can cause discomfort with and disapproval of one's own sexual orientation. Ego-dystonic sexual orientation or egodystonic homophobia, for instance, is a condition characterized by having a sexual orientation or an attraction that is at odds with one's idealized self-image, causing anxiety and a desire to change one's orientation or become more comfortable with one's sexual orientation. Such a situation may cause extreme repression of homosexual desires. In other cases, a conscious internal struggle may occur for some time, often pitting deeply held religious or social beliefs against strong sexual and emotional desires. This discordance can cause clinical depression, and a higher rate of suicide among LGBT youth (up to 30 percent of non-heterosexual youth attempt suicide) has been attributed to this phenomenon. Psychotherapy, such as gay affirmative psychotherapy, and participation in a sexual-minority affirming group can help resolve the internal conflicts, such as between religious beliefs and sexual identity. Even informal therapies that address understanding and accepting of non-heterosexual orientations can prove effective. Many diagnostic \"Internalized Homophobia Scales\" can be used to measure a person's discomfort with their sexuality and some can be used by people regardless of gender or sexual orientation. Critics of the scales note that they presume a discomfort with non-heterosexuality which in itself enforces heternormativity.\n\nParagraph 8: A second massacre followed in July 1837.

He returned from his suspension on December 17 against the Los Angeles Clippers, putting up 18 points and 12 rebounds in a 120–99 loss. Ayton was later immediately sidelined for the next five games due to a sprained right ankle before returning again, this time coming off the bench, on December 30 in a 122–116 win over the Portland Trail Blazers. He returned as a starter proper, albeit as a power forward, on January 3, 2020 in a 120–112 win over the New York Knicks. After a few more games, Ayton became the team's starting center again on January 16. That night, he scored 26 points and grabbed a career-high 21 rebounds in a 121–98 win over the Knicks. He became the first Suns player since Steve Nash to put up a 20/20 kind of game for the team (first player since Amar'e Stoudemire in terms of points and rebounds specifically), as well as the youngest player to have 25+ points and 20+ rebounds in the Madison Square Garden. On January 28, Ayton scored a season-high 31 points in a 133–104 win over the Dallas Mavericks. Two days later, Ayton was announced to return to the Rising Stars Challenge for the World Team; he joined only Amar'e Stoudemire and Devin Booker as announced participants in the event for the Suns as both a rookie and sophomore, though he would not play due to a left ankle injury, eventually being replaced by Nicolò Melli. On February 8, Ayton scored 28 points and grabbed 19 rebounds in a loss to the Denver Nuggets. He became the quickest player in franchise history to reach 1,000 rebounds at 94 games, as well as the fourth-quickest player to reach 1,000 since 1992. Ayton later matched his performance of 28 points and 19 rebounds on February 22 in a 112–104 win over the Chicago Bulls. After getting an ankle injury on March 3 against the Toronto Raptors, Ayton returned to play in the resumed season's bubble games on July 31, getting 24 points (including 2/3 three-point shooting for his first professional three-pointers made) and 12 rebounds in a 125–112 win over the Washington Wizards. He started in 7 of the team's 8 games in the 2020 NBA Bubble to give them a perfect 8–0 record there, giving the Suns their first 8-game winning streak since the 2009–10 season, ending their regular season with a 34–39 record.\n\nParagraph 16: Meanwhile, Stan and Ollie visit the beer garden with their wives and are indignantly asked to pay the bill by, to-them unknown, Alice and Lily, whom Alf and Bert left behind. This in turn angers Daphne and Betty. Under pressure, Ollie pays the bill run up by Alice and Lily and is mystifyingly given the ring left as security by Alf and Bert. Finn appears and shows a photo of Alf and Bert with some other young women to Daphne and Betty, who angrily leave the restaurant. Stan and Ollie, who are also angry, cause Finn to be beaten up by the landlord and the waiter, and he threatens revenge. Meanwhile, Alf and Bert are in Finn's quarters and decide to visit the landlord and ask for the ring. Having nothing to wear, they dress in blankets and scarves and are arrested. Stan and Ollie's wives, who had been informed by a spectator of the arrest of their \"husbands\", convince the judge to give them another chance. To celebrate, they go to a restaurant, where Stan and Ollie are already seated. Stan & Ollie and Alf & Bert do not notice each other. Ollie still has the ring and mistakenly puts it in Alf's pocket as he passes by, and later asks a bewildered Stan to give him back the ring. This is noticed by Mafia men, after which Stan and Ollie are kidnapped, taken to the waterfront and told to hand over the ring. The gangsters threaten to throw them off the dock in cement shoes. But the two manage to push their captors into the water and, after rocking wildly in the cement shoes, also fall into the water. Alf and Bert are nearby, hiding from the captain and Finn. They discover the ring in Alf's pocket and return it to the captain before rescuing Stan and Ollie from the water. The two pairs of twins happily reunite and decide to go explain the situation to Stan and Ollie's wives. Neither Stan nor Alf \"can see any further than the end of their nose\", agree Ollie and Bert, who promptly step off the dock and fall into the water.\n\nParagraph 17: Researcher Iain R.

After the occupation by German troops of the areas of Eastern Europe populated by Crimean Karaites, this appellation was observed by the German administration. They involved  three major historian specialists on the history of the Karaites: Zelig Kalmanovich, Meir Balaban and Yitzhak (Ignacy) Schiper. Despite the fact that all three had been before the war fierce opponents of the theory of the Turkic origin of the Crimean Karaites, they supported Shapshal's theory in order to save  the European Karaites from the Holocaust. Shapshal was instrumental in the formulation of Nazi policy towards the Karaims. As Hakham of Vilnius he was infamous for his confrontations with such Jewish community figures as Zelig Kalmanovich. He was also known for having been forced (under penalty of endangering his own community) to give the Nazis a detailed list of the members of the Crimean Karaites communities of Troki and Vilnius, allowing them to easily discover and arrest Jews who had forged papers stating that they were Crimean Karaites.\n\nParagraph 20: A second massacre followed in July 1837. On 13 July Dawson was speared in the arm by a Wardandi warrior, and Mrs Dawson had a spear thrown at her. This would have been in retaliation to the massacre on 27 June. The Bussell brothers Charles, Lenox and Alfred then got together with the Chapmans and took various steps to retaliate and locate the suspected perpetrator, a Noongar warrior called Gaywal; including taking four Noongar women and a child hostage for a day. The young warrior who threw the spears was Knockindon, a Wardandi man whose land the Bussells were occupying. On 24 July Vernon returned from Perth with the year's rations. On 30 July shouting was heard down at the estuary, and the Bussells, Dawson and other settler men armed themselves and headed down there. They shot and killed at least six people. Bessie Bussell wrote \"Three women, one man, one boy are known to be dead, but more are supposed to be dying.\" Three days later the Bussell brothers buried the bodies when they realised that Noongar people were not going to come back for their dead. Lenox refused to do a report on this incident to the resident magistrate John Molloy. Dawson submitted a report about his spearing instead.  \n\nParagraph 21: Famitsus reviewers each praised the gameplay, story, and the introduction of full-motion movies. One reviewer cited it as the series' new exemplar, while another pointed out rough edges in the graphical redesign and that the new 3D perspective made seeing some parts of the map difficult. 1UP.com's Shane Betternhausen was positive overall, saying \"[Path of Radiance] delivers a superbly paced and rewarding adventure\". RPGamer's Chris Privitere said \"While Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance doesn't necessarily add anything new to the tactical genre, it does everything very well\", recommending it to players while stressing the need for patience. Peer Schneider of IGN called the game \"yet another worthy installment in Intelligent Systems' venerable strategy RPG series\". RPGFan reviewer Mark Tjan said that while not the best Fire Emblem game he had played, \"it's certainly a good game and worth picking up if you're searching for an SRPG worth your time and money\". Nintendo World Report's Karl Castaneda was also highly positive, though commenting that its graphical quality were more suited to the early days of the GameCube's life and that it might have been a great success if released during that period. Eurogamer's Tom Bramwell, despite feeling that the game was flawed by inherent problems in the Fire Emblem formula, enjoyed the game and was willing to replay once he had finished. Greg Kasavin, writing for GameSpot, saying that \"by replacing the traditional random battles that typify most Japanese role-playing games with a fun and exciting turn-based combat system, and by going out of its way to deliver a memorable and genuinely emotional story, Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance accomplishes what all role-playing games attempt, but very few actually manage to do\".

{"input": "", "context": "Paragraph 1: Yesterday is plagued by a persistent cough and feelings of weakness. She goes to the local clinic, which is an extremely long walk for her and Beauty. She waits all day in the long queue to see the doctor, only to be turned away at the end of the day without having seen the doctor. She brushes it off, saying that she is not that ill. When Beauty finds her mother collapsed on the doorstep of their home, she runs to call her mother's friend, the teacher. Yesterday consults a traditional healer, but her teacher friend insists she return to the clinic. The teacher pays for a taxi to the clinic so that she can get there early enough to see the doctor; the teacher also takes care of Beauty for the day. The doctor who sees Yesterday asks her where she got her name from, and Yesterday explains that her father named her Yesterday because, \"He said things were better yesterday than today.\" The doctor tells Yesterday that her illness is AIDS-related and that she probably got it from her husband, who is away working in a mine. After hearing the news, Yesterday is very upset. Yesterday understands that she will die from this disease, leaving her daughter alone.\n\nParagraph 2: Yesterday is plagued by a persistent cough and feelings of weakness. She goes to the local clinic, which is an extremely long walk for her and Beauty. She waits all day in the long queue to see the doctor, only to be turned away at the end of the day without having seen the doctor. She brushes it off, saying that she is not that ill.

The setting is a large, fertile valley ideal for grazing cattle. Rancher Jacob W. Ewing's (Jason Robards) family has lived in the valley for generations, and his dream is to control all of it and preserve it from those - farmers and oilmen, for example - who would use the land for other purposes. Visiting J.W. is wealthy oil executive Neil Atkinson, whose late father was J.W.'s good friend and financial backer; the Atkinsons helped J.W. buy out neighboring ranchers, taking advantage of their financial problems (often with some \"persuasion\" from J.W.'s henchmen). The one remaining holdout is Ella Connors (Jane Fonda), whose family has ranched in the area for the last two generations and who relies on the family's aging but skillful cowhand Dodger (Richard Farnsworth). Another small player is war veteran Frank Athearn (James Caan) to whom Ella has sold a small plot of land to pay her bills. Ella and J.W. have some personal history which Ella prefers to put behind her, but which J.W. keeps bringing up. Although J.W. believes that Ella cannot survive another season financially, Ella and Frank, both of whom are committed to making a living ranching, enter into an uneasy alliance, especially after a dangerous incident precipitated by J.W. involving Frank and Frank's partner, fellow veteran Billy Joe Meynart (Mark Harmon). Neil, meanwhile, wants to explore the entire valley for oil, and uses his family's financial support to pressure J.W. into agreeing. Ella, Frank, and Neil soon discover that J.W. will go to any lengths to get what he wants.\n\nParagraph 4: Yesterday is plagued by a persistent cough and feelings of weakness.

Ewing's (Jason Robards) family has lived in the valley for generations, and his dream is to control all of it and preserve it from those - farmers and oilmen, for example - who would use the land for other purposes. Visiting J.W. is wealthy oil executive Neil Atkinson, whose late father was J.W.'s good friend and financial backer; the Atkinsons helped J.W. buy out neighboring ranchers, taking advantage of their financial problems (often with some \"persuasion\" from J.W.'s henchmen). The one remaining holdout is Ella Connors (Jane Fonda), whose family has ranched in the area for the last two generations and who relies on the family's aging but skillful cowhand Dodger (Richard Farnsworth). Another small player is war veteran Frank Athearn (James Caan) to whom Ella has sold a small plot of land to pay her bills. Ella and J.W. have some personal history which Ella prefers to put behind her, but which J.W. keeps bringing up. Although J.W. believes that Ella cannot survive another season financially, Ella and Frank, both of whom are committed to making a living ranching, enter into an uneasy alliance, especially after a dangerous incident precipitated by J.W. involving Frank and Frank's partner, fellow veteran Billy Joe Meynart (Mark Harmon). Neil, meanwhile, wants to explore the entire valley for oil, and uses his family's financial support to pressure J.W. into agreeing. Ella, Frank, and Neil soon discover that J.W. will go to any lengths to get what he wants.\n\nParagraph 27: Yesterday is plagued by a persistent cough and feelings of weakness. She goes to the local clinic, which is an extremely long walk for her and Beauty. She waits all day in the long queue to see the doctor, only to be turned away at the end of the day without having seen the doctor. She brushes it off, saying that she is not that ill. When Beauty finds her mother collapsed on the doorstep of their home, she runs to call her mother's friend, the teacher. Yesterday consults a traditional healer, but her teacher friend insists she return to the clinic. The teacher pays for a taxi to the clinic so that she can get there early enough to see the doctor; the teacher also takes care of Beauty for the day. The doctor who sees Yesterday asks her where she got her name from, and Yesterday explains that her father named her Yesterday because, \"He said things were better yesterday than today.\" The doctor tells Yesterday that her illness is AIDS-related and that she probably got it from her husband, who is away working in a mine. After hearing the news, Yesterday is very upset. Yesterday understands that she will die from this disease, leaving her daughter alone.\n\nParagraph 28: Yesterday is plagued by a persistent cough and feelings of weakness.

{"input": "", "context": "Paragraph 1: Kryl moved to Prague in 1968 as an assistant at Czechoslovak Television. In his spare time he performed his romantic and satiric folk songs in numerous small clubs. When the Warsaw Pact armies occupied Czechoslovakia on 21 August 1968 to suppress the Prague Spring reform movement, Kryl released his first album. The title song Bratříčku zavírej vrátka (Keep the Gate Closed, Little Brother) was composed spontaneously on 22 August 1968 as an immediate reaction to the occupation. The album described his perception of the inhumanity of the regime and his views on life under communist rule. The album, released in early 1969, was banned and removed from shelves shortly after, but this could not prevent the songs from getting around the audience and becoming cult hits.\n\nParagraph 2: The $10,000 prize winner is chosen by a three-member jury appointed by a selection committee composed of the Librarian of Congress, the Poet Laureate Consultant in Poetry, a publisher named by the Academy of American Poets and a literary critic nominated by the Bobbitt family. Awarded for \"the Most Distinguished Book of Poetry Published in 2006 or 2007, OR For Lifetime Achievement in Poetry\", nominations come from publishers, and is given only to living American poets. The criteria for the award are that a nomination must be a poet's first poetry book or a book composed of new work of any length. Collected or selected works qualify only if they include at least thirty new poems previously unpublished in book form  with prior publication in print media being acceptable.\n\nParagraph 3: Meanwhile, Murphy's performance has garnered unanimous praise. Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly highlighted Gothel as \"a firecracker\" amidst an otherwise \"sedate\" cast. Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal wrote that \"Donna Murphy does evil deliciously as the voice of Mother Gothel\", while Nows Norman Wilner felt that the actress successfully \"channelled\" Broadway actress Patti LuPone in her performance. Meanwhile, Tim Robey of The Daily Telegraph compared Murphy's performance to actress Julie Andrews, writing, \"the Julie-Andrews-on-stimulants vocal stylings of Broadway star Donna Murphy ... makes Mother Gothel into a memorable manipulative diva\". Joe Neumaier of the Daily News called Murphy's acting \"deliciously mischievous\". Meanwhile, Jonathan Crocker of Total Film wrote, \"Donna Murphy's vocal performance as the vain, villainous fake-matriarch is marvellous\", adding, \"her belted-out rendition of 'Mother Knows Best' is easily the film's top musical number\". Likewise, the Tampa Bay Times Steve Persall penned, \"Nobody but Murphy should be cast as Gothel\", continuing, \"her 'Mother Knows Best' is a knockout\". Simon Reynolds of Digital Spy felt that \"Donna Murphy steals the show\". Similarly dubbing Murphy a scene-stealer, Canoe.ca's Lindsey Ward wrote that \"Murphy ... turns into a giant spectacle with her voice, a powerful force to be reckoned with\". David Edelstein of Vulture.com hailed Murphy as \"Broadway's gift to animated movies\", praising in particular the actress' delivery of \"the movie's best line: \"Oh, so I'm the bad guy now?” Quickflix deemed Murphy \"wonderful\", while Stephen Witty of The Star-Ledger called her \"terrific\". Sandie Angulo Chen of Common Sense Media opined, \"As for the dramatic tension, it's best in the form of Mother Gothel – brilliantly played by Murphy, whose signature Broadway voice ... adds the necessary punch\". Chen added that Gothel \"is ... a personal favorite\" while comparing the character to Cher and actress Sophia Loren. The A.V. Clubs Tasha Robinson wrote that Gothel was \"magnificently voiced by star Murphy\". Murphy's performance of \"Mother Knows Best\" has also been very positively received, with critics again comparing the actress to Julie Andrews. While calling Gothel's voice \"to die for\", Peter Travers of Rolling Stone deemed her performance of the song \"comic bliss\". Linda Cook of the Quad-City Times penned that the song was \"belted out wonderfully by Murphy and makes the purchase of the soundtrack worthwhile\". Marjorie Baumgarten of The Austin Chronicle opined, \"Murphy brings stage showmanship to her musical interludes as Mother Gothel, which drip with sarcasm and biting wit.\" Slant Magazines Christian Blauvelt, who felt that the film's songs lacked as a result of Moore's \"pop-star vocals\", happened to very much enjoy Gothel's performances, writing, \"when Broadway vet Murphy takes to scaling Menken's octave-climbing melodies like a vocal escalator, it's a different story\". Calling Gothel \"one of the most potent schemers in the Disney canon\", Times Richard Corliss felt that Murphy's performance was worthy of a Tony Award for Best Actress, concluding, \"no one can summon the malice in humor, and the fun in pain, like this prima Donna\". In his review of the film's soundtrack, James Christopher Monger of AllMusic wrote that both \"Moore and Murphy take on the lion's share of the work here, and both deliver the goods\".\n\nParagraph 4: Around 1615 the first timbered mansion was erected by the crown.  1702 the second wooden manor with six wings, possibly designed by Johan Hårleman, was finished during the ownership of Emmanuel's nephew Charles.  In July 1719 Lövstabruk, along with most other locations of economic importance along the eastern coast of Uppland from Norrtälje to Harnäs bruk just south of Gävle, were burnt down by the northern half of a Russian fleet in an attempt by the Czar to move forward with the peace negotiations that were stalled by Sweden.  This effort was ill responded to by the unenterprising Swedish government in the political vacuum after the death of King Charles XII.  At first Charles de Geer was sceptical about rebuilding the ironworks in Lövstabruk, and considered giving up, going back to Wallonia.  However, his able manager Georg Svebilius, who had successfully saved Skebo bruk by a civil militia of his during his employment there, persuaded him to go on.  Within four years the ironworks was producing again, and in the 1730s the current Manor house, now built in stone with four wings, and other less important buildings were also reconstructed.  The baron Charles de Geer was bestowed head of county in addition to many years of tax exemption for his efforts.  Lövstabruk was made a fideicommiss during his ownership.  When the childless bachelor died after a stroke in 1730, his nephew Charles de Geer inherited Lövstabruk at an age of 10.  Charles studied entomology in the Netherlands, and was a reputed researcher in addition to running the ironworks from the age of 19.  He knew Olof Rudbeck and Carl von Linne, and started a famous scientific library in Lövstabruk, including the 'Flower Book', now owned by Carolina Rediviva, as well as an Aviary.  The Manor was improved upon during his ownership, primarily to the design of Jean Eric Rehn, the dining room perhaps being the most notable effort.  His son, also named Charles, preserved the estate while he concentrated upon his interest in politics, agitating against the king.  At the turn of the century the ironworks business went well, and the Manor was once more overhauled, this time by Isak Gustaf Clason.  As the economy turned worse again a planned overall renovation of all buildings in a Dutch renaissance style never took place, except for the new warehouse and the bookkeeper's lodge.\n\nParagraph 5: Producer Sean S. Cunningham originally conceived an action-horror film in which Jason Voorhees would battle Freddy Krueger of the A Nightmare on Elm Street series. Paramount Pictures, who had released the previous eight Friday the 13th films, negotiated with New Line Cinema over the rights to the series, and ultimately granted New Line rights to the Jason Voorhees character, but retained control of the Friday the 13th title. New Line placed Cunningham's idea for a Freddy-versus-Jason film on hold, prompting him to generate a different script to precede that plot line. Cunningham's original idea would later manifest as Freddy vs. Jason in 2003. The studio courted John McTiernan and Tobe Hooper to helm the film. Adam Marcus, who served as an apprentice for editor Susan E. Cunningham during post production for Friday the 13th Part 2, was brought in by Cunningham to direct the film under the notion that he must remove Jason's hockey mask. Cunningham has denied ever telling Marcus to \"find a way to get rid of that f**king mask\", however, Marcus rebukes Cunningham's claim and insists that he did not have that level of creative control. Cunningham had also demanded that the events of Friday the 13th Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan be ignored. The filmmaker's initial pitch saw Elias Voorhees, Jason's brother, digging up his body at the beginning of the film, eating his heart, taking on his supernatural powers and embarking on a similar killing spree. Jay Huguely was hired to flesh out Marcus' ideas into a script. According to Marcus, he had originally written the character of Steven Freeman to be Tommy Jarvis from part 4-6, but New Line Cinema only owned the rights to Jason and not Tommy and so could not legally use that character at the time. Marcus also explains that New Line Cinema did not own the Friday the 13th title, explaining why the film titles after Jason Takes Manhattan did not include the franchise name up until the 2009 remake.\n\nParagraph 6: Several infantry divisions re-instituted Recondo Schools in the post Vietnam era to better train more small unit combat arms leaders. Fort Carson, Colorado operated a Recondo school during the late 1960s and early 1970s.  Unique from other Recondo courses, Fort Carson took advantage of the mountainous terrain in the area and incorporated mountaineering training.  In 1973, Fort Carson closed the Recondo school, but retained the mountaineering cadre.  The mountaineering course and cadre were reassigned to the 1/10th Infantry Regiment, 4th Infantry Division, as a nod to the 10th Mountain Division, which had been created during World War II (1943) and inactivated in 1958 (reactivated later in 1985).  The 1/10th Infantry Mountaineering Course was four weeks in duration and was conducted off-post in Cheyenne Canyon.  Instruction included knot tying and rope management, balance climbing, roped climbing, rope bridges, rope traverses, and rappelling.  Most students were able to attain a climbing level of 5.4 or better by the end of the course.  The 9th Infantry Division ran a Recondo School from 1975 to 1978 which was 21 days long and included 272 hours of intense training. Originally the Recondo School was reserved for soldiers from the 1st Brigade of the 9th Infantry Division which was also known as the Recondo Brigade.  However, according to MG Volney F. Warner, the 2nd and 3rd Brigade commanders were constantly complaining because their NCO's would reenlist for the 1st Brigade and not for their present unit.  MG Warner finally relented and made the Recondo School open to all soldiers on Fort Lewis.  The training camp was located in a series of old railway cars which doubled as barracks for the students in a remote field location. The cadre were mainly composed of former senior members of the 2d Battalion (Ranger), 75th Infantry, a separate unit also located at Fort Lewis. The program of instruction included intense training in patrolling, ambushes, small unit tactics, first aid, rappelling, night navigation, riverine operations, and survival. Constant mental pressure was applied to each student at all times including 'salting' the railway cars with CS riot control crystal which were a continual skin irritant to the students. Intense physical training was provided with log drills running up and down a very steep hill leading down to the Puget Sound, long-distance formation runs averaging 7 minute miles with full equipment and rifles and intense periods of physical exercises.  Riverine and boat insertion tactics were taught and raft drills were conducted in the Puget Sound even in the middle of winter pushing the students to their absolute breaking point.  The final survival phase consisted of the killing of rabbits and chickens and a small steer to psychologically prepare the students to survive under the most austere of conditions. The 9th Division Recondo School was unique in that it was open to both men and women assigned to the post. However, there were no female graduates during the course's period of operations and the course averaged about a 90 percent attrition rate with about 40% of the losses among those who initially attempted the arduous physical fitness and water survival pre-tests and another 50% loss among those who actually began the course.  Most graduates ending up with a 20-pound weight loss. The final exercise normally included a platoon sized night raid on the old Fort Lewis Vietnam Village.  Graduates were awarded an arrowhead shaped badge with the arched letters RECONDO on the top which was worn on the right pocket of the fatigue shirt or left pocket of the dress green uniform.\n\nParagraph 7: The inverted pyramid marks the intersection of two main underground walkways beneath the Place du Carrousel and orients visitors towards the museum entrance under the Cour Napoléon. Tensioned against a ,  square steel caisson frame, the inverted pyramidal shape in laminated glass points downward towards the floor. The glass of the pyramid itself is  thick, while the glass above the pyramid at courtyard (ground) level, which must be able to support the weight of pedestrians, is  thick. The tip of the pyramid is suspended  above floor level.  Individual glass panes in the pyramid are connected by stainless-steel crosses  in length. After dark, the structure is illuminated by a frieze of spotlights.\n\nParagraph 8: The $10,000 prize winner is chosen by a three-member jury appointed by a selection committee composed of the Librarian of Congress, the Poet Laureate Consultant in Poetry, a publisher named by the Academy of American Poets and a literary critic nominated by the Bobbitt family.

The Han Dynasty scholar and poet Ma Rong (79–166 AD) mentioned in one of his poems of hammers 'pounding in the water-echoing caves'. As described in the Hou Han Shu, in 129 AD the official Yu Xu gave a report to Emperor Shun of Han that trip hammers were being exported from Han China to the Western Qiang people by way of canals through the Qilian Mountains. In his Rou Xing Lun, the government official Kong Rong (153–208 AD) remarked that the invention of the trip hammer was an excellent example of a product created by intelligent men during his own age (comparing the relative achievements of the sages of old). During the 3rd century AD, the high government official and engineer Du Yu established the use of combined trip hammer batteries (lian zhi dui), which employed several shafts that were arranged to work off one large waterwheel. In Chinese texts of the 4th century, there are written accounts of men possessing and operating hundreds of trip hammer machines, such as the venerable mathematician Wang Rong (died 306 AD), Deng Yu (died 326 AD), and Shi Chong (died 300 AD), responsible for the operation of hundreds of trip hammers in over thirty governmental districts throughout China. There are numerous references to trip hammers during the Tang Dynasty (618–907 AD) and Song Dynasty (960–1279), and there are Ming Dynasty (1368–1644) references that report the use of trip hammers in papermills of Fujian Province.\n\nParagraph 10: With his description, it is seen that the out-of-date Chinese term for pestle and mortar (dui, tui) would soon be replaced with the Chinese term for the water-powered trip-hammer (.

The Book of Mormon prophet Ether taught that a remnant of the house of Joseph would build a holy city in the Americas. Afterwards, there would be a New Jerusalem that would come down from heaven where the remnant would live. Latter Day Saints believe that this refers to the City of Enoch, and that it will return to the earth from heaven at the Second Coming. Later in the Book of Mormon timeline, Jesus visited the Nephites in the Americas and taught that they were a remnant of the house of Joseph. After they were brought to the knowledge of the Lord, they would be given the Americas as their inheritance. Repentant Gentiles will assist them in building the New Jerusalem. Early Latter Day Saints interpreted these scriptures to mean that there would be a sudden and dramatic conversion of the American Indians to Mormonism. They viewed themselves as repentant Gentiles that would assist the American Indians in building the New Jerusalem, They warned Americans who did not repent would be destroyed by the American Indians to make way for the New Jerusalem, based on a scripture in the Book of Mormon that warns the Gentiles to repent, \"lest a remnant of the seed of Jacob shall go forth among you as a lion, and tear you in pieces, and there is none to deliver.\"\n\nParagraph 13: On October 25, 2017, Prof. Ido Bruno was appointed Director of the Israel Museum in Jerusalem as the Anne and Jerome Fisher Director. Bruno served as a professor in the Industrial Design Department of the Bezalel Academy of Arts & Design, Jerusalem. He brings to the position decades of experience as a curator and designer of exhibitions presented in Israel and across the world with a focus on art, archeology, science, and history. He was unanimously elected by the museum's board of directors, chaired by Isaac Molho, following an extensive search and review process of candidates from Israel and abroad. Bruno assumed his position at the museum in November 2017.\n\nParagraph 14: Kryl moved to Prague in 1968 as an assistant at Czechoslovak Television.

After an appeal to the Board of Assessment Appeals to reverse their earlier decision was denied, the city appealed the Washington County Court of Common Pleas.  On August 5, 1994, Judge Thomas J. Terputac reversed the board's decision, ruling in Order No. 93-7033 that the college did not qualify for tax-exempt status.  According to the trial court, Washington & Jefferson College was not a \"purely public charity\", failing four of five criteria in the Hospital Utilization Project case.  Specifically, Judge Terputac opined that the college had been founded as a purely public charity, but had morphed into an \"enterprise of big business.\"  The college appealed to the Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court, which overturned Judge Terputac's decision on September 15, 1995, in a decision written by Judge James R. Kelley.  According to that court, Washington & Jefferson College did satisfy the requirements to be considered a \"purely public charity.\"  Judges Bernard L. McGinley, Doris A. Smith-Ribner, and Dan Pellegrini dissented.  The City of Washington appealed that decision to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, which affirmed the lower court's decision on November 20, 1997, in a decision written by Justice John P. Flaherty.  According to the court, the lower court was correct in concluding that the college did in fact satisfy the five requirements for an entity to be considered a \"purely public charity,\" a standard that was set out in the Hospital Utilization Project case: \"1) advance a charitable purpose; 2) donate or render gratuitously a substantial portion of its services; 3) benefit a substantial and indefinite class of persons who are legitimate subjects of charity; 4) relieve the government of some of its burden; and 5) operate entirely free from private profit motive.\"  The court said that \"the record demonstrates that W&J fulfills all of these requirements.\"  Most persuasive was the fact that the college's benefits were open to all and that those served were members of a charitable class.  The dissent by Justice Russell M. Nigro did not state that he thought that the college should not be tax-exempt, only that the rest of the court had \"so broadly construed its requirements that any private college or university can satisfy the test and obtain tax-exempt status.\"\n\nParagraph 16: In 1993, the Washington County Board of Assessment ruled that the 87 properties owned by the college were exempt from property and real estate taxes.

Nigro did not state that he thought that the college should not be tax-exempt, only that the rest of the court had \"so broadly construed its requirements that any private college or university can satisfy the test and obtain tax-exempt status.\"\n\nParagraph 17: In December, the deputies of the other provinces convened by the circular of May 27 arrived in Buenos Aires. Most of them were closer to the ideas of Saavedra, and Gregorio Funes became highly influential over them. They did not agree about which body they should join: the deputies wanted to join the Junta, while Moreno thought that they should start a constituent assembly. Funes, allied with Saavedra, calculated that they could stop Moreno by joining the Junta, as his proposals would be agreed to by a minority. The Junta, with both its original members and the deputies, discussed the topic on December 18. Funes said that Buenos Aires had no right to rule the other provinces without their consent, and got the support of the other members. He said that there was popular discontent with the Junta. The supporters of Moreno said that such discontent was only among some rebels, and Moreno said that it was only the discontent of the Patricians in respect of the Suppressions decree. However, only Paso voted with him, and the deputies joined the Junta. Moreno resigned, but his resignation was rejected. His opposition to the incorporation of the deputies is seen by some historians as an initial step in the conflict between Buenos Aires and the other provinces, which dominated politics in Argentina during the following decades. Some call it a precursor of the Unitarian Party, while others find his words or actions more consistent with the Federalist Party. However, historians Paul Groussac and Norberto Piñeiro feel it is inappropriate to extrapolate so far into the future. Piñeiro considered it an error to label Moreno as federal or unitary, proving that this organization been prioritized over the secondary aspect of centralism or federalism, while Groussac similarly notes that Moreno devoted all his energies to the immediate problem of achieving independence without giving much thought to possible long-term scenarios.\n\nParagraph 18: In December, the deputies of the other provinces convened by the circular of May 27 arrived in Buenos Aires.

A catalog that shows all these Lego figures is available. Some Lego sets from 1974 on included much larger figures where only the heads and hair were special pieces , which is why the usual figures are \"mini\". Technic used larger scale action figures between 1986 and 2001. These figures featured more realistic sculpts, although still distinctively angular, and featured more articulation, including bendable elbows and knees. These figures are further distinguished from minifigures in that they cannot be easily disassembled; even the hair pieces are non-removable. Duplo includes figures that have less articulation than standard minifigures and cannot be disassembled for safety reasons. Likewise, the Fabuland collection, produced in the 1980s, consisted of larger anthropomorphized animal characters, which also could not be easily disassembled. Belville and Scala, Lego products marketed to girls, also include larger scale figures. These figures are similar to Technic figures in articulation, but feature less angular body sculpts. Scala figures more closely resemble dolls, in that clothes are separate from the figures and hair is made of strands rather than molded plastic. The Lego Baby line included figures that could move at all and had the size a bit bigger than the Duplo figures. In 2001 Lego further expanded the minifigure system, with the introduction of Bionicle figures. These figures are a part of a fictional story developed by Lego and resemble biomechanical creatures. Initially, these figures were produced without articulation, only able to hold tools and weapons. Bionicle later got replaced with Hero Factory in 2010. In 2005, Lego released Bionicle playsets, with minifigure variations of characters that had previously been produced in the larger Bionicle scale, notably the Toa and Visorak characters. While these minifigures did not feature movable parts, Lego released Piraka and Inika playsets in 2006, which included minifigures with movable parts. The Friends theme, released in 2012, included mini-doll figures, a more doll-like construction with more realistic anatomy, soon introduced into other themes chiefly aimed at girls. Even though the mini-dolls in the Lego Friends theme have more realistic anatomy, the mini-dolls' legs can only move ninety degrees into a sitting position. The mini-dolls' legs are also molded together and can not move separately as the traditional Lego minifigure legs can. The mini-doll in the Lego Friends theme is slightly taller than the traditional minifigure.\n\nParagraph 9: The video begins with Ciara putting her Goodies CD in a radio, setting it to the \"1, 2 Step\" track, and pressing the play button.

By April 9, Florey had a draft of The Invisible Man co-written with Garrett Fort who had contributed to the scripts of both Dracula and Frankenstein. Based mostly on Wylie's The Murderer Invisible, their outline included plot elements such as an invisible octopus, invisible rats, and blowing up Grand Central Station. Unwilling to wait while Florey worked out the script and the film's technical difficulties, Universal made The Old Dark House (1932) Karloff's next feature with Whale as director. Whale had decided to return to horror features following the financial failure of his film The Impatient Maiden (1932). By June 1932, producer Sam Bischoff left Universal to set up his own independent studio. Florey accepted Bischoff's invitation to join him and also left Universal. By June 6, John L. Balderston, whose name had appeared in the credits of Dracula and Frankenstein, submitted a screenplay for The Invisible Man in collaboration with the film's new director Cyril Gardner. This was Balderston's third attempt at the script based primarily on Wylie's novel. In mid-1932, Universal writers John Huston and studio scenario editor Richard Schayer attempted new treatments for the film.

Since he was not re-elected in 1832, he was initially only able to complete only one term in Congress until March 3, 1833. This was marked by discussions about the policies of President Andrew Jackson. In these years, the Nullification Crisis reached its peak with the state of South Carolina. In 1834 Jenifer was re-elected to Congress in the seventh district of his state, where he was able to complete three more legislative periods between March 4, 1835, and March 3, 1841.

In Latin America, for example, women were 50% more likely to lose a job during the first months of the pandemic. Their main concerns are: more than half of women work on a temporary basis or in very low-quality conditions, so they are more likely to lose their jobs. Moreover, women tend to be employed in vulnerable sectors such as retail, restaurants and hospitality. They also often work in informal jobs, from selling wares on the streets to sewing at home, that lack protections such as paid sick leave or unemployment insurance. To this we must add that, with the closure of schools, many women have no one to leave their children with. Many migrant domestic workers have lost their jobs and, similarly, those working in Europe may be forced to return to their countries without any income. \"Stay at home\" has been a burden for women who have to take care of their children, elderly or other dependants. With home working, women are forced to take care of the home and their work responsibilities at the same time. It is women who mainly care for COVID patients, so their risk of infection increases. Most of the health sector is made up of women (nurses, auxiliaries, cleaners...), they work in precarious situations with low salaries, and, in addition, they do not have sufficient protections. It is the state that has to take charge of guaranteeing the basic rights of its citizens in order to create a more egalitarian post-pandemic scenario. Commissions formed by experts to advise governments have almost no women at all, when it is women who are on the front line. Experiences in past crises such as the Ebola crisis in conflict regions such as the Democratic Republic of Congo showed that school closures exacerbated inequalities, as girls are less likely to return to school than boys. They are also constrained in finding work or forced to take on extra household chores. The under-representation of women in informal and agricultural jobs can also exacerbate economic inequalities. In situations of fragility, conflict and violence, only 4 women out of 10 are formally employed, a figure that drops to 2 out of 10 in situations of ongoing conflict.\n\nParagraph 9: Embarrass has a humid continental climate (Köppen Dfb), bordering very closely on a subarctic climate (Dfc), with short, warm summers and long, bitterly cold winters. Summer nights remain cool despite the warm days. With an average annual temperature of , Embarrass is the coldest place in Minnesota. In winter 2000–2001, the temperature in Embarrass did not rise above freezing from November 24 to March 1; the high for meteorological winter (December to February) was 32 °F on January 10.

This line closed to passengers in 1951. Goods services were withdrawn from the end of 1968 and the track was lifted.  In the mid-1980s, the route was opened as a cycle path, now the Alban Way. The remains of the branch can be seen to the left of the single platform when looking down the line in the direction of Watford Junction, including overgrown remnants of the second platform which would have served the branch.\n\nParagraph 15: The series was designed as an educational program for children and teenagers, spotlighting historical figures and important events. Most episodes feature a standard formula of an elderly (93-year-old) Indiana Jones (played by George Hall) in present-day (1993) New York City encountering people who spur him to reminisce and tell stories about his past adventures. These stories would either involve him as a young boy (8 to 10, played by Corey Carrier) or as a teenager (16 to 21, played by Sean Patrick Flanery). The younger Indy would travel to different parts of the world with his parents and tutor. The older, teenaged Indy rebels against his father by joining the Belgian army. Using a fake name he fights both at Verdun and in Africa. He later becomes a spy. In one episode, a fifty-year-old Indy (played by Harrison Ford) is seen reminiscing. Initially, the plan was for the series to alternate between the adventures of Indy as a child (Corey Carrier) and as a teenager (Sean Patrick Flanery), but eventually the episodes featuring Flanery's version of the character dominated the series. The series' bookends revealed that the elderly Jones has a daughter, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren. There is no mention of a son, but in 2008, the film Kingdom of the Crystal Skull introduces Mutt Williams as his son with Marion Ravenwood.\n\nParagraph 16: The Latin American Council of Social Sciences (CLACSO) states that the burden of care falls on women and that the appearance of new gender divisions at work, as a result of this pandemic that we are having to live, are increasingly unsustainable.

{"input": "", "context": "Paragraph 1: The Dublin Fusiliers actively took part in the efforts to lift the Siege of Ladysmith, which lasted from 30 October 1899 to 28 February 1900. On 15 December the 2nd Dublins took part in the Battle of Colenso. The Dublins were part of the 5th Brigade (known as the Irish Brigade) who crossed the wrong part of the Tugela River and suffered heavy casualties in the process. The battle was a defeat for the British forces and became part of a notorious period for the British in the war, known as \"Black Week\". The defeat, however, did not discourage further attempts being made. The Dublins did not participate in any more attempts until January 1900 when they took part in the Tugela campaign, collectively known as the Battle of the Tugela Heights. February saw the Dublins take part in heavy fighting before, on 27 February, they supported the Royal Irish Fusiliers in their final charge on Pieters Hill, suffering heavy casualties though taking the position. This victory led to the siege of Ladysmith being lifted the following day by cavalry, with the main force of infantry arriving on 3 March. On 10 March 1900 Queen Victoria decreed that a sprig of shamrock be adorned on the headdress of Irish units on Saint Patrick's Day to commemorate their actions in South Africa. This tradition remains in existence with Irish units of the British Army.\n\nParagraph 2: Receptive bilinguals are those who can understand a second language but who cannot speak it or whose abilities to speak it are inhibited by psychological barriers. Receptive bilingualism is frequently encountered among adult immigrants to the U.S. who do not speak English as a native language but who have children who do speak English natively, usually in part because those children's education has been conducted in English; while the immigrant parents can understand both their native language and English, they speak only their native language to their children.  If their children are likewise receptively bilingual but productively English-monolingual, throughout the conversation the parents will speak their native language and the children will speak English. If their children are productively bilingual, however, those children may answer in the parents' native language, in English, or in a combination of both languages, varying their choice of language depending on factors such as the communication's content, context or emotional intensity and the presence or absence of third-party speakers of one language or the other. The third alternative represents the phenomenon of \"code-switching\" in which the productively bilingual party to a communication switches languages in the course of that communication.  Receptively bilingual persons, especially children, may rapidly achieve oral fluency by spending extended time in situations where they are required to speak the language that they theretofore understood only passively.  Until both generations achieve oral fluency, not all definitions of bilingualism accurately characterize the family as a whole, but the linguistic differences between the family's generations often constitute little or no impairment to the family's functionality. Receptive bilingualism in one language as exhibited by a speaker of another language, or even as exhibited by most speakers of that language, is not the same as mutual intelligibility of languages; the latter is a property of a pair of languages, namely a consequence of objectively high lexical and grammatical similarities between the languages themselves (e.g., Norwegian and Swedish), whereas the former is a property of one or more persons and is determined by subjective or intersubjective factors such as the respective languages' prevalence in the life history (including family upbringing, educational setting, and ambient culture) of the person or persons.\n\nParagraph 3: In 2002, an armed incident erupted between Morocco and Spain, regarding the uninhabited Perejil Island, located 250m off the Moroccan northern coast. On July 11, 2002 a group of Moroccan soldiers set up base on the islet, violating the status quo situation agreed between both States. The Moroccan government said that they set foot on the island in order to monitor illegal immigration, which was denied by the Spanish government since there had been little co-operation in the matter by that time (a repeated source of complaint from Spain). After protests from the Spanish government, led by José María Aznar, the soldiers were replaced by Moroccan navy cadets who then installed a fixed base on the island. On the morning of July 18, 2002 Spain launched a full-scale military operation to take over the island. The operation was successful and the Moroccan navy cadets were dislodged from the island in a matter of hours without offering any resistance to the Spanish Grupo de Operaciones Especiales (commando) attack force. The islet returned to its status quo situation and is now deserted. It is to highlight the mediation role offered by the United States, and the lack of collaboration of France towards its European allies during the crisis.\n\nParagraph 4: The chromatic number of a circle graph is the minimum number of colors that can be used to color its chords so that no two crossing chords have the same color. Since it is possible to form circle graphs in which arbitrarily large sets of chords all cross each other, the chromatic number of a circle graph may be arbitrarily large, and determining the chromatic number of a circle graph is NP-complete. It remains NP-complete to test whether a circle graph can be colored by four colors.  claimed that finding a coloring with three colors may be done in polynomial time but his writeup of this result omits many details.\n\nParagraph 5: Starting in the world of hip-hop in the late 1980s when they were only engaged breakdancing. In the early 1990s (1992) they had the opportunity to record what was the sequel to the explosion of Puerto Rican hip-hop, as it was the second production of \"the Noise.\" On this tape, they had the opportunity to record about ten minutes, a song that the audience welcomed well by the strong content that was talking about blunts, whores, a ton of bad words (that at that time no one heard of), about \"Guillaera\", \"Bellakeo\", \"Perreo\", things that were not common at that time was very extroverted and full of controversy. For the next years a tragedy, the murder of a close friend called Misael, is what motivates them to write a very deep song and had the opportunity to record it in \"The Noise 3\" and is nothing more than the song \"Amigo\" that was a hit and gave an incredible fame to \"Las Guanabanas\", because their lyrics were very mature for that time and for them that they were Teenagers. People who have follow them through their entire careers have truly seen what this singers have gone through and have seen their evolution in the world of Caribbean Hip-Hop, Rap and Reggaeton. In 1998 they released their first production \"Back To Reality\" in the hands of Dj Nelson and Flow Music. Then in 1999, they released the sequel \"Back to Reality 2\".\n\nParagraph 6: Her London début, as Rossane in Handel's Alessandro, took place on 5 May 1726, alongside Senesino and Cuzzoni. During the next two seasons she created four more Handel roles: Alceste in Admeto and Pulcheria in Riccardo Primo (both 1727), and Emira in Siroe and Elisa in Tolomeo (1728). She also sang in a revival of Radamisto, and in operas by Ariosti and Giovanni Bononcini. In a performance of the latter's Astianatte on 6 June 1727, a riot broke out in the audience between her followers and those of her 'rival' Cuzzoni in the King's Theatre, Haymarket,  in front of Caroline, Princess of Wales. This furore seized the public imagination and a great deal of journalistic exaggeration  – the pamphleteer John Arbuthnot published \"The DEVIL to pay at St. JAMES's: Or A full and true ACCOUNT of a most horrid and bloody BATTLE between Madam FAUSTINA and Madam CUZZONI\", in which he lambasted the two ladies: \"TWO of a Trade seldom or ever agree … But who would have thought the Infection should reach the Hay-market and inspire Two Singing Ladies to pull each other's Coiffs, to the no small Disquiet of the Directors, who (God help them) have enough to do to keep Peace and Quietness between them. … I shall not determine who is the Aggressor, but take the surer Side, and wisely pronounce them both in Fault; for it is certainly an apparent Shame that two such well bred Ladies should call Bitch and Whore, should scold and fight like any Billingsgates.\" Recent research has shown, however, that it was the singers' supporters who were behaving badly, rather than the singers themselves, who had worked together before in Italy and continued to work together for the Royal Academy until the directors were forced to dissolve it in 1728 owing to mounting debts.\n\nParagraph 7: Marjory LeBreton  (born July 4, 1940) is a Canadian former leader of the Government in the Senate of Canada, a cabinet-rank position; and past national chair of Mothers Against Drunk Driving in Canada. She worked with four leaders of the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada - John Diefenbaker, Robert Stanfield, Joe Clark and Brian Mulroney - from 1962 to 1993 before being appointed to the Senate on the advice of Mulroney.  She sat as a Progressive Conservative Senator from her appointment until moving with most of her caucus colleagues to the new Conservative Party of Canada in 2004, of which she was soon elected to Chief Whip.  She served as an advisor to then opposition leader Stephen Harper during the 2006 election, which the Conservative Party won.  After the election, she was named to the cabinet position Leader of the Government in the Senate. On July 4, 2013, LeBreton announced she would not continue in the position as of the next cabinet shuffle, which occurred later that summer. She retired from the Senate upon reaching her 75th birthday on July 4, 2015.\n\nParagraph 8: On Day 9, two of the top three seeds, and the two finalists from the previous year, Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic, were severely tested. Federer, aiming for his fifth consecutive Open title, was playing twenty-sixth seed Igor Andreev in one of the scheduled night matches on the Arthur Ashe Stadium; he was victorious in five sets, 6–7(5), 7–6(5), 6–3, 3–6, 6–3. Federer struggled to break Andreev's serve in the opening two sets, whereas Andreev broke Federer in the first game of the first, and had seven break points in the early games of the second (Andreev had a low success rate overall, only taking advantage of two out of fifteen break points in the whole match). In the final set Andreev, at 4–2 down, had five further break point opportunities, but failed to convert any as Federer served out the match. Djokovic was also pushed to five sets, defeating fifteenth seed Tommy Robredo 4–6, 6–2, 6–3, 5–7, 6–3 in nearly four hours. Robredo broke Djokovic's serve at 4–4 the first set, before Djokovic won sets two and three with some ease. However, after having broken serve in the fourth, Robredo levelled the match at 3–3, prompting the number three seed to smash his racket, and be the subject of booing from sections of the crowd. Djokovic failed to convert break points at 5–5, allowing Robredo to forge a break of his own and take it to a fifth set. Djokovic was able to close out the match after breaking at 2–2 in the final set. Djokovic was beset by problems related to both a hip injury (for which he required two time-outs) and exhaustion, having been unable to sleep until 4.30 am (UTC−5) on Day 8 after his match with Marin Čilić. Robredo responded by saying, \"I think that if you're not fit enough, then don't play.\" Djokovic set up a tie with sixth seed Andy Roddick, who easily beat eleventh seed and Olympic silver medalist Fernando González 6–2, 6–4, 6–1; 2003 champion Roddick acknowledged that he would have to complete an upset to defeat Djokovic, despite Djokovic's admission that whomever he faced in the next round would be a fitter opponent. Gilles Müller continued his unexpected run, as he defeated fifth seed Nikolay Davydenko in a demanding match that finished 6–4, 4–6, 6–3, 7–6(10). Müller, who served twenty aces, became the lowest-ranked player, at world number 130, to reach the quarterfinals of the Open since Nicolas Escudé (rank 136) in 1999, and the lowest-ranked at a Grand Slam tournament since Alexander Popp (rank 198) at Wimbledon 2003. He was also the first Luxembourgian to reach the quarterfinal stage of a Grand Slam.\n\nParagraph 9: The Dublin Fusiliers actively took part in the efforts to lift the Siege of Ladysmith, which lasted from 30 October 1899 to 28 February 1900. On 15 December the 2nd Dublins took part in the Battle of Colenso. The Dublins were part of the 5th Brigade (known as the Irish Brigade) who crossed the wrong part of the Tugela River and suffered heavy casualties in the process. The battle was a defeat for the British forces and became part of a notorious period for the British in the war, known as \"Black Week\". The defeat, however, did not discourage further attempts being made. The Dublins did not participate in any more attempts until January 1900 when they took part in the Tugela campaign, collectively known as the Battle of the Tugela Heights. February saw the Dublins take part in heavy fighting before, on 27 February, they supported the Royal Irish Fusiliers in their final charge on Pieters Hill, suffering heavy casualties though taking the position. This victory led to the siege of Ladysmith being lifted the following day by cavalry, with the main force of infantry arriving on 3 March. On 10 March 1900 Queen Victoria decreed that a sprig of shamrock be adorned on the headdress of Irish units on Saint Patrick's Day to commemorate their actions in South Africa. This tradition remains in existence with Irish units of the British Army.\n\nParagraph 10: Starting in the world of hip-hop in the late 1980s when they were only engaged breakdancing. In the early 1990s (1992) they had the opportunity to record what was the sequel to the explosion of Puerto Rican hip-hop, as it was the second production of \"the Noise.\" On this tape, they had the opportunity to record about ten minutes, a song that the audience welcomed well by the strong content that was talking about blunts, whores, a ton of bad words (that at that time no one heard of), about \"Guillaera\", \"Bellakeo\", \"Perreo\", things that were not common at that time was very extroverted and full of controversy. For the next years a tragedy, the murder of a close friend called Misael, is what motivates them to write a very deep song and had the opportunity to record it in \"The Noise 3\" and is nothing more than the song \"Amigo\" that was a hit and gave an incredible fame to \"Las Guanabanas\", because their lyrics were very mature for that time and for them that they were Teenagers. People who have follow them through their entire careers have truly seen what this singers have gone through and have seen their evolution in the world of Caribbean Hip-Hop, Rap and Reggaeton. In 1998 they released their first production \"Back To Reality\" in the hands of Dj Nelson and Flow Music.

There he met Bobby Bradford in 1965, with whom he subsequently worked on a number of projects, notably the New Jazz Art Ensemble. He also played with Hampton Hawes and Harold Land. In the 1970s Carter became well known on the basis of his solo concerts. At New Jazz Festival Moers in 1979, he and the German clarinet player Theo Jörgensmann performed on three days. Afterwards Carter received complimentary reviews and wide recognition from around the world. He and Jörgensmann met again in 1984. The program of the Berlin JazzFest was built around the clarinet. After Carter's solo performance, he and Jörgensmann also played together.\n\nParagraph 16: On Day 9, two of the top three seeds, and the two finalists from the previous year, Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic, were severely tested.

He was also the first Luxembourgian to reach the quarterfinal stage of a Grand Slam.\n\nParagraph 17: Receptive bilinguals are those who can understand a second language but who cannot speak it or whose abilities to speak it are inhibited by psychological barriers. Receptive bilingualism is frequently encountered among adult immigrants to the U.S. who do not speak English as a native language but who have children who do speak English natively, usually in part because those children's education has been conducted in English; while the immigrant parents can understand both their native language and English, they speak only their native language to their children.  If their children are likewise receptively bilingual but productively English-monolingual, throughout the conversation the parents will speak their native language and the children will speak English. If their children are productively bilingual, however, those children may answer in the parents' native language, in English, or in a combination of both languages, varying their choice of language depending on factors such as the communication's content, context or emotional intensity and the presence or absence of third-party speakers of one language or the other. The third alternative represents the phenomenon of \"code-switching\" in which the productively bilingual party to a communication switches languages in the course of that communication.  Receptively bilingual persons, especially children, may rapidly achieve oral fluency by spending extended time in situations where they are required to speak the language that they theretofore understood only passively.  Until both generations achieve oral fluency, not all definitions of bilingualism accurately characterize the family as a whole, but the linguistic differences between the family's generations often constitute little or no impairment to the family's functionality. Receptive bilingualism in one language as exhibited by a speaker of another language, or even as exhibited by most speakers of that language, is not the same as mutual intelligibility of languages; the latter is a property of a pair of languages, namely a consequence of objectively high lexical and grammatical similarities between the languages themselves (e.g., Norwegian and Swedish), whereas the former is a property of one or more persons and is determined by subjective or intersubjective factors such as the respective languages' prevalence in the life history (including family upbringing, educational setting, and ambient culture) of the person or persons.\n\nParagraph 18: In 2002, an armed incident erupted between Morocco and Spain, regarding the uninhabited Perejil Island, located 250m off the Moroccan northern coast. On July 11, 2002 a group of Moroccan soldiers set up base on the islet, violating the status quo situation agreed between both States. The Moroccan government said that they set foot on the island in order to monitor illegal immigration, which was denied by the Spanish government since there had been little co-operation in the matter by that time (a repeated source of complaint from Spain). After protests from the Spanish government, led by José María Aznar, the soldiers were replaced by Moroccan navy cadets who then installed a fixed base on the island. On the morning of July 18, 2002 Spain launched a full-scale military operation to take over the island. The operation was successful and the Moroccan navy cadets were dislodged from the island in a matter of hours without offering any resistance to the Spanish Grupo de Operaciones Especiales (commando) attack force. The islet returned to its status quo situation and is now deserted. It is to highlight the mediation role offered by the United States, and the lack of collaboration of France towards its European allies during the crisis.\n\nParagraph 19: On Day 9, two of the top three seeds, and the two finalists from the previous year, Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic, were severely tested.

Since it is possible to form circle graphs in which arbitrarily large sets of chords all cross each other, the chromatic number of a circle graph may be arbitrarily large, and determining the chromatic number of a circle graph is NP-complete. It remains NP-complete to test whether a circle graph can be colored by four colors.  claimed that finding a coloring with three colors may be done in polynomial time but his writeup of this result omits many details.\n\nParagraph 21: The Dublin Fusiliers actively took part in the efforts to lift the Siege of Ladysmith, which lasted from 30 October 1899 to 28 February 1900.

{"input": "", "context": "Paragraph 1: Hideo Sasaki was born in Reedley, California, on 25 November 1919. He grew up working on his family's California truck farm, and harvesting crops on Arizona farms. He began his college studies at the University of California, Berkeley during the time of World War II. Owing to his Japanese descent, he was forced into the Poston internment camp in Arizona after the signing of Executive Order 9066. He was able to leave the camp upon volunteering to work as a farm hand in Sterling, Colorado. Soon after the war, he moved to Denver, Colorado where he met his wife, Kisa, a graduate of the University of Colorado. Sasaki then moved to the University of Illinois where he received Bachelor of Fine Arts and Landscape Architecture in 1946. During his time at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign, Sasaki worked with a man named Professor Harris. Professor Harris enjoyed working with Hideo and saw the brilliance in his designs and thinking process. According to Professor Harris in an interview with the New York Times, he said \"He was calling for the need for more contemporary design and collaboration at a time when landscape architecture was still caught up in the Beaux-Arts, He didn't subscribe to any particular design aesthetic. He wanted people to understand the human needs and natural forces that were working on the landscape.\" What this means is that Sasaki had thought outside the box and through that was able to move architecture into its modern era. Professor Harris has seen this innovation and passion in Sasaki during his time at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign. Sasaki's work at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign was influential in shaping modern landscape architecture. He proposed a new design philosophy that focused on understanding the relationships between humans and nature. He encouraged collaboration between disciplines and advocated for the use of modern design techniques. His work helped to shift the way landscape architecture was approached and created a more holistic approach to design. His ideas continue to influence modern landscape architecture today. In 1948 he graduated with a Master of Landscape Architecture from Harvard Design School. After graduation he returned to Illinois where he instructed for two years. For the next eighteen years (1953-1970) he became a professor and the chairman of the department of Landscape Architecture of the Harvard Graduate School of Design. In 1953, he founded Sasaki Associates, incorporated in nearby Watertown, Massachusetts, where he was the president and chairman until 1980. He led the company's architects and planners in developing many noted commercial areas and corporate parks. In 1956 he worked on the design of the Havana Plan Piloto with Mario Romañach and the Catalan architect Josep Lluís Sert.\n\nParagraph 2: Hideo Sasaki was born in Reedley, California, on 25 November 1919.

His work helped to shift the way landscape architecture was approached and created a more holistic approach to design. His ideas continue to influence modern landscape architecture today. In 1948 he graduated with a Master of Landscape Architecture from Harvard Design School. After graduation he returned to Illinois where he instructed for two years. For the next eighteen years (1953-1970) he became a professor and the chairman of the department of Landscape Architecture of the Harvard Graduate School of Design. In 1953, he founded Sasaki Associates, incorporated in nearby Watertown, Massachusetts, where he was the president and chairman until 1980. He led the company's architects and planners in developing many noted commercial areas and corporate parks. In 1956 he worked on the design of the Havana Plan Piloto with Mario Romañach and the Catalan architect Josep Lluís Sert.\n\nParagraph 3: Later on, Tsukushi is invited to Tsukasa's birthday party by his mother Kaede. Tsukushi decides to make him a present similar to the one she gave him when he left for New York and dresses up in a fancy dress which Tsubaki had bought for her. During her son's birthday party Kaede announces Tsukasa's engagement to Ohkawahara Shigeru, the only daughter of a Japanese oil magnate. After Kaede makes her announcement she embarrasses Tsukushi by calling her up on stage to play the piano which she is unable to do. She congratulates Tsukasa and runs out followed by him. He confronts her about the engagement telling her that she should not have come since it was all part of Kaede's plans. Tsukushi says it doesn't matter since they are no longer in a relationship and before she can finish what she was saying Kaede arrives and agrees with what Tsukushi had said, followed by Shigeru who is shocked about the earlier events. Tsukasa then yells at his mother and tries to leave with Tsukushi but instead mistakenly grabs Shigeru's arm and leaves with her. To make things even more complicated, Shigeru falls in love with Tsukasa after their interactions out on the street. Tsukushi, in an effort to deal with the painful events regarding her past love, immerses herself in her studies to get into law school with the help of Rui. As they grow closer, Rui realizes his true feelings for her. During this time, Tsukushi finds out that her family is having money issues and she decides to take a second job in order to help her family with expenses but it is too much for her and she collapses during work. She is taken to the hospital and while Tsukasa is at a dinner with Shigeru and her family, Nishida informs him about Tsukushi being taken to the hospital and he rushes off to see her. Just before Tsukasa enters Tsukushi's room, he sees Rui and leaves confused about why he is there. Later, when Tsukushi wakes up she sees Rui, realizing that he had stayed the night and when he awakes he kisses her then leaves. When Tsukushi finally gets discharged from the hospital and goes home she finds out that her father was fired and left with her mother to go to a nearby village to become a fisherman in order to earn income. Tsukushi starts packing her belongings and is notified by Yuki that she knows someone in her tea class who might have a place for her and her brother to stay at. They start living in an old building and find out that Tsukasa is living next to them since he had purchased the building. Later on, Tsukushi and Tsukasa have a fight which results in him landing on top of her. Shigeru suddenly arrives, sees them and runs out of the building.\n\nParagraph 4: The Raid Gauloise or The Raid is considered by many to be the first modern expedition adventure race and was first held in 1989 in New Zealand as \"la grande traversée\". Its creator, Gérard Fusil, took the existing concept of long distance endurance races like the Whitbred Round the World Yacht Race, and focused on the team aspects, requiring each competitor to be part of a five-person co-ed team supported by a two-person logistics crew. The Raid had no set course, with competitors being required to rely on their wits and judgment to reach the specified checkpoints. The Raid was named after its original sponsor, the Gauloises Cigarette Company.\n\nParagraph 5: Lawton signed with the Minnesota Twins on August 12, 1991, after being selected by them in that year's draft. He began his professional baseball career in 1992 with the Gulf Coast League Twins of the rookie-league Gulf Coast League. That season, Lawton batted .260 with 39 runs scored, 45 hits, eight doubles, three triples, two home runs, 26 runs batted in (RBIs), 20 stolen bases, and 27 walks in 53 games played. Amongst league batters, Lawton was third in runs scored, and fifth in stolen bases. During the 1993 season, Lawton was assigned to the Fort Wayne Wizards of the Class-A Midwest League. With the Wizards, he batted .285 with 50 runs scored, 97 hits, 21 doubles, three triples, nine home runs, 38 RBIs, 23 stolen bases, and 65 walks in 111 games played. He was tied for tenth in the league in caught stealing (15). In 1994, Lawton was assigned to play with the Class-A Advanced Fort Myers Miracle. He was named to the 1994 Florida State League All-Star Team. On the season, Lawton batted .300 with 79 runs scored, 134 hits, 30 doubles, one triple, seven home runs, 51 RBIs, 42 stolen bases, and 80 walks in 122 games played. He was tied for second in the league caught stealing (19), and walks; fourth in stolen bases; eighth in runs scored; and ninth in doubles.\n\nParagraph 6: The Raid Gauloise or The Raid is considered by many to be the first modern expedition adventure race and was first held in 1989 in New Zealand as \"la grande traversée\".

Chicago were simply unstoppable all season long: they scored 32 goals without reply in the month of May, overwhelming Wisconsin Rebels 8–0, flattening Sioux Falls Spitfire 9–0 with three goals from Patrick Grange and braces from both James Klatter and Hamid Mehreioskouei, and putting five goals past Indiana Blast. Fire didn't concede their first goal until the seventh game of the season (a 3–1 win over the Michigan Bucks), but their exquisite form in front of goal continued unabated: five goals against Kansas City Brass, six on the road over St. Louis Strikers, and another five against the hapless Wisconsin Rebels were the June highlights, with Nowaf Jaman hitting four goals in the Kansas game, and Thabiso Khumalo netting a hat trick against St. Louis. Chicago's amazing form gave their first ever berth in the US Open Cup; they flattened Illinois-based USASA side S.A.C. Wisla 5–1 in their first round tie, with two of the goals being scored by Julian Nash, and even more impressively overcame PSL stalwarts New Hampshire Phantoms by the same scoreline in the second round, despite the game being Chicago's first ever match against professional opposition. Fire's fairytale run ended in the third round with a 1–0 defeat at the hands of A-League side Rochester Raging Rhinos, but their efforts still illustrated the strength of the team. Back in league play, Chicago's only dropped points came in the game against Kalamazoo Kingdom, which finished 0–0, but as the season wound down Fire still punished their luckless opponents: young Bosnian striker Vedad Ibišević scored twice in their 4–1 win over Wisconsin, and Khumalo scored another two in the 5–0 win over Indiana Invaders which secured the divisional title. Fort Wayne Fever hosted the Central Conference playoffs, and Chicago overcame the hosts 3–1 in the semi final, to set up a decider with the Boulder Rapids Reserve in the conference championship. However, after a 0–0 tie in regulation time, Boulder midfielder John Pulido scored a 98th minute golden goal to send the Colorado team the national final four, and send the Fire home disappointed. The 2004 Fire team was awash with future stars: in addition to top scorers Nowaf Jaman and Julian Nash, who scored 12 goals each, players such as Drew Moor, Dasan Robinson, Chris Rolfe all featured for the team, while goalkeeper Brad Guzan posted the best GK stats in the PDL – 0.388 goals against – before turning pro with Chivas USA.\n\nParagraph 8: Later on, Tsukushi is invited to Tsukasa's birthday party by his mother Kaede.

Eimer's organs were first described in the European mole in 1871 by German zoologist Theodor Eimer. Other mole species also possess Eimer's organs, though they are not as specialized or numerous as in the star-nosed mole. Because the star-nosed mole is functionally blind, the snout was long suspected to be used to detect electrical activity in prey animals, though little, if any, empirical support has been found for this hypothesis. The nasal star and dentition of this species appear to be primarily adapted to exploit extremely small prey. A report in the journal Nature gives this animal the title of fastest-eating mammal, taking as little as 120 milliseconds (average: 227 ms) to identify and consume individual food items. Its brain decides in approximately 8 ms if prey is edible or not.

That afternoon, as the mortars began a slow bombardment of the lower riverside breastworks, Sachem steamed up close to Southern batteries tempting them to reveal the positions of their cannon; but the Confederate guns spurned the bait and remained hidden. As darkness fell, Farragut moved his assault forces, three steam sloops-of-war—each lashed to a gunboat—and side-wheeler, , up to predetermined positions just out of range of Port Hudson's artillery. Shortly after ten, the warships, led by flagship,  , and her consort,  , got under way and stealthily steamed upstream. About an hour later, guns of the lower battery opened fire. Sachem, Essex, and the mortar schooners immediately replied. Their fire so hampered the gunners in the lower batteries that they did little damage to Farragut's flotilla as it raced up the river, guns ablazing, toward more deadly batteries beyond range of Sachem, Essex, and the mortar schooners. About an hour past midnight on the 15th, Comdr. Caldwell, in Essex, ordered Sachem to investigate a ship which had been sighted coming down stream. It proved to be  being towed by  after the steam sloop-of-war had been disabled and forced to retire from the action. Later, a boat came down and reported that Mississippi was aground and in trouble.

She soon struck a raft, breaking it in two, fouling her propeller, and almost causing her to collide with Richmond. A few moments later, blazing Mississippi drifted into view and forced Sachem, to maneuver desperately to avoid entanglement with that doomed and dangerous derelict. Then, Sachem devoted the rest of the night to picking up stray survivors of the side wheeler. During the fighting, Sachems only serious injury was a fracture in the barrel of her 20-pounder Parrot rifle. After supporting Farragut's attack on Port Hudson, Sachem was based at Baton Rouge, to help maintain Union control of the lower river.\n\nParagraph 2: The chapter begins with a Muqattaʿat, the two-letter formula Hā-Mīm, the last of the seven chapters to do so. In the Islamic tradition, the meanings of such formulae at the beginnings of chapters are considered to be \"known only to God\". The following verses (2–9) warn against those who reject the Quran and reiterate the Quranic assertion that the verses of the Quran are revealed from God and were not composed by humans. The verses maintain that the Quran itself is a \"clear proof\" of God's signs, and challenge the disbelievers to produce another scripture, or \"some vestige of knowledge\", to justify their rejection.\n\nParagraph 3:  Kate Spencer made her first appearance in live action on The CW television series Arrow, played by Chelah Horsdal. In \"Damaged\", District Attorney Kate tries to get Oliver Queen convicted after he is accused of being the Starling City vigilante but Laurel Lance arrives at the last minute to save him by having him confined to his home. Later, Kate tries to get Oliver to plead insane rather than take a lie detector test but Oliver still goes through with the test and gets out of it, subsequently managing to clear his name by having his associate John Diggle appear as the vigilante while he is confined. In \"State V. Queen\" after A.D.A. Adam Donner is abducted by Count Vertigo during the trial of Moira Queen, she, despite the concerns of Sebastian Blood, assigns Laurel as head of the case. In \"Birds of Prey\" Kate has Adam Donner fired when he uses the arrest and trial of Frank Bertinelli to draw out his vigilante daughter Helena Bertinelli/The Huntress which results in a hostage situation. Laurel is also briefly reappointed to her job without Kate's approval which she apologizes for; she initially states that nothing had changed, but Laurel blackmails Kate into giving her job back. In \"The Man Under The Hood\" when Laurel's father Quentin Lance is arrested for assisting the Arrow, Laurel once again blackmails Kate and she has the charges against Quentin dropped. However, as she walks away she warns Laurel to be careful of her. In \"Streets of Fire\", she is killed by one of Slade Wilson's soldiers, forcing Sebastian Blood to recognize that Wilson has no intention of carrying out their original deal of damaging Starling City so that Blood could rebuild it in the aftermath. In \"The Calm\", after Slade Wilson's defeat, Laurel keeps working under the new district attorney, who in \"Green Arrow\" is revealed to be named Susanna.\n\nParagraph 4: On October 19, 1990, a further impropriety surfaced. In 1989 the Ontario Labour Relations Board found that Rizzo had shifted a dozen workers from one company to a new one ( Muro Construction Ltd ) following the residential construction industry crisis in order to save their job and keep them working in spite of higher wages as result of joining a different union paying them higher benefits and higher dues. To stop the harassment of Local Union  Rizzo agreed to pay $8,164 to pay dues for a certain period of time for the workers for which dues were paid to Local 586 for the same period of time.  Rae was angered not only by the revelation but also Rizzo's response to the allegation. When confronted by reporters Rizzo had used the f.... word and  the next day he resigned from the NDP caucus to sit as an independent member of the legislature. He said, \"There was a settlement. My men were paid twice for their benefits through two unions. There's nothing wrong with that. In business, you have to face these problems once in a while,\" He went on to say that he expected to be back in the NDP caucus. He said, \"In time, you will see I have never done anything wrong.\" He also accused Liberal rival, Chaviva Hošek, of being behind the accusation. \"She was behind it during the campaign. This is a continuation of the campaign... you will see somebody tried to get me. Not only that, but they tried to embarrass the government and they would do the same to any member of this government to try to embarrass the government.\"\n\nParagraph 5: While Farragut approached Port Hudson on 14 March, , Sachem, and several mortar schooners were already in position below the forts.

In the intervening years, John's death has remained an unsolved murder, though it is commonly held that Charlotte was responsible. Despite notice from the Louisiana Highway Commission that she has been evicted from the property to make way for the impending construction of a new interstate, Charlotte is defiant, and threatens the demolition crew with a rifle. Seeking help in her fight against the Highway Commission, Charlotte summons Miriam, a poor cousin who lived with the family as a girl, but has since moved to New York City and become wealthy. Miriam returns and soon renews her relationship with Drew Bayliss, a local doctor who jilted her. Charlotte's sanity soon deteriorates following Miriam's arrival, her nights haunted by a mysterious harpsichord playing the song John wrote for her and by the appearance of his disembodied hand and head. Suspecting that Miriam and Drew are after Charlotte's money, Velma seeks help from Mr. Willis, an insurance investigator from England who is still fascinated by the case and who has visited Mayhew's ailing widow, Jewel; she gave him an envelope only to be opened after her death.\n\nParagraph 8: David was transfixed by this girl who had sauntered into his mind and kissed him without any trouble. David travelled to the Jean Grey School and used astral projection to check up on her, finding Blindfold in the medical bay in a coma. Deciding to find out more about her, David delved into her mind and discovered her tragic history for himself. When Ruth Aldine was born, it became immediately obvious she wasn't like other children. She was clearly a mutant and the X-gene had caused her to be born without eyes. Having a child with an obvious mutation put a strain on her parents’ marriage and, after a few weeks, Ruth's father walked and never came back. Her mother had to work long hours to be able to feed the family and so she would often leave Ruth in the care of her older brother, Luca. Seeing his father walk out because of Ruth caused Luca to build up a deep resentment of his sister. As she grew up, Ruth started to display other powers, which caused even more stress on the family. Luca's resentment towards Ruth caused him to begin physically lashing out at her. When he was in his teens, Luca became self-destructive and was soon sent to rehab for his drug addiction. While there, he latched onto sermons by a bigoted priest and started hating mutants even more. Though Luca was released as drug-free, his problems weren't solved and he continued his abuse of his sister and his mother. Luca finally snapped and attempted to kill his sister with a chainsaw, but their mother intervened and died protecting Ruth from her brother. The years of abuse and violence had caused Ruth to see herself as the problem, so when Luca blamed her for making him kill their mother, she believed him. Luca was caught by the authorities and not only convicted of his crime but was sentenced to death. Ruth went to live with her aunt and the few years that followed were the happiest of her life. There, she could use her various gifts without feeling persecuted by anyone. By the time she was in her early teens, it was time for Luca's execution. Regardless of all the things he had put her through, Ruth felt she needed to be there as he died. She used her telepathy and gained access to the execution. However, as Luca was given the lethal injection, his own gifts emerged and his \"spirit\" left his body and attacked Ruth, stealing half her powers. After that day, Ruth was unable to talk in a clear and definitive way. She would always add words like \"please, thank you, yes, no and sorry\" into regular sentences, as if she had a form of Tourette's. In fact, it wasn't just her speech patterns that had changed; her entire psyche had fractured and Ruth found it hard to piece back together again. Thanks to her gifts, Ruth also had trouble separating the past, present, and future into their proper order, since she perceived all three at once. Ruth's aunt eventually received a call from the Xavier Institute and so Ruth was sent to a school where she could harness her gifts. David could feel Ruth's psyche hiding somewhere within her memories but he couldn't reach her before the personality that had originally harmed Ruth stopped him.\n\nParagraph 9: Number Nine was founded in 1982 by Andrew Najda and Stan Bialek as Number Nine Computer Corporation.  The company was renamed Number Nine Visual Technology Corporation in the early 1990s.  For most of its existence, Number Nine was based in Lexington, Massachusetts.  Number Nine initially made an Apple II accelerator board, then later moved into the design and manufacture of high-end PC graphics cards in 1983.  Number Nine was one of the premier, higher-end graphics card companies into the early 1990s.  In the mid to late 1990s, Number Nine began to lose market share to competitors in both the price and performance arenas.  Number Nine was slow to respond to the boom in 3D graphics, continuing to emphasize high quality, fast 2D graphics. On December 20, 1999, Number Nine announced a \"letter-of-intent\" for S3 Inc. (later S3 Graphics Co.) to buy substantially all assets and intellectual property of Number Nine.  By mid 2000, S3 had completed the acquisition of Number Nine's assets and Number Nine had ceased operations.  In 2002 two former Number Nine engineers, James Macleod and Francis Bruno, formed Silicon Spectrum, Inc., and licensed Number Nine's graphics technology from S3 to implement in FPGA devices.\n\nParagraph 10:  Kate Spencer made her first appearance in live action on The CW television series Arrow, played by Chelah Horsdal. In \"Damaged\", District Attorney Kate tries to get Oliver Queen convicted after he is accused of being the Starling City vigilante but Laurel Lance arrives at the last minute to save him by having him confined to his home. Later, Kate tries to get Oliver to plead insane rather than take a lie detector test but Oliver still goes through with the test and gets out of it, subsequently managing to clear his name by having his associate John Diggle appear as the vigilante while he is confined. In \"State V. Queen\" after A.D.A. Adam Donner is abducted by Count Vertigo during the trial of Moira Queen, she, despite the concerns of Sebastian Blood, assigns Laurel as head of the case. In \"Birds of Prey\" Kate has Adam Donner fired when he uses the arrest and trial of Frank Bertinelli to draw out his vigilante daughter Helena Bertinelli/The Huntress which results in a hostage situation. Laurel is also briefly reappointed to her job without Kate's approval which she apologizes for; she initially states that nothing had changed, but Laurel blackmails Kate into giving her job back. In \"The Man Under The Hood\" when Laurel's father Quentin Lance is arrested for assisting the Arrow, Laurel once again blackmails Kate and she has the charges against Quentin dropped. However, as she walks away she warns Laurel to be careful of her. In \"Streets of Fire\", she is killed by one of Slade Wilson's soldiers, forcing Sebastian Blood to recognize that Wilson has no intention of carrying out their original deal of damaging Starling City so that Blood could rebuild it in the aftermath. In \"The Calm\", after Slade Wilson's defeat, Laurel keeps working under the new district attorney, who in \"Green Arrow\" is revealed to be named Susanna.\n\nParagraph 11: While Farragut approached Port Hudson on 14 March, , Sachem, and several mortar schooners were already in position below the forts. That afternoon, as the mortars began a slow bombardment of the lower riverside breastworks, Sachem steamed up close to Southern batteries tempting them to reveal the positions of their cannon; but the Confederate guns spurned the bait and remained hidden. As darkness fell, Farragut moved his assault forces, three steam sloops-of-war—each lashed to a gunboat—and side-wheeler, , up to predetermined positions just out of range of Port Hudson's artillery. Shortly after ten, the warships, led by flagship,  , and her consort,  , got under way and stealthily steamed upstream. About an hour later, guns of the lower battery opened fire. Sachem, Essex, and the mortar schooners immediately replied. Their fire so hampered the gunners in the lower batteries that they did little damage to Farragut's flotilla as it raced up the river, guns ablazing, toward more deadly batteries beyond range of Sachem, Essex, and the mortar schooners. About an hour past midnight on the 15th, Comdr. Caldwell, in Essex, ordered Sachem to investigate a ship which had been sighted coming down stream. It proved to be  being towed by  after the steam sloop-of-war had been disabled and forced to retire from the action. Later, a boat came down and reported that Mississippi was aground and in trouble. While Sachem steamed to assist the distressed side wheeler, another boat appeared, rowing down, bringing Capt. Smith, Mississippis commanding officer; Lt. George Dewey, the future hero of Manila Bay; and word that Mississippi had been abandoned. Sachem transferred the officers to Richmond and then headed back up river. She soon struck a raft, breaking it in two, fouling her propeller, and almost causing her to collide with Richmond. A few moments later, blazing Mississippi drifted into view and forced Sachem, to maneuver desperately to avoid entanglement with that doomed and dangerous derelict. Then, Sachem devoted the rest of the night to picking up stray survivors of the side wheeler. During the fighting, Sachems only serious injury was a fracture in the barrel of her 20-pounder Parrot rifle. After supporting Farragut's attack on Port Hudson, Sachem was based at Baton Rouge, to help maintain Union control of the lower river.\n\nParagraph 12: Jawbox is an American post-hardcore band from Washington, D.C., formed in 1989 by J. Robbins (vocals/guitar), Kim Coletta (bass), and Adam Wade (drums). After the trio released the album Grippe in 1991, Bill Barbot (guitar/vocals) joined as the fourth member. Jawbox released their second album Novelty in 1992, followed by Wade being replaced by Zach Barocas that same year. Jawbox signed to the major label Atlantic Records and released their third album For Your Own Special Sweetheart in 1994, which spawned the band's most recognizable song \"Savory\". After the release of their fourth album Jawbox in 1996, the band departed from Atlantic, and subsequently disbanded in 1997. They reunited for a brief one-off show in 2009, followed by a full-time reunion in 2019. Barbot left the band in 2021 and he was replaced by Brooks Harlan.\n\nParagraph 13: Number Nine was founded in 1982 by Andrew Najda and Stan Bialek as Number Nine Computer Corporation.

In the Islamic tradition, the meanings of such formulae at the beginnings of chapters are considered to be \"known only to God\". The following verses (2–9) warn against those who reject the Quran and reiterate the Quranic assertion that the verses of the Quran are revealed from God and were not composed by humans. The verses maintain that the Quran itself is a \"clear proof\" of God's signs, and challenge the disbelievers to produce another scripture, or \"some vestige of knowledge\", to justify their rejection.\n\nParagraph 15: David was transfixed by this girl who had sauntered into his mind and kissed him without any trouble. David travelled to the Jean Grey School and used astral projection to check up on her, finding Blindfold in the medical bay in a coma. Deciding to find out more about her, David delved into her mind and discovered her tragic history for himself. When Ruth Aldine was born, it became immediately obvious she wasn't like other children. She was clearly a mutant and the X-gene had caused her to be born without eyes. Having a child with an obvious mutation put a strain on her parents’ marriage and, after a few weeks, Ruth's father walked and never came back.

In 1989 the Ontario Labour Relations Board found that Rizzo had shifted a dozen workers from one company to a new one ( Muro Construction Ltd ) following the residential construction industry crisis in order to save their job and keep them working in spite of higher wages as result of joining a different union paying them higher benefits and higher dues. To stop the harassment of Local Union  Rizzo agreed to pay $8,164 to pay dues for a certain period of time for the workers for which dues were paid to Local 586 for the same period of time.  Rae was angered not only by the revelation but also Rizzo's response to the allegation. When confronted by reporters Rizzo had used the f.... word and  the next day he resigned from the NDP caucus to sit as an independent member of the legislature. He said, \"There was a settlement. My men were paid twice for their benefits through two unions. There's nothing wrong with that. In business, you have to face these problems once in a while,\" He went on to say that he expected to be back in the NDP caucus. He said, \"In time, you will see I have never done anything wrong.\" He also accused Liberal rival, Chaviva Hošek, of being behind the accusation. \"She was behind it during the campaign. This is a continuation of the campaign... you will see somebody tried to get me. Not only that, but they tried to embarrass the government and they would do the same to any member of this government to try to embarrass the government.\"\n\nParagraph 21: On October 19, 1990, a further impropriety surfaced.

{"input": "", "context": "Paragraph 1: In the following years, Epirus faced the growing threat of the expansionist Roman Republic, which fought a series of wars with Macedonia. The League remained neutral in the first two Macedonian Wars. However, they sided with the anti-Roman Macedonian-Illyrian pact in the Third Macedonian War (171–168 BC). After the Roman victory, a total of 150,000 Epirotes, mostly Molossians, were enslaved and sent to Italy, by decision of the Roman Senate. This decision is the only such act of the Roman senate and the largest, single, slave-hunting operation in Roman history. In the following years, Epirote slaves in Italy outnumbered slaves of other origins and the majority of slave marriages were between Epirotes. In historiography, the decision of the senate has been the subject of much debate, as the two main anti-Roman powers of the time in that region, the Macedonians and the Illyrians, suffered few consequences in contrast to the Molossians in terms of punishment. In past scholarship, the theory of Howard Hayes Scullard was the most recognized theory. He connected the measures taken by the Romans to Charops of Epirus, member of a rival tribe the Chaonians – a Roman ally – who in order to gain command of the region, pushed for the extermination of the Molossians. This interpretation is based on the negative assessment of Charops, already in ancient sources, as Polybius calls him \"the most savage and degenerate of all men\". The modern interpretation of the events, focuses more on the structural reasons which led to this decision by the Romans rather than the personal politics of regional actors. The plague of 174 BC caused a great reduction of available labor in Italy, which was supplied almost exclusively by slave labor. In the following years, slave-hunting became a central feature of Roman campaigns. The Roman senate, which represented the landowning elite, specifically targeted the Molossians because of the proximity of their territory to Brundisium and Taranto would require a much lower cost of transportation. In comparison, at least 65,000 Sardinians and many other tribes were enslaved in the same year. Though the region witnessed widescale destruction the Greek language in Epirus showed remarkable vitality in the following centuries both in the cities as well as outside them.\n\nParagraph 2: In the following years, Epirus faced the growing threat of the expansionist Roman Republic, which fought a series of wars with Macedonia.

Some popular sizes include \"full-frame\" or 35mm, APS-C, and 1-inch. Lenses are often intended to work with one of these sensor formats, but in some cases a lens can be used with multiple formats.  A “full-frame” type lens produces an image circle that is large enough to cover a 35mm sensor. Because APS-C sensors are smaller than 35mm sensors a full frame lens should be compatible with an APS-C sensor.

An APS-C type lens often does not have the coverage to cast light on the entirety of a 35mm sensor, causing dark corners in the images.\n\nParagraph 7: Despite a one-night stand with Mandy Salter (Nicola Stapleton) in January 1994, Ricky does not enter into another serious relationship until August, when he begins dating Bianca Jackson (Patsy Palmer). They move in together, but when Bianca begins to treat Ricky badly, he begins an affair with her best friend Natalie Price (Lucy Speed), in 1995. Natalie falls in love with Ricky and sets it up so that Bianca catches them kissing. Furious, Bianca finishes with Ricky, cutting up all his clothes and, after Ricky rejects Natalie, she flees Walford. Bianca eventually forgives Ricky and they reunite. Bianca strays with Lenny Wallace (Des Coleman), but immediately realises her mistake and marries Ricky on 17 April 1997. Later that year Bianca falls pregnant, but a prenatal scan reveals her unborn baby has both spina bifida and hydrocephalus; the Butchers decide to terminate the pregnancy. The trauma devastates them both, but it does bring them closer and in September 1998 Bianca discovers she has fallen pregnant again, resulting in her prematurely giving birth to their son Liam on Christmas Day 1998. The following year, Ricky becomes acquainted with Bianca's mother Carol Jackson (Lindsey Coulson) and her boyfriend Dan Sullivan (Craig Fairbrass). He quickly gets along with the pair, but this changes when Carol tells him that Bianca and Dan have embarked on an affair - as the pair had previously had a relationship in Spain, prior to Dan falling in love with Carol. When the affair becomes public knowledge, the Butchers' marriage ends and Bianca departs with Liam for Manchester. Ricky, devastated by his marriage breakdown, begins to clash with Dan when the latter taunts him - as well as becoming unhappy with his own life and work. This escalates when Ricky learns that Phil has recently befriended Dan, who later tells Ricky that Phil and Roy have been working together on a motor scam. In response, Ricky confronts Phil and the two have an argument as Ricky attempts to leave Walford. Phil apologizes to Ricky for hurting him and promises that he'll deal with Dan for him. Ricky initially agrees to return to Walford, but secretly leaves without Phil's consent.\n\nParagraph 8: In the following years, Epirus faced the growing threat of the expansionist Roman Republic, which fought a series of wars with Macedonia. The League remained neutral in the first two Macedonian Wars. However, they sided with the anti-Roman Macedonian-Illyrian pact in the Third Macedonian War (171–168 BC). After the Roman victory, a total of 150,000 Epirotes, mostly Molossians, were enslaved and sent to Italy, by decision of the Roman Senate. This decision is the only such act of the Roman senate and the largest, single, slave-hunting operation in Roman history. In the following years, Epirote slaves in Italy outnumbered slaves of other origins and the majority of slave marriages were between Epirotes. In historiography, the decision of the senate has been the subject of much debate, as the two main anti-Roman powers of the time in that region, the Macedonians and the Illyrians, suffered few consequences in contrast to the Molossians in terms of punishment. In past scholarship, the theory of Howard Hayes Scullard was the most recognized theory. He connected the measures taken by the Romans to Charops of Epirus, member of a rival tribe the Chaonians – a Roman ally – who in order to gain command of the region, pushed for the extermination of the Molossians. This interpretation is based on the negative assessment of Charops, already in ancient sources, as Polybius calls him \"the most savage and degenerate of all men\". The modern interpretation of the events, focuses more on the structural reasons which led to this decision by the Romans rather than the personal politics of regional actors. The plague of 174 BC caused a great reduction of available labor in Italy, which was supplied almost exclusively by slave labor. In the following years, slave-hunting became a central feature of Roman campaigns. The Roman senate, which represented the landowning elite, specifically targeted the Molossians because of the proximity of their territory to Brundisium and Taranto would require a much lower cost of transportation. In comparison, at least 65,000 Sardinians and many other tribes were enslaved in the same year. Though the region witnessed widescale destruction the Greek language in Epirus showed remarkable vitality in the following centuries both in the cities as well as outside them.\n\nParagraph 9: Despite a one-night stand with Mandy Salter (Nicola Stapleton) in January 1994, Ricky does not enter into another serious relationship until August, when he begins dating Bianca Jackson (Patsy Palmer).

Simon, meanwhile, is with B'dg at the Chamber of Shadows, where Black Hand and the Templar Guardians are being held. A battle ensues between Simon and Black Hand and whilst Simon is distracted, freeing the Templar Guardians, Black Hand sucks him into his ring. Simon is transported into the Dead Zone where Sinestro and Hal are trapped. Sinestro tells Simon that he was killed by Black Hand. Hal says Simon can't be dead because he still has the ring on. Sinestro then attacks Simon trying to get the ring. Since the ring is useless against Sinestro, Simon takes out his gun and fatally shoots him. However, Sinestro comes back to life because they are in the Dead Zone. Tomar-Re tells Hal that he believes the ring chose someone like Sinestro, not Hal, and that could explain Simon's brash personality. Simon offers to give Hal his ring but Hal objects, because the ring might reject Hal or think Baz is dead. Sinestro wakes and says he is going to get back at Simon, which makes Simon nervous. B'dg, with the help of the Templar Guardians, tries to retrieve Simon. Meanwhile, Simon's ring starts to split with the new half trying to go to Hal, Sinestro tackles Hal to the ground and shows Hal the First Lantern torturing Carol Ferris. This puts fear in Hal's heart, then the ring goes to Sinestro, and he and Simon swap places with Black Hand. Simon is being strangled by Sinestro, but then he later lets Simon go and teleports to his home planet of Korugar, trying to defend himself. When Simon and B'dg arrive at the planet Korugar's grave and witnessed Sinestro attacking Carol Ferris and White Lantern Kyle Rayner, they stop him. While Simon tells Carol the message that Hal was truly alive in the Dead Zone, Sinestro struggles for Kyle's white ring and attempts to become a White Lantern himself, but it strangely rejected him; the white ring then comes into the possession of Simon, but when he failed to restore Sinestro's home planet; the white ring returns to Kyle's ownership. When Sinestro flies off, Simon and B'dg team-up with Kyle and Carol and are ready to fight against the First Lantern. In the final battle, Simon and the reserve Lantern Corps attacked the First Lantern, and he is finally destroyed.\n\nParagraph 3: Allmusic editor Jon O'Brien found that the album suggested \"a confusing and disappointing change in direction.

An excerpt from Burawoy's 2004 ASA presidential address provides a succinct summary of his understanding of the term: \"As mirror and conscience of society, sociology must define, promote and inform public debate about deepening class and racial inequalities, new gender regimes, environmental degradation, market fundamentalism, state and non-state violence.

In Critical Sociology, Burawoy writes: \"We might say that critical engagement with real utopias is today an integral part of the project of sociological socialism. It is a vision of socialism that places human society, or social humanity at its organizing center, a vision that was central to Marx but that was too often lost before it was again picked up by Gramsci and Polanyi. If public sociology is to have a progressive impact it will have to hold itself continuously accountable to some such vision of democratic socialism.\"As Mark D. Jacobs and Amy Best write, \"The mission of public sociology, in Michael Burawoy's formulation, is to strengthen the institutions of civil society against the encroachments of both state and market.\" Indeed, Burawoy maintains that, since the last half of the twentieth century and into the twenty first, the political stance of sociology has drifted more leftward, while the all encompassing influence of neoliberalism has dragged the rest of world more rightward. In the aftermath of Reaganomics, the state and market have begun to work in collusion to propagate the ideals of market fundamentalism, replacing the state's role in redistributing resources and providing social welfare services, to one of creating economic opportunities for enterprise. In his view, this will have devastating consequences for civil society, the very subject of sociology itself, unless the discipline embraces his call to unashamedly engage with the world's diverse (and at-risk) publics to achieve some greater good, thus resisting the perverse allure of neoliberalism. One example of this can be seen in the vast increase in adjunct professors in universities and the impact that has had on the inability of professors to publish articles that would give them credence in the eyes of not only publics but also within the discipline itself.\n\nParagraph 8: While there is no one definition of public sociology, the term has come to be widely associated with Burawoy's particular perspective of sociology.

Simon, meanwhile, is with B'dg at the Chamber of Shadows, where Black Hand and the Templar Guardians are being held. A battle ensues between Simon and Black Hand and whilst Simon is distracted, freeing the Templar Guardians, Black Hand sucks him into his ring. Simon is transported into the Dead Zone where Sinestro and Hal are trapped. Sinestro tells Simon that he was killed by Black Hand. Hal says Simon can't be dead because he still has the ring on. Sinestro then attacks Simon trying to get the ring. Since the ring is useless against Sinestro, Simon takes out his gun and fatally shoots him. However, Sinestro comes back to life because they are in the Dead Zone. Tomar-Re tells Hal that he believes the ring chose someone like Sinestro, not Hal, and that could explain Simon's brash personality. Simon offers to give Hal his ring but Hal objects, because the ring might reject Hal or think Baz is dead. Sinestro wakes and says he is going to get back at Simon, which makes Simon nervous. B'dg, with the help of the Templar Guardians, tries to retrieve Simon. Meanwhile, Simon's ring starts to split with the new half trying to go to Hal, Sinestro tackles Hal to the ground and shows Hal the First Lantern torturing Carol Ferris. This puts fear in Hal's heart, then the ring goes to Sinestro, and he and Simon swap places with Black Hand. Simon is being strangled by Sinestro, but then he later lets Simon go and teleports to his home planet of Korugar, trying to defend himself. When Simon and B'dg arrive at the planet Korugar's grave and witnessed Sinestro attacking Carol Ferris and White Lantern Kyle Rayner, they stop him. While Simon tells Carol the message that Hal was truly alive in the Dead Zone, Sinestro struggles for Kyle's white ring and attempts to become a White Lantern himself, but it strangely rejected him; the white ring then comes into the possession of Simon, but when he failed to restore Sinestro's home planet; the white ring returns to Kyle's ownership. When Sinestro flies off, Simon and B'dg team-up with Kyle and Carol and are ready to fight against the First Lantern. In the final battle, Simon and the reserve Lantern Corps attacked the First Lantern, and he is finally destroyed.\n\nParagraph 13: Allmusic editor Jon O'Brien found that the album suggested \"a confusing and disappointing change in direction.

{"input": "", "context": "Paragraph 1: Stoecker was born in Halberstadt, Province of Saxony, in the Kingdom of Prussia. Stoecker's father was a blacksmith turned prison guard, and despite his poverty, Stoecker was able to attend university, which was unusual for a working-class man in the 19th century. An energetic and hardworking Protestant pastor who wrote widely on various social and political issues, Stoecker had a charismatic personality which made him one of Germany's best loved and most respected Lutheran clergyman. As a theology student at the University of Halberstadt, Stoecker was already known as the \"second Luther\" as his writings and speeches defending the Lutheran faith were considered outstanding. \n\nParagraph 2: In 1895, Hearne had a temporary setback, taking only 133 wickets and at times appearing stale. However, despite the driest summer he had yet played through, 1896 proved to be Hearne's great year: his 257 wickets included an amazing haul of 56 for just over 13 each against the Australians: a feat bettered only by Jim Laker in 1956 under more helpful weather conditions. Though a few very badly broken wickets at Lord's in a very dry May helped him, his work on the hard and true pitches earned respect, even fear, from most batsmen, and when the weather finally broke up in August, he took 10 for 60 on a difficult Oval wicket to ensure England the Ashes. Earlier in the year he had taken all nine wickets that fell for MCC against the Australians (George Giffen was absent). In 1897, though his feats were less staggering than the previous year because the wickets at Lord's in dry weather had become quite unhelpful to bowlers, Hearne was clearly the best bowler apart from the incomparable Tom Richardson, and he was chosen to tour Australia for the only time. He did not disappoint despite the very hard pitches: with Richardson only once at his best Hearne had to shoulder a very heavy burden and did so very well, taking 20 wickets including 6 for 98 at the MCG. In 1898, Hearne was again magnificent, taking 222 wickets at a slightly lower cost than in 1896. Whilst, on difficult pitches without support, his excellent bowling did not reward Middlesex early on, in August, aided by Albert Trott, Middlesex won their last seven games to come second.\n\nParagraph 3: He appeared in the Kennedy Center production of Follies from May 7, 2011 through June 19, 2011, as Ben Stone, with Bernadette Peters, Jan Maxwell, Danny Burstein and Elaine Paige. He had played this role previously in the 1988 Michigan Opera production (with Juliet Prowse and Nancy Dussault). He reprised his role in the Broadway engagement at the Marquis Theatre from August 7, 2011 (in previews) through January 22, 2012. Raines continued with this production in the Ahmanson Theatre, Los Angeles, California engagement, from May 3, 2012 through June 9, 2012. Raines received a Tony Award nomination for Best Leading Actor in a Musical for this role.\n\nParagraph 4: to describe a novel wireless sensor network architecture where the individual pieces could act and coordinate as a whole.  In this sense, the term describes a specific type of sensor network: an amorphous network of spatially distributed sensor platforms (pods) that wirelessly communicate with each other.  This amorphous architecture is unique since it is both synchronous and router-free, making it distinct from the more typical TCP/IP-like network schemes. A pod as a physical platform for a sensor can be orbital or terrestrial, fixed or mobile and might even have real time accessibility via the Internet. Pod-to-pod communication is both omni-directional and bi-directional where each pod sends out collected data to every other pod in the network. Hence, the architecture allows every pod to know what is going on with every other pod throughout the sensor web at each measurement cycle. The individual pods (nodes) were all hardware equivalent and Delin's architecture did not require special gateways or routing to have each of the individual pieces communicate with one another or with an end user.  Delin's definition of a sensor web was an autonomous, stand-alone, sensing entity – capable of interpreting and reacting to the data measured – that does not necessarily require the presence of the World Wide Web to function.  \n\nParagraph 5:  Shortwave: Shortwave broadcasting in the United States also dates back to the 1920s, though the shortwave bands were nationalized during World War II and was not opened to private broadcasters again until 1962. Like AM, shortwave stations benefit from atmospheric propagation and can cover vast areas of territory, but the higher frequencies are reflected during the daytime and require the stations to shift frequencies depending on time of day, which discourages listening for long periods of time. Current services include federal government transmissions, such as the official time signal broadcasts over station WWV, plus a few privately owned outlets that focus primarily on brokered programming, religious broadcasting and alternative political talk (WTWW, a conventionally programmed oldies station targeting radio enthusiasts, is a notable exception). The most widely known of the government-run networks is Voice of America, which features an international news and information format that serves a general worldwide audience; other networks target specific geographic regions. These government-run networks were, until 2013, forbidden from being marketed to American citizens; they still neither own nor affiliate with any AM or FM stations. The U.S. also provided the American Forces Network, a service for American armed service members stationed overseas that mostly relays commercial programming; AFN broadcasts are pointed away from the U.S. with signals pointed toward listeners in Japan, Korea and parts of Europe, and used single sideband technology to discourage casual American listeners from intercepting the programming. AFN appears not to have operated on shortwave since the mid-2010s. The upper ends of the shortwave band, circa 27 MHz, constitute the citizens band, which peaked in popularity in the 1970s and is reserved for personal communications.\n\nParagraph 6: to describe a novel wireless sensor network architecture where the individual pieces could act and coordinate as a whole.  In this sense, the term describes a specific type of sensor network: an amorphous network of spatially distributed sensor platforms (pods) that wirelessly communicate with each other.

She fights off a multitude of sci-fi monsters and mobile suits then jumps into a throng of Alien Metron and tosses them aside. She is then in a lightsaber duel with Darth Vader, with Stormtroopers sitting in the background and the Death Star enshrined in one corner. From atop a cliff, a xenomorph with artificial legs,a reference to Dai Sentai Goggle V's monsters who when grown giant, have the same metallic legs, wielding the Discovery One, knocks the girl down with an energy burst and the Dynaman robot (Dyna Robo) attempts to crush her. The girl lifts Dyna Robo off her with superhuman strength and smashes it against a cliff. The Stormbringer suddenly appears in the sky, and the girl jumps on it, riding it like a surfboard. A few scenes unconnected to the main plot are shown, such as Yoda as Yū Ida given a Japanese comedy routine with various characters in the audience. The girl is still riding the Stormbringer when she runs into a formation of Ultrahawk 1's. Then the Yamato, the Arcadia attached to the transformed SDF-1 Macross appear, along with an exploding VF-1 Valkyrie variable fighter from Macross armed with a Gundam-style beam saber. An air battle unfolds in an otaku coffee shop. The girl is then seen in a world filled with American comic superheroes. A host of machines and characters (from The Lord of the Rings, Conan, Narnia, Pern, and others) fly past her into space, including a Klingon battle cruiser, the moon ship from H. G. Wells' First Men in the Moon, the Millennium Falcon, Lord Jaxom and the Thunderbirds. Once back on land, the girl jumps off the Stormbringer and it splits into seven parts, which fly through the sky spewing smoke in seven colors. A sequence of famous spaceships crashing into each other is shown. Then, suddenly, \"what could only be described as an atomic bomb\" explodes over an unpopulated city, leaving behind a flurry of sakura petals. Successive upheavals of the Earth give birth to new worlds. As a beam launched by the Daicon traverses the sky, lush greenery sprouts and grows. The camera then pans over a massive crowd of fictional characters, the sun rises, the camera zooms out to the solar system, and the film ends with an image of the Daicon logo.\n\nParagraph 8: In 1895, Hearne had a temporary setback, taking only 133 wickets and at times appearing stale.

Whilst, on difficult pitches without support, his excellent bowling did not reward Middlesex early on, in August, aided by Albert Trott, Middlesex won their last seven games to come second.\n\nParagraph 9: Burchfield's style was largely developed by the summer of 1915, after his junior year at the Cleveland School of Art, as he sketched and painted constantly in and around Salem, OH, \"gathering the materials for a lifetime,\" according to his journals. Exposed in school to modernist European trends, he developed an almost fauvist use of broad areas of simplified color, enlivened by delightful particularizations of nature, and in 1917, began combining visual motifs projecting human moods, often disturbing, into the pictures. Assigned to the camouflage unit in the Army in 1918, he even worked his designs into painting schemes disguising tanks and artificial hills. Biographers note his exposure to modernist trends and traditional Chinese painting while in art school but overlook that the hallucinatory quality in his work may be partly traced to an episode of nervous exhaustion in 1911 while a junior in high school. Determined to record all the area's flowering plants that spring, he stayed up late at night painting whole bouquets of the blooms and had a bout of what was referred to at the time as \"brain fever,\" which might now be termed mania. He seems to have learned to use it as a source of energy and inspiration, and his school transcript records only three days' absence that semester. Painting constantly from 1915, even while working full-time in summer and after college, he sketched on walks to and from home at lunchtime and completed paintings based on them at night. Half of his lifetime output of paintings was produced while living in Salem from 1915 to 1917. The fact that so many paintings of this period were depictions of scenes visible from the windows of his boyhood home prompted Henry Adams, curator of drawings at the Cleveland Museum of Art, to call it \"the most important house in American art history.\"\n\nParagraph 10: On 18 May Ursúa requested three missionaries to support the expedition from the Franciscan provincial superior, friar Antonio de Silva; by 30 May three friars were ready to join the Spanish force, accompanied by a lay brother who had not yet taken vows. In addition, Silva sent another group of Franciscans led by friar Andrés de Avendaño, who was accompanied by another friar and a lay brother. This second group was only to remain with García while convenient for them to do so, and were to continue onwards independently to Nojpetén to make contact with the Itzas, with the tacit approval of Ursúa. In fact Avendaño and his party left Mérida on 2 June, a week before the party assigned to García. On 23 June Ursúa received a message informing him of the occupation of Sakbʼajlan (Dolores del Lakandon) by Guatemalan troops. By this time García was at Tzuktokʼ, near the Kejache border. Although Ursúa's purported plan, as authorised by the Spanish crown, was to build a road uniting Yucatán with Guatemala, he now realised that he was in a race to conquer the Itza kingdom; President Barrios of Guatemala had reached Sakbʼajlan and was returning to Santiago to prepare another expedition, and Guatemalan soldiers had already reached the lakeshore of Petén Itzá. Any linking road to Dolores del Lakandon would have passed through sparsely inhabited territory; instead the Yucatecan surveyor plotted a route due south directly to the lake where it could connect with the south road via Cahabón in Verapaz. This route would leave Dolores del Lakandon and the Lakandon Chʼol isolated to the west. Ursúa issued new orders to García dissimulating his desire to conquer the Itza. His letter ordered García to link up with President Barrios at Dolores del Lakandon, and gave him a precise route that would take him instead to the lake. A short time after receiving these orders, García ordered the construction of a fort at Chuntuki, some 25 leagues (approximately 65 miles or 105 km) north of Lake Petén Itzá. This would serve as the main military base for the Camino Real (\"Royal Road\") project; the supply base was at Kawich, under the command of Juan del Castillo y Arrué. On 27 July Ursúa authorised the creation of three new militia companies of 25 men apiece to reinforce García. Two were Spanish companies and one was a mixed-race company consisting of mestizos and pardos.\n\nParagraph 11: The New York State Unified Court System is a unified state court system that functions under the Chief Judge of the New York Court of Appeals who is the  Chief Judge of New York. The Chief Judge supervises the seven-judge Court of Appeals and is chair of the Administrative Board of the Courts. In addition, the Chief Judge establishes standards and administrative policies after consultation with the Administrative Board and approval by the Court of Appeals. The Chief Administrator (or Chief Administrative Judge if a judge) is appointed by the Chief Judge with the advice and consent of the Administrative Board and oversees the administration and operation of the court system, assisted by the Office of Court Administration. The eleven-member New York State Commission on Judicial Conduct receives complaints, investigates, and makes initial determinations regarding judicial conduct and may recommend admonition, censure, or removal from office to the Chief Judge and Court of Appeals. The Court of Appeals promulgates rules for admission to practice law in New York. (The New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division is responsible for actual admissions.) The New York State Reporter is the official reporter of decisions and is appointed by the Court of Appeals.\n\nParagraph 12: Game 1 was a match-up between aces: Greg Maddux for the Atlanta Braves and Kevin Ritz for the Colorado Rockies. Ritz and Maddux worked their way out of minor trouble early on, but, in the top of the third, Marquis Grissom broke the scoreless tie with a shot to make it 1–0. However, the Rockies soon answered in the bottom of the fourth. After Maddux got Dante Bichette to ground out, he walked Larry Walker. Then a single by Andrés Galarraga moved Walker to third. Ellis Burks's sac fly brought Walker home. The next batter, Vinny Castilla, would hit a two-run homer to give Colorado its first lead of the night, but In the top of the sixth, Chipper Jones led off with a home run to make it a one-run game. David Justice then walked just before a single by Ryan Klesko. An error during the play by Burks moved Justice to third. Steve Reed relieved Ritz and Luis Polonia reached on a fielder's choice, bringing Justice home to tie the game. The Braves would load the bases, but Maddux struck out to end the inning. In the top of the eighth, Mike Munoz took the mound for Colorado. He got two quick outs, but surrendered a single to Klesko. Darren Holmes came in and gave up a single to Javy López. Dwight Smith followed with a pinch-hit RBI single to center to give the Braves a 4–3 lead. In the bottom of the inning, Bichette walked off Greg McMichael, then moved to third on a single by Walker and an error by Justice on the play. Galarraga would then reach on a fielder's choice (on a diving stop by Chipper Jones robbing the Big Cat of extra bases), with Walker out at second. Alejandro Peña came on to face Burks with one out. Burks doubled to tie the game at four apiece, but Pena got the next two outs. Curt Leskanic came on in the top of the ninth and got two outs, but gave up a home run to Chipper Jones. The Braves now had a 5–4 lead, but the Rockies tried to mount a rally in the bottom half off Mark Wohlers. With one out, Mike Kingery singled and was followed by another single by Bichette. Walker was then walked, loading the bases with only one out. That put the winning run in scoring position. Wohlers, however, was able to get Galarraga and pitcher Lance Painter (Rockies skipper Don Baylor had run out of position players in his first postseason game as manager) to strike out to end the game and give the Braves a well-earned victory.\n\nParagraph 13: On 18 May Ursúa requested three missionaries to support the expedition from the Franciscan provincial superior, friar Antonio de Silva; by 30 May three friars were ready to join the Spanish force, accompanied by a lay brother who had not yet taken vows. In addition, Silva sent another group of Franciscans led by friar Andrés de Avendaño, who was accompanied by another friar and a lay brother. This second group was only to remain with García while convenient for them to do so, and were to continue onwards independently to Nojpetén to make contact with the Itzas, with the tacit approval of Ursúa. In fact Avendaño and his party left Mérida on 2 June, a week before the party assigned to García.

In this sense, the term describes a specific type of sensor network: an amorphous network of spatially distributed sensor platforms (pods) that wirelessly communicate with each other.  This amorphous architecture is unique since it is both synchronous and router-free, making it distinct from the more typical TCP/IP-like network schemes. A pod as a physical platform for a sensor can be orbital or terrestrial, fixed or mobile and might even have real time accessibility via the Internet. Pod-to-pod communication is both omni-directional and bi-directional where each pod sends out collected data to every other pod in the network. Hence, the architecture allows every pod to know what is going on with every other pod throughout the sensor web at each measurement cycle. The individual pods (nodes) were all hardware equivalent and Delin's architecture did not require special gateways or routing to have each of the individual pieces communicate with one another or with an end user.  Delin's definition of a sensor web was an autonomous, stand-alone, sensing entity – capable of interpreting and reacting to the data measured – that does not necessarily require the presence of the World Wide Web to function.  \n\nParagraph 15: Game 1 was a match-up between aces: Greg Maddux for the Atlanta Braves and Kevin Ritz for the Colorado Rockies.

He had played this role previously in the 1988 Michigan Opera production (with Juliet Prowse and Nancy Dussault). He reprised his role in the Broadway engagement at the Marquis Theatre from August 7, 2011 (in previews) through January 22, 2012. Raines continued with this production in the Ahmanson Theatre, Los Angeles, California engagement, from May 3, 2012 through June 9, 2012. Raines received a Tony Award nomination for Best Leading Actor in a Musical for this role.\n\nParagraph 19:  Shortwave: Shortwave broadcasting in the United States also dates back to the 1920s, though the shortwave bands were nationalized during World War II and was not opened to private broadcasters again until 1962. Like AM, shortwave stations benefit from atmospheric propagation and can cover vast areas of territory, but the higher frequencies are reflected during the daytime and require the stations to shift frequencies depending on time of day, which discourages listening for long periods of time. Current services include federal government transmissions, such as the official time signal broadcasts over station WWV, plus a few privately owned outlets that focus primarily on brokered programming, religious broadcasting and alternative political talk (WTWW, a conventionally programmed oldies station targeting radio enthusiasts, is a notable exception). The most widely known of the government-run networks is Voice of America, which features an international news and information format that serves a general worldwide audience; other networks target specific geographic regions. These government-run networks were, until 2013, forbidden from being marketed to American citizens; they still neither own nor affiliate with any AM or FM stations. The U.S. also provided the American Forces Network, a service for American armed service members stationed overseas that mostly relays commercial programming; AFN broadcasts are pointed away from the U.S. with signals pointed toward listeners in Japan, Korea and parts of Europe, and used single sideband technology to discourage casual American listeners from intercepting the programming. AFN appears not to have operated on shortwave since the mid-2010s. The upper ends of the shortwave band, circa 27 MHz, constitute the citizens band, which peaked in popularity in the 1970s and is reserved for personal communications.\n\nParagraph 20: to describe a novel wireless sensor network architecture where the individual pieces could act and coordinate as a whole.

{"input": "", "context": "Paragraph 1: To scale the western slope of the Sierra Nevada, East of Pine Grove Highway 88 follows a ridge that separates the watershed of the North Fork Mokelumne River to the south of the highway, with a number of other watersheds to the north. At lower elevations the watershed to the north of this ridge is initially Sutter Creek, later the South Fork Cosumnes River, and later still that of the Middle Fork Cosmunes River. At the highest elevations the watershed to the north of the road and the ridge is the Silver Fork American River. Several overlooks are located at spots where SR 88 follows this ridge which provide views into the canyons of each of these rivers. For several miles this ridge, and by extension SR 88, form the boundary between Amador and El Dorado County. In the lower parts of this ridge are the settlements of Pioneer and Buckhorn. Two small settlements are located in the higher elevations of this ridge, Cooks Station, and Ham's Station. Both of these are today known as locations where Caltrans implements traveling restrictions during winter storms, such as requiring tire chains, restricting certain vehicles or complete closures. Where this ridge crosses the divide between the Cosumnes and American Rivers is where the road joins the Mormon Emigrant Trail, which follows a different ridge up the mountains from the modern U.S. Route 50 corridor near Sly Park. This trail is so named for the Mormons in California during the gold rush, who created this path to rejoin the Mormon migration to Utah. Just past Silver Lake, Route 88 reaches a geographic feature known as the Carson Spur. This is where this ridge effectively ends, and the road follows a dynamited path down to the Kirkwood Mountain Resort and the small town of Kirkwood, where the road crosses into Alpine County. The Carson Spur section is prone to frequent avalanches in the winter and is periodically closed for avalanche control measures. In the final push up to Carson Pass the road passes by Caples Lake.\n\nParagraph 2: Fame is a reality television competition series that ran on NBC in the summer of 2003.  The show was essentially NBC's attempt to duplicate the success of mega-hit American Idol, right down to their selection of judges.  Former pop star Carnie Wilson was similar in her judgements to American Idol's Paula Abdul, Johnny Wright, the veteran music producer, was the show's analogue of Randy Jackson, and JoJo Wright was, like Simon Cowell, the judge who says things to stir people up.  The show retained the original Fame theme music (with a new vocal), as well as producer Debbie Allen. Former NSYNC member Joey Fatone was the official host of the show, but Allen also made frequent appearances.\n\nParagraph 3: Point Lonsdale has a large 100-year-old Norfolk Pine 'The Christmas Tree' that is lit up on the first Saturday in December at the end of an evening of A Community Celebration of Christmas. The Community Celebration of Christmas is run by a committee of volunteers assisted by the local service clubs, Lions and Rotary. The focus of the event is the community and children and each year the lights are turned on by a special guest (or guests) of honour chosen for their contribution to the Community. The Borough of Queenscliffe has a high percentage of volunteers and it is usually volunteers that are chosen as the special guest/guests of honour in recognition of their contribution to the community. Santa arrives at 7:25pm in the local Fire Brigade Truck, whilst throwing lollies to the children, to start an evening of entertainment by local performers. Glowcandles are sold as a fundraiser for maintaining equipment on the tree with all profits supporting the ongoing lighting of the tree. The tree itself is decorated by community volunteers and service club members coordinated by The Christmas Tree Committee. Festooning is hauled up by hand and manually secured into the tree. This tree can be found at the corner of Grimes Road and Point Lonsdale Rd, Point Lonsdale, Victoria. When lit up this tree can be seen for miles out to sea and is a Queenscliffe Borough icon, having been lit since about 1952–1953. When the lights are on you know Christmas is getting close.\n\nParagraph 4: At the same time, the Indonesian government started sending their troops on UN peacekeeping missions. The first batch of soldiers were sent to Sinai, Egypt and were known as Garuda Contingent 1. Garuda Contingent I began its first deployment January 8, 1957 to Egypt. Garuda Contingent I consisted of the combined personnel of the 15th Army Infantry Regiment Territorial Command (TT) IV / Diponegoro, as well as one company of the 18th Infantry Regiment TC V / Brawijaya in Malang. This contingent was led by Lt. Col. of Infantry Hartoyo which was later replaced by Lieutenant Colonel of Infantry Suadi Suromihardjo, while his deputy was Major of Infantry Soediono Suryantoro. The contingent departed on January 8, 1957, on board the Douglas C-124 Globemaster II transport aircraft of the United States Air Force for Beirut, the Lebanese capital. From Beirut the contingent was divided by two, the majority heading to Abu Suweir and partly to Al Sandhira. Furthermore, the El Sandhira troops moved into Gaza, the border area of Egypt and Israel, while the command is in Rafah. This contingent returned to Indonesia on September 29, 1957. Garuda Contingent I had a total number of 559 army personnel of all ranks.\n\nParagraph 5: At the same time, the Indonesian government started sending their troops on UN peacekeeping missions.

The skull has an estimated length of 370.3 mm from the front end of the maxillae to the rear margin of the squamosals and a width of 299.1 mm that narrows to 203.7 mm, giving the skull a “pear-shape” appearance. The skull lacks a distinct post-temporal notch, which is a feature seen in polacanthines and other nodosaurids. The maxilla forms the posterior margin of a relatively simple naris in the anterior margin of the bone, which is relative to derived nodosaurids and ankylosaurids, but does not form a portion of a secondary palate. The tooth row is arched ventrally and has an estimated 22–25 alveoli that increased in size posteriorly. The palate does not have a pronounced hourglass appearance as in derived nodosaurids due to medially deflected tooth rows. The nasal taper anteriorly and are relatively subrectangular. The nasals extend laterally from their relatively unfused suture, while the nasals of most ankylosaurs are fused except for Silvisaurus and Niobrarasaurus. The nasal’s posterior margin possesses a tongue-like process that would have overlapped the frontals. The narial passage was large and simple as the external surface is lightly textured and the internal surface is relatively smooth, unlike that of derived nodosaurids and ankylosaurids. The orbits have a subrectangular shape and are slightly more elongate from front to back. The suborbital horn is formed mostly from the far end of the quadratojugal to the ventral margin of the orbit. The suborbital horn is evenly rounded, unornamented and hides the head of the quadrate in side view. The lateral wall of the skull extends behind the orbit unlike those of polacanthids and most nodosaurids except for Peloroplites, Silvisaurus and Struthiosaurus. The sheet-like pterygoids flexed nearly dorsally against the front portion of the basicranium as in nodosaurids and not open transversely as in ankylosaurids or polacanthines. The mandibular articulation is more proportionally wider than in other ankylosaurs. In occipital view, the skull is subrectangular and wider than tall as in most other derived ankylosaurs. The paroccipital processes share a similar morphology and orientation to those in Gargoyleosaurus. The paroccipital processes also extend straight laterally as in most other ankylosaurs. The paroccipital has a triangular wedge of bone of unknown identity fused to it, which separates it from the quadrate. The occipital condyle is similar in overall morphology to that of Cedarpelta, except for the occipital condyle angles near the front, and there are no separate basal tubera between the basioccipital and the basisphenoid. The skull roof is roughened texturally by remodelling of the bone surface and preserves skin impressions on the margins that are represented by shallow grooves. The central portion of the skull was covered in an extensive median scale, as in other nodosaurids. A particular robust pair of scales were present along the margin of the skull based on narrow grooves near the region.\n\nParagraph 7: To scale the western slope of the Sierra Nevada, East of Pine Grove Highway 88 follows a ridge that separates the watershed of the North Fork Mokelumne River to the south of the highway, with a number of other watersheds to the north.

This contingent was led by Lt. Col. of Infantry Hartoyo which was later replaced by Lieutenant Colonel of Infantry Suadi Suromihardjo, while his deputy was Major of Infantry Soediono Suryantoro. The contingent departed on January 8, 1957, on board the Douglas C-124 Globemaster II transport aircraft of the United States Air Force for Beirut, the Lebanese capital. From Beirut the contingent was divided by two, the majority heading to Abu Suweir and partly to Al Sandhira. Furthermore, the El Sandhira troops moved into Gaza, the border area of Egypt and Israel, while the command is in Rafah. This contingent returned to Indonesia on September 29, 1957. Garuda Contingent I had a total number of 559 army personnel of all ranks.\n\nParagraph 9: At the same time, the Indonesian government started sending their troops on UN peacekeeping missions.

Keister hosted for one season (1988-89) in the one-hour, 6p.m. Sunday slot (and in the talk show format), but, following the lead of a \"Greatest Hits\" special that aired at 11:30 p.m. Saturday, the show moved into that slot. From the show's start until he became host in 1989, Keister was a regular supporting performer. Many of the initial award-winning elements of Almost Live! were his efforts, so the program quickly changed formats to feature more of his abilities, as well as other cast members, in video sketches. The guest interviews and live band segments were dropped. The focus changed to sketch comedy and the show was shaved back to a half-hour format. Because of its popularity among the station's staff members, KING-TV asked NBC to broadcast Almost Live at 11:30 p.m. slot, delaying Saturday Night Live locally by a half hour. The station received permission from the network to broadcast their show at that timeslot for a six-month trial basis, but host John Keister stated “Saturday Night Live tanked [in the ratings locally], and we won a big award [being named best local show in America by the National Association of Television Programming Executives], so the trial was allowed to continue [indefinitely].”\n\nParagraph 11: The film is set \"deep in the heart of Transylvania\" and the story appears to take place sometime during the mid-19th century. Professor Abronsius, formerly of the University of Königsberg, and his apprentice Alfred are on the hunt for vampires. Abronsius is old and withering and barely able to survive the cold ride through the wintry forests, while Alfred is bumbling and introverted. The two hunters come to a small village seemingly at the end of a long search for signs of vampires. The two stay at a local inn full of angst-ridden townspeople who perform strange rituals to fend off an unseen evil.\n\nParagraph 12: Male, female. Forewing length 4.5-4.8 mm.

Forewing shining bronze brown with reddish gloss, the basal area, below fold, to transverse fascia pale yellow, two white lines in the basal area, a narrow subcostal to one-quarter, slightly bending from costa, a broad and short yellowish white dorsal at base, a silver metallic tubercular spot with pinkish reflection at one-quarter just below fold, a pale yellow transverse fascia beyond the middle, narrowing towards dorsum and slightly darkened in the middle, bordered at the inner edge by two pale golden metallic subcostal and subdorsal spots with reddish and purple reflections, neither spot reaching costa nor dorsum, thus forming an inward oblique fascia, bordered at the outer edge by a broad outwardly oblique fascia, narrowed in the middle, beyond the outer metallic fascia pale yellow streaks on the costal and dorsal sides, the dorsal streak much longer than the costal, a narrow and indistinct whitish apical line from the dorsal pale yellow streak to apex, cilia bronze brown around apex, ochreous-grey towards dorsum. Hindwing shining grey with greenish and reddish gloss, cilia ochreous-grey. Underside: forewing shining greyish brown, hindwing shining greyish-brown in costal half, pale grey in dorsal half. Abdomen dorsally shining pale yellow, segments banded shining greyish white posteriorly, ventrally shining yellowish white, anal tuft whitish dorsally, grey ventrally, in the female abdomen is segment seven brownish grey and the anal tuft yellowish white.\n\nParagraph 13: The EMC EA/EB is an early passenger train-hauling diesel locomotive built from May 16, 1937, to 1938 by Electro-Motive Corporation of La Grange, Illinois for the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. They were the first model in a long line of passenger diesels of similar design known as EMD E-units. Each locomotive unit developed  from two  Winton 201-A diesel engines, driving the wheels through an electric transmission—the generator driven by each engine provided current for traction motors. The locomotives were of A1A-A1A wheel arrangement—two three-axle trucks of which only the outer two axles were powered. Six two-unit  locomotives were produced, each consisting of a lead cab-equipped EA A unit and a cabless booster EB B unit. They were numbered 51 through 56; the A units bore the bare number and the B units the number followed by 'X'.\n\nParagraph 14: Parker was born in Hastings, Sussex, the second son (and fifth of six children) of German-born Charles August Schwabe, manager of the Albany Hotel, Hastings, and his English wife Kate (née Parker), a church organist. He was educated at St Francis Xavier College, and at Bruges in Belgium.  He served with the Royal Sussex Regiment in the First World War, reaching the rank of sergeant. He began his theatrical career in London in 1922, adopting the surname \"Parker\" from his mother's maiden name. He made his first film appearance in 1933 and subsequently became a familiar face in British and occasionally American films until his death. He appeared less often on television, but many of his films have remained popular and are often shown.\n\nParagraph 15: Parker was born in Hastings, Sussex, the second son (and fifth of six children) of German-born Charles August Schwabe, manager of the Albany Hotel, Hastings, and his English wife Kate (née Parker), a church organist.

The university is recognized as the most prestigious university of Ukraine, being the largest national higher education institution. KNU is ranked within top 650 universities in the world. It is the third oldest university in Ukraine after the University of Lviv and University of Kharkiv. Currently, its structure consists of fifteen faculties (academic departments) and five institutes. It was founded in 1834 by the Russian Tsar Nikolai I as the Saint Vladimir Imperial University of Kiev, and since then it has changed its name several times. During the Soviet Union era, Kiev State University was one of the top-three universities in the USSR, along with Moscow State University and Leningrad State University. It is ranked as the best university in Ukraine in many rankings (see below). Throughout history, the university has produced many famous alumni including Mykola Lysenko, Nikolay Bunge, Mykhailo Drahomanov, Mykhailo Hrushevskyi, Nikolai Berdyaev, Mikhail Bulgakov, Ivan Schmalhausen, Theodosius Dobzhansky, Viacheslav Chornovil, Leonid Kravchuk, and many others. Taras Shevchenko himself, banned from educational activities for political reasons, worked for the university as a field researcher.\n\nParagraph 17: Keister became the permanent replacement after Shafer left the program.

In 1861, Thomas N. Miller, Henry Phipps (the son of the shoemaker Margaret Carnegie did home work for), Anthony Kloman, and Andrew Kloman organized the Iron City Forge in Pittsburgh to take advantage of the booming need for iron products during the American Civil War.  Miller subsequently bought out Anton Kloman's share.  Phipps and Miller later learned that Andrew Kloman had sold a one-ninth share in the business to a local man who subsequently died during the war, and Miller bought his share (raising his ownership in the business to four-ninths). Kloman, Miller, and Phipps were soon at odds over these transactions and one another's refusal to sell out to the others, and they sought Andrew Carnegie's assistance in resolving the dispute.  On September 1, 1863, Carnegie drew up new incorporation papers which made Miller a \"special partner\" in the firm and which also made Thomas Carnegie a partner in the business.  The money for Thomas' investment came from Andrew.  A clause in the contract permitted Kloman and Phipps to oust Miller and make him a silent partner, which they quickly did.  The same clause, however, gave Thomas Carnegie the right to purchase the extra one-ninth share Miller had obtained, and Andrew Carnegie immediately financed this purchase.  When Miller, one of Andrew's closest friends, protested, Andrew induced Thomas to plead with him to acquiesce lest Andrew's reputation as a fair dealer suffer. Miller did so.", "answers": ["12"], "length": 4588, "dataset": "passage_count_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "98f5057b32fc0207ebe06ddf1bf9c58a7d2fe82874d43aa5"}

The king of Beri in Kham, Donyo Dorje, was a practitioner of the Bön religion and enemy of the Gelugpa. He allied with the Tsangpa ruler Karma Tenkyong and sent a message, suggesting that the troops of Kham and Tsang would attack the Gelugpa stronghold in Ü in concert. The aim was to eradicate the Gelugpa and allow freedom of worship for the other sects. The message was intercepted and forwarded to Güshi Khan, who used it as a pretext for a new invasion. The Dalai Lama is said to have been opposed to creating more bloodshed, but Sonam Rapten went behind his back and encouraged Güshi to destroy the Beri ruler. The campaign was prepared in 1639, assisted by some Tibetans. In June of that year, Güshi moved against Beri and subjugated most of Donyo Dorje's subjects. On 6 January 1641, according to the chronicles of the 5th Dalai Lama, \"the ruler of Beri and others fled to a well-defended frontier, but as by the sharp iron of a person's virtue, the phenomenon of magnet and iron-filings takes place, so they were all captured and placed in a large prison-yard. All the root causes of unhappiness were removed from their places. The lamas and rulers of the Sakyapa, Gelugpa, Karmapa, Drukpa and Taklungpa were brought out of the prison dungeons where they had been placed and sent back to their own. The people up to the king of Jang paid taxes in money and earnestly sought to bow to him respectfully.\" The Beri ruler was executed and all the Dalai Lama's enemies in Kham were crushed.\n\nParagraph 3: Robert and Tina Minoru (\"the Magicians\") are Nico Minoru's parents. The two are dark wizards who posed as an average, church-going, middle-class couple. The two are the least-liked by the Pride; in a holograph, it's revealed the Steins and Yorkes consider them unstable because they're magicians; the Deans and Hayes hate them because they're humans; Geoffrey Wilder also criticizes Robert on one occasion. When the Gibborim had first abducted the Pride for the first meeting, the Minorus were on their wedding day. Arriving in the Gibborim's chamber with the rest of the Pride, the two quickly unleashed a black hole of bats at the Pride. In their first appearance, the two appear as an average couple, where Robert is unwilling to be late, and Tina is an Oprah fan.  When the Runaways witness the Rite of Blood, they see that Robert conducts the enchanted spell of sacrifice. The Runaways see the Minorus in action when they get ambushed at the Steins' laboratory; Tina conducts her powers using a mystical Staff known as the \"Staff of One\", and Robert conducts his powers through a spell book. Tina attempted to stab Nico with the Staff, but, due to Nico's own innate magic and hereditary link with Tina, the Staff was absorbed by Nico, who kept it. It is later hinted that there is more than one Staff of One, as shown when Bo, the first lady to a drug dealer in New York, knew of Nico's incantation and Chase commented that Nico had \"a Staff of One.\" The Minorus, though having mentioned that they only \"dabbled\" in the dark arts the first time the Pride was gathered, were given enough mystical power by the Gibborim to rule Los Angeles and even beyond. In the final battle with the Pride at the Marine Vivarium, Nico ignored the Wilders' and her parents' wishes to rule in the new world. Regardless, Tina screamed at Nico to run while she and Robert held back the Gibborim, a reason the Runaways were able to flee to safety.\n\nParagraph 4: Since Descartes, philosophers have been occupied with the concept of consciousness and its subjective nature has posed a special problem for science. Its nature arises from the neuronal structures in the brain and some understanding of these, together with the experimental tools needed to explore them, is given in the following chapters. They then recapitulate Edelman's still controversial theory of somatic selectionism during early development which controls the topology of a particular brain and enables restructuring in response to experience. They argue that memory is not a symbolic representation but a reflection of how the brain has changed its dynamics in order to achieve motor activity. This leads to a discussion of primary consciousness which integrates with perception into a means of directing immediate behavior and requires significant levels of reentrancy to achieve its effects.\n\nParagraph 5: Moved to Camp Dennison, Ohio, September 10, 1861; thence to Louisville, Ky., September 21.

The two are dark wizards who posed as an average, church-going, middle-class couple. The two are the least-liked by the Pride; in a holograph, it's revealed the Steins and Yorkes consider them unstable because they're magicians; the Deans and Hayes hate them because they're humans; Geoffrey Wilder also criticizes Robert on one occasion. When the Gibborim had first abducted the Pride for the first meeting, the Minorus were on their wedding day. Arriving in the Gibborim's chamber with the rest of the Pride, the two quickly unleashed a black hole of bats at the Pride. In their first appearance, the two appear as an average couple, where Robert is unwilling to be late, and Tina is an Oprah fan.  When the Runaways witness the Rite of Blood, they see that Robert conducts the enchanted spell of sacrifice. The Runaways see the Minorus in action when they get ambushed at the Steins' laboratory; Tina conducts her powers using a mystical Staff known as the \"Staff of One\", and Robert conducts his powers through a spell book. Tina attempted to stab Nico with the Staff, but, due to Nico's own innate magic and hereditary link with Tina, the Staff was absorbed by Nico, who kept it. It is later hinted that there is more than one Staff of One, as shown when Bo, the first lady to a drug dealer in New York, knew of Nico's incantation and Chase commented that Nico had \"a Staff of One.\" The Minorus, though having mentioned that they only \"dabbled\" in the dark arts the first time the Pride was gathered, were given enough mystical power by the Gibborim to rule Los Angeles and even beyond.

The plans called for $30 million retractable end zone seating in the south and a retractable terrace in the north end to ensure that fans aren't farther from the playing surface in soccer configuration due to the longer CFL field, and a roof over most permanent seating areas.  Leiweke promised that soccer playing surface will remain natural grass.  A reinforced hybrid playing surface such as Desso GrassMaster, in which artificial fibres are embedded in the turf to allow for the grass roots to intertwine with them to strengthen the pitch, was originally under consideration, but concerns that this would complicate repairs to the pitch led MLSE to decide against it.  A $1 million subsurface heating system and a $1 million artificial lighting system were installed to encourage grass growth, and MLSE secured an exemption to use pesticides on the field.  Portions of the CFL end zones are artificial turf.  Removable paint is used for lining the field to allow for the football lines to be removed prior to soccer games.  As well, the field has two football goalpost configurations so that the same grass isn't relined every game.  Under a two-phase construction process, the field was lengthened and the capacity of the stadium increased for $77 million by May 1, 2015, with the roof added by May 1, 2016 for $43 million.\n\nParagraph 11: New trouble soon followed. The king of Beri in Kham, Donyo Dorje, was a practitioner of the Bön religion and enemy of the Gelugpa. He allied with the Tsangpa ruler Karma Tenkyong and sent a message, suggesting that the troops of Kham and Tsang would attack the Gelugpa stronghold in Ü in concert. The aim was to eradicate the Gelugpa and allow freedom of worship for the other sects. The message was intercepted and forwarded to Güshi Khan, who used it as a pretext for a new invasion. The Dalai Lama is said to have been opposed to creating more bloodshed, but Sonam Rapten went behind his back and encouraged Güshi to destroy the Beri ruler. The campaign was prepared in 1639, assisted by some Tibetans. In June of that year, Güshi moved against Beri and subjugated most of Donyo Dorje's subjects. On 6 January 1641, according to the chronicles of the 5th Dalai Lama, \"the ruler of Beri and others fled to a well-defended frontier, but as by the sharp iron of a person's virtue, the phenomenon of magnet and iron-filings takes place, so they were all captured and placed in a large prison-yard. All the root causes of unhappiness were removed from their places. The lamas and rulers of the Sakyapa, Gelugpa, Karmapa, Drukpa and Taklungpa were brought out of the prison dungeons where they had been placed and sent back to their own. The people up to the king of Jang paid taxes in money and earnestly sought to bow to him respectfully.\" The Beri ruler was executed and all the Dalai Lama's enemies in Kham were crushed.\n\nParagraph 12: New trouble soon followed.

Its nature arises from the neuronal structures in the brain and some understanding of these, together with the experimental tools needed to explore them, is given in the following chapters. They then recapitulate Edelman's still controversial theory of somatic selectionism during early development which controls the topology of a particular brain and enables restructuring in response to experience. They argue that memory is not a symbolic representation but a reflection of how the brain has changed its dynamics in order to achieve motor activity. This leads to a discussion of primary consciousness which integrates with perception into a means of directing immediate behavior and requires significant levels of reentrancy to achieve its effects.\n\nParagraph 16: Moved to Camp Dennison, Ohio, September 10, 1861; thence to Louisville, Ky., September 21.

The king of Beri in Kham, Donyo Dorje, was a practitioner of the Bön religion and enemy of the Gelugpa.

The campaign was prepared in 1639, assisted by some Tibetans. In June of that year, Güshi moved against Beri and subjugated most of Donyo Dorje's subjects. On 6 January 1641, according to the chronicles of the 5th Dalai Lama, \"the ruler of Beri and others fled to a well-defended frontier, but as by the sharp iron of a person's virtue, the phenomenon of magnet and iron-filings takes place, so they were all captured and placed in a large prison-yard.

The lamas and rulers of the Sakyapa, Gelugpa, Karmapa, Drukpa and Taklungpa were brought out of the prison dungeons where they had been placed and sent back to their own. The people up to the king of Jang paid taxes in money and earnestly sought to bow to him respectfully.\" The Beri ruler was executed and all the Dalai Lama's enemies in Kham were crushed.", "answers": ["5"], "length": 7520, "dataset": "passage_count_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "f095709382914a3fb45f07e0cfcc21407125b22239f2b38e"}

On the second night of the Stardom Cinderella Tournament 2021 from May 14, Koguma made her official in-ring return, saving Mayu Iwatani from an attack performed by Oedo Tai after the latter fell short to Himeka in the quarter-finals of the tournament. She was later revealed to have joined the Stars stable. On the third night of the tournament from June 12, Koguma teamed up with fellow stablemates Mayu Iwatani, Starlight Kid, Hanan and Rin Kadokura, losing to Oedo Tai's (Natsuko Tora, Konami, Fukigen Death, Ruaka and Saki Kashima) in a Ten-woman elimination tag team match where Starlight Kid was eliminated last and she was forced to join Oedo Tai. At Yokohama Dream Cinderella 2021 in Summer on July 4, she teamed up with fellow Stars stablemate Mayu Iwatani and unsuccessfully challenged Alto Livello Kabaliwan (Giulia and Syuri) for the Goddess of Stardom Championship. At the Stardom 5 Star Grand Prix 2021, Koguma fought in the \"Red Stars\" block, scoring a total of 11 points after competing against Momo Watanabe, Mayu Iwatani, Starlight Kid, Himeka, Fukigen Death, Natsupoi, Giulia, Mina Shirakawa and Saki Kashima. At Stardom 10th Anniversary Grand Final Osaka Dream Cinderella on October 9, 2021, Koguma fell short to Hazuki in a singles match. At Kawasaki Super Wars, the first event of the Stardom Super Wars trilogy which took place on November 3, 2021, Koguma teamed up with Mayu Iwatani and went into a time-limit draw against Donna Del Mondo's Himeka and Natsupoi. At Tokyo Super Wars on November 27, she unsuccessfully challenged Starlight Kid for the High Speed Championship. At Osaka Super Wars, the last event of the series from December 18, Koguma teamed up with Hazuki and Mayu Iwatani and took part in a ¥10 Million Unit Tournament which was also contested for the Artist of Stardom Championship by first defeating Cosmic Angels (Tam Nakano, Mina Shirakawa and Unagi Sayaka) in the semi finals, and eventually falling short to the championsMaiHimePoi (Maika, Natsupoi and Himeka) in the finals on the same night as a result of a Six-woman tag team ladder match. At Stardom Dream Queendom on December 29, 2021, Koguma challenged Starlight Kid again for the High Speed Championship unsuccessfully, this time in a three-way match also involving AZM.\n\nParagraph 4: In Season 3, Hakeem drunkenly goes to see Tiana after the failure of his wedding and states that it was always her he loved. He doesn't know that Anika is in the hospital giving birth to his daughter, Bella. Lucious, angry with Hakeem's behaviour, puts his name of the certificate as a legal guardian instead of Hakeem as he is married to Anika. Hakeem tries to get over his wedding humiliation by making music but is interrupted by Shyne and his sister, Nessa (Sierra McClain). Shyne offers to produce for Hakeem. Hakeem eventually agrees to this. He gets involved in a beef with another rapper, Gram (Romeo Miller), who starts dating Tiana and they kiss in front of a surprised Hakeem during a performance. Hakeem responds by recording a diss track to both of them. He begins to develop feelings for Nessa but she is interested in Andre. Hakeem eventually finds out about this from Lucious whilst performing with Jamal in his house on Empire XStream, their streaming service. Hakeem responds by dissing both Andre and Jamal on the live stream, resulting in a huge argument and setting a feud with Andre. Hakeem also begins to develop a bond with his daughter, Bella. When Tiana is set up by Andre and Nessa during a modelling session in which Nessa purposely burnt the dress she was supposed to wear, Hakeem figures out that Andre was responsible for this and confronts him. Nessa ends up taking Tiana's spot. Hakeem comforts Tiana afterwards and during an outdoor performance, he kisses her and tells her he can't wait for her to meet Bella. They both start dating again and Hakeem supports Tiana after she gets in a fight with Nessa when they finish a performance at Leviticus. Hakeem celebrates his 21st birthday at Leviticus but it goes wrong when he lets in some strangers who helped him earlier. One of them assaults one of Tiana's friends and a fight breaks out. Andre shuts down Hakeem's XStream channel, telling him he needs to learn to take responsibilities while Jamal tells him he needs to \"be a man.\" Tiana also chastises him for being selfish. He goes to Lucious to collect Bella so he can spend the rest of his birthday with her and this pleases Lucious. Hakeem, with encouragement from Jamal and Cookie, apologises to Tiana's friend via music through Jamal's XStream channel. Hakeem introduces Tiana to Bella and they both bond immediately. When Empire is to take residency in Las Vegas, Hakeem and Tiana have the last laugh over Andre and Nessa when Tory Ash (Rumer Willis) gets Nessa's spot. Whilst at home, Hakeem does an insightful piece on family via his XStream channel. This pleases Lucious and he decides to include Hakeem's name on Bella's certificate. However, Bella is taken away by social services, courtesy of Diana DuBois (Phylicia Rashad). This sends Hakeem into a panic. He follows Anika to the DuBois house and he finds Bella. However, Diana DuBois tells Hakeem that she wants something from him in return.\n\nParagraph 5: DE 1 begins at MD 528 at the Maryland state line in Fenwick Island, where it heads north along a multilane divided highway called Coastal Highway through the Delaware Beaches resort area along the Atlantic Ocean, crossing the Indian River Inlet on the Indian River Inlet Bridge. In Dewey Beach, the route turns northwest away from the ocean, running through commercial development from Rehoboth Beach to Nassau. DE 1 forms a concurrency with US 9 from Carpenters Corner to Nassau. Past Nassau, DE 1 leaves the Delaware Beaches resort area and runs northwest through rural areas in northern Sussex County. The route bypasses Milford to the east along the Milford Bypass, crossing into Kent County. After an interchange with the northern terminus of US 113, DE 1 heads north along Bay Road through more rural areas, passing east of Frederica. The route becomes a freeway near Magnolia and turns into a toll road called the Korean War Veterans Memorial Highway while passing Dover Air Force Base. DE 1 bypasses the city of Dover to the east and begins to run parallel to US 13. The route passes east of Smyrna and enters New Castle County, where it crosses US 13 multiple times and heads west of Odessa. The road has an interchange with the northern terminus of the US 301 toll road in Biddles Corner. The toll road portion of the route ends before it crosses the Chesapeake & Delaware Canal on the Senator William V. Roth Jr. Bridge in St. Georges. DE 1 becomes concurrent with US 13 from Wrangle Hill to Tybouts Corner, where US 13 splits to the northeast. The DE 1 freeway heads north and meets US 40 in Bear before it comes to Christiana, where DE 7 joins the route. The DE 1 designation ends at an interchange with I-95 and DE 7 continues north along the freeway to the DE 58 interchange, from which point DE 7 turns into a divided highway with at-grade intersections.\n\nParagraph 6: Traditional Hindu Astrology, based the notion of exaltation primarily on the stellar constellations, also called Nakshatras, in which the planet fell. There are 27 Nakshatras present in the Sidereal Zodiac. Taking 360°/27 results in a precise arc of 13° 20′ per Nakshatra, remembering that 60′ constitute 1°. For example, although Jupiter is exalted in Cancer there are 3 different Nakshatras Jupiter could occupy within the 30° arc of Cancer, namely, Punarvasu (20°00′ Gemini to 3°20 Cancer), Pushya (3°20′ to 16°40′ Cancer), and Ashlesha (16°40′ to 29°59′ Cancer). Since Jupiter is exalted at 5° Cancer this placement signifies his true exaltation in Pushya Nakshatra. The Nakshatra Devata of Pushya is Bṛhaspati, the teacher of the Gods. Jupiter will not give his full exaltation effects when he is posited in a Nakshatra besides Pushya although he is still generally exalted in the sign of Cancer. Furthermore, each Nakshatra is divided into four sections, also called pāda, and when taking 13°20′/4 results in a precise arc of 3°20′ per pāda. The four pāda denote the four goals of life according to the Vedic tradition, namely, Dharma, Artha, Kāma, and Mokṣa. Although Jupiter finds strong exaltation in Pushya there are four different pāda Jupiter could occupy within the 13°20′ arc of Pushya, namely, Dharma pāda (3°20′-6°40′ Cancer), Artha pāda (6°40′-10°00′ Cancer), Kāma pāda (10°00′-13°20′ Cancer), and Mokṣa pāda (13°20′-16°40′ Cancer). Since Jupiter is exalted at 5° Cancer this signifies \"deep\" exaltation in the heart of the Dharma pāda of Pushya Nakshatra in the sign of Cancer which provides the astronomical reasoning of Jupiters exaltation degree. Esoterically speaking, when Jupiter is in Cancer (which signifies the heart), and is being influenced by Bṛhaspati (the teacher of the Gods), and is directed toward righteous action (Dharma pāda) Jupiter is functioning in 100% exaltation, concerning everything Jupiter represents.\n\nParagraph 7: Traditional Hindu Astrology, based the notion of exaltation primarily on the stellar constellations, also called Nakshatras, in which the planet fell.

He also specialised in propaganda, studying and attempting to influence American politics in favour of North Vietnam. He trained special undercover Vietcong spies who infiltrated government organisations in Saigon. In 1968, Linh directed the Tet Offensive against South Vietnam. This surprise attack throughout most South Vietnamese towns and cities was a turning point of the Vietnam War. After the end of the Vietnam War and the re-unification of Vietnam in 1975, Linh was inducted to the Communist Party's Politburo and became party chief of the capital Saigon. He favoured a slow transformation of the formerly capitalist southern part of the country causing him to come into conflict with his party colleagues. In the late 1970s, though considered a promising party politician, he had repeated arguments with Lê Duẩn, Ho Chi Minh's successor as party leader, preventing him from rising further in the hierarchy. In 1982, he was even removed from the Politburo. According to his friends, Linh resigned after an argument over the future of South Vietnam, in which he defended private capital.\n\nParagraph 10: Traditional Hindu Astrology, based the notion of exaltation primarily on the stellar constellations, also called Nakshatras, in which the planet fell.

He holds her to try and comfort her, but immediately hears screaming coming from the forest. He rushes to the source of the screaming only to find Taichi and one of the Takeda ninja he spoke with earlier dead, along with another badly injured Takeda ninja. A spider yōma attacks, but Hikage uses shuriken to drive it off, seeing a brief, transparent vision of Marou in the yōma's wake. Before dying, the injured ninja reveals that Marou is a \"child born of the ground\" and that everyone in the Takeda village knew about it, but never discussed it. Left with this mystery, Hikage confronts Aya with Taichi's death, only for her to deny it. When Aya goes to her house to store some water, she hears Ito's voice asking her to do her a favor that night. Hikage goes down to the riverbank to find that the bodies of Taichi and the dead ninja, along with the bloodstains and weapons, have disappeared without explanation. Hikage hears Aya singing unusually late that night and goes to investigate. He finds Aya being held in a different spider yōma's mandibles and attacks it. It drops Aya, but soon runs away with Hikage in pursuit. He arrives at the temple and finds the priest from the waterfall standing before him on the path. He tells Hikage that he is erasing the villager's memories in order to ripen them for Kikuga no Miko's (the demon lord yōma of the land) revival after revealing the fact that he was the spider yoma from before. On the verge of death from a short battle, the priest/yōma warns Hikage about the suicide of the entire village should he die, which Hikage proceeds to kill him anyway. Aya wakes up and remembers how she got her scar, the priest's spell having worn off when he died. It was assumed that she drowned herself. Hikage finds a seemingly unconscious Ito and rushes to her aide. However, she wakes up and restrains Hikage but he was able to kill her also. Hikage enters the shrine and destroys the buddha statue to reveal an egg that he quickly cuts open. The egg opens to reveal Marou feasting on Taichi's severed head. A speechless Hikage approaches him, but Marou attacks him, causing the entire building to come crashing down. Outside, a fully dressed Marou walks away, giving the broken building a final glance before departing.\n\nParagraph 13: The following night, Hikage sees Aya suffering from a nightmare.

The chase began very sedately, only Tushar Imran looking to take runs as he smashed Brad Hogg about, but Hogg got his revenge when Tushar was out for 24, lofting to Katich. Earlier, Nafees Iqbal had gone for 8, and with Javed Omar out as the third man to fall, for 19 off 51 balls, it looked to be business as usual for Bangladesh. But this match had more tricks up its sleeve. Hogg and Clarke leaked runs like a drain, six wides were bowled, and Mohammad Ashraful showed another glimpse of why he's been called Bangladesh's finest batsman. As he made the second ODI hundred in the Bangladesh team's history, he forged a massive 130-run partnership with Habibul Bashar, and had a great two hours at the crease (although dropped on 54) - before picking out Jason Gillespie at long on to be out for exactly 100. Bangladesh still needed 23 runs off 17 balls, but Aftab Ahmed continued his fine form from the Oval match with England, as he first took a leg bye off Ashraful, then gave the strike to Rafique, who smashed a cover driven four before taking another legbye. A four and a dot-ball finished a 10-run over, meaning that Bangladesh now needed only 13 off 12 balls. A good over from McGrath followed, as he conceded only six runs - including an edged four from Rafique. With the last over, Bangladesh needed seven runs, and Ahmed swung the first ball of the over to midwicket for six. Thus, it became a formality - Bangladesh won with four balls and five wickets to spare, almost convincing in today's cricket, and the result meant that the Aussies needed a victory over England at Bristol the following day to have any chance of winning the group stage.\n\nParagraph 15: The DVR feature of Windows XP Media Center Edition, Windows Vista and the Windows 7 version of Windows Media Center create files in this format.

Like the previous game, players control Hikaru using the left analog stick and shoulder buttons while using the right analog stick to control various Gotcha Gadgets that are unlocked as the player progresses through the game. Along with returning gadgets such as the Stun Club, Monkey Net, Super Hoop, Water Net, Slingback Shooter, RC Car, and Sky Flyer, Ape Escape 2 introduces three new gadgets; the Bananarang, which attracts monkeys with its scent, the Water Cannon, which puts out fires, and the Electro Magnet, which can be used on magnetic surfaces. The Magic Punch, a gadget from the first game unlocked in the post-game, also makes a return. New to the game is the monkey sidekick, Pipotchi, who accompanies Hikaru through most of the game. While with Hikaru, Pipotchi can give the player hints, help Hikaru reach ledges, and revive him once per life when he gets knocked out.\n\nParagraph 18: That was not all, however.

Thus, it became a formality - Bangladesh won with four balls and five wickets to spare, almost convincing in today's cricket, and the result meant that the Aussies needed a victory over England at Bristol the following day to have any chance of winning the group stage.\n\nParagraph 19: Koguma returned to professional wrestling after a six-year hiatus at the 10th Anniversary of Stardom on March 3, 2021, where she participated in a 24-women Stardom All-Star rumble match also involving superstars from the promotion's past such as Chigusa Nagayo, Kyoko Inoue, Yuzuki Aikawa, Bea Priestley and others. On the second night of the Stardom Cinderella Tournament 2021 from May 14, Koguma made her official in-ring return, saving Mayu Iwatani from an attack performed by Oedo Tai after the latter fell short to Himeka in the quarter-finals of the tournament. She was later revealed to have joined the Stars stable. On the third night of the tournament from June 12, Koguma teamed up with fellow stablemates Mayu Iwatani, Starlight Kid, Hanan and Rin Kadokura, losing to Oedo Tai's (Natsuko Tora, Konami, Fukigen Death, Ruaka and Saki Kashima) in a Ten-woman elimination tag team match where Starlight Kid was eliminated last and she was forced to join Oedo Tai. At Yokohama Dream Cinderella 2021 in Summer on July 4, she teamed up with fellow Stars stablemate Mayu Iwatani and unsuccessfully challenged Alto Livello Kabaliwan (Giulia and Syuri) for the Goddess of Stardom Championship. At the Stardom 5 Star Grand Prix 2021, Koguma fought in the \"Red Stars\" block, scoring a total of 11 points after competing against Momo Watanabe, Mayu Iwatani, Starlight Kid, Himeka, Fukigen Death, Natsupoi, Giulia, Mina Shirakawa and Saki Kashima. At Stardom 10th Anniversary Grand Final Osaka Dream Cinderella on October 9, 2021, Koguma fell short to Hazuki in a singles match. At Kawasaki Super Wars, the first event of the Stardom Super Wars trilogy which took place on November 3, 2021, Koguma teamed up with Mayu Iwatani and went into a time-limit draw against Donna Del Mondo's Himeka and Natsupoi. At Tokyo Super Wars on November 27, she unsuccessfully challenged Starlight Kid for the High Speed Championship. At Osaka Super Wars, the last event of the series from December 18, Koguma teamed up with Hazuki and Mayu Iwatani and took part in a ¥10 Million Unit Tournament which was also contested for the Artist of Stardom Championship by first defeating Cosmic Angels (Tam Nakano, Mina Shirakawa and Unagi Sayaka) in the semi finals, and eventually falling short to the championsMaiHimePoi (Maika, Natsupoi and Himeka) in the finals on the same night as a result of a Six-woman tag team ladder match. At Stardom Dream Queendom on December 29, 2021, Koguma challenged Starlight Kid again for the High Speed Championship unsuccessfully, this time in a three-way match also involving AZM.", "answers": ["10"], "length": 5686, "dataset": "passage_count_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "e2f7189604414e3a11f30404b5953204ecc9c0966ef4a5b6"}
{"input": "", "context": "Paragraph 1: This view was shown to be incorrect by Dingwall and Laskey in 1982. Using a protein called nucleoplasmin, the archetypal ‘molecular chaperone’, they identified a domain in the protein that acts as a signal for nuclear entry. This work stimulated research in the area, and two years later the first NLS was identified in SV40 Large T-antigen (or SV40, for short). However, a functional NLS could not be identified in another nuclear protein simply on the basis of similarity to the SV40 NLS. In fact, only a small percentage of cellular (non-viral) nuclear proteins contained a sequence similar to the SV40 NLS. A detailed examination of nucleoplasmin identified a sequence with two elements made up of basic amino acids separated by a spacer arm. One of these elements was similar to the SV40 NLS but was not able to direct a protein to the cell nucleus when attached to a non-nuclear reporter protein. Both elements are required. This kind of NLS has become known as a bipartite classical NLS. The bipartite NLS is now known to represent the major class of NLS found in cellular nuclear proteins and structural analysis has revealed how the signal is recognized by a receptor (importin α) protein (the structural basis of some monopartite NLSs is also known). Many of the molecular details of nuclear protein import are now known. This was made possible by the demonstration that nuclear protein import is a two-step process; the nuclear protein binds to the nuclear pore complex in a process that does not require energy. This is followed by an energy-dependent translocation of the nuclear protein through the channel of the pore complex. By establishing the presence of two distinct steps in the process the possibility of identifying the factors involved was established and led on to the identification of the importin family of NLS receptors and the GTPase Ran.\n\nParagraph 2:  Scrubbing tubes: Water before and after the animal chamber must be removed. One arrangement would use a large acrylic column of Drierite (8 mesh (scale), i.e., relatively coarse) upstream (before the push pump, before the animal chamber) to dry incurrent airstream and several tubes with smaller mesh (10–20, i.e., relatively fine) Drierite to remove water after the animal chamber. To prepare a scrubbing tube, make sure there is a small amount of cotton at either end of the tube to prevent dust particles from traveling to the analyzers. Use small amounts of cotton, say around 0.005 g, just enough to keep the dust out of the tubing. Large amounts of cotton will block air flow when/if it gets damp. Pour the Drierite into the tube with a funnel, tap the tube on the bench to pack the grains tightly (to increase surface area – air + water rushes through loose Drierite, requiring frequent changes of scrubbers), and cap off with a small amount of cotton. To remove carbon dioxide] before and after the animal chamber, Ascarite II is used (Ascarite II is a registered trademark of the Arthur H. Thomas Co.). Ascarite II contains NaOH, which is caustic (so don't get any on your skin and keep away from water). A scrubbing tube is prepared by placing a small amount of cotton into the tube end, filling one-third of the way with 10–20 mesh Drierite, adding a small amount of cotton, then an additional third of the tube with the Ascarite II, another layer of cotton, followed by more Drierite and capping the tube off with another small amount of cotton. Tap the tube on the bench as each layer is added to pack the grains. Note: Driereite can be used over and over again (after heating in an oven), although indicating Drierite will lose color with repeated drying; Ascarite II is used once and will be considered a hazardous waste.\n\nParagraph 3: This view was shown to be incorrect by Dingwall and Laskey in 1982.

There were hundreds of largely independent secular and ecclesiastical territories in the empire, most of which were ruled by a noble dynasty (though several dozen were city states). Many were autocratic rulers who barely recognized any other authority within their territories. Princes had the right to levy taxes and borrow money as they saw fit. The growing costs of administration and military upkeep impelled the princes to keep raising their subjects' cost of living.  The lesser nobility and the clergy paid no taxes and often supported their local prince. Many towns had privileges that exempted them from paying taxes, and so the bulk of the burden of taxation fell on the peasants. Princes often attempted to force their freer peasants into serfdom through increasing taxes and the introduction of Roman Civil law. Roman Civil law was advantageous to those princes who sought to consolidate their power, because it brought all land into their personal ownership and eliminated the feudal concept of the land as a trust between lord and peasant that conferred rights as well as obligations on the latter. By maintaining the remnants of the ancient law which legitimized their own rule, they not only elevated their wealth and position in the empire through the confiscation of all property and revenues, but also their dominion over their peasant subjects. Under this ancient law, the peasants had little recourse beyond passive resistance. Even so, the prince now had absolute control over all his serfs and their possessions.   Uprisings generally remained isolated, unsupported and easily put down until Thomas Müntzer and similar radicals began to reject the legitimizing factors of ancient law and invoked the concept of \"Godly Law\" as a vehicle for rousing the people.\n\nParagraph 5: From 1833 he was the leading architect of the cathedral at Cologne which was to be completed. At Cologne, he was next to Vincenz Statz the most important practical representative of Gothic Revival architecture. From the time it was recognized that the completion of the great cathedral at Cologne was the task which would bring the highest honour to the Gothic style, so Schinkel's school was drawn on for men to carry out the work, first Friedrich Adolf Ahlert, and after his death, Zwirner being called to Cologne. Before long more confidence was placed in Zwirner than had been given to his predecessor, because he showed a more perceptive grasp of the work of the old masters. After the work of restoration was finished, he presented his plans for the completion of the structure in 1841 to King Frederick William IV; upon the approval of the plans the work began the next year. However, neither Zwirner nor his able successor Karl Eduard Richard Voigtel, who completed the work, succeeded in uniting the charm of free play of imagination with technical correctness and architectural sequence. Nevertheless, there is no doubt that Zwirner was one of the finest judges of the medieval style.\n\nParagraph 6: All four upper secondary schools are bilingual and about one fourth of the tuition is given in English by native speakers. This also means that course materials are both in Swedish and English. The schools have students attending from all over the greater Stockholm region, making admission highly competitive. VRG Odenplan has some of the highest minimum admission requirements in the country. Admission to its natural sciences program with natural sciences orientation is especially competitive; in 2009 all students had perfect grades, and since 2016 all students has had a score of at least 330.0 (with a national average of 228.7; out of maximum possible 340.0) translated from their grades from Swedish primary school, due to high application rates.\n\nParagraph 7: New TEPS  1+class 526 to 600 foreigners with the highest level of communication skills  (Native Level of Communicative Competence) It is comparable to a well-educated native speaker to communicate and cope with professional work.

She was known by the nickname \"Mattie\". The Hughes family were converts to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and emigrated to the United States with their two daughters, Mary Elizabeth and Martha Maria. They embarked from Liverpool, England on March 30, 1860, on the ship Underwriter and arrived in New York City, New York on May 1, 1860. Peter was very sick at the time and Elizabeth gave birth to their third child, Annie Lloyd. They stayed in New York to earn money to travel the plains to Utah territory. Erastus Snow, a Mormon leader, invited the family to join a pioneer company funded by the LDS Church for the less fortunate. The family accepted the invitation and traveled by train to Florence, Nebraska, and left with The Joseph Horne Company on July 11, 1861. Shortly before the family's arrival in the Salt Lake Valley, on September 3, 1861, Martha's sister Annie Lloyd Hughes died and was buried in an unmarked grave. She was 21 months old. The Joseph Horne company arrived in the Salt Lake valley on September 13, 1861. Three days after they arrived in Salt Lake City, on September 17, 1861, Peter Hughes died. Elizabeth Hughes was left a widow with two young daughters at the age of 28. Thirteen months later, Elizabeth married James Patten Paul, a widower with four sons, thereafter giving birth to the later Latter-day Saints university professor and newspaper editor Joshua Hughes Paul. After Elizabeth's marriage to James P. Paul, Martha, at different times in her life, went by the surnames of both Paul and Hughes. Later in life, Paul encouraged Martha to follow her dream of becoming a medical doctor.\n\nParagraph 9: New TEPS  1+class 526 to 600 foreigners with the highest level of communication skills  (Native Level of Communicative Competence) It is comparable to a well-educated native speaker to communicate and cope with professional work.

As the self-proclaimed protector of all Yōkai, Baron Draxum seeks to mutate humanity to avert a prophecy predicting the destruction of the Yōkai. An incident amidst an earlier attempt to turn humanity into Yōkai led to the creation of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles while causing Hamato Yoshi's transition into Splinter, attempting to win the former to his side before joining forces with the Foot Clan to reassemble the Kuroi Yōroi and revive Shredder. In \"How to Make Enemies and Bend People to Your Will\", Draxum exploits a loophole in the Foot's rules to becomes its leader through tactics that enable him to gain a shard of the Kuroi Yōroi that the Foot Lieutenant and Foot Brute failed to acquire. In the episode \"End Game\", Draxum equips the restored Kuroi Yōroi armor intending to destroy humanity once and for all. The Foot Lieutenant and Foot Brute address him as Shredder, but he rejects the title, confused with the name \"Shredder\". Due to a Jupiter Jim action figure being wedged in a hole in the back of the helmet, the Turtles managed to attack that part and cause the armor to fall off of Draxum, though the armor is revived after siphoning some of Draxum's life force, degrading his body to nearly a corpse and weakening his powers considerably. After the Foot Recruit emerged from the portal she opened to assist her senseis, Draxum used his weakened abilities to escape through it. In \"Repairin' the Baron\", Mikey takes in a weakened Draxum and teaches him to tolerate humans with Raph's help. After saving a mother and daughter from the Ferris wheel during Garm and Freki's attempt to capture him at Albeartoland while losing his mask in the process, and slowly starting to regain his lost power, he starts to tolerate humans, after which Raph and Mikey get him a job working at the cafeteria at April's school. In the four-part \"Finale\" episodes, Draxum realized that Shredder was the threat to the Yōkai mentioned in the prophecy, not humanity.\n\nParagraph 11: Boris is first found in written records in the case of the Bulgarian ruler Knyaz Boris I (852–889), who adopted Christianity in AD 864 and introduced it to his people. His name came to be known in Europe in relation to this particular act. Moreover, after his death in AD 907 he was proclaimed the first Bulgarian saint, and traces of his Orthodox sainthood during this period can be found as far away as Catholic Ireland. The Patriarchate of Constantinople recognized the canonization of St. Boris in AD 923. Prince Boris was purportedly not a Slav and descended from the Bulgars. Among the Bulgars the name was known in its two forms: Boris and Bogoris.\n\nParagraph 12: Martha Maria Hughes Cannon was born near Llandudno, Caernarfonshire, Wales on July 1, 1857, the daughter of Peter Hughes and Elizabeth Evans.

Cash remained outside, \"mesmerized by the bizarre sight\", as Jerome Clark wrote. He went on: \"The object, intensely bright and a dull metallic silver, was shaped like a huge upright diamond, about the size of the Dayton water tower, with its top and bottom cut off so that they were flat rather than pointed. Small blue lights ringed the center, and periodically over the next few minutes flames shot out of the bottom, flaring outward, creating the effect of a large cone. Every time the fire dissipated, the UFO floated a few feet downwards toward the road. But when the flames blasted out again, the object rose about the same distance.\"\n\nParagraph 14:  Scrubbing tubes: Water before and after the animal chamber must be removed.

It was commonly believed that big-character posters originated in Yan'an, the CCP headquarter during the Anti-Japanese War and the subsequent civil war. They not only disseminated news and communist ideas but were also used to purge party officials during the 1942 Rectification Movement. During this early use of big-character posters, both the target and the degree of criticism were strictly controlled by the CCP party units. However, occasionally, though rarely, people also used big-character posters to criticize the CCP. On March 23, 1942, Wang Shiwei, a 36-year-old pro-Communist journalist and writer, posted an essay titled \"Two Reflections\". Written in large characters, the essay criticized certain party leaders for repressing forms of political dissent. In the next week, several other posters similarly critical of the party also went up, which triggered intense debate among the party leadership. The party did not appreciate such public criticism of its operation, and the writers were punished. In particular, Wang was accused as a \"Trotskyist spy\" and beheaded in 1947. In 1945, during The 7th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party, Mao Zedong reflected on Wang's big-character poster: \"We were defeated by him. We acknowledged our defeat and worked hard at rectification.\"  In 1957, when Mao Zedong had started to use big-character posters to mobilize the masses during the Hundred Flowers Campaign, he looked back to the Yan'an period in his talk at the supreme state conference: \"A few big-character posters were written in the Yan'an period, but we didn't promote it. Why? I guess maybe we were a bit foolish back then.\"\n\nParagraph 17: Boris is first found in written records in the case of the Bulgarian ruler Knyaz Boris I (852–889), who adopted Christianity in AD 864 and introduced it to his people.

A lab production prior to the Broadway revival, also directed by Carlyle, was planned to run from May 19 to June 8. Participants in the lab production included Sierra Boggess as Lily, Matt Doyle as Albert, Drew Gehling as Neville, Clifton Duncan as Archibald and Brooklyn Shuck as Mary. The revival did not come to pass in the 2018–19 season and there has been no further word on the project. When Warren Carlyle was interviewed by Ken Davenport for The Producer's Perspective Podcast in May 2019, he said that the revival was still on the table. They had a cast lined up, they were just waiting for the right theatre to be available. The revival's workshop streamed from May 6-9, 2021.

Cash remained outside, \"mesmerized by the bizarre sight\", as Jerome Clark wrote. He went on: \"The object, intensely bright and a dull metallic silver, was shaped like a huge upright diamond, about the size of the Dayton water tower, with its top and bottom cut off so that they were flat rather than pointed. Small blue lights ringed the center, and periodically over the next few minutes flames shot out of the bottom, flaring outward, creating the effect of a large cone. Every time the fire dissipated, the UFO floated a few feet downwards toward the road. But when the flames blasted out again, the object rose about the same distance.\"\n\nParagraph 21: This view was shown to be incorrect by Dingwall and Laskey in 1982. Using a protein called nucleoplasmin, the archetypal ‘molecular chaperone’, they identified a domain in the protein that acts as a signal for nuclear entry. This work stimulated research in the area, and two years later the first NLS was identified in SV40 Large T-antigen (or SV40, for short). However, a functional NLS could not be identified in another nuclear protein simply on the basis of similarity to the SV40 NLS. In fact, only a small percentage of cellular (non-viral) nuclear proteins contained a sequence similar to the SV40 NLS. A detailed examination of nucleoplasmin identified a sequence with two elements made up of basic amino acids separated by a spacer arm. One of these elements was similar to the SV40 NLS but was not able to direct a protein to the cell nucleus when attached to a non-nuclear reporter protein. Both elements are required. This kind of NLS has become known as a bipartite classical NLS. The bipartite NLS is now known to represent the major class of NLS found in cellular nuclear proteins and structural analysis has revealed how the signal is recognized by a receptor (importin α) protein (the structural basis of some monopartite NLSs is also known). Many of the molecular details of nuclear protein import are now known. This was made possible by the demonstration that nuclear protein import is a two-step process; the nuclear protein binds to the nuclear pore complex in a process that does not require energy. This is followed by an energy-dependent translocation of the nuclear protein through the channel of the pore complex. By establishing the presence of two distinct steps in the process the possibility of identifying the factors involved was established and led on to the identification of the importin family of NLS receptors and the GTPase Ran.\n\nParagraph 22: Martha Maria Hughes Cannon was born near Llandudno, Caernarfonshire, Wales on July 1, 1857, the daughter of Peter Hughes and Elizabeth Evans. She was known by the nickname \"Mattie\". The Hughes family were converts to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and emigrated to the United States with their two daughters, Mary Elizabeth and Martha Maria. They embarked from Liverpool, England on March 30, 1860, on the ship Underwriter and arrived in New York City, New York on May 1, 1860. Peter was very sick at the time and Elizabeth gave birth to their third child, Annie Lloyd. They stayed in New York to earn money to travel the plains to Utah territory. Erastus Snow, a Mormon leader, invited the family to join a pioneer company funded by the LDS Church for the less fortunate. The family accepted the invitation and traveled by train to Florence, Nebraska, and left with The Joseph Horne Company on July 11, 1861. Shortly before the family's arrival in the Salt Lake Valley, on September 3, 1861, Martha's sister Annie Lloyd Hughes died and was buried in an unmarked grave. She was 21 months old. The Joseph Horne company arrived in the Salt Lake valley on September 13, 1861. Three days after they arrived in Salt Lake City, on September 17, 1861, Peter Hughes died. Elizabeth Hughes was left a widow with two young daughters at the age of 28. Thirteen months later, Elizabeth married James Patten Paul, a widower with four sons, thereafter giving birth to the later Latter-day Saints university professor and newspaper editor Joshua Hughes Paul. After Elizabeth's marriage to James P. Paul, Martha, at different times in her life, went by the surnames of both Paul and Hughes. Later in life, Paul encouraged Martha to follow her dream of becoming a medical doctor.\n\nParagraph 23: In a Turkish tale collected by Turkologist Ignác Kúnos with the title Der Schlangen-Prinz (\"The Snake-Prince\"), a poor broom-maker has three daughters and earns their living by selling brooms. One day, he stops to sit on a stone in the woods and utters a loud sigh. Suddenly, the stone opens up and an Arab appears to him, saying he was summoned. The broom-maker denies having summoned him, but pours out his woes to the man, who is the Snake-Prince's lala. The Arab man gives him a sack of gold and suggests the broom-maker brings his daughters to him, one at a time. The Arab submits the girls to a test: they are given a sherbet laced with a sleeping potion so they fall asleep, then the Arab will prickle her foot with a needle. The elder two avoid eating the sherbet and have their feet prickled by a needle, screaming in pain, while the youngest falls asleep and does not feel a thing. The Arab sends them back, but keeps the youngest as his master's potential bride. The Arab sleeps by the girl's side for 40 nights, while she lies asleep on the bed. Whenever the youth appears, he hides a set of keys under the cushion, which the girl takes to open 40 doors. Behind the last one she sees a garden where a pair is asleep: a youth with a girl next to him, and a cradle nearby. The human girl places a shawl on the girl then leaves. The asleep girl, the daughter of the Padishah of the Peris, wakes up, sees the shawl and accuses her companion of consorting with a human, then flies away. The youth goes to live with the human girl, but, one night, she does not drink her sherbet and feigns sleep. She turns to her bedmate and sees a padlock on his navel; she opens it and sees inside a great Tscharschi filled with people making cushions and carpets for the girl's unborn child she will bear to the snake prince. The human girl leaves the padlock and closes it again, but the snake prince, in human form, realizes his wife opened the padlock and orders his Arab servant to expel her from his palace. The girl, pregnant, wanders off until she reaches a Seraj that belongs to her elder sister-in-law, who does not welcome her. This repeats again with the second sister-in-law, but her husband's youngest sister takes her in just as she is ready to give birth. The third sister-in-law notices that the child, a boy, has a padlock on his navel, just like his father. Meanwhile, the snake prince, regretting his actions, goes after his human wife and pays a visit to his three sisters, in hopes of finding her again. At last, he arrives at his youngest sister's palace and leaves his snakeskin outside. Inside the palace, the human girl is advised by her sister-in-law to take the snakeskin and burn it, while he is occupied with his sister. It happens thus, and the snake prince, fully human, reconciles with his human wife.\n\nParagraph 24: Boris is first found in written records in the case of the Bulgarian ruler Knyaz Boris I (852–889), who adopted Christianity in AD 864 and introduced it to his people. His name came to be known in Europe in relation to this particular act. Moreover, after his death in AD 907 he was proclaimed the first Bulgarian saint, and traces of his Orthodox sainthood during this period can be found as far away as Catholic Ireland. The Patriarchate of Constantinople recognized the canonization of St. Boris in AD 923. Prince Boris was purportedly not a Slav and descended from the Bulgars. Among the Bulgars the name was known in its two forms: Boris and Bogoris.", "answers": ["15"], "length": 6538, "dataset": "passage_count_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "a1426d2fa0f78082a4add09db890181e4f32725cb8c0730a"}

The Battalion's mission: to eliminate everyone in the village who stood in their way of capturing 'the Guerrilla,' as the Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front (FMLN) was known. In the lapse of three days every inhabitant of the village was executed. On the fatal day of December 10, soldiers rousted the civilians from their homes and gathered them in the central plaza where they were forced to lie down on the street. Soldiers then brutally kicked them, threatened and seized jewelry and valuables along with accusing the people of belonging to the FMLN. At nightfall, people were ordered to enter their homes and were warned not to step outside or else they would be murdered. The following morning, the citizens were forced outside where they were then divided into groups of men with boys and women with girls and children. Men and older boys were taken to a church and the rest were taken to vacant homes. In the church, the soldiers blindfolded the men and killed them either by decapitation or point-blank gunshots. Many of these men were tortured before being executed. At the same time, women and girls were forced to walk up hillsides where they were first raped before being murdered. Then the soldiers rounded up the children in an empty home where they shot and killed every child. After proceeding with the executions of all the inhabitants, they left obscene writings on the walls prior to burning the homes and the bodies. The soldiers didn't settle with just eliminating the inhabitants, they made sure that the animals belonging to the deceased were killed and burned as well. The “Angels of Hell,” as the Atlácatl Battalion styled themselves, had completed their mission.\n\nParagraph 3: On December 10, 1981, the Atlácatl Battalion entered the village of El Mozote with a plan in mind.

Despite her handicap, Toph has developed special skills by keeping company with the blind 'badgermoles' that inhabited nearby caves. By imitating their movements, Toph became a master of the martial art known as 'earthbending', but she kept her ability secret from her overprotective family. Toph fought frequently in Earth Rumble, an earthbending lei tai tournament resembling professional wrestling, under the alias \"Blind Bandit\". By the time Aang and his friends discover Toph at the tournament, she had become champion, holding a 42–0 win–loss record. However, Aang unintentionally beats her in a match when he tries to talk to her, as she could not sense air currents. When her parents learn about this and confine her further, Toph runs away to accompany Aang and his friends as Aang's earthbending instructor, although her parents believe she was kidnapped by Aang. Toph nearly leaves the group after feuding with Katara over not contributing to the group's teamwork, though rejoins them following a meeting with Iroh and encountering Princess Azula for the first time. Toph successfully begins Aang's training of earthbending and slows the descent of Wan Shi Tong's Library, where the group learns the date of the next Day of Black Sun and inadvertently gains an advantage over the Fire Nation, as it sinks, though fails to prevent Appa from being kidnapped by sandbenders. Due to Appa being the group's transportation, they are forced to travel on foot, journeying through Serpent's Pass and preventing a drill from entering Ba Sing Se. Now in the city, she infiltrates the Earth Kingdom Royal Palace, meeting Dai Li, bonds with Katara, encounters Jet and reunites with Appa. Toph also learns to metalbend after she is captured in a metal cage by people who were sent by her parents to retrieve her. She realizes that metal contains small amounts of earth, which she can manipulate. She quickly escapes and traps her captors in the same small cage.\n\nParagraph 5: \"Where possible, the protocol makes use of existing Internet and Web technologies.

She surveys Goethe's novels, poems, plays, autobiographical writings, even his scientific works on botany and colour theory, and concludes that it is relation. In Goethe's view, she writes, \"It is for the truth of relation that we come into mortal existence,—not to know ourselves, not to save ourselves, not to be ourselves except in relation.... The relation of Man to Woman is typical of this great law.... Throughout the universe, only relation is creative.... When Man and Woman see each other, they begin to apprehend the Universe.\" Mere identity—the self prior to relation—is \"not complete\". It \"can only be perfected by fitting itself to others, accepting the welfare of others as more its own than its own personality.\" She quotes Goethe scholar Herman Grimm: \"Goethe was persuaded that all phenomena stand in mutual relation, and therefore nothing can be demonstrated by the study of isolated parts.\" She observes that \"the idea of womanhood always suggests that of relation, symbolizing as she does the attractive forces of existence, beauty winning to union,...in one all-comprehensive word, love.\" Or, in more abstract terms, \"The attractive principle is at once attraction which stimulates action and the centripetal power which holds action true to its centre.\" This puts woman \"in the van of the world's progress of evolution\". The \"highest human relation\" is love. \"Woman's misery, man's degradation, is the result of the broken law of love.\" Women know this better than men because they test life \"by a more delicate analysis than masculine logic supplies\". They consider \"things in their relations\". That is why in \"the great work in which Goethe sought to read the riddle of life,... das Weibliche is the moving power\". The \"one simple thought\" that runs all through Faust is expressed \"in the last grand verse\". What is revealed there is \"that which enters into every faith, which underlies the beautiful in art, the ideal in philosophy, the essence of morality, the meaning of life. It is the sense of the relation of the individual to the universal. We never think, never can think, of the feminine alone. It is not what separates her from others, but what gives the power of union, which makes her feminine, and so creative. And the masculine knows itself only in relation to the feminine. So it is that the eternally feminine 'draws us by sweet leadings' of beauty to love, to union, to new creation.\"\n\nParagraph 9: Cheney then attempts to define what this \"aspect\" is.

In 2006, his Tigers beat two top-5 teams who later played in BCS bowls, including eventual BCS Champion Florida. Tuberville had a 5–2 career record versus top-5 teams, including three wins versus Florida. But he developed a reputation for losing games when he clearly had the better team. Examples include a humbling 24-point loss to a 4–5 Alabama team in 2001 and a loss to Vanderbilt—the first time Auburn lost to the Commodores in over 50 years. In fact, after dropping three straight SEC games in 2003, Auburn booster Bobby Lowder and Auburn's president and athletic director contacted then Louisville head coach Bobby Petrino to gauge his interest in taking the Auburn job if Tuberville was fired. The press found out about the meeting, which occurred just before the 2003 Alabama game, and the episode has since been known as JetGate.\n\nParagraph 14: The Hyderabad began their campaign on a winning note defeating the Madhya Pradesh by seven wickets. The Hyderabadi bowlers took regular wickets to bowl-out Madhya Pradesh to 231 while measured half-centuries from Tanmay Agarwal and Rohit Rayudu completed the chase for the Hyderabad with seven wickets and 14 balls to spare. In the second match, Nitish Rana's unbeaten knock of 91 in 87 balls helped the Delhi chase the revised target of 176 in 30.4 overs in a rain-hit match to hand the Hyderabad their first defeat in the tournament. Earlier, it was Manan Sharma who troubled the Hyderabad batsmen in the middle with his four-wicket haul until Mohammad Siraj's cameo at the end with a couple of sixes that helped the Hyderabad to recover to 205. In another rain-affected reduced-over match, the Saurashtra successfully chased the revised target of 110 in 19 overs with the combined batting effort from Robin Uthappa, Aarpit Vasavada and Prerak Mankad. Earlier, the Hyderabad recovered in the middle from the top-order collapse with 95-run partnership between Kolla Sumanth and Bavanaka Sandeep but could not capitalize on that partnership as the Hyderabad suffered from another collapse at the end and were restricted to 196 in 45 overs. The Hyderabad's match against the Andhra, their fourth match of the tournament, was washed off due to the incessant rains in Delhi. In the fifth match, Mehdi Hasan's maiden fifer helped the Hyderabad bowl out the Uttar Pradesh for 130 despite their skipper, Suresh Raina's half-century while the opening partnership of 124 between Akshath and Tanmay handed the Hyderabad a 9-wicket win over the Uttar Pradesh. Chasing 223 to win, the Chhattisgarh were bowled out to 121 with Palakodeti Sairam and Mehdi sharing three wickets between them as the Hyderabad secured their third win in six matches. Earlier, Rohit's half-century along with the support from Sandeep's 41 helped the Hyderabad post 222 in 50 overs. Siraj missed the rest of the group matches for the Hyderabad as he was selected to the national team for the test series against the West Indies. In the seventh match, two-wicket hauls along with the tight bowling from Sairam and Ravi Kiran helped the Hyderabad restrict the Kerala to 189 despite the half-century from VA Jagadeesh while an unbeaten century partnership between Rohit and Sandeep completed the chase for the Hyderabad with seven wickets to spare. The Hyderabad survived the scare in their last group match defeating the Odisha narrowly by one wicket but still need the favorable results on the last day to qualify for the knockout stage. Chasing 248 to win, the Hyderabad enjoyed the strong start with the half-centuries from their openers, Tanmay and Akshath but their dismissals triggered the batting collapsed until an unbeaten 43-run knock from Sumanth completed the chase despite the flurry of wickets at the other end. Earlier, the Odisha had a strong start too with the century partnership between Govinda Poddar and Subhranshu Senapati but the six-wicket haul from Milind helped the Hyderabad restrict the Odisha to 247. The defeat of the Baroda to the Maharashtra in the Group A helped the Hyderabad advance to the knockout stage as they finished third in the Group B and fifth across the groups A & B with five wins, two losses and a draw.\n\nParagraph 15: The Hyderabad began their campaign on a winning note defeating the Madhya Pradesh by seven wickets.

Cantillo was only 17 years old, but quickly established himself as among the most talented players in the league when he won MVP honors as a rookie.  The Comets also won the league championship that season.  Cantillo earned MVP honors in 1974, and in 1975 was a first team All Star for the fourth consecutive year. In February 1975 the Comets loaned him to the Tampa Bay Rowdies of the North American Soccer League for the upcoming NASL indoor tournament. Castillo went on to win the Regional MVP award, before getting injured early in the championship final. He scored five goals in four games for the 1975 indoor Rowdies. At the end of the 1975 ASL season, the Comets traded Cantillo to New York Inter-Giuliana SC, of the semi-pro German-American Soccer League, which played in the winter months. They also loaned him to Tampa Bay for the 1976 NASL season.  He played a single season, twenty-one games total, with the Rowdies before returning to the ASL, this time signing with the New Jersey Americans.  Cantillo was part of the ASL's most exciting team as the Americans played a free-flowing attacking game which took them to the 1977 championship.  Cantillo was again the league MVP, his third in five years in the ASL, and a first team All Star.  Cantillo jumped leagues again at the end of the 1977 season.  He joined the New England Tea Men of the NASL.  He would remain with this team in its various incarnations until 1985, except for 1983 when he played for Team America.  The Tea Men spent the 1978-1980 seasons in New England before moving to Jacksonville, Florida at the end of the 1980 season.  Cantillo moved with the team and played the 1981 and 1982 seasons with Jacksonville.  In the fall of 1982, he signed with the New York Arrows of Major Indoor Soccer League.  He spent one season with the Arrows.  In 1983, he signed with Team America.  That year, the U.S. Soccer Federation attempted to create a more successful U.S. national team by entering the team into the NASL as a franchise.  However, the team stumbled to a 10-20 record and the bottom of the league standings and USSF pulled the national team from the NASL at the end of the season.  In 1984, Cantillo returned to the Tea Men who by then played in the United Soccer League.\n\nParagraph 18: Cantillo, a native of Costa Rica, began his professional soccer career with the Cincinnati Comets of the American Soccer League in 1972.

The Hyderabadi bowlers took regular wickets to bowl-out Madhya Pradesh to 231 while measured half-centuries from Tanmay Agarwal and Rohit Rayudu completed the chase for the Hyderabad with seven wickets and 14 balls to spare. In the second match, Nitish Rana's unbeaten knock of 91 in 87 balls helped the Delhi chase the revised target of 176 in 30.4 overs in a rain-hit match to hand the Hyderabad their first defeat in the tournament. Earlier, it was Manan Sharma who troubled the Hyderabad batsmen in the middle with his four-wicket haul until Mohammad Siraj's cameo at the end with a couple of sixes that helped the Hyderabad to recover to 205. In another rain-affected reduced-over match, the Saurashtra successfully chased the revised target of 110 in 19 overs with the combined batting effort from Robin Uthappa, Aarpit Vasavada and Prerak Mankad. Earlier, the Hyderabad recovered in the middle from the top-order collapse with 95-run partnership between Kolla Sumanth and Bavanaka Sandeep but could not capitalize on that partnership as the Hyderabad suffered from another collapse at the end and were restricted to 196 in 45 overs. The Hyderabad's match against the Andhra, their fourth match of the tournament, was washed off due to the incessant rains in Delhi. In the fifth match, Mehdi Hasan's maiden fifer helped the Hyderabad bowl out the Uttar Pradesh for 130 despite their skipper, Suresh Raina's half-century while the opening partnership of 124 between Akshath and Tanmay handed the Hyderabad a 9-wicket win over the Uttar Pradesh. Chasing 223 to win, the Chhattisgarh were bowled out to 121 with Palakodeti Sairam and Mehdi sharing three wickets between them as the Hyderabad secured their third win in six matches. Earlier, Rohit's half-century along with the support from Sandeep's 41 helped the Hyderabad post 222 in 50 overs. Siraj missed the rest of the group matches for the Hyderabad as he was selected to the national team for the test series against the West Indies. In the seventh match, two-wicket hauls along with the tight bowling from Sairam and Ravi Kiran helped the Hyderabad restrict the Kerala to 189 despite the half-century from VA Jagadeesh while an unbeaten century partnership between Rohit and Sandeep completed the chase for the Hyderabad with seven wickets to spare. The Hyderabad survived the scare in their last group match defeating the Odisha narrowly by one wicket but still need the favorable results on the last day to qualify for the knockout stage. Chasing 248 to win, the Hyderabad enjoyed the strong start with the half-centuries from their openers, Tanmay and Akshath but their dismissals triggered the batting collapsed until an unbeaten 43-run knock from Sumanth completed the chase despite the flurry of wickets at the other end. Earlier, the Odisha had a strong start too with the century partnership between Govinda Poddar and Subhranshu Senapati but the six-wicket haul from Milind helped the Hyderabad restrict the Odisha to 247. The defeat of the Baroda to the Maharashtra in the Group A helped the Hyderabad advance to the knockout stage as they finished third in the Group B and fifth across the groups A & B with five wins, two losses and a draw.\n\nParagraph 22: On December 10, 1981, the Atlácatl Battalion entered the village of El Mozote with a plan in mind. The Battalion's mission: to eliminate everyone in the village who stood in their way of capturing 'the Guerrilla,' as the Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front (FMLN) was known. In the lapse of three days every inhabitant of the village was executed. On the fatal day of December 10, soldiers rousted the civilians from their homes and gathered them in the central plaza where they were forced to lie down on the street. Soldiers then brutally kicked them, threatened and seized jewelry and valuables along with accusing the people of belonging to the FMLN. At nightfall, people were ordered to enter their homes and were warned not to step outside or else they would be murdered. The following morning, the citizens were forced outside where they were then divided into groups of men with boys and women with girls and children. Men and older boys were taken to a church and the rest were taken to vacant homes. In the church, the soldiers blindfolded the men and killed them either by decapitation or point-blank gunshots. Many of these men were tortured before being executed. At the same time, women and girls were forced to walk up hillsides where they were first raped before being murdered. Then the soldiers rounded up the children in an empty home where they shot and killed every child. After proceeding with the executions of all the inhabitants, they left obscene writings on the walls prior to burning the homes and the bodies. The soldiers didn't settle with just eliminating the inhabitants, they made sure that the animals belonging to the deceased were killed and burned as well. The “Angels of Hell,” as the Atlácatl Battalion styled themselves, had completed their mission.\n\nParagraph 23: Tuberville established himself as one of the best big-game coaches in college football, winning nine of his last 15 games against top-10 opponents since the start of the 2004 season. In 2006, his Tigers beat two top-5 teams who later played in BCS bowls, including eventual BCS Champion Florida. Tuberville had a 5–2 career record versus top-5 teams, including three wins versus Florida. But he developed a reputation for losing games when he clearly had the better team. Examples include a humbling 24-point loss to a 4–5 Alabama team in 2001 and a loss to Vanderbilt—the first time Auburn lost to the Commodores in over 50 years. In fact, after dropping three straight SEC games in 2003, Auburn booster Bobby Lowder and Auburn's president and athletic director contacted then Louisville head coach Bobby Petrino to gauge his interest in taking the Auburn job if Tuberville was fired.

{"input": "", "context": "Paragraph 1: The paceman was rested for the match against Derbyshire immediately after the Headingley Test, which Australia won by an innings. Lindwall returned for the match against Glamorgan and took 2/36 in a rain-affected draw that did not reach the second innings. In the next match against Warwickshire, he claimed 3/27 in the first innings, taking three consecutive middle-order wickets—including Test batsmen Tom Dollery and Abdul Hafeez Kardar—in the space of 12 balls as the hosts fell for 138. In reply, Australia stumbled to 6/161 when Lindwall joined Hassett. The pair put on 70 for the seventh wicket, the largest partnership in a low-scoring match. Lindwall ended with 45, the second highest score for the entire match, as Australia took a 116-run lead. He took the first wicket and ended with 1/32 as Bradman's men won by nine wickets. Australia proceeded to face Lancashire at Old Trafford for the second time during the season in a match that doubled as Washbrook's benefit. Lindwall made 17 in the tourists' first innings of 321 and then dismissed the home side's first three batsmen, taking 3/32 as Lancashire fell for 130. Washbrook top-scored with 38 before Lindwall had him caught in the slips by Miller. He also collected several painful bruises from Lindwall on his right hand and thumb. Bradman described his leading paceman as being in \"stupendous form ... I have not seen before or since such sustained brilliance from a pace bowler\". Australia made 3/265 declared in their second innings, leaving the hosts with a target of 457 in less than a day, with Washbrook unable to bat due to Lindwall's bruising bowling. Lindwall bowled both openers with the new ball, but Lancashire appeared to be safely batting out a draw at 5/191 with only eight minutes remaining. Lindwall returned after Bradman took the new ball, and told the slip cordon to move halfway back to the boundary. Bowling with a tailwind, Lindwall was at full pace, in one of the fastest displays Bradman had seen in his long career. He bowled Jack Ikin for 99 and Dick Pollard—who later claimed to have not seen the ball—for a golden duck. The hosts were in danger of suffering a late collapse and defeat, but William Roberts successfully defended the hat-trick ball; Lancashire lost no further wickets and were 7/191 when stumps were drawn; Lindwall ended with 4/27. He also caused Washbrook to miss the final Test with a thumb injury. The paceman was rested from the non-first-class match against Durham, which was a rain-affected draw.\n\nParagraph 2: He uses another single individual, John the Baptist to talk about \"the rising and setting of the sun.\" He says, \"all deeper and more inward self-knowledge sees the finger of God that points to him.\" John was \"the voice crying in the wilderness\", then the \"morning star\" came and his disciples were sad because people were going to him and John said, \"He must increase; I must decrease.\" John was willing to step aside because \"he knew that the ceremony after which he was named would be abolished, would disappear as a baptism with water in contrast to a baptism with fire and the Holy Spirit.\"When a common danger stands at everyone's door, when a common calamity teaches people to hold together and drums reconciliation into them, then it certainly is seen how they are reconciled in the understanding of the same things and how this reconciliation would benefit them jointly and would benefit the individual.

It was not even with his replacement of the name of Dussart who sought to impose the Leopold administration on Kwango even by force. It was then that in 1892 and 1893 there were two wars ranked between the two armies, that of the Kabamba  faustin and that of the Leopoldian administration in which there were considerable losses on both sides. If the principal Belgian agent perished in the first war of 1892, the one which followed in 1893 with a greater reinforcement of soldiers of the public force saw the assassination of the Kabamba  faustin. It was also the beginning of the destabilization of the kings, but not that of the kingdom or the resistance. In fact, the kings who were enthroned after this revolting event showed themselves more intransigent with respect to submission to the power of whites. Thus, faced with repression, they had the choice either to go into exile with their brothers, the Lunda of Angola, or to undergo forced relegation to Banningville or elsewhere. Mulombo kings Désiré Nkulu and Chief Munene Nkenzi were deported respectively, while the kabamba Koko Kodia Puanga found refuge in Angola in 1915. After the two bloody wars of 1892 and 1893, when the Kwango was militarily armed, the resistance assumed passive form. This took many forms, ranging from the subtle violence by leopard men \"Masiona\" to civil disobedience and the refusal to serve any power of oppression, to participate in any enterprise or to obey any colonial injunction. It was this passive resistance that continued throughout the colonial era until independence. When in 1908, Leopold II ceded the Congo to Belgium, the colonial administration, to whom the narrative of the resistance Yaka had already been made, tried to occupy the Kwango by force, but she stumbled upon the civil resistance whose main manifestation was the refusal of cooperation with the colonial agents. Even after the assassination in 1893 of the kabamba Tsiimba Nkumbi, under which open resistance was waged, the Bayaka continued civic resistance. Because of the unfortunate incidents of the conflict, and after 2 years of colonial military siege, the colonial mission in Kwango was abandoned. By way of punishment and fear\n\nParagraph 4: The baronetcy expired on the death of the last Sir William, the 5th Baronet, without issue in 1795. He was succeeded by his nephew, William Thomas Darby Esq., the son of Vice-Admiral George Darby, who assumed the surname and arms of St. Quintin in 1795. Between 1795 and 1801 William Thomas commissioned the architect Thomas Leverton to extensively remodel the hall in the Regency style, with fine Regency interiors. On his early death in 1805 it passed to his 7-year-old son William (1798-1859). William lived mainly in London but returned to Scampston when he was appointed High Sheriff of Yorkshire in 1850. He died childless in 1859 and was succeeded by his brother, Matthew Chitty Downes St. Quintin, a JP and colonel of the 17th Lancers. Matthew became mentally ill and spent much of what remained of the family fortune, dying in 1876. His son William Herbert St. Quintin, born in 1851, was a Justice of the Peace from 1875 to his death and an alderman from 1889. He was appointed High Sheriff of Yorkshire for 1899–1900 and Deputy Lieutenant of the East Riding. He was also a keen naturalist. On his death in 1933 the St. Quintin name died out and the estate passed into the hands of the Lestrange Malone family, as his daughter Margery had married Lt. Col. Edmund George S. L'Estrange Malone in 1910.\n\nParagraph 5: He uses another single individual, John the Baptist to talk about \"the rising and setting of the sun.\" He says, \"all deeper and more inward self-knowledge sees the finger of God that points to him.\" John was \"the voice crying in the wilderness\", then the \"morning star\" came and his disciples were sad because people were going to him and John said, \"He must increase; I must decrease.\" John was willing to step aside because \"he knew that the ceremony after which he was named would be abolished, would disappear as a baptism with water in contrast to a baptism with fire and the Holy Spirit.\"When a common danger stands at everyone's door, when a common calamity teaches people to hold together and drums reconciliation into them, then it certainly is seen how they are reconciled in the understanding of the same things and how this reconciliation would benefit them jointly and would benefit the individual.

Kokone lives with her single father Momotarō; her mother perished in an accident while Kokone was still young, and Kokone complains that her father never told her much about her mother.  Momotarō is an eccentric car mechanic and has a jacket similar to Peach's, a blue stuffed dog, a motorcycle, and a cracked tablet, all similar to the ones seen in Kokone's dreams.  The situation takes a turn for the worse when Momotarō is unceremoniously arrested three days prior to the 2020 Tokyo Olympics and accused of stealing the car company Shijima Motors' secrets.  A suited figure who looks identical to the Heartland king's evil adviser visits the Morikawa home, and is overheard to be searching for both the tablet and Kokone.  Via text message from jail, Momotarō warns his daughter not to trust the adviser, who is named Watanabe.  The message includes a picture of a younger Momotarō, his wife, and Watanabe.  With Morio's help, Kokone evades Watanabe and his men and recovers the stolen tablet and bear doll, driving away in the family's motorcycle.  They also discover a business card for Isshin Shijima, the chairman of Shijima Motors, and consider visiting him for help after Kokone is told that her mother, Ikumi, was the daughter of the chairman.  The two take a nap in the motorcycle, visit Heartland where they dream of the motorcycle soaring through the sky, and are surprised to find on waking up that the motorcycle has driven itself to Osaka overnight before running out of gas.  Kokone's attempts to contact her father via the tablet seemingly fail, but surprisingly enough, the \"magic\" seems to work in the real world when a request to the tablet's e-Heart chat for train tickets results in an attendant giving them paid-for Shinkansen tickets to Tokyo.  There, Kokone seeks an audience with the chairman, while Morio learns that mechanics from Shijima Motors were the ones who saw Kokone's message and had bought the tickets for the pair.  The mechanics explain that after the chairman's daughter had a falling out with her father and eloped with Momotarō, they used this chat to keep in contact with Momotarō, who had been continuing his wife's self-driving car programming and research.  Ikumi had run a project researching self-driving car technology years ago, but Ikumi's father, as chairman, refused her proposal at the time.\n\nParagraph 7: Postflight analysis of the back-to-back failures found that in each case, the missile had fallen victim to rough combustion in one booster engine, which destroyed the LOX injector head (the injector damage on 51D was more extensive than 48D) and started a thrust section fire. In both missiles, the rough combustion cutoff sensor in the B-1 engine failed to operate. On 48D, the rough combustion did not occur in that engine and the lack of RCC cutoff was not a problem (B-1 thrust was terminated instead by the turbopump overspeed sensor). The B-2 RCC sensor operated correctly and terminated thrust before liftoff could be achieved. On 51D, it resulted in the B-1 continuing to operate until the missile lifted, resulting in a destructive pad fallback. The exact reason for the rough combustion was unclear, although it had occurred over a dozen times in static firing tests of the MA-2 engines. However, it was noted that the separate exhaust duct for the gas generator vent pipe had been removed from both LC-11 and LC-13 after engineers decided that it was unnecessary and impeded removal and installation of protective covers on the pipe during ground testing. It could not be determined with certainty if the lack of an exhaust duct had anything to do with the failures, and in any case, camera coverage did not offer any evidence in support of this theory. Nonetheless, it was decided to put the exhaust duct back on the Atlas pads at CCAS in order to comply with the configuration of operational Atlas missile silos, and as a \"just in case\" measure. Adjustments to the insulation boots on both missile was also ruled out as a probable cause of the failures. Aside from re-installing the exhaust duct, camera coverage of the flame deflector pit at ignition would also be increased and greater efforts made to ensure that the booster engines were free of contaminants. An added backup accelerometer was added to the RCC sensors in case of a failure. Two launch facilities were now in need of repair. LC-13 was severely damaged by the fallback of 51D and would not be used again for six months, while damage to LC-11 was less extensive and repairs were completed in only two months. After restoration, LC-13 was converted for the Atlas E and would not host further D-series tests. Attention shifted to LC-12 where Atlas 56D flew over  with an instrumented nose cone, impacting the Indian Ocean.\n\nParagraph 8: To find out whether the PVA intended to occupy the outpost, the regimental intelligence officer ordered the 2nd Battalion to send a platoon as quickly as possible from E Company to reconnoiter the hill. The patrol cleared the Jamestown Line shortly before daylight on the 19th, but soon ran into machine gun and rifle grenade fire as it advanced up the hill. Convinced that the PVA planned to remain, Colonel Cordero made an assessment of the situation. The heavy mortar fire and the attack that had followed had badly depleted B Company, although there might be some remnants of the company still on the hill. He assumed that the PVA now held the position with small arms, light machine guns and light mortars. There was a waist-deep, circular trench that ringed the military crest of the hill completely and four bunkers. At the base of the hill, on the approaches, the PVA had established combat outposts of squad size. Colonel Betances, the 2nd Battalion commander, ordered two platoons from E Company to advance on Kelly on the morning of 20 September. By late afternoon one platoon had fought its way to the top. The second was still on the porters' trail moving forward slowly. The PVA, however, had no intention of surrendering possession of Kelly for they quickly sent reinforcements to bolster their defending forces. The platoon on the hill began to take casualties from the small arms, machine gun and mortar fire, and the second platoon was forced to fall back as it encountered similar PVA opposition on its way to the crest. Faced with the PVA determination to hang on to the outpost and the mounting casualty list, the two platoons withdrew to the Jamestown Line. In the meantime, the 1st Battalion prepared to counterattack through the 2nd Battalion's positions. During the evening of 20 September, A Company, under 1st Lt. St. Clair Streett, Jr., moved forward to take up the attack from the south and C Company advanced to the base of the hill on which Kelly was located. The PVA mortar and artillery became very heavy as the men crossed the valley floor en route to the hill approaches. As the two companies began their ascent, B Company moved forward toward the outpost line to support the attack. Mortar fire came in swiftly and with deadly effect as casualties cut the strength of B Company to twenty-six men and forced the cancellation of the company mission. The PVA fire was also taking its toll of A and C Companies. In addition, the PVA used time-fuzed artillery fire as the 1st Battalion troops edged their way to the top. The airbursts over the heads of A and C Company were demoralizing and caused panic. Lieutenant Streett had to fall back and reorganize A Company, while C Company clung to a finger of the hill with two platoons. A and C Companies totaled about 60 men each at this juncture, while the PVA had an estimated 100 men on the hill and was reinforcing freely. A UN artillery barrage pounded the PVA positions on Kelly early in the morning of 21 September. But when the remnants of A and C Companies tried to close in on the PVA positions, they were met with small arms fire and hand grenades. Two squads from C Company almost reached the crest of Kelly shortly before noon only to receive mortar concentrations that forced them to fall back to the trenches. No sooner had the PVA mortar fire ceased when the Chinese counterattacked and forced C Company to pull out completely. In the early afternoon A, B and C Companies were ordered to return to their company areas. They had suffered over seventy casualties in the fight for Kelly. That night the 1st Battalion relieved the 3rd Battalion and the action around Kelly slowed down for several days.\n\nParagraph 9: Madhavananda became a trustee of the Ramakrishna Math and a member of the governing body of the Ramakrishna Mission in 1922. He was called back to India in 1929 to serve as a Joint Secretary of the Order. He was appointed General Secretary in May 1938 and remained in that position until he was appointed Vice President in March 1962. His tenure as general secretary was an all-time high of 24 years. After the demise of Vishuddhananda, he became the President of the Order on August 4, 1962. As the President of the Order, Madhavananda presided over the Birth Centenary Celebrations of Vivekananda in 1963.\n\nParagraph 10: A species, Styracosaurus ovatus, from the Two Medicine Formation of Montana, was described by Gilmore in 1930, named for a partial parietal under the accession number USNM 11869. Unlike S. albertensis, the longest parietal spikes converge towards their tips, instead of projecting parallel behind the frill. There also may only have been two sets of spikes on each side of the frill, instead of three. As estimated from the preserved material, the spikes are much shorter than in S. albertensis, with the longest only  long. An additional specimen from the Two Medicine Formation was referred to Styracosaurus ovatus in 2010 by Andrew McDonald and John Horner, having been found earlier in 1986 but not described until that year. Known from a premaxilla, the nasal bones and their horncore, a postorbital bone and a parietal, the specimen Museum of the Rockies 492 was considered to share the medially-converging parietal spikes with the only other specimen of S. ovatus, the holotype. Following this additional material, the species was added to a phylogenetic analysis where it was found to group not with Styracosaurus albertensis, but in a clade including Pachyrhinosaurus, Einiosaurus and Achelousaurus, and therefore McDonald and Horner gave the species the new genus name Rubeosaurus. Another specimen, the partial immature skull USNM 14768, which was earlier referred to the undiagnostic genus Brachyceratops, was also referred to Rubeosaurus ovatus by McDonald and colleagues in 2011. While the medial spikes of USNM 14768 were too incomplete to show if it shared the convergence seen in other R. ovatus specimens, it was considered to be the same species as it was also found in the older deposits of the Two Medicine Formation, and had a unique combination of parietal features only shared completely with the other specimens of the species.\n\nParagraph 11: In normal Japan, Kokone is finishing up her school term, considering where to go to college, and reconnecting with old friend Morio who has returned from Tokyo from his first year in college.  Kokone lives with her single father Momotarō; her mother perished in an accident while Kokone was still young, and Kokone complains that her father never told her much about her mother.  Momotarō is an eccentric car mechanic and has a jacket similar to Peach's, a blue stuffed dog, a motorcycle, and a cracked tablet, all similar to the ones seen in Kokone's dreams.  The situation takes a turn for the worse when Momotarō is unceremoniously arrested three days prior to the 2020 Tokyo Olympics and accused of stealing the car company Shijima Motors' secrets.  A suited figure who looks identical to the Heartland king's evil adviser visits the Morikawa home, and is overheard to be searching for both the tablet and Kokone.  Via text message from jail, Momotarō warns his daughter not to trust the adviser, who is named Watanabe.  The message includes a picture of a younger Momotarō, his wife, and Watanabe.  With Morio's help, Kokone evades Watanabe and his men and recovers the stolen tablet and bear doll, driving away in the family's motorcycle.  They also discover a business card for Isshin Shijima, the chairman of Shijima Motors, and consider visiting him for help after Kokone is told that her mother, Ikumi, was the daughter of the chairman.  The two take a nap in the motorcycle, visit Heartland where they dream of the motorcycle soaring through the sky, and are surprised to find on waking up that the motorcycle has driven itself to Osaka overnight before running out of gas.  Kokone's attempts to contact her father via the tablet seemingly fail, but surprisingly enough, the \"magic\" seems to work in the real world when a request to the tablet's e-Heart chat for train tickets results in an attendant giving them paid-for Shinkansen tickets to Tokyo.  There, Kokone seeks an audience with the chairman, while Morio learns that mechanics from Shijima Motors were the ones who saw Kokone's message and had bought the tickets for the pair.  The mechanics explain that after the chairman's daughter had a falling out with her father and eloped with Momotarō, they used this chat to keep in contact with Momotarō, who had been continuing his wife's self-driving car programming and research.  Ikumi had run a project researching self-driving car technology years ago, but Ikumi's father, as chairman, refused her proposal at the time.\n\nParagraph 12: The baronetcy expired on the death of the last Sir William, the 5th Baronet, without issue in 1795. He was succeeded by his nephew, William Thomas Darby Esq., the son of Vice-Admiral George Darby, who assumed the surname and arms of St. Quintin in 1795. Between 1795 and 1801 William Thomas commissioned the architect Thomas Leverton to extensively remodel the hall in the Regency style, with fine Regency interiors. On his early death in 1805 it passed to his 7-year-old son William (1798-1859). William lived mainly in London but returned to Scampston when he was appointed High Sheriff of Yorkshire in 1850. He died childless in 1859 and was succeeded by his brother, Matthew Chitty Downes St. Quintin, a JP and colonel of the 17th Lancers. Matthew became mentally ill and spent much of what remained of the family fortune, dying in 1876. His son William Herbert St. Quintin, born in 1851, was a Justice of the Peace from 1875 to his death and an alderman from 1889. He was appointed High Sheriff of Yorkshire for 1899–1900 and Deputy Lieutenant of the East Riding. He was also a keen naturalist. On his death in 1933 the St. Quintin name died out and the estate passed into the hands of the Lestrange Malone family, as his daughter Margery had married Lt. Col. Edmund George S. L'Estrange Malone in 1910.\n\nParagraph 13: The baronetcy expired on the death of the last Sir William, the 5th Baronet, without issue in 1795.

However, Blast is unsatisfied and instructs some of his mercenaries to abduct Yim and force him to transfer HK$1 billion to Blast's bank account before killing him. In the meantime, Blast also captured Carmen and tied her inside the trunk of a taxi with a grenade in her hand, but Cheung finds and rescues her at a gas station. Blast then demands two helicopters for him to leave a Hong Kong with a couple of hostages including Cheung, and sets off the timer for the 1,000 kg of C4 to go off in an hour until the helicopters arrive. Cheung then wears some C4 explosives around him and enters the tunnel, threatening Blast to hand out the remote for the 1,000 kg of C4, which startles a couple of the mercenaries and ignites a gunfight where Cheung shoots Blast's leg, while Kong's squad and the Special Duties Unit rush in and takes down the mercenaries while evacuating the civilians, where Kai-piu and a some officers and hostages were killed. Amidst the chaos, Blast shoots Cheung's leg in retaliation and the two exchange fire where Blasts destroys the remote. Blast gains the upper hand when Cheung runs out of ammo and reloads, but Kong severs Blast's arm and the latter is arrested. Cheung rushes to the Hong Kong Island exit of the tunnel while ordering his subordinate, Ben (Ron Ng) to stay at the Kowloon exit and they find the detonating device of the explosives under the trucks at their respective location, but unable to get a clear view. With less than three minutes before it goes off, Cheung consults the engineer of the tunnel whether the tunnel can sustain 500 kg of C4 exploding, and decides to take a gamble and cut the yellow wire, telling Ben to follow suit if safe. However, the explosives blows up after Cheung cuts the wire, killing him on the spot, so Ben cuts the red wire, but is still heavily injured by the impact. The explosion destroys most of the tunnel but did not affect its structure. Wan announces to reporters that 468 hostages were saved while 38 were killed, along with 43 criminals and 18 officers killed in the incident. Afterwards, Cheung and other slain officers are given burials at the Gallant Garden where Kong, Carmen, Ben and the others mourn the fallen.\n\nParagraph 2: Britain became a fertile ground for further development of the existential approach when R. D. Laing and David Cooper, often associated with the anti-psychiatry movement, took Sartre's existential ideas as the basis for their work (Laing, 1960, 1961; Cooper, 1967; Laing and Cooper, 1964). Without developing a concrete method of therapy, they critically reconsidered the notion of mental illness and its treatment. In the late 1960s, they established an experimental therapeutic community at Kingsley Hall in the East End of London, where people could come to live through their 'madness' without the usual medical treatment. They also founded the Philadelphia Association, an organization providing an alternative living, therapy, and therapeutic training from this perspective. The Philadelphia Association is still in existence today and is now committed to the exploration of the works of philosophers such as Ludwig Wittgenstein, Jacques Derrida, Levinas, and Michel Foucault as well as the work of the French psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan. It also runs some small therapeutic households along these lines. The Arbours Association is another group that grew out of the Kingsley Hall experiment. Founded by Joseph Berke and Schatzman in the 1970s, it now runs a training program in psychotherapy, a crisis center, and several therapeutic communities. The existential input in the Arbours has gradually been replaced with a more neo-Kleinian emphasis.\n\nParagraph 3: Hawkes is a sympathetic soul who is willing to lend an ear to anyone who needs to talk.  During \"Murder Sings the Blues\" (episode 307) he is shown in flashback to have met a girl at a party.  The girl felt unhappy, so Hawkes took her out for a cup of coffee and listened to her tell him her troubles.  Afterwards, he gave her his phone number if she ever felt like she needed to talk to him again.  The girl is found dead two weeks later on board a subway car following a rave party, with Hawkes' phone number still on her person.  Hawkes, when he discovers his phone number in the girl's possession, neglects to tell Mac about his connection to her, which earns him a dressing-down from Mac in front of the entire lab.  Later, Hawkes apologizes to Mac for not disclosing how he knew the victim and tells his story. Their relationship has clearly mended by episode 309 (\"And Here's To You, Mrs Azrael\"), when Mac confides about his father's lingering death from cancer, and Sheldon comforts him. This dialogue also indicates that Hawkes is opposed to euthanasia. On a few episodes, such as \"Hammer Down\", \"It Happened To Me\", and \"Scared Stiff\", Dr. Hawkes tends to get emotional when a murder is medical-related, or if the suspect happens to be a doctor. Hawkes has been the victim of racism while out in the field especially in dealings with white supremacist Micheal Elgers. In \"Green Piece\", Hawkes investigating the bombing of a house, is led to Elgers who is adorned with Nazi tattoos all over his body and other white power propaganda is discovered in Elgers' apartment. Elgers lays into Hawkes calling him inferior, an affirmative action case, but Hawkes stands his ground. In \"Yahrzeit\", Hawkes is faced with the death of his uncle and plans to fly to Michigan for the funeral, however the flight is delayed and Hawkes decides to help the team investigate the murder of an auctioneer. He offers to assist Danny Messer with Messer informing his friend that he's about to question Micheal Elgers. Hawkes defiantly states, \"He's a vicious racist and that's his problem\". Elgers once again targets Hawkes for being black, but like before, Hawkes maintains composure. Hawkes remains in New York long enough to see Elgers arrested for crimes unrelated to the murder before taking his flight to be with his family to honor his uncle.\n\nParagraph 4: The episode is a parody of the VH1 biography series Behind the Music and shares its narrator, Jim Forbes. It begins with the Simpson family history and how they got into show business: believing that families depicted in the numerous TV shows they watch together bear no resemblance to their comparative dysfunctionalism, Homer writes and directs an inadequate video \"pilot\" that fails to attract the attention of the major networks except for Fox, as its president happens to be Marge's hairdresser. After much fine-tuning and on-set mishaps produce many of the show's running gags, The Simpsons''' resounding ratings and merchandising success makes the family extraordinarily wealthy; having moved out of their house on Evergreen Terrace to live in MC Hammer's former mansion, \"Hammertime\" (renamed \"Homertime\"), they expand their scope to include a series of Grammy-winning, \"mega-platinum\" novelty albums.\n\nParagraph 5: The episode is a parody of the VH1 biography series Behind the Music and shares its narrator, Jim Forbes.

Afterwards, he gave her his phone number if she ever felt like she needed to talk to him again.  The girl is found dead two weeks later on board a subway car following a rave party, with Hawkes' phone number still on her person.  Hawkes, when he discovers his phone number in the girl's possession, neglects to tell Mac about his connection to her, which earns him a dressing-down from Mac in front of the entire lab.  Later, Hawkes apologizes to Mac for not disclosing how he knew the victim and tells his story. Their relationship has clearly mended by episode 309 (\"And Here's To You, Mrs Azrael\"), when Mac confides about his father's lingering death from cancer, and Sheldon comforts him. This dialogue also indicates that Hawkes is opposed to euthanasia. On a few episodes, such as \"Hammer Down\", \"It Happened To Me\", and \"Scared Stiff\", Dr. Hawkes tends to get emotional when a murder is medical-related, or if the suspect happens to be a doctor. Hawkes has been the victim of racism while out in the field especially in dealings with white supremacist Micheal Elgers. In \"Green Piece\", Hawkes investigating the bombing of a house, is led to Elgers who is adorned with Nazi tattoos all over his body and other white power propaganda is discovered in Elgers' apartment. Elgers lays into Hawkes calling him inferior, an affirmative action case, but Hawkes stands his ground. In \"Yahrzeit\", Hawkes is faced with the death of his uncle and plans to fly to Michigan for the funeral, however the flight is delayed and Hawkes decides to help the team investigate the murder of an auctioneer. He offers to assist Danny Messer with Messer informing his friend that he's about to question Micheal Elgers. Hawkes defiantly states, \"He's a vicious racist and that's his problem\". Elgers once again targets Hawkes for being black, but like before, Hawkes maintains composure. Hawkes remains in New York long enough to see Elgers arrested for crimes unrelated to the murder before taking his flight to be with his family to honor his uncle.", "answers": ["6"], "length": 4831, "dataset": "passage_count_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "399c1693d887bc15ed45f43ac7d8fcac1ec208a003abb0c5"}
{"input": "", "context": "Paragraph 1: Upon the division of Vietnam in 1954 into North and South, Quảng Trị became the northernmost province of the Republic of Vietnam. The Vietnamese Demilitarized Zone lay in the province. Beginning 1964, the province gradually became a center for American bases, particularly after October 1966, when the 3rd Marine Division moved to bases just south of the demilitarized zone. In 1966, North Vietnamese forces also began occupying the northern region and pushing deeper into the province. The provincial capital, Quảng Trị City, was overrun and occupied briefly by Communist troops in April 1967, and was a principal battleground during the 1968 Tet Offensive when it was again overrun by North Vietnamese troops and held for a short period before being recaptured by South Vietnamese government and U.S. forces. The Battle of Khe Sanh (1968) was a part of the North's steady efforts to occupy the whole of the province. After Khe Sanh was evacuated in July 1968, the North Vietnamese continued their efforts to take the entire province. The most notable achievement of the North Vietnamese offensive in 1972 was capturing Quảng Trị (First Battle of Quảng Trị), although they lost much of the territory gained during the South Vietnamese counter-offensive from June through September 1972 (Second Battle of Quảng Trị).\n\nParagraph 2: Feminist researchers often use unstructured interviews as opposed to more structured interview in terms of research techniques because it attempts to eliminate power imbalances in the relationship between the interviewer and the interviewee. Some feminist researchers are influenced by the works of writer and researcher, Ann Oakley, who pioneered an interview methodology based on an anti-oppression framework. Oakley argues that the form of structured interviews positions the interviewee as a subordinate, which supports the masculine \"paradigm of inquiry\" and produces a \"perfect interview\" that is \"morally indefensible\". As an alternative, Oakley writes that \"the best way to find out about someone else's lives is through non-hierarchical relationships where the interviewer is prepared to invest their own personal identity in the research relationship, answering questions and sharing knowledge\". Oakley argues that interviews need to be conducted as equal relationships so that the research can lead to a retrieval of more fruitful and significant data. Together, Howard Becker and Oakley have argued that interviews should be more natural and more like an everyday conversation. Oakley argues that traditional guidelines contradict the aims of feminist research and that for a feminist interviewing women, the \"use of prescribed interviewing practice is morally indefensible [and] general and irreconcilable contradictions at the heart of the textbook are exposed\". This approach is viewed by many contemporary researchers as ethically responsible and it is very relevant in terms of developing research approaches that are grounded by the experience of in minorities. \"Feminists have argued that the production of atomistic 'facts' and figures fracture people's lives\" and letting others speak for themselves allows work to be produced which challenges stereotypes, oppression, and exploitation. Only one small part of experience is abstracted typically from structured interviews and questionnaires as the focus for attention as it is only \"a simple matrix of standardized variables which is unable to convey an in-depth understanding of, feeling of, the people under the study\". To break down imbalances of power within the relationships of the interviewer and the interviewee, the unstructured interview approach to research maximizes the ability to explore a full account of life experience. It can be seen that the principle belief of feminist research \"must begin with an open-ended exploration of women's experiences, since only from that vantage point is it possible to see how their world is organized and the extent to which it differs from that of men\". It is also important to note that this approach to research is used to explore life experience from those belonging to all other minority groups.\n\nParagraph 3: Another manifestation of this changing social landscape was the rise of mass discontent, including the radical student movement, both in the United States – where it was driven mainly by opposition to the Vietnam War, and in Europe. Aside from the Civil Rights Movement, in which socialists participated, the anti-war movement was the first left-wing upsurge in the United States since the 1930s, but neither there nor in Europe did the traditional parties of the left lead the movement. In the mid-20th century some libertarian socialist groups emerged from disagreements with Trotskyism which presented itself as Leninist anti-stalinism. As such the French group Socialisme ou Barbarie emerged from the Trotskyist Fourth International, where Castoriadis and Claude Lefort constituted a Chaulieu–Montal Tendency in the French Parti Communiste Internationaliste in 1946. In 1948, they experienced their \"final disenchantment with Trotskyism\", leading them to break away to form Socialisme ou Barbarie, whose journal began appearing in March 1949. Castoriadis later said of this period that \"the main audience of the group and of the journal was formed by groups of the old, radical left: Bordigists, council communists, some anarchists and some offspring of the German \"left\" of the 1920s\". Instead Trotskyist, Maoist and anarchist groups arose. They became particularly influential in 1968, when riots amounting almost to an insurrection broke out in Paris in May 1968. Between eight and ten million workers struck, challenging the view becoming popular amongst socialists at the time that the working class were no longer a force for change. There were also major disturbances such as the 1968 Democratic National Convention protest activity in Chicago, the Columbia University protests of 1968 in New York, the embryonic Red Army Faction in West Berlin, and in other cities. In the short-term these movements provoked a conservative backlash, seen in De Gaulle's 1968 election victory and the election of Richard Nixon in the 1968 United States presidential election. In the 1970s, as particularly the far left Trotskyist groups continued to grow, the socialist and Communist parties again sought to channel people's anger back into safe confines, as they did in 1945. The British Labour Party had already returned to office under Harold Wilson in 1964, and in 1969 the German Social Democrats came to power for the first time since the 1920s under Willy Brandt. In France François Mitterrand buried the corpse of the old socialist party, the SFIO, and founded a new Socialist Party in 1971, although it would take him a decade to lead it to power. Labour governments were elected in both Australia and New Zealand in 1972, and the Austrian Socialists under Bruno Kreisky formed their first post-war government in 1970.\n\nParagraph 4: The 1906 World Series was the championship series in Major League Baseball for the 1906 season. The third edition of the World Series, it featured a crosstown matchup between the American League champion Chicago White Sox and the National League champion Chicago Cubs. The Cubs had posted the highest regular-season win total (116) and winning percentage (.763) in the major leagues since the advent of the 154-game season. The White Sox, known as the \"Hitless Wonders\" after finishing with the worst team batting average (.230) in the American League, beat the Cubs in six games for one of the greatest upsets in Series history as the Sox out-pitched the Cubs in their first two wins and out-hit them in their last two. The home teams alternated, starting with the National League Cubs being home in Game 1.\n\nParagraph 5: Another manifestation of this changing social landscape was the rise of mass discontent, including the radical student movement, both in the United States – where it was driven mainly by opposition to the Vietnam War, and in Europe.

He is visited by a Jean Grey in distress. She asks him how he managed to stop hurting people; he explains that he stopped killing because he had already slain many in revenge and it ultimately didn't make him feel any better. He notices blood on her shirt and asks whose blood it is, but she refuses to answer. U.S. military forces arrive, but the target turns out to be Jean and not Lehnsherr, and she responds violently, forcing Lehnsherr  to use his own powers to stop her from doing further damage. After she forces the troops to withdraw, Lehnsherr banishes Jean from Genosha, explaining that he's protecting its citizens from her. Hank McCoy then seeks Lehnsherr out, revealing that she killed Raven, and he now wants Lehnsherr's help in finding the out of control Jean to put an end to her rampage. After some more talk, Lehnsherr retrieves a duplicate of his old helmet that En Sabah Nur made for him and prepares for the confrontation. Erik meets Charles Xavier and some of the X-Men outside the house where Jean is; Xavier warns Erik that if the public sees the mutants fighting each others on the street, they will see them as \"violent freaks\", and all they had achieved for mankind's tolerance of them may be lost. In spite of this, Hank, Erik and a few of his Genoshian compatriots prepare to storm the mansion, causing the very damage Xavier warned them about. Inside the mansion, Erik finds Jean in company with Vuk, a woman unknown to him. He attempts to kill Jean, but she fights back, breaks his helmet and telekinetically throws him out of the building. Lehnsherr and his fellow mutants are captured by the military, who put collars on them to negate their powers and put them on a train. Unknown assailants arrive, in league with Vuk; they are all revealed to be alien shapeshifters who once lost their home planet to the Phoenix Force and now hope to exploit the flawed Jean, its newest host, with the hopes of clearing the Earth to be their new home. After the military is bested, a soldier on board disables the mutants' collars, allowing them to defeat the aliens. After the battle, Erik meets with Charles as a friend, bringing with him a chess board and finally reconciles from their old differences.\n\nParagraph 7: Another manifestation of this changing social landscape was the rise of mass discontent, including the radical student movement, both in the United States – where it was driven mainly by opposition to the Vietnam War, and in Europe.

When Lolo resists, Tin Lid calls in the \"Hyena Men\" (Security) to \"Trank\" (Sedate) her. It is revealed that Tin Lid works for a man called Doctor Dearly, who runs the Bin. The children hate him because Dearly made Mrs Murdoe \"go takeaway\" (In this instance, it means he sacked her, but it in others, it means dying). Mrs Murdoe then became a spirit guide for the children, along with a law-abiding moose's head called Moose (As he doesn't move for them, the children refer to being tired as \"moosed\" or \"moosed out\") and a fast cat called Jack. It's also revealed that there were other children once, but eventually, they all \"went takeaway\" (died) and went to the \"Sky Boat\" (Heaven). Their death was caused by warts appearing over their bodies (\"lumpies\") At one point, a child with two heads is mentioned, but not exposited on. All of the children live their lives in near-identical ways, watching a TV movie called the Natural World, (A running plot point is a leopard attacking a group of monkeys), and looking out of a window, (which isn't allowed, so they have to hide it) named The Weather Eye. Meanwhile, in the city outside the Bin, a young man named Nail meets a girl called Natalie while trying to steal from her shop. They strike up a relationship, because of each other's hatred of society. They do jobs to and from the Bin. Cough Cough is getting weaker, and eventually, slowly goes blind. He has warning against Dearly, saying he is trying to kill them all. He reveals that he has given each of them a syringe and is keeping several pills. The others do not believe him until Dearly takes away books and TV, saying it is bad for their eyes. Dearly exposits to X-Ray that he plans to take one of his eyes and transplant it to CC. However, this is postponed due to X-Ray regurgitating on Dearly. When X-Ray tells CC about this, he explains that he has stashed away four syringes and enough pills to kill all of the nurses, he tells them to escape. Eventually, CC \"goes takeaway\" (dies) during an operation on his eye. X-Ray eventually finds out that CC poisoned himself with some pills and when he explains his theory to Chicken Angel, she tells him that they helped him. Angry, he forgets to hide the Weather Eye, and when Tin Lid sees, she also discovers a diary that CA has been writing in, a coloured pencil to write with, a book and a clock that Lolo calls \"Maiden China\" (She mishears CC saying what's written on it earlier on, Made in China). As Tin Lid is about to \"trank\" Lolo (give her an injection), X-Ray, stabs Tin Lid with her syringe and runs away with CA and Lolo. Meanwhile, Nail and Natalie visit the Bin, Nat finds the children and stows them away in the back of their van. Nat later tells Nail, and listens to the children's tales of horror inside the Bin. After convincing Nail to take the children to the ocean (where they think they will find the \"Sky Boat\") they set out, with Nail still worried that they will be arrested for abduction, paedophilia and possibly murder if they do not cure Lolo's case of the \"lumpies\". On the way, they find Mrs Murdoe's son, a chief ranger, and X-Ray and CA both get the lumpies. The book ends with them reaching the ocean, and holding hands, waiting for death.\n\nParagraph 11: The West Porch is the best entrance to use to access the cathedral.  Once inside six steps lead down to the floor of the nave and from here one has a good view of the altar erected at the crossing of the transept. The west porch was first built in the 15th century at the time the south tower was erected and was completely rebuilt in 1888. The west porch gable dates to the 13th century but was reworked in the 14th century and a rose window was added in the 16th century. Two doors give access to the cathedral, and the trumeau is decorated with a standing Virgin Mary which came from the Chapelle Saint-Colomban in Peumerit-Quintin. The North porch is known as the  \"du Matray\" and was reconstructed in 1856. The tympanum is decorated with \"Une Vierge à l'oiseau\" in polychromed wood. The Sacristy was added between the arm of the transept and the north aisle of the nave in the 15th century.The north gable of the transept has a large window destroyed during the French Revolution and completely replaced in 1852. It is topped by a clock tower dating to 1836 which replaced an earlier tower dated 1618. The cathedral has two towers. The Tour du Nordic  or the Tour Brieuc is 28 metres high and holds two bells. The Tour du Midi is higher at 33 metres and holds three bells. The latter tower was built in the 15th-century partly as a consequence of the sieges of 1375 and 1394 and its spire was added in 1852. The gable of the north transept built with much red granite quarried in the local area has a modern window, the old window having been destroyed in the French revolution. The gable is topped by an 18th-century clock, and for many years this was the only clock in the town. \n\nParagraph 12: Upon the division of Vietnam in 1954 into North and South, Quảng Trị became the northernmost province of the Republic of Vietnam.

{"input": "", "context": "Paragraph 1: The book was given a mildly positive review on the Pro Wrestling Torch podcast on May 3, 2011. Todd Martin ranked it as a solid read. Dante Spears of CultOfWhatever stated in his review that he felt that the book was more a biography of Harts entire family and a history of the family's territory Stampede more than a book about Hart himself, which he found enjoyable. He expresses that the stories told in the book about Hart's family, life and career were all very interesting. David Bixenspan of CageSide Seats criticized the book concerning Hart recollection of many events, especially ones about Bret, stating: \"The book is filled with statements that often come off as pretty out there, whether it's bad memory or an agenda or something else. A lot of these center around his brother Bret. The most outlandish-sounding claim is that when their mother Helen was on her deathbed and an hour away from dying, Bret entered her hospital room, saw his sister Diana (who had just written a controversial book about the family that was eventually recalled when Owen's widow Martha took legal action), and literally reached over his dying mother to grab his sister by the neck. Bruce then goes on to say that security guards had to pull Bret off and remove him from the room. When reached for comment, Bret's representatives told me that “Bret has no recollection of anything like that happening. In fact, when Helen died, he elected not to go to the hospital the night she died. In other words, what Bruce wrote is completely false.” (Also, in his book, Bret noted that Helen died at 3:30 AM local time while he was lying awake in bed.) A few sources who are well connected to the family told me that they had never heard the story before\". Another example Bixenspan noted was that Hart's description of how he met his future wife Andrea did not at all coincide with the event was told in Heath McCoy's acclaimed book Pain and Passion: The History of Stampede Wrestling which portrays Hart as meeting her when he was a substitute teacher at her school. Despite this, he stated that the early parts of the book with stories of the Hart family were very much enjoyable. Writing for the Seattle Post-Intelligencer Glen Boyd expresses that Hart's book, on one hand, offers a fascinating inside look at the professional wrestling industry, with its colorful cast of characters and equally cutthroat behind the scenes politics but that it also serves as a forum for Hart to air some of his own issues in public, Boyd felt that if one reads between the lines it becomes \"not hard to see through Hart's often harsh criticisms of his more famous siblings (this is especially true in the case of his brother younger Bret \"Hitman\" Hart), as not being at least a little colored by his own professional jealousy.\" Nonetheless, Boyd states that the book comes off as a candid retelling of Hart's life and that it often feels like reading a diary. Bret has dismissed many of the stories in the book, including claims that his signature look with black and pink duds and dark shades was inspired by Bruce.\n\nParagraph 2: The book was given a mildly positive review on the Pro Wrestling Torch podcast on May 3, 2011.

Despite this, he stated that the early parts of the book with stories of the Hart family were very much enjoyable. Writing for the Seattle Post-Intelligencer Glen Boyd expresses that Hart's book, on one hand, offers a fascinating inside look at the professional wrestling industry, with its colorful cast of characters and equally cutthroat behind the scenes politics but that it also serves as a forum for Hart to air some of his own issues in public, Boyd felt that if one reads between the lines it becomes \"not hard to see through Hart's often harsh criticisms of his more famous siblings (this is especially true in the case of his brother younger Bret \"Hitman\" Hart), as not being at least a little colored by his own professional jealousy.\" Nonetheless, Boyd states that the book comes off as a candid retelling of Hart's life and that it often feels like reading a diary. Bret has dismissed many of the stories in the book, including claims that his signature look with black and pink duds and dark shades was inspired by Bruce.\n\nParagraph 3: \"Their kings are not permanent. They select and appoint the most worthy man. If there are unexpected calamities in the kingdom, such as frequent extraordinary winds or rains, he is unceremoniously rejected and replaced. The one who has been dismissed quietly accepts his demotion, and is not angry. The people of this country are all tall and honest.

They make gold and silver coins. Ten silver coins are worth one gold coin. They trade with Anxi [Parthia] and Tianzhu [Northwest India] by sea. The profit margin is ten to one. ... The king of this country always wanted to send envoys to Han, but Anxi [Parthia], wishing to control the trade in multi-coloured Chinese silks, blocked the route to prevent [the Romans] getting through [to China].\"\n\nParagraph 4: \"Their kings are not permanent.

In 1709, a great flood overflowed Fort Louis de la Mobile: because of this and the outbreaks of disease, Bienville ordered the settlement to move downriver to the present site of Mobile, Alabama in 1711 where another wooden Fort Louis was built. By 1712, when Antoine Crozat took over administration of Louisiana by royal appointment, the colony boasted a population of 400 persons. In 1713, a new governor arrived from France, and Bienville moved west where, in 1716, he established Fort Rosalie on the present site of Natchez, Mississippi. The new governor, Antoine Laumet de La Mothe, sieur de Cadillac, did not last long due to mismanagement and a lack of growth in the colony. He was recalled to France in 1716, and Bienville again took the helm as governor, serving the office for less than a year until the new governor, Jean-Michel de Lepinay, arrived from France. Lepinay's tenure was short lived, however, as Crozat had relinquished control of the colony and its administration to John Law and his Company of the Indies. In 1718, Bienville found himself once again governor of Louisiana, and it was during this term that Bienville established the city of New Orleans, Louisiana.\n\nParagraph 6: The book was given a mildly positive review on the Pro Wrestling Torch podcast on May 3, 2011. Todd Martin ranked it as a solid read. Dante Spears of CultOfWhatever stated in his review that he felt that the book was more a biography of Harts entire family and a history of the family's territory Stampede more than a book about Hart himself, which he found enjoyable. He expresses that the stories told in the book about Hart's family, life and career were all very interesting. David Bixenspan of CageSide Seats criticized the book concerning Hart recollection of many events, especially ones about Bret, stating: \"The book is filled with statements that often come off as pretty out there, whether it's bad memory or an agenda or something else. A lot of these center around his brother Bret. The most outlandish-sounding claim is that when their mother Helen was on her deathbed and an hour away from dying, Bret entered her hospital room, saw his sister Diana (who had just written a controversial book about the family that was eventually recalled when Owen's widow Martha took legal action), and literally reached over his dying mother to grab his sister by the neck. Bruce then goes on to say that security guards had to pull Bret off and remove him from the room. When reached for comment, Bret's representatives told me that “Bret has no recollection of anything like that happening. In fact, when Helen died, he elected not to go to the hospital the night she died. In other words, what Bruce wrote is completely false.” (Also, in his book, Bret noted that Helen died at 3:30 AM local time while he was lying awake in bed.)

This relates to the fact that for nearly four hundred years Spanish dollars, known as pieces of eight were in widespread use on the world's trading routes, including the Caribbean Sea region. However, following the revolutionary wars in Latin America, the source of these silver trade coins dried up. The last Spanish dollar was minted at the Potosí mint in 1825. The United Kingdom had adopted a very successful gold standard in 1821, so 1825 was an opportune time to introduce the British sterling coinage into all the British colonies.\n\nParagraph 8: On April 8, 2008, an updated version was presented at the Beijing Motor Show and there was a change of name to C-Élysée and at the same time the car underwent another restyling to bring it into line with the range of cars produced by Citroën for the Chinese market. ; the \"C\" in the name was chosen to maintain consistency in the new names adopted by the manufacturer. The most evident aesthetic change was in the grille, now in line with the European Citroën, and in particular with the second generation of the Citroën C5, as it incorporated the emblem into the two large horizontal chromed bars that made up the grille itself. In total, 300 changes were made by Dongfeng technicians compared to the previous model. The new car was a step lower than the C-Triomphe based on the C4, and was equipped with the 109 HP 1.6 16v engine, as well as a decidedly more modern equipment than the previous Élysée, which included the latest generation ABS system. , updated suspension and an audio system with USB socket. As for the transmission, there were two gearbox variants available: 5-speed manual or 4-speed automatic. Inside, the dashboard maintained the same setting as the previous one, but new seats with better padding were introduced. The VIP variant was also restyled. Starting from 2009, the C-Élysée was also offered with a hatchback two-volume bodywork, replacing the old Fukang: in this case the rear lights, while recalling in form those of a normal ZX or a normal Fukang a two volumes, were more rounded in the corners and were more modern in the graphics of the plastics.\n\nParagraph 9: Before WRKS, many of the stations playing this music were on AM radio. Primary artists included The Isley Brothers, McFadden & Whitehead, Aretha Franklin, Marvin Gaye, and The Temptations. One of the first stations to try the format was WSID in Baltimore in the late 1950s/1960s/1970s. WDGS-AM in the Louisville market had a full-range urban AC format, with no rap music, as early as 1985. WDGS neatly substituted jazz, blues and urban/soul gold for the 35% of the playlists that were rap/hip-hop at the time, while playing 65% non-rap urban currents, to wide acclaim. WJMO in Cleveland and WVOL in Nashville were some of the early converts. KHYS in Houston switched to the format in 1999. KCJZ in San Antonio followed suit 7 months later. Early in 1994, M Street Journal reported 33 radio stations in the format, compared to 14 a year earlier. Many of these were affiliates of the Satellite Music Network format Urban Gold, which had 27 stations six months after starting October 1, 1993. Steve Harris, the SMN manager for urban radio, said no black radio stations had targeted adults over 35. Consultant Tony Gray said older adults did not like contemporary music, which had few tunes that had proved they could stand the test of time. And hip hop was becoming a bigger part of contemporary radio. Another factor was the availability of older records in remastered form. Hurricane Dave Smith of WJJJ in Pittsburgh, which had switched from smooth jazz, doubted the format would succeed on FM radio, but he believed listeners who enjoyed older songs were used to AM. Sean Ross of WGCI-AM in Chicago believed the format could work either place, but stations that selected it would be those desiring something different. The satellite format focused on the years 1967 to 1978, but also played songs from as far back as 1963 and as recent as the early 1980s. Included were both ballads and uptempo songs. WGCI even played songs from the 1950s, including Unforgettable by Nat King Cole, though Ross said even teenagers liked the station because they had learned about older songs from their parents, and because newer versions of old songs were being recorded. Other stations included WRBO 103.5 in Memphis, WNPL in Nashville, KMEZ in New Orleans and WPLZ in Richmond.\n\nParagraph 10: Before WRKS, many of the stations playing this music were on AM radio.

{"input": "", "context": "Paragraph 1: Reviewing the serial in 2009, Patrick Mulkern of Radio Times stated, \"The concept is fine, especially with the time-lapse cliffhanger to episode two ... Otherwise the plot is lacking in dramatic incident and there are often tracts of extreme tedium.\" He felt that the Guardians did not have enough time to develop and called the Monoids \"somewhat ludicrous\", though he did praise the direction, music, and effects. DVD Talk's John Sinnott gave the serial three and a half out of four stars, writing that the first half was \"slow\" but became interesting when the TARDIS crew returned. Arnold T. Blumberg of IGN rated the serial an eight out of ten, highlighting the \"snappy and exciting\" pace and the \"surprisingly top-notch\" production values, aside from the Monoids. SFX reviewer Ian Berriman rated it three out of five stars, describing it as \"quaint\" with the Monoids being \"laughable\" villains. However, he did note the ambition of the story, that it was faster-paced than others at the time, and the \"positively epic\" sets. Brian J. Robb of Dreamwatch praised the direction but wrote that the \"ambitious story that fails miserably thanks to the less-than-stellar Monoids\". Charlie Jane Anders of io9 listed the cliffhanger of \"The Plague\"—in which the TARDIS crew leave and return in the future—as one of the greatest Doctor Who cliffhangers in a 2010 article.\n\nParagraph 2: As soon as Romanian troops entered Bessarabia in 1941, they began a campaign to exterminate the local Jews, which amounted to 122,000 at the beginning of the Romanian administration. The order was given by the Conducător (\"Leader\") of Romania Ion Antonescu of his own accord and under no German pressure. Special teams instigated the locals to kill Jews on their own and, when this failed, special orders were delivered to local garrisons to have them executed. The Romanian Army's campaign of ethnic cleansing in Bessarabia was already in place by 6 July 1941, when 500 Jews were killed in the town of Edineț, reaching Chișinău by 17 July 1941, when several thousands were killed on a single day. The army was joined by the Romanian Gendarmerie, which received orders to \"exterminate on the spot all Jews in rural areas\" and \"imprison in ghettos all Jews in urban areas\". Jews turned over to the gendarmes by the army had no chance of survival and were shot immediately. On 11 July 1941, the Einsatzgruppen D started its own extermination campaign in Bălți, and by mid-August, the unit had murdered 4,425 Jews in the northern part of Bessarabia. As the Romanians left corpses unburied whenever they plundered, raped or fired shots in the streets and received bribes from Jews, the Nazis issued letters, protests and orders decrying the lack of organization and planning. Beginning with 24 July 1941, a parallel campaign of deporting the surviving Jews across the Dniester began. The convoys of deportees were not provided with food or water and had to sleep in improvised camps surrounded by barbed wire in the middle of a plowed field. Hundreds of Jews were pushed into the Dniester and whoever attempted to climb out was shot. As the Germans refused to allow the transit of Jews across the river, several ghettos were set up across Bessarabia, hosting about 80,000 Jews by late August 1941. 25,000 of them would die in these camps, characterized by forced labor, corruption, hunger, plunder, suffering, rapes, executions and epidemics; before death marches across the Dniester were resumed after an agreement with Nazi Germany on 30 August 1941. Consequently, 55,867 Jews from Bessarabia were deported into Transnistria. The killings, along deportations, continued until October 1941, when all Jews had been removed from Bessarabia. More than 45,000 Jews, likely 60,000, were killed in Bessarabia and Bukovina. Furthermore, until 15 November 1943, between 104,522 and 120,810 Romanian citizens of Jewish ethnicity or descent originating in Bessarabia, Bukovina and the Old Kingdom died in Transnistria as a result of typhus, hunger, cold or straightforward murder.\n\nParagraph 3: Thevet and his colleagues land on the Brazilian mainland on November 10, and are welcomed and fed by a delegation of native people immediately upon their arrival. At the welcoming feast, they are served an alcoholic beverage brewed from a combination of different roots. Initially hoping to venture inland or elsewhere along the coast, the expeditionary team members are informed that there is little freshwater for a significant distance away from the indigenous settlement but that they would be welcome to remain near their landing site for the time being. Venturing to a nearby inlet, Thevet and company are impressed by an array of colorful birdsㅡtheir feathers making an attractive decoration for the sparse garments of native peopleㅡand a generous bounty of fish, upon which local residents may subsist. Finally Thevet describes some of the local flora, including beautiful trees unseen in Europe and small vines utilized by the natives as accessories and for medicinal purposes. Thevet describes a fruit which the  Tupinambá call the Hoyriri, now identified as the pineapple:,another fruit that commeth vp in the fieldes, which they name Hoyriri, the which to loke on, would be iudged to grow on some trée. Notwithstāding it groweth in a cer∣taine herbe that beareth leafe like to a Palme, as wel in the length as in largenesse, it groweth in the midst of the leaues very round, & within it be litle Nuts, of the which the kernell is white & good to eate, sauing that ouermuch therof, as wel as of other things, hurteth the braine. ... if... dressed & trimmed, it wold take away this vice. Notwith¦standing the Americanes eat therof, chiefly ye litle childrē. The fields ar very ful within two leagues of Cap de Fria.The Catholic author acknowledges and laments the absence of organized religion in the lives of indigenous people. Although they do believe in \"Toupan\"ㅡsome sort of higher being reigning above them and governing the climateㅡthey make no clear effort to worship or honor it as a collective. Moreover, rather than believe in a great prophet similar to those venerated in Abrahamic faiths, the natives passively celebrate \"Hetich,\" the figure allegedly responsible for teaching them to cultivate the roots that became an essential staple of their diet. Thevet then digresses from this point, describing some alternative properties of the roots that emerge once separate varieties are subjected to certain external forces. Following this, the author momentarily touches upon how Christopher Columbus and his team were initially worshiped by local Amerindians, before losing this divine status once it was gradually discovered that they behaved and functioned as ordinary men. Cannibalism is addressed at the end of this chapter, being attributed to certain indigenous groups who allegedly consume human flesh as one in European society might consume any other meat.\n\nParagraph 4: As soon as Romanian troops entered Bessarabia in 1941, they began a campaign to exterminate the local Jews, which amounted to 122,000 at the beginning of the Romanian administration.

Otherwise, they may be seen on cloudy days or during periods of rain. Most are terrestrial, though all are capable of climbing. One species, B. insularis, which is endemic to Ilha da Queimada Grande, is considered to be semi arboreal. This species, unlike most Bothrops, preys primarily on birds, due to the absence of native mammal species on Queimada Grande. This feeding habit probably accounts for their more arboreal lifestyle compared with their mainland cousins. Many species of Bothrops exhibit tail vibration behavior when disturbed.\n\nParagraph 6: Clement of Alexandria says: \"Because of the angels\". By the angels he means righteous and virtuous men. Let her be veiled then, that she may not lead them to stumble into fornication. For the real angels in heaven see her though veiled. Clement of Alexandria explicated this: \"It has also been commanded that the head should be veiled and the face covered, for it is a wicked thing for beauty to be a snare to men. Nor is it appropriate for a woman to desire to make herself conspicuous by using a purple veil.\" Tertullian explains that in his days, the women of the Corinthian church from the age of puberty onwards (unmarried and married) were practicing Christian headcovering despite the fact that non-Christians in the region did not observe this ordinance; as such, the practice of Christians was countercultural. In his deliberative treatise De virginibus velandis (\"On the Veiling of Virgins\") Tertullian argumented from scripture, natural law and Christian disclipline that from puberty virgins ought to be veiled when in public. The custom of some Carthaginian consecrated virgins not being veiled when the church gathered was sharply criticised as being contrary to the truth. This is only 150 years after the Apostle Paul wrote 1 Corinthians. He said, \"So, too, did the Corinthians themselves understand [Paul]. In fact, at this day the Corinthians do veil their virgins [and married women]. What the apostles taught, their disciples approve.\" \"Early church history bears witness that in Rome, Antioch, and Africa the custom [of wearing the head covering] became the norm [for the Church].\" The historian Cory Anderson stated that the reason for this is because the early Church understood Saint Paul's instruction to apply to the whole church. Origen of Alexandria () wrote, \"There are angels in the midst of our assembly… we have here a twofold Church, one of men, the other of angels… And since there are angels present… women, when they pray, are ordered to have a covering upon their heads because of those angels. They assist the saints and rejoice in the Church.\" In the second half of the third century, women praying with their heads covered is mentioned as church practice by St. Victorinus in his commentary of the Apocalypse of John. The early Christian Acts of Thomas, written in Syriac Aramaic, assigns Hell as the fate of women who did not wear a headcovering, stating:\n\nParagraph 7: As soon as Romanian troops entered Bessarabia in 1941, they began a campaign to exterminate the local Jews, which amounted to 122,000 at the beginning of the Romanian administration. The order was given by the Conducător (\"Leader\") of Romania Ion Antonescu of his own accord and under no German pressure. Special teams instigated the locals to kill Jews on their own and, when this failed, special orders were delivered to local garrisons to have them executed. The Romanian Army's campaign of ethnic cleansing in Bessarabia was already in place by 6 July 1941, when 500 Jews were killed in the town of Edineț, reaching Chișinău by 17 July 1941, when several thousands were killed on a single day. The army was joined by the Romanian Gendarmerie, which received orders to \"exterminate on the spot all Jews in rural areas\" and \"imprison in ghettos all Jews in urban areas\". Jews turned over to the gendarmes by the army had no chance of survival and were shot immediately. On 11 July 1941, the Einsatzgruppen D started its own extermination campaign in Bălți, and by mid-August, the unit had murdered 4,425 Jews in the northern part of Bessarabia. As the Romanians left corpses unburied whenever they plundered, raped or fired shots in the streets and received bribes from Jews, the Nazis issued letters, protests and orders decrying the lack of organization and planning. Beginning with 24 July 1941, a parallel campaign of deporting the surviving Jews across the Dniester began. The convoys of deportees were not provided with food or water and had to sleep in improvised camps surrounded by barbed wire in the middle of a plowed field. Hundreds of Jews were pushed into the Dniester and whoever attempted to climb out was shot. As the Germans refused to allow the transit of Jews across the river, several ghettos were set up across Bessarabia, hosting about 80,000 Jews by late August 1941. 25,000 of them would die in these camps, characterized by forced labor, corruption, hunger, plunder, suffering, rapes, executions and epidemics; before death marches across the Dniester were resumed after an agreement with Nazi Germany on 30 August 1941. Consequently, 55,867 Jews from Bessarabia were deported into Transnistria. The killings, along deportations, continued until October 1941, when all Jews had been removed from Bessarabia. More than 45,000 Jews, likely 60,000, were killed in Bessarabia and Bukovina. Furthermore, until 15 November 1943, between 104,522 and 120,810 Romanian citizens of Jewish ethnicity or descent originating in Bessarabia, Bukovina and the Old Kingdom died in Transnistria as a result of typhus, hunger, cold or straightforward murder.\n\nParagraph 8: During the late 1700s, there were a number of proposals for canals on the south bank of the River Thames, and several of the prominent canal engineers of the time were involved. John Smeaton looked at two possible routes for a canal between Kingston upon Thames and Ewell in 1778. Ralph Dodd, who was also involved with promoting the Thames and Medway Canal, proposed a canal with a number of branches linking Deptford, Clapham, Kingston, Ewell, Epsom, Mitcham and Croydon. A plan for a canal from Croydon to Wandsworth was thought to be impractical by William Jessop and John Rennie, because the main source of water in the area through which it would run was the River Wandle, and this supplied a number of mills which would be affected if the river was used to supply the canal. Jessop also advised on a canal from Vauxhall to Rotherhithe in 1796, while in 1799, a railway from London through Croydon to Portsmouth, using horses to pull the wagons, was suggested. Eventually, three projects were submitted to parliament for approval. These were the Grand Surrey Canal, at the time called the Kent and Surrey Canal, the Croydon Canal linking Croydon and Rotherhithe, and the Surrey Iron Railway, a horse-drawn linking Croydon to Wandsworth, and all three were authorised in 1801.\n\nParagraph 9: In 1986 and 2002, Pan was invited to take part in Basking – Nanjing Art Activity twice.

Otherwise the plot is lacking in dramatic incident and there are often tracts of extreme tedium.\" He felt that the Guardians did not have enough time to develop and called the Monoids \"somewhat ludicrous\", though he did praise the direction, music, and effects. DVD Talk's John Sinnott gave the serial three and a half out of four stars, writing that the first half was \"slow\" but became interesting when the TARDIS crew returned. Arnold T. Blumberg of IGN rated the serial an eight out of ten, highlighting the \"snappy and exciting\" pace and the \"surprisingly top-notch\" production values, aside from the Monoids. SFX reviewer Ian Berriman rated it three out of five stars, describing it as \"quaint\" with the Monoids being \"laughable\" villains. However, he did note the ambition of the story, that it was faster-paced than others at the time, and the \"positively epic\" sets. Brian J. Robb of Dreamwatch praised the direction but wrote that the \"ambitious story that fails miserably thanks to the less-than-stellar Monoids\". Charlie Jane Anders of io9 listed the cliffhanger of \"The Plague\"—in which the TARDIS crew leave and return in the future—as one of the greatest Doctor Who cliffhangers in a 2010 article.\n\nParagraph 11: Dane was born Rasmus Karl Therkelsen Gottlieb (not Karl Daen as sometimes reported) in Turesensgade 23 in central Copenhagen, Denmark, to Rasmus Carl Marius Gottlieb and Anne Cathrine (née Simonsen) Gottlieb. He had two brothers: Reinald Marius and Viggo Eiler. His parents' marriage was apparently stormy, with his father having trouble with alcohol and money management. In 1903, Dane's parents divorced, leaving him in the custody of his mother. His father was a glove maker by trade but enjoyed the theatre. Around the start of the 20th century, he built a toy theatre which people began to pay to see; during this time, Dane and his brother Reinald would perform for the crowds. His father worked as a curtain puller at the local theatre, to which his two sons accompanied him. Dane later said this would inspire him to act. In 1900, Dane and his brother apprenticed as machinists, a job he would perform on and off throughout his life. In 1907, he began compulsory military service in the First Artillery Battalion. He was promoted to
